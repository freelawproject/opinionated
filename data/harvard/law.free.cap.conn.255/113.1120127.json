On appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>53 Conn. App. 747, 768, 731 A.2d 768 (1999). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">\u201c1. Whether the Appellate Court correctly determined that the admission of the medical examiner\u2019s testimony regarding possible causes of death that leave markings only on the skin was harmless error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201c2. Whether the Appellate Court correctly determined that the hearsay testimony of three witnesses regarding statements made to them by the defendant\u2019s children was properly admitted under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201c3. Whether the Appellate Court correctly determined that witness testimony regarding the [victim\u2019s] fearful state of mind regarding the defendant was relevant to prove his motive to murder her and was more probative of his motive than it was prejudicial to the defendant?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>250 Conn. 922, 922-23, 738 A.2d 662 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">As to the first certified issue, we conclude that, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to elicit testimony from the medical examiner regarding possible causes of death that commonly leave markings only on the skin. With respect to that issue, therefore, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim, though not because the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was harmless error, as the Appellate Court held, but, rather, because the trial court\u2019s ruling simply was not erroneous. As to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>second and third certified issues, we answer both in the affirmative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cOn November 19, 1994, at approximately 3:19 a.m., Ronald McClain and Sheila McClain, neighbors who lived across the street from the defendant [on Hillside Avenue in Plymouth], awoke to screams from the defendant\u2019s children. Ronald McClain observed an orange glow coming from the left side of the [defendant\u2019s] house. He also observed the defendant\u2019s two children on the roof of the front porch, a ladder against the front porch and the defendant standing at the bottom of the ladder. [Ronald] McClain called 911 and went downstairs to let the [defendant and his children] into [McClain\u2019s] home. The children were screaming that their house was on fire and that they could not find their mother [Wendy Wargo].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant stated that his wife was in the house, that he could not get her out and that he did not know if she had come home. The children remained at the McClain home while the defendant and Ronald McClain returned to the burning house. The defendant again stated that he did not know if his wife had come home that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u201cThe firefighters arrived a few minutes later and found the defendant outside the house, confused and attempting to put water on the fire with a garden hose. The defendant told the firefighters that he did not know his wife\u2019s whereabouts. Later, the defendant, while he pointed to the den, told fireman Frederick Telke, \u2018Yes, she\u2019s in here, she\u2019s in here.\u2019 When asked if he was sure, the defendant walked to the driveway and pointed to his wife\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cFirefighters entered the home and approached the den, where the fire was concentrated, but were unable to remain due to the high temperatures, heavy smoke and unstable floor. The body of the victim . . . was later found in this area. Firefighters also entered the second floor of the house and found only smoke damage. They did not hear any smoke detector alarms.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cSeveral hours later, Officer Gerald Allain of the Plymouth police department questioned the defendant. The defendant stated that the victim smoked cigarettes and that he recalled the smoke alarms going off. He stated that the thick smoke forced him to his knees [and that] he took the children to the porch roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cOn November 19,1994, the defendant gave a signed, written statement to the police. He indicated that the victim slept on the couch because their marriage was \u2018on the rocks.\u2019 That same day, the defendant told the victim\u2019s uncle, James Castiola, that he knew what had happened. He stated that the victim had come home, and had lain down on the couch, [near] approximately fifty videotapes. While on the couch, the victim had lit a cigarette and had fallen asleep. The defendant told Castiola that the fire had been accelerated by the videotapes, which cannot be put out when they catch fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u201cState Trooper Kevin McGurk was assigned to determine the cause and origin of the fire. He examined the Wargo home the following morning and determined that the fire originated in the den. McGurk discovered a pour pattern leading up to the area of origin, which indicated that an accelerant had been used. On the basis of his observations, McGurk concluded that the fire had been intentionally set. Other officers executed a search warrant on the Wargo home and retrieved an empty bottle of bleach from the basement and a can of acetone from the storage shed. Joseph Cristino, a forensic analysis engineer, examined the two smoke detectors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>retrieved from the Wargo home. [Cristino found that it was \u2018highly improbable\u2019 that the first floor smoke detector was working at the time of the fire and that, had the battery been connected to the second floor detector, there was a high probability that it would have worked at the time of the fire.]</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u201cA notebook also was seized from the defendant\u2019s bedroom dresser. The parties stipulated that the notes contained therein were written in the defendant\u2019s handwriting. The defendant was a member of the fire brigade at work and had received training in chemical fires and hazardous materials. The defendant was familiar with spontaneous combustion caused by the combination of alkalies and acids. The defendant admitted writing various phrases in the notebook, such as \u2018lock box in shed,\u2019 \u2018tool box,\u2019 \u2018acetone,\u2019 \u2018alcohol clorox,\u2019 \u2018aim foil,\u2019 \u2018dry run,\u2019 \u2018rope kds drs,\u2019 \u2018straps,\u2019 \u2018pillow,\u2019 \u2018oil in can,\u2019 \u2018rid of stuff,\u2019 \u2018glvs,\u2019 \u2018hat,\u2019 \u2018shirt,\u2019 \u2018cigs,\u2019 and \u2018ldr.\u2019 The defendant stated that these abbreviations could have been a camping list, but that he did not know why he wrote these abbreviations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 750-52. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state to question Malka Shah, the state\u2019s associate medical examiner, about causes of death that often result in injuries only to the skin. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On direct examination, Shah testified about the results of the autopsy that she had performed on the victim. Shah explained that the victim\u2019s body had been burned beyond recognition, and that the victim could be identified only by reference to her dental records. Shah further stated that the victim\u2019s body was so badly charred that she was unable to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>duct an examination of the victim\u2019s skin. Shah, however, indicated that she was able to examine the victim\u2019s internal organs, including her lungs. Shah stated that, on the basis of her examination of those organs, the victim \u201cdefinitely\u201d had died prior to the fire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, although Shah testified that she could not determine either the cause of the victim\u2019s death or the manner in which she had died, Shah\u2019s examination of the victim\u2019s internal organs revealed that the victim had not died of natural causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Thereafter, the state queried Shah about whether there are any traumatic causes of death that commonly manifest injuries only on the skin. Shah responded in the affirmative, and the state then asked Shah to enumerate those causes of death. The defendant objected to the question, and the trial court excused the jury. On voir dire examination outside the presence of the jury, Shah testified that \u201cmany . . . asphyxial deaths . . . drug overdose deaths . . . [and deaths by] electrocution\u201d manifest injuries \u201conly on the skin.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the conclusion of Shah\u2019s voir dire testimony, the defendant sought to have the state barred from presenting such testimony to the jury. Specifically, the defendant argued that, because Shah could not determine the victim\u2019s cause of death, her testimony regarding these potential causes of death was irrelevant, speculative and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, concluding that the testimony was relevant to explain Shah\u2019s inability to pinpoint the victim\u2019s cause of death. The trial court also concluded that any possible prejudice to the defendant stemming from Shah\u2019s testimony could be mitigated on cross-examination, especially in view of Shah\u2019s testimony that she could not determine the cause of the victim\u2019s death. Finally, the court expressly found that any prejudicial effect of the testimony was outweighed by its probative value. The jury then was recalled and Shah testified in a manner consistent with her voir dire testimony. In addition, Shah noted in her testimony that toxicological tests indicated that the victim had not died from a drug overdose and also indicated that the victim\u2019s injuries were not consistent with death by electrocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant renewed the claim that he had made in the trial court regarding Shah\u2019s testimony identifying certain possible causes of death. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant, concluding that, because Shah was unable to determine the victim\u2019s cause of death to a reasonable medical probability, her testimony regarding death by asphyxiation, drug overdose or electrocution was irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 759.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Appellate Court further concluded, however, that Shah\u2019s objectionable testimony was harmless because, notwithstanding its lack of relevance, its admission likely did not affect the verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Id. In so concluding, the Appellate Court noted Shah\u2019s own testimony that she could not determine the victim\u2019s cause of death and the fact that the trial court had underscored that testimony in its instructions to the jury. Id. Judge Foti concurred in the result reached by the majority but disagreed with its determination that the trial court improperly had allowed the state to elicit testimony from Shah about traumatic asphyxiation, drug overdose and electrocution. Id., 768-69 <em>(Foti, J., </em>concurring). In Judge Foti\u2019s view, that testimony was relevant in explaining Shah\u2019s \u201cseemingly contradictory position\u201d that, although she was unable to determine the specific cause of the victim\u2019s death, she was able to determine that the victim had not died of natural causes. Id., 769 <em>(Foti, J., </em>concurring). Inasmuch as Judge Foti also determined that Shah\u2019s testimony was not unduly prejudicial; id., 771 <em>(Foti, J., </em>concurring); he concluded that the trial court properly had overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of Shah\u2019s testimony. See id. <em>(Foti, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">On appeal to this court upon our grant of certification, the defendant maintains that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Shah to testify regarding possible causes of death. The defendant further claims, however, that, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, Shah\u2019s testimony was harmful because it is more likely than not that the jury relied on that evidence in finding that he had murdered the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The state contends, as Judge Foti stated in his concurring opinion, that the trial court properly determined that Shah\u2019s testimony was admissible to assist the jury in understanding why Shah was unable to ascertain the cause of the victim\u2019s death notwithstanding her opinion that the victim had not died of natural causes. Alternatively, the state asserts that, even if the trial court improperly had overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that portion of Shah\u2019s testimony, the admission of that evidence was harmless error for the reasons articulated by the Appellate Court. We agree with Judge Foti and the state that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the trial court was within its discretion in allowing Shah to testify about the three possible causes of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard by which we review the trial court\u2019s determinations concerning the [admissibility] of evidence. The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u201cConcerning expert testimony specifically, we note that the trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. . . . Expert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or juiy in considering the issues. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u201c[Of course, a predicate to the admissibility of such testimony is its relevance to some issue in the case.] Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>250 Conn. 172, 180-81, 738 A.2d 586 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated on the principle that \u201c[e]xpert opinions must be based upon reasonable probabilities rather than mere speculation or conjecture if they are to be admissible in establishing causation.\u201d <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 554-55, 534 A.2d 888 (1987); accord <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 338, 593 A.2d 478 (1991). Specifically, the defendant maintains that Shah\u2019s testimony regarding death by traumatic asphyxiation, drug overdose and electrocution was inadmissible because that testimony was cast in terms of possibilities rather than probabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is true, of course, that \u201c[t]o be reasonably probable, a conclusion must be more likely than not.\u201d <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 555. In this case, however, the state did not seek to elicit an opinion from Shah as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death; indeed, Shah expressly acknowledged that she was unable to render such an opinion. Rather, Shah\u2019s testimony about causes of death that commonly leave marks or injuries only on the skin was admitted solely for the purpose of assisting the jury in understanding why, although Shah was able to determine that the victim had died prior to the fire and that her death was not attributable to natural causes, she <em>could not </em>ascertain how the victim had died. Thus, Shah\u2019s testimony was relevant to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>strate that, because the victim\u2019s skin had been destroyed by the fire, there were several possible causes of death that she could not rule out <em>which would have been consistent with an intentional killing. </em>In the absence of such testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that no such possible cause of death existed, an inference that, if Shah\u2019s testimony were credited, would have been both unwarranted and highly prejudicial to the state, which bore the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally killed the victim. We, therefore, disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s determination that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Shah\u2019s testimony concerning possible causes of death was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We emphasize that our conclusion is not inconsistent with the well established rule that expert opinions regarding causation must be based upon reasonable probabilities and not mere possibilities. See, e.g., <em>Kilduff v. Adams, Inc., </em>supra, 219 Conn. 338; <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 554-55. In the present case, the state sought to elicit Shah\u2019s testimony regarding causes of death that commonly result in injuries only to the skin, not to establish the victim\u2019s cause of death, but, rather, to explain why Shah\u2019s inability to ascertain the cause of death was not fatal to the state\u2019s contention that the victim had been killed intentionally. Indeed, Shah\u2019s testimony about death by traumatic asphyxiation, drug overdose and electrocution, cast as it was in terms of possibilities, was not admissible to prove the cause of the victim\u2019s death, but, rather, as the trial court determined, to demonstrate the existence of other causes of death that may be consistent with homicide, but which Shah could not adequately determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>because of the condition of the victim\u2019s body. The defendant\u2019s claim therefore must fail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The defendant next claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court properly had determined that certain statements made by the defendant\u2019s children were admissible under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cSheila McClain and Kimberly Fredericks, a friend of the McClains\u2019 son, watched the Wargo children [Brent, age six, and Rachael, age four] from approximately 3:30 a.m. until 7:30 a.m. on the morning of the fire. A neighbor of the Wargos, Lynn Monahan, brought her children to the McClains\u2019 house to keep the Wargo children company. [During this period, the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>were very upset and frightened, and frequently ran to the door to view the fire, repeatedly asking when they would see their mother.] At approximately 5 a.m., while the house was still burning, Monahan\u2019s son, James . . . heard [Brent] say that his mother was in the house and [Rachael] say [\u2018that daddy had stepped on mommy while he was getting us out of the house.\u2019 Sheila] McClain testified that approximately fifteen minutes after [Brent] arrived at her house, he said that his parents had been fighting. Fredericks testified that [she overheard Brent tell Sheila McClain] that his parents had been fighting that night. [Fredericks further testified that she heard Brent say that \u2018daddy stepped on mommy while he was getting us out of the house.\u2019]</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u2018'[The defendant] objected to these statements as inadmissible hearsay. The trial court admitted these statements under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Wargo, supra, 53 Conn. App. 755-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s claim of evidentiary impropriety, we set forth the applicable legal principles. \u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 803, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). Among the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule is the spontaneous utterance exception, which applies to an utterance or declaration that: (1) follows some startling occurrence; (2) refers to the occurrence; (3) is made by one having the opportunity to observe the occurrence; and (4) is made in such close connection to the occurrence and under such circumstances as to negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Stange, </em>212 Conn. 612, 616-17, 563 A.2d 681 (1989); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Haritos, </em>100 Conn. 476, 484, 124 A. 44 (1924). \u201cThe basis for the [spontaneous] utterance exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>... is that such statements are given under circumstances that eliminate the possibility of fabrication, coaching, or confabulation, and that therefore the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provide sufficient assurance that the statement is trustworthy and that cross-examination would be superfluous.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, 497 </em>U.S. 805, 820, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990); see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11.11.1, p. 373 (\u201c[t]he [spontaneous utterance] exception rests on the view that such assertions, made in reaction to a startling event, are trustworthy and void of self-interest\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]he ultimate question is whether the utterance was spontaneous and unreflective and made under such circumstances as to indicate absence of opportunity for <em>contrivance and </em>misrepresentation. . . . Whether an utterance is spontaneous and made under circumstances that would preclude contrivance and misrepresentation is a preliminary question of fact to be decided by the trial judge. . . . The trial judge exercises broad discretion in deciding this preliminary question, and that decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an unreasonable exercise of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Stange, </em>supra, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Finally, although \u201ccircumstantial evidence of the declarant\u2019s personal perception must not be so scanty as to forfeit the guarantees of trustworthiness which form the hallmark of all exceptions to the hearsay rule\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>145 F.3d 572, 576 (3d Cir. 1998); the state is not required to establish such personal observation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the declarant beyond any possible doubt. Rather, the question for the trial court is whether a reasonable inference may be drawn that the declarant had personal knowledge of the facts that are the subject of his or her statement. Cf., e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>192 F.3d 761, 767 (7th Cir. 1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tocco, </em>135 F.3d 116, 128 (2d Cir. 1998).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201c[djirect proof of observation is not necessary; if the circumstances appear consistent with opportunity [to observe] by the declarant, the requirement is met.\u201d 2 C. McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed. 1999) \u00a7 272, p. 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court properly had determined that the statements attributed to Brent and Rachael satisfy the requirements of the hearsay exception for spontaneous utterances. Specifically, the defendant asserts that: (1) the state failed to establish that the children personally observed the events that they recounted in their statements; (2) there is a likelihood that the children\u2019s statements were unduly influenced by conversations that they had overheard between the defendant and Sheila McClain about the fire, thereby seriously undermining the reliability of the children\u2019s statements; and (3) Brent\u2019s statement regarding his parents\u2019 fighting was a narration of a past event, not a spontaneous utterance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s first assertion, the trial court reasonably determined that the state adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the declarations attributed to the children were a product of their own observations. With respect to the children\u2019s statements that the defendant had stepped on the victim \u201cwhile he was getting [them] out of the house,\u201d it is clear that the children were relating what they personally had observed as they were being taken from the burning home by the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> With respect to Brent\u2019s comments that the defendant and the victim had been fighting, the trial court properly determined that the jury reasonably could have inferred that Brent, who was present in the house that evening, had the opportunity personally to observe his parents engaged in some kind of altercation or argument prior to the fire. This determination is buttressed by the evidence indicating that Brent had specified that the altercation occurred on the night of the fire.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>We also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the statements were inadmissible because the two children necessarily were influenced by certain conversations that they had overheard shortly after they were removed from the burning house. Specifically, the defendant points to several comments by the defendant and Sheila McClain indicating that the victim was still in the burning home. Although there is a reasonable likelihood that the children heard those statements, there is nothing in the record to substantiate the defendant\u2019s claim that the statements undermined the reliability of the children\u2019s assertions. Indeed, there was no reference by the defendant, Sheila McClain or anyone else to a fight or altercation between the defendant and the victim, nor was there any such reference to the defendant stepping on the victim as he took the children out of the house.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In such circumstances, we can discern no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>for the defendant\u2019s claim that the children\u2019s statements were influenced by anything that they may have overheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The defendant also claims that Brent\u2019s statement regarding a fight between the defendant and the victim was a narration of a past event rather than a spontaneous utterance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this issue. On direct examination, Freder-icks testified that she had overheard Brent say to Sheila McClain that \u201cmommy and daddy were fighting <em>tonight.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) On cross-examination, however, Fredericks indicated that, although she believed that Brent had stated that the fight had occurred <em>that night, </em>she was not positive that Brent had indicated when the fight took place. On the basis of Fredericks\u2019 cross-examination testimony, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Brent\u2019s statement related to an altercation that had occurred on the night of the fire and not to some prior altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim lacks merit because the state was not required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a temporal link between Brent\u2019s statement and the fight. Rather, Fredericks\u2019 testimony about Brent\u2019s statement was admissible as long as a reasonable inference may be drawn that an altercation between the defendant and the victim had occurred on the night of the fire. Fredericks testified that, based on her recollection, Brent had indicated that the altercation occurred on the night of the fire. The fact that she was not certain that Brent\u2019s statement included a reference to the time of the altercation goes to the weight of the evidence and not to its admissibility. Therefore, the trial court properly determined that Fredericks\u2019 testimony provided a sufficient temporal nexus between Brent\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ment and the altercation between the defendant and the victim on the night of the fire.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Lastly, the defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court improperly permitted a friend of the victim, Irene Ellis, to testily about a conversation that she had had with the victim on November 16, 1994, three days before the fatal fire. In that conversation, the victim iterated her decision to seek a divorce and, in addition, expressed her belief that the defendant would have killed her during a domestic argument approximately two weeks earlier if their daughter had not been awakened by the altercation. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. On November 1,1994, the victim had the defendant served with divorce papers. Soon thereafter, the defendant placed a telephone call to Christina Fuggetta, a close friend of the victim and the defendant. Fuggetta testified that the defendant had told her that the victim, who already was receiving counseling, had rejected the defendant\u2019s request that she allow him to join her in those counseling sessions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>After Fuggetta advised the defendant \u201cto move on with his life and . . . seek counseling [himself],\u201d the defendant became angry and stated that he did not intend to become a \u201cweekend father\u201d and have someone else raise his children. The defendant then asserted that he would \u201crather see [his wife and children] dead than have her raise the kids and corrupt them.\u201d Fuggetta told the defendant not to \u201cbe stupid,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f [he] did anything to [the victim, he would] end up in jail.\u201d The defendant, however, responded that \u201che\u2019d rather see [the children] with no parents at all [than] have her corrupt them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Ellis, who had been friendly with the victim since grammar school, testified that she had received a telephone call from the defendant on November 7, 1994. Ellis, who was residing in New Mexico at the time,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> stated that the defendant had asked her to return to Connecticut to try to convince the victim not to obtain a divorce and to seek marriage counseling. After explaining that she could not come to Connecticut, Ellis told the defendant that the victim did not love him any more and that there was no chance of a reconciliation. Ellis testified that the defendant then told her that he and the victim \u201cjust had a big blow out\u201d that had \u201cgot[ten] a little out of hand.\u201d The defendant further explained to Ellis that he and the victim were home together, that he had consumed a few drinks, and that he had thrown ice cubes at the victim, called her names and yelled at her. The defendant told Ellis that when the victim finally got up to leave the room, the defendant followed her to the top of the stairway and slammed her against the wall,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> repeatedly \u201ctelling her ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>get her fn ass downstairs to the basement so [that] he could beat the shit out of her and kill her.\u201d The altercation ended when the couple\u2019s daughter awoke and called out to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Ellis further testified that, according to the defendant, the victim \u201cwas taking him for everything he had. She was taking the house [and] the kids. He wasn\u2019t going to be a weekend father or a Sunday father . . . and that he worked too damn hard for his money, his house, his family [and] for [the victim] to fuck it up for him.\u201d Finally, in response to Ellis\u2019 query as to why the defendant would \u201cwant to stay with somebody that doesn\u2019t love [him],\u201d the defendant stated to her that \u201che would rather see [the victim] in hell, if it came to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Theresa Luther, the victim\u2019s mother, also testified for the state. Luther stated that the defendant had stopped by her house one evening prior to the fire and told her that the victim wanted a divorce. The defendant asked Luther if she would agree to speak to the victim to try to talk her out of proceeding with the divorce, and Luther agreed to raise the subject with the victim. Approximately one week later, Luther informed the defendant that she had spoken to the victim and that the victim \u201chad made the decision that she could not reconcile with [the defendant] and [that] she was going ahead with the divorce.\u201d Luther further testified that the defendant responded that he would make the victim\u2019s life a \u201cliving hell\u201d if she did not reconcile with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The state then recalled Ellis to testify about a second telephone conversation that she had had with the victim on November 16, 1994, three days before the fire. The defendant objected to Ellis\u2019 testimony, and the parties conducted a voir dire examination of Ellis outside the presence of the jury. Ellis testified that, in her telephone conversation with the victim on November 16, 1994, the victim stated that she had no desire to reconcile with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the defendant and that she had made a final decision to obtain a divorce. Ellis further testified that the victim also referred to the encounter that she had had with the defendant in which the defendant slammed her against the wall and threatened to kill her. With respect to that altercation, Ellis testified that the victim told her that she feared that the defendant would have killed her if their daughter had not been awakened by the disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The defendant objected to Ellis\u2019 testimony about the November 16 telephone conversation on the ground that it was not relevant to any issue in the case. The state maintained that Ellis\u2019 testimony was admissible to establish circumstantially the victim\u2019s state of mind which, the state further claimed, was relevant to what the state asserted was the defendant\u2019s motive to kill the victim, namely, the deteriorating state of their marriage as reflected in her decision to seek a divorce. After thoughtful consideration of the applicable precedent, the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s relevancy objection to Ellis\u2019 testimony and, in addition, concluded that the probative value of the proffered testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. The jury then was recalled and, in accordance with the trial court\u2019s ruling, Ellis testified in a manner consistent with her voir dire testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Immediately thereafter, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>instructed the jury that Ellis\u2019 testimony was admissible only for the limited purpose of \u201cdemonstrating the victim\u2019s . . . state of mind as [it] relates to the relationship that existed between [the victim] and the defendant and as that relates to [the] question or issue of . . . reconciliation [by the victim and the defendant].\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On appeal, the defendant renews the claims that he raised in the trial court. We agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the admission of Ellis\u2019 testimony regarding her telephone conversation with the victim three days before the fire.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As we previously have stated; see part II of this opinion; an out-of-court statement that is offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is inadmissible hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>unless the statement falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 803. \u201cAn out-of-court statement is not hearsay, however, if it is offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then present state of mind, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 237-38, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 632, 626 A.2d 273 (1993). Of course, for any such out-of-court statement to be admissible, it must be relevant to an issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Inasmuch as the victim\u2019s statements to Ellis on November 16 were admitted for the limited purpose of establishing the victim\u2019s state of mind, the defendant does not dispute the fact that those statements are not hearsay. The defendant claims, rather, that the statements were inadmissible because the victim\u2019s state of mind was irrelevant to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cWhether the victim\u2019s state of mind is relevant depends ... on the nature of the issues at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 253, 627 A.2d 877 (1993). We previously have held that evidence of a victim\u2019s mental state may be relevant to establish the defendant\u2019s motive to kill the victim. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 501-502, 556 A.2d 154 (1989) (\u201c[t]he victim\u2019s mental state was relevant both to show the victim\u2019s fear of the defendant . . . and to establish the defendant\u2019s motive for committing the crime\u201d [citations omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 285, 533 A.2d 553 (1987) (\u201cThe trial court correctly determined that [the victim\u2019s expression of fear of the defendant] was rehable circumstantial evidence of a deteriorated relationship. As such, it was relevant and probative because it tended to support the state\u2019s claim that the relationship [between the victim and the defendant] had broken down, and from that circumstance the jury could infer motive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In the present case, the state adduced ample evidence tending to show that the defendant had decided to kill the victim because he was extremely angry and upset that she had intended to divorce him and that, consequently, his contact with his children would be limited.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the testimony evidencing the victim\u2019s state of mind was relevant to establish, circumstantially, the extent to which the defendant\u2019s marriage had broken down, a state of affairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that the jury reasonably could have determined provided the defendant with a motive to kill the victim.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 233, 613 A.2d 224 (1992), to support his claim that the trial court improperly permitted the state to elicit Ellis\u2019 testimony regarding her telephone conversation with the victim. In particular, the defendant claims that <em>Duntz </em>stands for the broad proposition that evidence of a victim\u2019s state of mind is not relevant to the state\u2019s asserted theory of motive. The defendant, however, misconstrues our holding in <em>Duntz. </em>In that case, the defendant, Richard Duntz, was charged with murder. See id., 209. The victim had told several people that he was frightened of Duntz, and the trial court permitted the state to call those individuals to testify about the victim\u2019s statements to show that Duntz and the victim \u201chad an antagonistic relationship and, therefore, that [Duntz] had a motive ... to kill the victim.\u201d Id., 233. The state adduced no other evidence to indicate that an antagonistic relationship existed between the two men. See generally id., 231-33. We concluded that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling constituted an abuse of discretion because \u201cthe jury could not have drawn such an inference solely from the statements of the victim without resorting to impermissible speculation [due to the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>that] the victim\u2019s expressed fear may have been subjective and unfounded.\u201d Id., 233. We also emphasized the \u201ctremendous potential for this evidence of subjective fear to prejudice [Duntz] unfairly . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In the present case, by contrast, the state, through the testimony of Fuggetta, Ellis and Luther, presented substantial evidence, wholly independent of the victim\u2019s statements, regarding the deteriorating state of her marriage to the defendant, the victim\u2019s firm decision to end the marriage and the defendant\u2019s unwillingness to accept a divorce and the resulting likelihood of reduced contact with his children. In light of this evidence, the trial court reasonably determined that Ellis\u2019 testimony about the victim\u2019s statements was probative of the defendant\u2019s motive to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We next consider the issue of whether, despite the relevancy of the challenged testimony, the trial court nevertheless should have excluded it as being unduly prejudicial. \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Of course, [a] 11 adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the juiy. . . . The trial court . . . must determine whether the adverse impact of the challenged evidence outweighs its probative value. . . . Finally, [t]he trial court\u2019s discretionary determination that the probative value of evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. . . . [B]ecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process . . . every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>. . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 329-30, 746 A.2d 761 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We agree with the Appellate Court that, under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the victim\u2019s statements to Ellis outweighed any prejudicial effect that they may have had. As we have indicated, the state already had adduced evidence about the victim\u2019s resolute intention to obtain a divorce, and Ellis testified that the defendant, himself, had told her about his altercation with the victim, including his threat to kill her. In view of this other evidence, none of which the defendant seriously contested, the victim\u2019s statements to Ellis cannot reasonably be characterized as unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. Furthermore, the trial court issued a hmiting instruction concerning Ellis\u2019 testimony about her conversation with the victim immediately after the completion of her testimony. See footnote 21 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As we have recognized, a real risk of prejudice exists \u201cin allowing surrogates to speak for the victim pointing back from the grave.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 255. Because of that risk, trial courts must take special care in evaluating the relevance of such evidence and in weighing its probative value and prejudicial effect. The court did so in this case and reached a conclusion that is fully supported by the facts and the law. Consequently, we, like the Appellate Court, reject the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of arson in the first degree when, with intent to destroy or damage a building, as defined in section 53a-100, he starts a fire or causes an explosion, and (1) the building is inhabited or occupied or the person has reason to believe the building may be inhabited or occupied ... or (4) at the scene of such fire or explosion a peace officer or firefighter is subjected to a substantial risk of bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence if, believing that an official proceeding is pending, or about to be instituted, he: (1) Alters, destroys, conceals or removes any record, document or thing with purpose to impair its verity or availability in such proceeding . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-12\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> The defendant appealed to this court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, we transferred the appeal to the Appellate Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> Wendy Wargo is interchangeably referred to throughout this opinion as the Wargo children\u2019s mother, the defendant\u2019s wile and the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\"> Shah explained that the lack of soot in the victim\u2019s lungs and larynx and on the victim\u2019s tongue, coupled with the low level of carbon monoxide in her blood, led her to conclude that the victim \u201cwas definitely dead before the fire.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> With respect to fatal drug overdoses, Shah testified that needle marks or tracks frequently are found on the victim\u2019s skin. Shah further testified that death by electrocution usually results in only very localized bums. Finally, Shah indicated that traumatic asphyxiation caused by strangulation or choking can be determined by examining the skin of a victim\u2019s neck, along with that victim\u2019s neck muscles and local organs. Shah stated that she was unable to examine the victim\u2019s neck muscles, local organs and skin because the victim\u2019s body had been too badly burned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\"> The Appellate Court reasoned: \u201cShah testified that the victim had died before the fire started and that the victim had not died of natural causes. She further testified that she could not determine the cause of death. The fact that, in forensic science, death by asphyxiation, drug overdose or electrocution may be determined by markings on the skin is irrelevant because Shah could not provide any connection between those causes of death and the actual cause of death of the victim. This testimony did not support a relevant fact even to a slightest degree and its admission was improper.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 759.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\"> In light of our conclusion that the trial court properly allowed Shah\u2019s testimony, we do not address the defendant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s ruling regarding that testimony was harmful error. We note, however, that the defendant, in the portion of his brief explaining why, in his view, the trial court\u2019s alleged evidentiary impropriety was harmful, points to comments made by the state\u2019s attorney during her rebuttal closing argument in which she underscored the fact that, because Shah had eliminated drug overdose and electrocution as possible causes of the victim\u2019s death, it was \u201clogical\u201d to infer that the victim had died of traumatic asphyxiation, such as by strangulation or suffocation, \u201cbecause there is no reason [the victim] is dead naturally.\u201d Even though we do not reach the harmless error issue, we nevertheless agree with the defendant that the prosecutor should not have urged the jury to infer that the victim had died as a result of traumatic asphyxiation. Shah repeatedly stated that she could not ascertain the cause of the victim\u2019s death; according to Shah, traumatic asphyxiation was only <em>one possible </em>cause of the victim\u2019s death. Moreover, at the time that the court permitted the state to elicit that testimony from Shah, both the court and the state\u2019s attorney expressly stated that the testimony was probative to help explain why Shah could <em>not </em>give an opinion as to a specific cause of death. The defendant, however, failed to object to any part of the closing argument and did not make any claim on appeal that the objectionable portion of the rebuttal argument violated his federal or state constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> Thus, a declaration that satisfies the requirements of the spontaneous utterance exception is admissible irrespective of whether the declarant has testified or is available to testify.

On appeal, this court, after underscoring the fact that the nephew \u201cdid not see the accident,\u201d but, rather, \u201conly heard it\u201d; id.; concluded that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>properly had determined that the nephew\u2019s statement did not qualify as a spontaneous utterance. Id., 279. The defendant contends that the present case is governed by <em>Johnson </em>because there is no direct evidence that the Wargo children actually observed the incidents that are the subject of their statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention. <em>Johnson </em>is factually distinguishable from this case because in the present case, unlike in <em>Johnson, </em>the evidence was sufficient to permit an inference that the declarants, i.e., Brent and Rachael, <em>actually had observed </em>the events to which they referred in their statements. We note, moreover, that the reasoning we employed in <em>Johnson </em>has been criticized as \u201cillogical, inasmuch as the issue was whether an accident was caused by a tire blowout, and since the declarant had personally <em>heard </em>the noise, no reason appears why he was not a qualified \u2018earwitness\u2019 to the noise for purposes of the [spontaneous utterance] rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.) C. Tait <em>&amp; </em>J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 11.11.4, p. 374. In light of our conclusion that <em>Johnson </em>does not control our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim, however, we need not address the question of whether our analysis of the spontaneous utterance issue in <em>Johnson </em>was flawed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> As the defendant notes, Brent, like the defendant and Sheila McClain, made reference to the victim\u2019s presence in the burning house. Brent also indicated, however, that the defendant had stepped on the victim as he was taking Brent and his sister from the house. It is apparent, therefore, that Brent\u2019s statement regarding the victim\u2019s presence in the house was predicated on his own observation of the victim and his realization that she had not accompanied him to safety, and not on anything that the defendant or Sheila McClain had said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> The defendant also asserts that the trial court improperly failed to exclude Fredericks\u2019 testimony in light of evidence adduced at trial that, during an interview that defense counsel conducted with Brent and Rachael in the presence of their guardian and a Bristol police officer some two years after the fire, the children indicated that they had not witnessed their parents fighting on the night of the fire, but, rather, on a previous night. Again, this evidence goes to the weight to be afforded Fredericks\u2019 testimony and not to its admissibility. The jury reasonably could have credited Fredericks\u2019 recollection that Brent had stated that the fight occurred on the night of the fire. Moreover, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Brent\u2019s statement, as recalled by Fredericks, made relatively soon after the altercation, more reliably reflected what had transpired that night than Brent\u2019s or Rachael\u2019s recollection of the events two years thereafter. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Fredericks\u2019 testimony notwithstanding the children\u2019s conflicting statements two years later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> Ellis had moved from Connecticut to New Mexico in 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> Ellis testified that the defendant had told her that the victim had stumbled down the first few stairs. Ellis initially testified that the defendant had indicated that he had pushed the victim down the stairs.

You are specifically instructed that this evidence has been admitted for a limited purpose, that is, for you to consider it, giving whatever weight you feel it deserves on the state of mind of the victim ... as that relates to the marital relationship of the parties at the time. In other words, it is to be considered for that purpose and for no other purpose. You may consider the evidence with respect to the victim\u2019s state of mind at the time . . . only regarding the subject of reconciliation as that\u2019s come up during the course of the evidence, and I specifically inform you or instruct you that, it\u2019s not offered as any direct proof of any element of a crime charged, but as stated, may only be considered and weighed by you with respect to this issue or subject of reconciliation at that time. Similarly, it is not offered and is not admitted as being probative of the defendant\u2019s conduct on November 19, 1994, and is not to be considered by you as probative of the defendant\u2019s conduct on that date. And furthermore, it is not offered as probative of the defendant\u2019s state of mind at that particular time. Again, the evidence has been admitted for you to consider and give it whatever weight you feel it deserves with respect to demonstrating the victim\u2019s . . . state of mind as [it] relates to the relationship that existed between [the victim] and the defendant and as that relates to this question or issue of an intended reconciliation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> The defendant does not dispute the admissibility of any of the other trial evidence that is relevant to this claim, including Ellis\u2019 testimony regarding her earlier telephone conversation with the defendant on November 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b161-5\"> We note that the Appellate Court, in explaining why the trial court properly permitted the state to adduce testimony from Ellis about her telephone conversation with the victim, stated that \u201c[t]he defendant claimed that the victim had agreed to reconcile and not to proceed with the divorce.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 755. Although he did not testily at trial, the defendant, who filed an insurance claim under his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for losses resulting from the fire, did submit to an examination under oath as required by the terms of his policy. In the course of that examination, which the state had introduced into evidence, the defendant tended to downplay any animosity or hostility that existed between the victim and himself. He never stated, however, that the victim had agreed to reconcile and not to pursue a divorce. Rather, the defendant indicated that he had submitted a motion in his divorce case seeking statutory conciliation counseling and, in addition, that the victim had acquiesced in his request that they see a marriage counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We further note that, as the state points out, the defendant\u2019s efforts to minimize the extent to which his marriage had deteriorated provides a second, albeit closely related, basis for the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements to Ellis. \u201cA defendant\u2019s articulated or implied theory of defense may make the victim\u2019s state of mind material to the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>State v. Crafts, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 253. Indeed, as one prominent commentator has stated, this court has \u201cnot limited the use of the victim\u2019s state of mind to affirmative defenses recognized by law, such as self-defense or suicide . . . .\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (Sup. 2000) \u00a7 11.13.1, p. 247. Rather, we have \u201cpermitted] its use to rebut <em>theories </em>of defense, such as a claim of innocence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. Moreover, we have approved the use of testimony about a victim\u2019s expressions of fear of the accused when such evidence \u201chelps to rebut aspects of [an] asserted defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 634. In light of this precedent, the victim\u2019s statements to Ellis also were admissible to rebut the implication, raised by the defendant in his examination under oath, that reconciliation between the defendant and the victim was a distinct possibility and, therefore, that the defendant had no reason to kill the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> We previously have recognized the significance that proof of motive may have in a criminal case. \u201cWhile evidence of motive does not establish an element of the crime charged . . . such evidence is both desirable and important. ... It strengthens the state\u2019s case when an adequate motive can be shown. . . . Evidence tending to show the existence or nonexistence of motive often forms an important factor in the inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. . . . This factor is to be weighed by the jury along with the other evidence in the case. . . . The role motive plays in any particular case necessarily varies with the strength of the other evidence in the case. The other evidence may be such as to justify a conviction without any motive being shown. It may be so weak that without a disclosed motive the guilt of the accused would be clouded by a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>182 Conn. 220, 223-24, 438 A.2d 38 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
