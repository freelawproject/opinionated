The defendant, Angelo Joyner, who, after a first trial, was convicted of, inter alia, sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-70,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The habeas court granted the defendant\u2019s petition on the grounds that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, Samuel Dixon, had had a conflict of interest and had provided ineffective assistance to the defendant. Accordingly, the habeas court ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The victim died during the period between the end of the first trial and the beginning of the second trial. The defendant sought to exclude from the second trial the now-deceased victim\u2019s testimony from the first trial. The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the second trial court properly ruled that the habeas court\u2019s findings of conflict of interest and ineffective assistance of counsel prevented it, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from determining whether Dixon\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>examination of the victim in the first trial satisfied the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him, such that the victim\u2019s testimony would be admissible in the new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The defendant argues that, in determining that Dixon had provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, the habeas court necessarily determined that Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim at the first trial had failed to satisfy the confrontation clause of either the federal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>or Connecticut<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> constitution. This determination, the defendant contends, binds the trial court under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The state argues that the habeas court did not determine that Dixon\u2019s cross-examination failed to satisfy either the federal or state confrontation clause and, therefore, the second trial court is not barred from determining that issue under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The state further contends that, even if the habeas court had made such a determination, it was only one of many reasons offered for the habeas court\u2019s ultimate finding of ineffective assistance and, therefore, is not binding on the second trial court. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The following background is relevant to our resolution of the state\u2019s appeal. On June 28,1991, a jury found the defendant guilty of three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70, one count of assault in the first degree in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>utes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (l),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant filed motions for acquittal and for a new trial on July 12, 1991; both were denied. On July 26, 1991, the defendant was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On September 3, 1991, the defendant appealed to this court from the trial court\u2019s judgment, claiming that: (1) the state had presented insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for assault in the first degree; (2) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a) unconstitutionally had imposed upon him the burden of establishing the defense of mental disease or defect; (3) the trial court had failed to give a curative instruction sua sponte when the state\u2019s attorney stated that the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s demeanor in the courtroom in evaluating his defense of mental disease or defect; (4) the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing the state to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct in cross-examining the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist; (5) the trial court had improperly denied the defendant\u2019s request that the court inspect the victim\u2019s mental health records in camera; (6) the trial court had improperly permitted the state\u2019s psychiatrist to testify that the defendant had control over his conduct; and (7) the trial court had denied the defendant his constitutional right to testify at trial when it failed to conduct a canvass to determine, on the record, that the defendant\u2019s waiver of that right was knowing and voluntary. See <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 454, 625 A.2d 791 (1993). On May 4, 1993, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The defendant, acting pro se, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on May 20, 1993, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The defendant then amended the petition eleven times to include, inter alia, claims of prosecutorial misconduct and conflict of interest by Dixon. Specifically, he claimed that Dixon previously had represented his deceased father\u2019s estate in a wrongful death action. Although Dixon had been expected to distribute approximately $22,700 to each of the decedent\u2019s children, including the defendant, from the proceeds of the action, the defendant only received a small portion of his share from Dixon. Without that money, the defendant argued, he had been unable to retain the attorney of his choice in this criminal case. The defendant also claimed that Dixon had told him that any money he had held for the defendant had been garnished as a result of a civil suit brought by the victim. On September 19, 1997, the habeas court, <em>Rittenband, J., </em>found that Dixon had had a conflict of interest in representing the defendant and had provided the defendant with ineffective assistance. Thereafter, the habeas court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and ordered a new trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The victim died in 1992, and, on February 10, 2000, the defendant moved to exclude from the new trial the victim\u2019s testimony from the first trial. On February 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>2000, the second trial court, <em>Licari, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the victim\u2019s prior testimony, concluding that it was bound by the findings of the habeas court under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Specifically, the second trial court found that the habeas court, in order to have reached its decision to grant the defendant\u2019s habeas petition, necessarily had determined that Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim had been inadequate. On February 28, 2000, the state filed a substitute information, alleging one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a), one count of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (l),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> one count of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70. The state then requested that the second trial court dismiss the three counts of sexual assault in the first degree \u201cso that [the state] could have a final judgment [from] which [it could] appeal.\u201d The second trial court dismissed the three counts of sexual assault in the first degree and granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The defendant then was released on a written promise to appear on September 11, 2000, under the conditions that he not contact or attempt to contact the victim\u2019s minor child and that he not violate any state or federal criminal laws. The defendant agreed to waive any further benefit from the habeas court\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>as well as any speedy trial rights until the state\u2019s appeal was resolved. The state, in turn, agreed that, if it lost its appeal on the sexual assault charges, but was successful in retrying the defendant on the remaining charges, it would not seek a sentence longer than thirty years. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">We first address the potentially dispositive jurisdictional claims. See, e.g., <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 442, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997). The defendant claims that we lack subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal because: (1) the state was the party that obtained a dismissal of the sexual assault charges and did so \u201cwithout a detailed showing that it could not prosecute the defendant on those charges without the [excluded] testimony [of the victim]\u201d; and (2) the state did not seek dismissal of all charges, but, rather, only of the three counts of sexual assault, and if the state may appeal, it may do so only after a final judgment has been rendered with respect to all of the charges. The state contends that it properly followed the process for appeal described in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 454 A.2d 266 (1983). We agree with the state that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The defendant first argues that, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 42, in order to appeal from a judgment of dismissal that it had requested, the state must have presented a sufficiently detailed showing that it could not prosecute the defendant on the sexual assault charges without the victim\u2019s testimony. We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>In <em>Ross, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]f the judgment of dismissal with prejudice had been rendered upon a motion of the defendant under [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-56<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> rather than upon [the state\u2019s] motion, the state unquestionably could have appealed. We do not believe that the availability of appellate review should turn wholly upon the identity of the party who has invoked judicial recognition of the moribund status of the prosecution.\u201d Id., 48-49. Although \u201c[a]n appellant cannot ordinarily claim error in the action of the trial court which he has induced,\u201d an exception exists when \u201ca party consents to the entiy of a judgment against him when it is the only logical result at which the court could arrive given its previous rulings.\u201d Id., 47-48. It would be unfair to force the state to proceed with a case for which it has insufficient evidence to prove guilt because of a suppression order, inasmuch as the state would then be precluded by double jeopardy from seeking subsequent review of that order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See id., 48-49 (\u201cIn a criminal case, such as the one before [the court], the state has no realistic option to proceed to trial and await the inevitable outcome where vital evidence has been suppressed. If because of the unavailability of the suppressed evidence a defendant has been acquitted, the principle of double jeopardy would prevent a new trial regardless of whether the exclusionary ruling was erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>neous. . . . [U]nless such pretrial review is allowed the state could never secure appellate scrutiny of such a ruling. A defendant, of course, may claim error in such a ruling upon his appeal from the judgment of conviction.\u201d [Citations omitted.]).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As we concluded in <em>Ross, </em>\u201cin cases . . . where, as a result of the suppression of evidence before trial, a judgment of dismissal with prejudice fully dispositive of the case has been rendered, the state may, with the permission of the trial court as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 54-96,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> obtain appellate review of that ruling.\u201d Id., 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In the present case, the defendant argues that the state did not make a sufficient showing that it could not proceed on the sexual assault charges without the victim\u2019s testimony and, therefore, failed to provide the court with an \u201cassurance that this procedure [has] not be[en] resorted to lightly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>191 Conn. 506, 512, 467 A.2d 920 (1983). As in <em>Ross, </em>however, we conclude that the state\u2019s willingness to have the charges dismissed provides such assurance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 50-51 (\u201c[a] decision by the state to obtain dismissal of a prosecution with prejudice is a sufficiently serious precondition to the right of appeal [so as] to provide adequate assurance that this procedure will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>be resorted to lightly\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the state has met the requirements set forth in <em>Ross </em>for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s argument that, because the state only sought dismissal of three of the six charges against him, and, consequently, is appealing only the dismissal of those three charges, the appeal is interlocutory in nature. The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), in which this court stated: \u201cIt has long been this court\u2019s policy to discourage \u2018piecemeal\u2019 appeals, particularly in criminal proceedings.\u201d Id., 30. We concluded in <em>Curcio, </em>however, that there are two exceptions to this general principle: \u201c(1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id., 31. This \u201csecond test for finality . . . focuses not on the proceeding involved, but on the potential harm to the appellant\u2019s rights.\u201d Id., 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The defendant focuses on the second <em>Curcio </em>exception and claims that the state has not made any showing that its interest would be destroyed if appellate review were to be postponed, but, rather, has rested on a <em>\u201cbald </em>assertion\u201d of harm, which is insufficient under <em>Curcio. </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 34.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The state contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Curdo </em>does not apply because this appeal is not interlocutory in nature, but is an appeal of a final judgment under <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 42, as previously discussed. Because the dismissal of the sexual assault charges constitutes a final judgment under <em>Ross; </em>id., 50-51; we agree with the state that <em>Curdo </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We note that Practice Book (2001) \u00a7 61-6 (b), effective January 1, 2001, provides: \u201cThe state, with the permission of the presiding judge of the trial court and as provided by law, may appeal from a final judgment. In cases where an appealable judgment has been rendered on fewer than all counts of the information or complaint, the state may appeal from the judgment at the time it is rendered.\u201d In addition, Practice Book (2001) \u00a7 61-6 (c), also effective January 1, 2001, provides: \u201cTo the extent provided by law, the defendant or the state may appeal from a ruling that is not a final judgment or from an interlocutory ruling deemed to be a final judgment.\u201d Although this revised Practice Book section was not yet in effect when the state filed its appeal in this case, the commentary to the rule reflects its relevance to our resolution of this appeal. \u201cThe intent of this revision to [Practice Book \u00a7] 61-6 is to collect the ways in which an appeal from a criminal case may be taken.\u201d Practice Book (2001) \u00a7 61-6, official commentary. The commentary indicates that the revised Practice Book section, rather than breaking new ground, is merely articulating means that already existed by which an appeal may be taken\u2014including an appeal from a judgment \u201con fewer than all counts of the information or complaint\u201d; Practice Book (2001) \u00a7 61-6 (b); as in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Lastly, we address the defendant\u2019s related argument that if the state is entitled to appeal at all, it must await the completion of the trial on the remaining charges. In support of this claim, the defendant cites to <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Southard, supra, 191 Conn. 506, in which this court stated that \u201cto permit [an] appeal . . . would be inconsistent with the fundamental requirements of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The intent of that constitutional prohibition is to shield criminal defendants from repeated prosecution; for that reason, the prohibition cannot in and of itself be utilized by the state as a sword to obtain review of <em>interlocutory </em>orders that would be unavailable to the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 511-12. We already have concluded herein, however, that the dismissal of the sexual assault counts constitutes a final judgment under <em>Ross. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 49 (\u201c[a] dismissal with prejudice is unquestionably a final judgment which the state may appeal\u201d). Therefore, <em>Southard </em>is inapplicable in the present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The state claims that a finding of ineffective cross-examination of the victim by Dixon was not necessary to the decision of the habeas court to grant the defendant\u2019s request for a new trial and that relitigation of this issue, therefore, is not barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The principle of collateral estoppel \u201cmeans simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S. Ct. 1189, 25 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1970). \u201c[Collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating issues and facts <em>actu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>ally </em>and <em>necessarily </em>determined in an earlier proceeding between the same parties or those in privity with them upon a different claim.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 364, 373-74, 727 A.2d 1245 (1999). \u201cIf an issue has been determined, but the judgment is not dependent upon the determination of the issue, the parties may relitigate the issue in a subsequent action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 374. For collateral estoppel to apply, \u201cthe issue concerning which relitigation is sought to be estopped must be identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>220 Conn. 285, 297, 596 A.2d 414 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cAn issue is actually litigated if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 374; see also <em>P. X. Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>189 Conn. 153, 161-62, 454 A.2d 1258 (1983) (\u201c[t]he party or his privy against whom collateral estoppel is asserted . . . must have been given a full and fair opportunity to litigate in a prior proceeding the issue sought to be precluded in the subsequent proceeding\u201d). \u201cAn issue is necessarily determined if, in the absence of a determination of the issue, the judgment could not have been validly rendered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 374. We review collateral estoppel claims de novo. See <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 596, 726 A.2d 502 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The state contends that the issue of the adequacy of Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim was neither actually litigated nor decided by the habeas court and that the second trial court, therefore, was not collaterally estopped from determining whether Dixon\u2019s cross-examination satisfied the defendant\u2019s right to confront <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The state argues that the adequacy of the cross-examination was not a factor in the habeas court\u2019s decision regarding Dixon\u2019s performance and certainly was not a necessary factor in that decision. The defendant argues, to the contrary, that the habeas court based its determination of ineffective assistance of counsel on its finding that Dixon had cross-examined the victim ineffectively, that the second trial court, therefore, was collaterally estopped from evaluating the adequacy of the cross-examination, and that the victim\u2019s testimony should be excluded from the new trial. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The record reveals that the second trial court based its ruling excluding the victim\u2019s testimony on what it perceived as the habeas court\u2019s finding that the cross-examination of the victim had been inadequate. When the trial court rendered its decision on February 25, 2000, the state\u2019s attorney asked: \u201cAm I correct then, that your findings, to the extent that they are all factual findings, are based upon the findings of the habeas court?\u201d The court responded: \u201cThat is correct. [The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>court has] made no independent findings . . . Furthermore, the court stated: \u201cThe defendant makes a second tier argument that even if collateral estoppel is not applicable . . . under the general policies of the rule . . . this court should still find the victim\u2019s testimony inadmissible. [This court does] not reach that issue.\u201d Rather than evaluating Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim independently, the trial court, citing the doctrine of collateral estoppel, relied on what it interpreted as a finding by the habeas court that Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim had been insufficient. We conclude, however, that the habeas court made no such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The habeas court\u2019s September 19,1997 memorandum of decision granting the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus was based on both the habeas court\u2019s finding that Dixon had a conflict of interest and its finding that Dixon\u2019s representation of the defendant constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The second trial court stated that, in the present case, \u201ceffective assistance of counsel, conflict of interest, credibility and confrontation are so intertwined they are one and the same . . . .\u201d We conclude that a finding of inadequate cross-examination was not necessary to either the habeas court\u2019s conflict of interest finding or its ineffective assistance of counsel finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>We first address the habeas court\u2019s finding that Dixon had an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his performance. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 132-33, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991); see also <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980) (\u201c[T]he possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. In order to demonstrate a violation of . . . Sixth Amendment rights, a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d). We conclude that a finding of inadequate cross-examination was not necessary to that determination. The habeas court found an actual conflict of interest in that Dixon had stolen the defendant\u2019s portion of the inheritance and forced the defendant to retain him as counsel in the criminal case. The habeas court stated that this conflict of interest had affected Dixon\u2019s performance because it had resulted in Dixon: (1) effectively denying the defendant his counsel of choice by withholding the money with which the defendant would have retained another attorney; (2) failing to spend the money necessary to conduct an adequate investigation; and (3) allowing the defendant to appear before the jury in prison clothing, rather than spending the money to provide him with more appropriate attire as the defendant had requested.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The habeas court did not mention inadequate cross-examination as one of the manifestations of Dixon\u2019s conflict of interest. See <em>Slate </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>226 Conn. 265, 276, 627 A.2d 892 (1993) (\u201c [collateral estoppel does not bar relitigation of a nonessential issue because such an issue may not have been afforded careful deliberation and analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Furthermore, a finding of a conflict of interest would not render the victim\u2019s testimony during Dixon\u2019s cross-examination per se inadmissible.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ciak, </em>102 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. 1996), the court stated: \u201cThe defendant urges us to find that [the attorney\u2019s] cross-examination of [the witness] at the first trial was constitutionally inadequate per se because of the difficulty in determining the limits to the effect of [the attorney\u2019s] conflict of interest. . . . We decline the invitation to adopt so broad a rule. Rather, following the approach now well-established in applicable precedent, we look to the actual transcript of [the witness\u2019] testimony\u2014in particular to [the attorney\u2019s] cross-examination of [the witness]\u2014to determine whether the cross-examination imbues the testimony with the requisite indicia of reliability.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) As we previously noted, the habeas court in the present case did not even allude to a finding of ineffective cross-examination when it articulated the reasons underlying its finding of a conflict of interest. Because Dixon\u2019s ineffective cross-examination was not necessary to the habeas court\u2019s determination that Dixon had a conflict of interest, the habeas court\u2019s determination did not collaterally estop the trial court from independently evaluating Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We now consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the dispositive factor in the habeas court\u2019s decision was Dixon\u2019s ineffective assistance to the defendant, specifically, Dixon\u2019s failure to pursue a consent defense, which, the defendant argues, was the only viable defense. The defendant claims that attacking the victim\u2019s credibility on cross-examination constituted the necessary means by which to pursue the consent defense. The defendant argues, therefore, that a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of inadequate cross-examination was necessary to the habeas court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s logic is flawed. Even if it is assumed that the habeas court\u2019s determination of ineffective assistance of counsel was the dispositive factor in that court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s habeas petition, the habeas court did not indicate that a failure to pursue a consent defense was the only, or even a necessary, basis for that decision. The habeas court found that Dixon\u2019s inadequate pretrial investigation alone was sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. It also cited each of the following factors in support of its finding of ineffective assistance of counsel: Dixon\u2019s failure to dress the defendant in nonprison garb, his failure to retain a medical expert<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and his failure to present a consent defense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Furthermore, even if a finding that Dixon failed to establish an adequate consent defense had been necessary to the habeas court\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel determination, attacking the victim\u2019s credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>through cross-examination was not the necessary means by which to establish that defense. A consent defense could have been pursued through the testimony of other witnesses, found by an investigator Dixon had hired, who believed that the defendant had been living with the victim and who could have provided testimony to contradict the victim\u2019s story about the nature of her relationship with the defendant. Similarly, a medical expert could have testified for the defense regarding the conspicuous lack of bruises found below the victim\u2019s waist or about the victim\u2019s blood alcohol content after the incident. Such evidence could have contradicted the victim\u2019s testimony that she did not consent and that she had not consumed alcohol on the night in question. Although an inadequate cross-examination of the victim was consistent with the habeas court\u2019s findings, it was not cited by the habeas court explicitly. Furthermore, to read such a conclusion into the habeas court\u2019s decision would be contrary to the requirement that issues be actually litigated and determined for collateral estoppel to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The undercurrent of the habeas court\u2019s discussion is that Dixon\u2019s inadequate investigation prevented him from making an informed decision about which defense to pursue. The habeas court did not address the inadequacy of Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim specifically. The habeas court\u2019s broad statement that Dixon\u2019s conflict of interest \u201cpermeated the entire criminal trial\u201d does not render the testimony of the victim per se inadmissible, and it does not collaterally estop the second trial court from independently evaluating the adequacy of Dixon\u2019s cross-examination in determining the admissibility of the victim\u2019s testimony in the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">It is also worth noting that, because the issue of the adequacy of Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>was not discussed in the defendant\u2019s habeas pleadings,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and, given the fact that the issue arose in a habeas proceeding and not a criminal trial, the state never had an adequate opportunity to argue its position regarding the adequacy of the cross-examination. The state lacked the incentive to expend the resources to assert its position as thoroughly as it would have had in a criminal trial at which the state either would have to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or forever lose the opportunity to convict him on that charge. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>242 Conn. 648, 655, 699 A.2d 987 (1997) (\u201cthe state . . . had no incentive to present its best evidence at the revocation proceeding where there was a lower standard of proof\u2019); <em>Slate </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra, 161 Conn. 502 (\u201c[w]here the issue is only probable cause the prosecuting attorney does not have the same interest in cross-examining an alibi witness as does the attorney for the State upon a trial on the issue of guilt or innocence\u201d); see also <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 752, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994) (\u201cdoctrine of collateral estoppel did not preclude the plaintiff from litigating the existence of probable cause even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that issue had already been partially litigated at an earlier Franks<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> hearing\u201d). Furthermore, the state could not have predicted that a conclusion that never was articulated by the habeas court would be considered a necessary finding for purposes of collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">On remand, the trial court will be required independently to evaluate the reliability of the victim\u2019s prior testimony and determine its admissibility at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-70 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> The doctrine of collateral estoppel prohibits the relitigation between the same parties of an issue that has been fully and fairly litigated and determined by a valid, final judgment.

Virtually the same language regarding Dixon\u2019s failure to question the victim about the medical records can be found in the amended petition in one of the four subsections to one of nineteen potential grounds for a finding of misconduct by Dixon. The defendant does not, and presumably cannot, point to any section of his amended petition in which he explicitly asserts that Dixon\u2019s cross-examination of the victim was inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\"> <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.
