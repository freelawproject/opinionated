Rocque, Jr., commissioner of environmental protection, and the department of environmental protection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to provide the defendant The Hartford Courant Company (Courant) with copies of certain records it had sought, redacting only social security numbers and those portions of the documents that fell within the attorney-client privilege. The department then appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the decision of the commission and held that the disclosure of the information sought from the department\u2019s personnel files would constitute an invasion of personal privacy. The commission and the Courant filed separate appeals from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the identity of the complainant in the sexual harassment investigation at issue here is exempt from disclosure under the act. We also agree with the trial court that certain other information concerning the investigation is exempt from disclosure, although we limit the exempt portions of the records to those comprising sexually descriptive information. We disagree, however, with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the identity of a complainant in a sexual harassment complaint and related information are <em>always </em>exempt from disclosure, irrespective of the particular facts of a case, and we therefore reverse the judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The material facts in these combined appeals are undisputed. On May 27, 1998, the defendant Daniel Jones, a reporter for the Courant, submitted a written request under the act to the department,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking access to and/or copies of personnel records pertaining to a sexual harassment investigation of a department manager.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Pursuantto General Statutes \u00a7 1-214 (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the department notified the employees involved, including the complainant and the department manager, of their right to object to the disclosure of the records. Each of the employees involved, including the complainant and the department manager, submitted a timely written obj ection to the disclosure ofthepersonnelrecords,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>aspermittedunder \u00a7 1-214 (c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The department then informed the Courant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>certain information was being withheld as exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Courant thereafter filed a complaint against the department with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">After an evidentiary hearing and an in camera inspection of the documents in question, the commission rendered its final decision. The commission ordered the department to provide the Courant with copies of the interview notes and tape recordings of the interviews conducted by the department during the course of its investigation of the complainant\u2019s sexual harassment complaint,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> redacting only social security numbers and those portions of the documents that were protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The department then filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, which sustained the appeal. The trial court found \u201cthat the information sought to be exempted from disclosure in this case is not of legitimate concern to the public and that the information is highly offensive to reasonable people. The identity of an alleged victim in a sexual harassment complaint, and other information related to the investigation, are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information laws. The disclosure of such information would constitute an invasion of the personal privacy of the complainant.\u201d The commission and the Courant then filed the appeals that are now before this court. They both argue that the trial court improperly concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that the identity of the complainant and other information concerning the department\u2019s investigation of the sexual harassment complaint are exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2). In addition, the Courant<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> argues that the trial court exceeded its proper scope of review under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by holding generally, without regard to the facts of this case, that the \u201cidentity of an alleged victim in a sexual harassment complaint, and other information related to the investigation, are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information laws,\u201d and that \u201cdisclosure of such information would constitute an invasion of the personal privacy of the complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The initial issue presented in these appeals is whether the trial court properly determined that disclosure of the identity of the complainant and certain other information related to the investigation of her complaint would constitute an invasion of privacy, and therefore, the information was exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2). Before addressing this issue, however, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>briefly set forth the applicable standard of judicial review. \u201cOur resolution of [these appeals] is guided by the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; to the determinations made by an administrative agency. [W]e must decide, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion. <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 221 Conn. 393, 397, 604 A.2d 351 (1992). Even as to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, <em>in light of the evidence, </em>the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 774, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 773-74; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 164-65, 635 A.2d 783 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u201cOur review of an agency\u2019s factual determination is constrained by ... \u00a7 4-183 (j), which mandates that a court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are ... (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record .... This limited standard of review dictates that, [w]ith regard to questions of fact, it is neither the function of the trial court nor of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. . . . <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 57, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991); see also <em>DiBlasi v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 823, 829-30, 624 A.2d 372 (1993). An agency\u2019s factual determination must be sustained if it is reasonably supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>225 Conn. 731, 744, 626 A.2d 705 (1993); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 57.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New England Cable Television Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>247 Conn. 97, 117-18, 717 A.2d 1276 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Both the commission and the Courant argue that the question in this case is not a pure question of law, but involves an application of the well settled meaning of \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) to the facts of this particular case. The department contends, however, that the present case presents a pure question of law that has not been subject to prior judicial scrutiny and that, therefore, the appropriate standard of review is de novo. We agree with the commission and the Courant that the present case involves applying the well settled meaning of \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) to the facts of this particular case. The appropriate standard of judicial review, therefore, is whether the commission\u2019s factual determinations are reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">With these legal principles in mind, we now turn to the initial issue presented in these appeals, namely, whether the trial court properly determined that disclosure of the identity of the complainant and certain other information would constitute an invasion of the complainant\u2019s privacy and, therefore, that the information was exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2). The act provides that \u201c [e]xcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute [including the exceptions to the act], all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records promptly during regular office or business hours or to receive a copy of such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-212. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (a). \u201c[I]t must be noted initially that there is an overarching policy underlying the [act] . . . favoring the disclosure of public records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992). \u201c[I]t is well established that the general rule under the [act] is disclosure, and any exception to that rule will be narrowly construed in light of the general policy of openness expressed in the . . . legislation [comprising the act].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 398. \u201cThe burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption clearly rests upon the party claiming the exemption.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 167. \u201cThis burden requires the claimant of the exemption to provide more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>than conclusory language, generalized allegations or mere arguments of counsel. Rather, a sufficiently detailed record must reflect the reasons why an exemption applies to the materials requested.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Section 1-210 (b) (2) provides that \u201c[n]othing in the Freedom of Information Act shall be construed to require disclosure of . . . [personnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy . . . .\u201d When a claim for exemption is based upon \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2), the person claiming the exemption must meet a twofold burden of proof. First, the person claiming the exemption must establish that the files are personnel, medical or similar files. In this case, there is no dispute that the Courant sought disclosure of personnel or similar files. See <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>233 Conn. 28, 30, 657 A.2d 630 (1995) (investigative file of sexual harassment complaint by one employee of state agency against coworker constituted personnel or similar file). Second, the person claiming the exemption under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) must also prove that disclosure of the files would constitute an invasion of personal privacy. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 169; <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The test for determining whether a disclosure constitutes an invasion of personal privacy under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) was enunciated in <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 175. In <em>Perkins, </em>this court adopted as the appropriate test for invasion of personal privacy under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) the definition of a tort action for the invasion of personal privacy, delineated in \u00a7 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977). <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>mission, supra, 172-75. We held that \u201cthe invasion of personal privacy exception of [\u00a7 1-210 (b) (2)] precludes disclosure . . . only when the information sought by a request does not pertain to legitimate matters of public concern and is highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d Id., 175; see also <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>242 Conn. 79, 84-85, 698 A.2d 803 (1997). <em>Perkins </em>explicitly rejected a balancing test and ruled that the information sought must satisfy both parts of the test to be exempt from disclosure. <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The records at issue in this case comprised a written complaint of sexual harassment made by an employee of the department against a department manager, the complainant\u2019s detailed statement to the investigating officer, and notes from interviews of many coworkers taken during the course of the department\u2019s investigation of that complaint. The investigation resulted in a finding that no sexual harassment took place, but that the manager \u201cexercised poor judgment . . . .\u201d The department claimed that the entire complaint, the entire statement of the complainant and portions of the interview notes were exempt from disclosure. The department provided copies of the records under seal to both the commission and the trial court. In addition, the department filed an index to the sealed records, which specified the exact portions of the interview notes that the department claimed were exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">After an in camera review of the documents submitted by the department, the trial court determined that these documents, which contain information about relationships between different parties, allegations of sexual improprieties, and the observations of those investigating, were not of legitimate concern to the public. The trial court further found that the information, if disclosed, would be highly offensive to a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>person. In so doing, the trial court implicitly overruled the commission\u2019s factual findings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In its final decision, the commission had found that \u201cthe notes from the interviews, which reflect the manner in which much of the investigation was conducted and the evidence on which the recommended action was based, pertain to legitimate matters of public concern.\u201d The commission further found that \u201cthe notes of the interviews do not contain information that could reasonably be considered highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d The commission failed to support these conclusory factual findings, however, by reference to any supporting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><em>Perkins </em>requires that the person claiming the exemption under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) first prove that the material that is claimed to be exempt from disclosure is not of legitimate public concern. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 175. The defendants argue that the identity of the complainant and other portions of the documents in question are of legitimate concern to the public because the public has a right to know how state agencies generally go about investigating allegations of sexual harassment within the workplace. They also contend that the identity of the complainant is a matter of legitimate public concern because disclosure of the complainant\u2019s identity may facilitate an evaluation of the department\u2019s investigation into this particular sexual harassment complaint. The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the complainant\u2019s identity may be helpful if the complainant is willing to discuss the matter with those who want to evaluate the investigation. The department argues in response that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the portions of the documents in question are not of legitimate concern to the public because they contain information about the personal and marital relationships of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">For purposes of analysis under the requirements of <em>Perkins, </em>we separate the information that the department claims is exempt into two categories. The first category consists of the complainant\u2019s identity and related personal information from which the complainant could be identified, for example, the complainant\u2019s home address. The second category comprises the balance of the information claimed to be exempt, including: information such as the date when and location where the sexual harassment allegedly occurred; a letter to the complainant from the assistant commissioner who investigated the complaint, seeking the complainant\u2019s cooperation; certain questions posed to witnesses as part of the department\u2019s investigation; and portions of certain answers to those questions. Some of the information in this second category is sexually explicit, for example, the allegations and descriptions of sexual contact and sexual improprieties, and details of intimate personal relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We are not persuaded that the first category of information, principally the complainant\u2019s identity, is of legitimate public concern. The name of the complainant is not necessary to the public\u2019s understanding or evaluation of the department\u2019s sexual harassment investigation. The complainant\u2019s name would add nothing to an examination or evaluation of the department\u2019s investigative process, which is clearly revealed by these records without the disclosure of the complainant\u2019s identity. In addition, we find no merit to the defendants\u2019 claim that the disclosure of the identity is warranted because such disclosure would be helpful in determining whether the complainant is willing to discuss the investigation with someone evaluating the process. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>records at issue reveal that the complainant was fearful of retaliation, consistently requested that the matter be kept as confidential as possible, and objected to the disclosure of the records of the investigation. We think it unlikely, therefore, that the complainant would be willing to discuss the matter with those who might want to evaluate the investigation. We agree with the trial court that the complainant\u2019s identity and related identifying information are not legitimate matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We turn next to the second category of information that the department claims is exempt to determine whether any of this information is of legitimate public concern. We conclude that much of this information <em>is </em>of legitimate public concern in that it reveals, for example, the department\u2019s efforts to secure the complainant\u2019s cooperation, the department\u2019s procedure in questioning witnesses and the complainant\u2019s concern for job-related consequences from the alleged sexual harassment. After reviewing all of the department\u2019s exemption claims, we conclude that the only portions of the records that are not a matter of legitimate public concern are those portions containing sexually explicit or descriptive information, such as allegations of sexual contact and sexual improprieties, and details of intimate personal relationships. In <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 89-90, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the public had no legitimate interest in disclosure of a report describing details of a state trooper\u2019s personal and marital relationships. The investigative report in that case resulted from a citizen\u2019s complaint that the trooper was involved in an inappropriate relationship with the complainant\u2019s wife. We conclude similarly here, that sexually explicit information contained in the records at issue pertaining to the complainant\u2019s intimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>relationships is not a matter of legitimate public concern.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In order to establish an exemption under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2), the party claiming the exemption must demonstrate also that the disclosure of the documents in question would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 175. The defendants assert that on the facts of this case, the disclosure of the identity of the complainant and the other information claimed to be exempt would not be highly offensive to a reasonable person because they do not reveal facts about the complainant\u2019s private life, but involve incidents that demonstrate how a public employee acted during the hours of employment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The department contends, however, that disclosure of the specific information contained within these documents would be highly offensive to a reasonable person because it pertains to the private life of the sexual harassment complainant and documents the complainant\u2019s private relationships. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The subject matter of the records in question is a sexual harassment complaint by an employee against a supervisor. As this court indicated in <em>Perkins, </em>\u201c[sjexual relations . . . are normally entirely private matters . . . .\u201d Id., 173. The trial court found that disclosing the identity of the sexual harassment complainant would be highly offensive to a reasonable person because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>unique sensitivity of the issues involved and the reluctance of sexual harassment victims to come forward because of the fear that they will be disbelieved or exposed in some way. The trial court further found that disclosure of the details of the alleged sexual harassment would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. We agree with both findings, which are supported by substantial evidence and by our examination of the records at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We conclude, therefore, that both parts of the twofold test established in <em>Perkins </em>are satisfied here in that the identity of the sexual harassment complainant in this case, including related identifying information, and sexually explicit portions of the investigation documents are not of legitimate public concern, and their disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Consequently, the identity of the complainant and the sexually explicit portions of the investigation documents are exempt from public disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We have undertaken a detailed review of the entire record before the trial court and, after doing so, conclude that the commission\u2019s factual findings were <em>not </em>reasonably supported by the substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>New England Cable Television Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 117-18. The trial court, therefore, properly reversed the commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Finally, although we agree with the trial court that the commission improperly ordered the department to disclose the entire file, we are not, however, in complete agreement with the trial court concerning exactly which portions of each document at issue are exempt from disclosure. The trial court agreed with all of the department\u2019s claims of exemption with respect to specific portions of the records. For example, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>agreed with the department that the entire sexual harassment complaint and all of the complainant\u2019s detailed statement were exempt from disclosure. We take a narrower view and conclude that the only portions of those two documents that are exempt are those portions identifying the complainant or containing sexually explicit information. We have reached the same conclusion with respect to the interview notes as well. For example, the trial court, agreeing with the department, found this question exempt from disclosure: \u201cWas [the complainant] consuming alcohol?\u201d We conclude that the question is not exempt from disclosure as an invasion of personal privacy and must be disclosed. To evidence our ruling with respect to each portion of the records claimed as exempt we are filing with the chief clerk of the appellate system a complete copy of the records at issue, redacting only those portions that we conclude are exempt from disclosure under the personal privacy exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The second issue presented in these appeals is whether the trial court exceeded its proper scope of review under \u00a7 4-183. The trial court, in effect, found that the identity of an alleged victim in a sexual harassment complaint and other information related to the investigation are <em>always </em>exempt from disclosure under the act and that the disclosure of such information would always constitute an invasion of the personal privacy of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The Courant contends that the court exceeded its proper scope of review when it found \u201cthat the identity of the complainant and related investigative material in a sexual harassment complaint, if disclosed to the public, constitute information which is highly offensive to a reasonable person,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he identity of an alleged victim in a sexual harassment complaint, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>other information related to the investigation, are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information laws. . . . The disclosure of such information would constitute an invasion of the personal privacy of the complainant.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Courant argues that the trial court abandoned the appropriate, fact intensive, case-by-case analysis required under <em>Perkins </em>and announced a rule of law to be applied in every case involving sexual harassment allegations. At oral argument, the department conceded that <em>Perkins </em>requires a fact intensive individual analysis of each case. The Courant and the department, therefore, both agree that, as construed in <em>Perkins, </em>\u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) requires a factual analysis on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We agree that the trial court exceeded the proper scope of review by concluding that the identity of a sexual harassment complainant and other information in a sexual harassment investigation are always exempt under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2). As we have demonstrated in part I of this opinion, \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) requires two factual findings. The party claiming the exemption under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) has the burden of proving both that the information in the record is not of legitimate public interest <em>and </em>that the disclosure of the information would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. These factual findings necessarily require an analysis of the facts of each case in which the personal privacy exemption is claimed. We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s finding that the identity of an alleged victim in a sexual harassment complaint and other information related to the investigation are always exempt from disclosure under the act and that the disclosure of this information would always constitute an invasion of the personal privacy of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to its finding that the identity of the sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>harassment complainant involved here and certain other information related to the investigation of her complaint are exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2), except to the extent that we limit the exemptions as discussed in this opinion and indicated in the redacted records filed herewith. We reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the materials that we do not find to be exempt and direct that court to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal as to those materials. We also reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to its finding that the identity of a sexual harassment complainant and other information related to the investigation are always exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2), and we direct the trial court to vacate that part of its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part and, to the extent that the judgment is reversed, the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment consistent with the preceding paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b), formerly \u00a7 1-19 (b), provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in the Freedom of Information Act shall be construed to require disclosure of . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\u201c(2) Personnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Section 1-210 was formerly codified at \u00a7 1-19 until 1999, at which time the provision was transferred.
