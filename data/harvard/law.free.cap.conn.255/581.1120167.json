App. 714, 716, 738 A.2d 668 (1999). The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court; id., 724; and we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal to this court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>251 Conn. 919, 742 A.2d 359 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We granted certification limited to the following three issues: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the behavior of [the] police officers was irrelevant to a prosecution under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c, and therefore preclusion of evidence of same did not violate the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights?\u201d; (2) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) does not permit a trial court to alter the language pertaining to the defendant\u2019s \u2018failure to testify\u2019 despite a specific request by the defendant not to use that phrase because of its negative connotation?\u201d; and (3) \u201cIf the answer to question two is yes, should this court exercise its supervisory authority to substitute neutral language under General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) when requested by the defendant?\u201d Id. We answer the first question in the negative, and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 9 a.m. on July 21, 1995, three Southington police officers, Detective Craig Fournier, Detective-Sergeant William Ludecke, and Officer John Olson, arrived at the Casanova residence to execute an arrest warrant for the defendant\u2019s younger brother, a juvenile. Soon thereafter, Ludecke requested that Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>cer Lewis Palmieri come to the residence to aid the officers in serving the arrest warrant on the defendant\u2019s younger brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">When Palmieri arrived, he followed Fournier to the front door of the Casanova residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both men were dressed in plainclothes with their badges, sidearms and handcuffs visibly mounted on their belts. Palmieri stood on the concrete steps to the house and held the exterior screen door open as Fournier stood in the doorway and spoke with the defendant\u2019s father, John Casanova, Sr. Olson and Ludecke stood behind Palmieri and Fournier.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">With his juvenile son standing behind him, Casanova, Sr., questioned Fournier about the charges pending against his juvenile son and what was going to happen to him. After a few minutes, the juvenile son was released into the officer\u2019s custody. Fournier stepped into the Casanova house .to take custody of the juvenile son and then sent him down the steps into the custody of Ludecke and Olson. Fournier then informed Casanova, Sr., who had remained in the house during the officers\u2019 visit, that he was under arrest for interfering with a police officer. Casanova, Sr., snickered, turned away from the officer, and walked toward the interior of the house. Fournier told Casanova, Sr., to stop. When Casanova, Sr., kept walking toward the rear of the house, Fournier followed him to place him under arrest. Palmieri then proceeded after Fournier and, as he walked toward the rear of the house, the defendant, the teenage son of Casanova, Sr., stepped into Palmieri\u2019s path. Palmieri pushed the defendant aside and warned him not to interfere or he also would be arrested. The officers followed Casanova, Sr., into the kitchen, where a struggle began when the officers attempted to take him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In order to subdue Casanova, Sr., Palmieri discharged two bursts of pepper spray in his direction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant then struck Palmieri on the left side of the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>with a closed fist. Palmieri turned and sprayed a burst of pepper spray at the defendant as he fled from the officer. Palmieri followed the defendant to a bathroom on the second floor of the house. The defendant slammed the bathroom door shut. Palmieri told the defendant he was under arrest and ordered him to exit the bathroom. When the defendant opened the door, Palmieri repeated that the defendant was under arrest and ordered him to he on the floor and put his hands behind his back. The defendant directed an expletive at Palmieri and then lunged toward the officer. Palmieri responded by discharging another burst of pepper spray at the defendant. The defendant again retreated into the bathroom. Palmieri then went downstairs to check on the situation with Casanova, Sr. Soon thereafter, additional police officers responded and eventually arrested the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">As a result of being struck by the defendant, Palmieri received a cut under his left eye that required five sutures to close. Palmieri also had other complications attributable to the defendant\u2019s blow, including dryness of the eye, blurred vision and sinus problems. After the jury found the defendant guilty, he was sentenced to a term of twelve months incarceration and fined. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The defendant first claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the ruling of the trial court, <em>Norko, J., </em>prohibiting the defendant from cross-examining the police officers concerning their entry into the Casanova <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>home. The evidence regarding the police officers\u2019 entry into the home had been the subject of a pretrial motion to dismiss heard by the court, <em>Barry, J. </em>Specifically, the defendant claims that Judge Norko, on the basis of the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss by Judge Barry, improperly excluded evidence that pertained to the entry of the two police officers into the defendant\u2019s residence prior to their scuffle with the defendant. The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s ruling prevented him from cross-examining the police officers regarding an element of the charge against him and thereby denied him his state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination of adverse witnesses, and his right to present a defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The following procedural history is relevant to this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the state\u2019s information on the ground, inter alia, that the officers\u2019 entry into the Casanova home had been unlawful, and that the subsequent arrest of the defendant had been unjustified. Specifically, the defendant claimed that under <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>191 Conn. 433, 440-42, 465 A.2d 323 (1983), he had the common-law privilege to resist the officers because they had unlawfully entered the Casanova residence without a warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Barry denied the motion, concluding: \u201c[The defendant did not sustain] his burden of proof that the entry of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>into his home [had been] unlawful or that the evidence presented [by the state was] insufficient to justify the bringing or continuing of the information or placing him on trial. The more credible evidence supports the likelihood that [the defendant] struck Officer Palmieri near the left eye while he was in the performance of his duty. Such conduct is not considered reasonable resistance even if the police entry was unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">At trial before Judge Norko, the defendant attempted to cross-examine Palmieri about the Southington police department\u2019s general procedures for warrantless arrests within a private residence. The state objected on the ground that the circumstances that had surrounded the arrest of Casanova, Sr., were irrelevant and that the pertinent issues were whether the defendant had assaulted Palmieri, whether Palmieri had been reasonably identifiable as a peace officer, and whether Palmieri had been performing his duties when the defendant assaulted him. Furthermore, the state argued, the evidence concerning the legality of the police officers\u2019 entry into the Casanova home had been excluded previously when Judge Barry denied the defendant\u2019s <em>Gallagher </em>claim in his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The defendant argued that the legality of Palmieri and Fournier\u2019s entry was essential for the jury\u2019s determination of whether the officers actually had acted within the bounds of their official duties. Additionally, the defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s pretrial denial of his motion to dismiss did not invoke the doctrines of collateral estoppel, res judicata, or the law of the case. Thus, the defendant argued, the trial court\u2019s pretrial decision did not preclude him from proffering to the jury the same evidence that he had offered during the pretrial hearing. On the basis of irrelevancy and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>primarily, on the law of the case doctrine,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial court agreed with the state and excluded all evidence concerning the propriety of Palmieri and Fournier\u2019s entry into the Casanova home.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The following day, the defendant requested that the court reconsider its ruling with regard to the evidence surrounding the legality of the officers\u2019 entry into the Casanova residence. The defendant argued that whether the police officers had entered the Casanova residence in the performance of their duties was an element of the crime charged against the defendant and a question of fact for the jury. The defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s ruling from the previous day therefore had prevented him from cross-examining the officers with regard to this element of \u00a7 53a-167c. The defendant also reasserted his claim that Judge Barry\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss based on <em>Gallagher </em>did not preclude the defendant from offering to the jury the same evidence that he had offered during the pretrial motion, which had pertained to the legality of the officers\u2019 entry. Thus, the defendant argued, the trial court\u2019s ruling violated his state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial and to a jury trial. Judge Norko noted the defendant\u2019s argument for the record, but declined to reconsider his previous ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">After the state presented its case-in-chief, the defense made a motion for acquittal, again arguing the importance of exploring the officers\u2019 entry into the defendant\u2019s home. This time, the defendant directed the trial court\u2019s attention to <em>State </em>v. <em>Privilera, </em>1 Conn. App. 709, 476 A.2d 605 (1984), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Biller, </em>5 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>616, 501 A.2d 1218 (1985), cert. denied, 199 Conn. 803, 506 A.2d 146, cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1005, 106 S. Ct. 3296, 92 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1986), and clarified his previous arguments, stating: \u201cOne of [the] elements [of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1)] is that [a] peace officer [must] be performing his duty at the time the alleged offense occurred. ... I have attempted [repeatedly] to have the court allow the defendant to put on evidence that the entry into the Casanova household was not in the performance of [the officers\u2019] duties and the officers . . . entered the household, not in a good faith entrance . . . [but in] a frolic .... [When they entered the house], the officers were no longer performing their duty or acting in the performance of their duties. They were in the household . . . illegally, and could not have had a good faith basis to prove otherwise. . . . The evidence would have shown that [the entry] was either a frolic or [due to the] personal intent of the officers involved [that led them] to pursue Mr. Casanova, Sr., into the household, which led them into what they claimed to be direct contact with [the defendant].\u201d The trial court denied the motion for acquittal. The Appellate Court subsequently affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude cross-examination concerning the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>cers\u2019 entry into the defendant\u2019s home prevented him from presenting relevant evidence to the jury to show that the officers were engaged in a personal \u201cfrolic\u201d and were not acting in good faith performance of their duties. Thus, the defendant claims that the trial court denied him his constitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense under the sixth<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and fourteenth <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We will set aside a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of its discretion. <em>State v. Provost, </em>251 Conn. 252, 257, 741 A.2d295 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 822, 121 S. Ct. 65, 148 L. Ed. 2d 30 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 283, 533 A.2d 553 (1987). The trial court has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination and \u201c[ejvery reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 746-47, 657 A.2d 611 (1995). \u201cTo establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 426, 493 A.2d 223 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 305, 664 A.2d 743 (1995). \u201cThe proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant.\u201d (Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>nal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 747. When the trial court excludes defense evidence that provides the defendant with a basis for cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses, however, such exclusion may give rise to a claim of denial of the right to confrontation and to present a defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 258, 745 A.2d 800 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 249, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-167c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault of a peace officer . . . when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer . . . from performing his duty, and while such peace officer ... is acting in the performance of his duties, (1) he causes physical injury to such peace officer . . . .\u2019\u2019To prove aviolation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1), the state must establish: \u201c(1) [I]ntent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer from performing his duties; (2) the infliction of physical injury to the peace officer; and (3) the victim must be a peace officer.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>30 Conn. App. 606, 610 n.4, 621 A.2d 755 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court, by excluding cross-examination concerning the officers\u2019 entry into the Casanova home, denied him the opportunity to present evidence relevant to part of the first element delineated previously, namely, whether Palmieri had been performing his duties when he was struck by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">\u201c[A] police officer has the duty to enforce the laws and to preserve the peace. Whether he is acting in the performance of his duty . . . must be determined in the light of that purpose and duty. If he is acting under a good faith belief that he is carrying out that duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and if his actions are reasonably designed to that end, he is acting in the performance of his duties. . . . Although from time to time a police officer may have a duty to make an arrest, his duties are not coextensive with his power to arrest. [His] official duties may cover many functions which have nothing whatever to do with making arrests. . . . The phrase in the performance of his official duties means that the police officer is simply acting within the scope of what [he] is employed to do. The test is whether the [police officer] is acting within that compass or is engaging in a personal frolic of his own. . . . These are factual questions for the jury to determine on the basis of all the circumstances of the case and under appropriate instructions from the court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Privitera, </em>supra, 1 Conn. App. 722; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoy, </em>137 F.3d 726, 729 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 850, 119 S. Ct. 124, 142 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1998); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>465 F.2d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Michalek, </em>464 F.2d 442, 443 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Heliczer, </em>373 F.2d 241, 245 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 917, 87 S. Ct. 2133, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1359 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torwich, </em>38 Conn. App. 306, 315-16, 661 A.2d 113, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 905, 665 A.2d 906 (1995). Although the court in <em>Privitera </em>used the preceding language with regard to its discussion of the correlation between General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-23 and 53a-167a (a), the analysis is also applicable to the same language in \u00a7 53a-167c, \u201cin the performance of his . . . duties . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In the present case, whether Palmieri had entered the Casanova home in the performance of his duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>was part of a required element of the offense charged against the defendant. The state, therefore, had the burden to prove this element beyond a reasonable doubt. By excluding evidence relating to Palmieri\u2019s entrance into the Casanova home, the trial court improperly deprived the defendant of the opportunity to cross-examine him with regard to whether Palmieri, in good faith, had been acting within the scope of his duties. S <em>ee In re Adalbertos., </em>27 Conn. App. 49, 57-59, 604 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1328 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The trial court also incorrectly excluded the evidence based on the law of the case doctrine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That doctrine is inapplicable here because the issue raised by the pretrial motion to dismiss was different from the eviden-tiary issue subsequently presented to the trial court. In his motion to dismiss, the defendant contended that the officers\u2019 entry into his house had been unlawful and his arrest, therefore, had been unjustified. The issue at trial was whether Palmieri had been acting in the performance of his duties, an element of the offense of assault of a peace officer. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly deprived the defendant of the opportunity to cross-examine Palmieri as to whether he was acting in the performance of his duties when he was struck by the defendant, in violation of the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional right to confrontation and his right to present a defense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We next must inquire whether the improper exclusion of this evidence entitles the defendant to a new trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Although the outright denial of a defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine a witness on an element of the charged offense implicates the constitutional protection of the confrontation clause, such a denial is subject to harmless error analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 253; <em>Demers </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 143, 160, 547 A.2d 28 (1988). A new trial is required only if the exclusion of the proffered evidence is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\u201cWhether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The state contends that any error on the part of the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state claims that Palmieri was acting within the scope of his employment because he properly had been dispatched to the Casanova home to assist in the execution of a proper arrest warrant. The state also claims that the defendant aggressively cross-examined the officers regarding inconsistencies between their testimony and police reports. Further, the state claims that the defendant elicited sufficient facts from the officers regarding the circumstances surrounding their entry into the Casanova home that permitted the jury to find that the officers had been engaged in a personal frolic provoked by the snickering of Casanova, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The first part of the state\u2019s analysis is overbroad. If we were to adhere to the state\u2019s test for whether an officer was acting within the scope of his employment, then, every time the police properly dispatched an officer to a scene, all of the officer\u2019s actions thereafter would be considered within the performance of his or her official duties. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s desired line of inquiry was relevant to an element of the offense charged. Although the defendant elicited on cross-examination that the officers entered the defendant\u2019s home once Casanova, Sr., had turned from them and had snickered at them, by excluding cross-examination concerning the officers\u2019 entry, the trial court prevented the defense from presenting evidence to the jury that could have shown that Palmieri had not entered the home in the good faith performance of his duties. This is an essential element of the charged offense, bearing on Palmieri\u2019s motivation behind his entry. In addition, because the defendant chose to exercise his right not to testify or otherwise to present evidence, the testimony of the officers was the only account of the incident heard by the jury. The defendant was clearly prejudiced by the exclusion of this evidence. We, therefore, cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">We emphasize the limits of our holding. We do not hold that, merely because police may have acted ille-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>gaily in making a warrantless arrest, they were not acting within the performance of their duties. That would not be enough, in and of itself, to justify a conclusion that they were engaging in a personal frolic. When, however, as here, the defendant seeks to cross-examine the police regarding the purported illegality of an entry into the home and their motives for engaging in that conduct, in order to undermine the state\u2019s contention that they were acting in the performance of their duties, the defendant must be given reasonable leeway to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The defendant next claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to use substitute language without \u201cnegative connotation\u201d during its instructions to the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s right not to testify. In particular, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by using the language, \u201cfailure to testify,\u201d from \u00a7 54-84 (b),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> instead of more neutral language as he had requested. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Prior to closing arguments, the trial court asked the parties if they had any issues to raise with respect to its proposed charge to the jury. The defendant objected to the court\u2019s use of the language \u201cfailure to testify\u201d to describe the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. The defendant argued that use of the word \u201cfailure\u201d had a negative connotation. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>requested, therefore, that the court substitute neutral language for the statutory language, but did not suggest or request any specific substitute language.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The state responded to the defendant\u2019s request by noting that the language in the corut\u2019s jury charge was the precise language of \u00a7 54-84 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The trial corut overruled the defendant\u2019s objection with regard to the failure to testify language.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On appeal, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion by including the statutory language in its charge. <em>State </em>v.

App. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The defendant claims that the word failure is \u201cintertwined with the concept of deficiency or defeat\u201d and, therefore, suggests that the defendant \u201cdid something wrong by not testifying.\u201d He argues that, because of the word\u2019s correlation with \u201cnegative\u201d words, the court\u2019s use of the word failure with regard to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dant\u2019s decision not to testify in effect countered the protection of his constitutional right not to testify, which prohibits the jury from drawing inferences of guilt from the failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\u201cTo determine whether an error in a [jury] charge constitutes reversible error, the court must consider the whole charge. ... In considering the charge as a whole we eschew critical dissection . . . thereby not passing upon the instructions attacked in artificial isolation from the whole charge. . . . The charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 440-41, 489 A.2d 350 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\u201cA request to charge which is relevant to the issues of [a] case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given. A refusal to charge in the exact words of a request [however] will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>231 Conn. 43, 47, 646 A.2d 835 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1038, 115 S. Ct. 1404, 131 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1995). Thus, when the substance of the requested instructions is fairly and substantially included in the trial court\u2019s jury charge, the trial court may properly refuse to give such instructions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>252 Conn. 533, 562-63, 747 A.2d 487 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>199 Conn. 255, 268-70, 506 A.2d 1041 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 143, 486 A.2d 637 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 26, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Estep, </em>186 Conn. 648, 653, 443 A.2d 483 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Considering the entire charge with respect to the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify; see footnote 19 of this opinion; we conclude that the instruction was neither negative in substance nor improper. The court referred to the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>four different ways. First, the trial court instructed the jury that the defendant had \u201cthe <em>option </em>to testify or not to testify at the trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, the trial court charged the jury that the defendant was \u201cunder <em>no obligation </em>to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Third, the trial court charged the jury that the defendant had \u201ca <em>constitutional right </em>not to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Only in the last sentence of its instruction did the trial court use the arguably negative phrase \u201cfailure to testify.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the charge as a whole, including the affirmative language as emphasized herein, was neutral in substance and appropriately guided the jury to a proper verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We also disagree with the implication in the defendant\u2019s brief that the language in \u00a7 54-84 (b) that provides \u201c[ujnless the accused requests otherwise\u201d means that the trial court <em>must </em>accept the instruction requested by a defendant when he chooses not to testify. More specifically, the statutory language provides that \u201c[u]nless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b). A party always may take exception to the trial court\u2019s jury charge or request that the trial court modify its language. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 42-19 and 42-24. The language \u201cunless the accused requests otherwise,\u201d however, permits the defendant to elect whether the court should give the jury an instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 651, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L.

The trial court properly charged the jury in compliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) by using the exact language from the statute. <em>See State v. Wright, </em>197 Conn. 588, 594, 500 A.2d 547 (1985) (finding trial court\u2019s use of exact language of \u00a7 54-84 [b] proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-167c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault of a peace officer . . . when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer . . . from performing his duty, and while such peace officer ... is acting in the performance of his duties, (1) he causes physical injury to such peace officer . . . .\u201d Section 53a-167c was amended by No. 98-41 of the 1998 Public Acts and by No. 99-26, \u00a7 28, and No. 99-204 of the 1999 Public Acts.

The state maintains that Palmieri first sprayed Casanova, Sr. The defendant argues that Palmieri, without provocation, sprayed him first, which then led to the punch delivered by the defendant to Palmieri. The dispute derives from the following colloquy between Palmieri and the assistant state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cQ. Now you\u2019re in the kitchen, and you observe a struggle. What do you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cA. I assist Detective Fournier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201cQ.

What did you do in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">\u201cA. A struggle started. We were moving around the kitchen.

And what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-16\">\u201cA. The next thing was, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a blur come at me.

Continuing on, that is when I saw Mr. Casanova, Jr., follow through after I was struck.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-19\">It is apparent, based on the entire record, that Palmieri misspoke when he used the word \u201cJr.\u201d in the preceding colloquy. This is evidenced by several of Palmieri\u2019s responses to similar questions posed by the defense. The following exchange between defense counsel and Palmieri is one such example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-20\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t get [Mr. Casanova, Sr.] under control in the kitchen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-21\">\u201cA. No, we didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-22\">\u201cQ. In fact, it was so difficult to get him under control that when Detective Fournier was grabbing ahold of him, you took out your mace or pepper spray to spray two quick bursts at John Casanova, <em>Sr., </em>to try to get him in the face to try to get him under control?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-23\">\u201cA. I tried to spray him\u2014Detective Fournier\u2014I don\u2019t recall having him as you indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-24\">\u201cQ.

On the side of him.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-26\">Additionally, neither party questioned the witnesses on whether Palmieri had sprayed the defendant before being stmck. Further, during closing arguments, both parties recounted that Palmieri had sprayed the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>with pepper spray only <em>after </em>Palmieri had been struck in the face. The lack of response by both parties to Palmieri\u2019s statement during the trial also leads to the conclusion that the disputed statement set forth in the preceding colloquy\u2014Palmieri\u2019s first reference to \u201cJr.\"\u2014is likely a mistake in the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b608-13\"> The Southington police also arrested Casanova, Sr., and charged him with interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> The defendant invoked both the federal constitution and the constitution of Connecticut. \u201cHe [however] has proffered no argument that the rights afforded to him by the federal and the state constitutions are in any way distinguishable with respect to the substantive issue that he has raised.
