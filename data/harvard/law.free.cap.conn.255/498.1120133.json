We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The trial court found the following facts. Andersen, an Illinois limited liability partnership with an office in Connecticut, has extensive experience in developing information computer programs for utility companies. The gas company is a Connecticut public utility that provides local gas distribution to various areas of the state. Finding that its information system, which it developed in 1972 and which was performed manually, was old and outdated, the gas company decided, in 1991, to acquire new computer information systems to manage its financial, accounting and cost control functions. Specifically, it decided that it needed two systems to update its informational systems, the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of which was a customer information system (customer system), which would manage billing, accounts receivable, customer service, credit and collection, marketing and the dispatching of customer service personnel. The second system was a distribution and construction information system (distribution system), which would manage planning, cost estimating and cost analysis relating to the installation of gas mains in the streets served by the gas company. The gas company\u2019s main purpose was to obtain computer software systems that would meet the business requirements of the company. It had assembled a team to search for a system that would meet these requirements of the company. The team considered off-the-shelf, or canned, software, but found that such software could not be modified by the user, and that it would become very expensive to tie into an existing system. Thus, the team decided that it needed a customized information system.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">After reviewing various proposals, the gas company selected Andersen to develop the customer and the distribution systems. In developing the customer system, Andersen modified its Customer 1 software to meet the gas company\u2019s requirements. Approximately 60 percent of its requirements could be met through the use of the Customer 1 software in developing the customer system; the remaining 40 percent was custom developed by Andersen. The custom work included the development of a meter inventory system, the creation of a marketing system to keep track of marketing and sales efforts and to target prospective customers, and the development of a means to integrate an existing computer aided dispatching system with the customer system. In developing the distribution system, Andersen used its core package of software known as Work 1. Work 1 met approximately 85 percent of the gas company\u2019s requirements for the distribution system; the remaining 15 percent was custom developed by Ander<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>sen. The custom work included the development of a system that would automatically schedule maintenance for equipment used in the field, and a means to integrate the distribution system with the customer system. Andersen and the gas company entered into two contracts (gas company contracts), one for each system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both contracts were fixed fee contracts with the fees contingent on the delivery by Andersen of a fully functioning software system in accordance with the agreed upon specifications. The product that resulted from the development of the systems remained the property of Andersen after the fulfillment of the contracts. The gas company received, however, a perpetual, nonexclusive license to use and modify the software. Andersen\u2019s fees under the gas company contracts were $12,979,000. Andersen collected a sales and use tax from the gas company with respect to the two contracts and remitted the payments to the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In 1988, the electric company had no unified system for accounting, budgeting and work management functions, and had eleven informational systems in operation, which were inadequate. The electric company explored the use of canned software. Some software was developed in-house where commercial software was not available. The electric company established a task force to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate its systems and make recommendations for improvement. The goal of the task force was to develop a system that would permit the electric company to monitor and budget for costs on a detailed level so that costs could be controlled more effectively. The task force recommended replacing existing systems with a management information and budgeting system (management system), which could only be done with the use of custom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>software because the canned software met only 20 to 25 percent of the electric company\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Andersen and the electric company entered into a contract (electric company contract), and used a team approach to create the software for the management system. The electric company provided the space and 50 percent of the staffing for the project. Andersen provided consulting services for architecture and engineering in the development and construction of the software. The management system began with a core package of canned software known as the Dunn and Bradstreet (McCormack and Dodge) Series M General Ledger software package, which provided for 20 to 25 percent of the management system\u2019s functional requirements. The remaining 75 to 80 percent was custom developed by a joint team of Andersen\u2019s and the electric company\u2019s personnel. Andersen\u2019s fees under the electric company contract were $15,826,601. Upon delivery, Andersen transferred to the electric company all intangible rights to the management system software, but retained rights to certain tools used in the development of the software.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">From June 1, 1990, to October 31, 1993, the gas company and the electric company made payments to Andersen pursuant to the contracts previously described. Andersen collected sales and use taxes from both companies with respect to those payments. After remitting the sales and use taxes imposed on the contracts in question, Andersen requested a refund from the commissioner in the amount of $1,438,828\u2014$525,522 attributable to the gas company contracts and $913,306 attributable to the electric company contract\u2014based upon amounts charged in connection with the development, license and sale of the custom software. The commissioner granted Andersen a refund of $76,500 for payments that Andersen had received from the gas company for license fees. The commissioner denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Andersen\u2019s claim for the balance of the refund claimed with respect to the gas company contracts and for the entire refund claim with respect to the electric company contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Andersen appealed from the denials of the commissioner to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-422.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After a trial, the trial court found that the true object of the contracts was \u201cto provide computer software programs that would meet [the] business needs [of the gas company and the electric company].\u201d The court also stated that the true object was \u201cthe creation of informational systems for both [companies], not the creation of the various elements necessary to reach the final product.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthese software programs, and the labor used to produce these programs, are not taxable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the sales or use tax statutes.\u201d The trial court reasoned, on the basis of its understanding of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 644-46, 563 A.2d 688 (1989), that \u201call computer software is nontaxable as intangible property regardless [of] whether the software is \u2018off the shelf or custom designed.\u201d Accordingly, the court rendered judgment for Andersen, ordering the commissioner to refund to Andersen $1,362,328, with interest. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Before reaching the commissioner\u2019s claims, we briefly address the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. Practice Book [\u00a7 60-5, formerly \u00a7 4061]; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>Pan-dolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>SLI International Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>236 Conn. 156, 163, 671 A.2d 813 (1996). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s ruling from the premise that, when the issue is the imposition of a tax, rather than a claimed right to an exemption or a deduction, the governing authorities must be strictly construed against the commissioner and in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>[supra, 689]; <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 588, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 420-23, 521 A.2d 569 (1987).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Hartford Parkview Associates Ltd.

In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>[supra, 220 Conn. 755-56].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bortner v. Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 258-59, 736 A.2d 104 (1999).

Specifically, the commissioner claims that the payments at issue were taxable as computer services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-408 (2)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 12-407 (2) (i) (A),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u00a7 12-426-27<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The commissioner also contends that the trial court: (1) failed to apply the definition of \u201ccomputer services\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-426-27 of the regulations; and (2) misinterpreted and misapplied this court\u2019s decision in <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 639. The commissioner further contends that his decision that the services at issue are taxable computer services has been ratified by recent legislation, namely, Public Acts 2000, No. 00-174, \u00a7\u00a7 71, 74 (P.A. 00-174). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>We agree. We base our conclusion on the necessarily retroactive application of P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The principles by which we determine the effect of a subsequent statutory amendment on earlier legislation are well established. \u201cWe recognize the usual presumption that, in enacting a statute, the legislature intended a change in existing law. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>193 Conn. 506, 513, 479 A.2d 208 (1984); <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 364 n.12, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); 1A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 22.30. This presumption, however, like any other, may be rebutted by contrary evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>legislative intent in the particular case. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 513-14.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 277, 528 A.2d 760 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u201cIn determining the intended effect of a later enactment on earlier legislation, two questions must be asked. \u2018First, was the act intended to <em>clarify </em>existing law or to <em>change </em>it? Second, if the act was intended to make a change, was the change intended to operate retroactively?\u2019 . . . <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 540, 489 A.2d 363 (1985).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cWhether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. See, e.g., [id., 284], In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or coiporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of <em>presumed </em>legislative intent that statutes affecting <em>substantive </em>rights shall apply prospectively only. <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 316, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, may be rebutted when the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 372, 678 A.2d 462 (1996); accord <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 483-84, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995); <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175, 588 A.2d 189 (1991). Where an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect. . . . <em>Toise </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>243 Conn. 623, 628, 707 A.2d 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>(1998). We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative history to ascertain whether the legislature intended that the amendment be given retrospective effect. See, <em>e.g., Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 290, 679 A.2d 925 (1996); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 787, 657 A.2d 616 (1995).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>245 Conn. 710, 718-19, 714 A.2d 1209 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">A brief review of the relevant statutory and regulatory framework is necessary to our resolution of the present case. Although the question of whether the payments at issue are subject to sales and use taxes requires our analysis of several statutory and regulatory provisions, our starting point is our sales tax statute, \u00a7 12-408. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-408 (l)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>relevant part: \u201cFor the privilege of making any sales as defined in subsection (2) of section 12-407, at retail, in this state for a consideration, a tax is hereby imposed on all retailers at the rate of six per cent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail or from the rendering of any services constituting a sale in accordance with subdivision (i) of subsection (2) of section 12-407 . . . .\u201d Section 12-408 (1) expressly provides that the services upon which it imposes a sales tax are those \u201cservices constituting a sale in accordance with subdivision (i) of subsection (2) of section 12-407 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We therefore turn to \u00a7 12-407 (2), which provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 mean and include . . . (i) the rendering of certain services for a consideration, exclusive of such services rendered by an employee for his employer, as follows: (A) <em>Computer and data processing services, </em>including but not limited to, time . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although no more expansive definition of \u201c[c]omputer and data processing services\u201d was provided by the 1993 revision of the General Statutes, the regulations provided such a definition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Section 12-426-27 (a) of the regulations provides that the rendering of the services enumerated in \u00a7 12-426-27 (b) for a consideration shall be a sale and subject to the sales tax. Subsection (b) (1) of \u00a7 12-426-27 includes, as one of the enumerated services, \u201c[c]om-puter and data processing services.\u201d Subsection (b) (1) of \u00a7 12-426-27 defines such services to \u201cmean and include providing computer time, storing and filing of information, retrieving or providing access to information, designing, implementing or converting systems<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> providing consulting services, and conducting feasibility studies. The transfer of dominion and control of computer hardware and software for a consideration does not come within the purview of this section, since such transfer shall constitute a lease or rental of tangible personal property and be subject to tax under Section 12-426-25.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The legislature recently amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 12-407 (2) by P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71. Section 71 of P.A. 00-174 provides in relevant part: \u201cSubsection (2) of section 12-407 of the general statutes, as amended by section 10 of public act 99-173, section 10 of public act 99-285 and section 1 of this act, is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof: (2) \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 mean and include . . . (i) the rendering of certain services for a consideration, exclusive of such services rendered by an employee for his employer, as follows: (A) <em>Computer and data processing services, including but not limited to, time, programming, code writing, modification of existing programs, feasibility studies and installation and implementation of software programs and systems even where such services are rendered in connection with the development, creation or production of canned or custom software or the license of custom software, </em>and exclusive of services rendered in connection with the creation, development hosting or maintenance of all or part of a web site which is part of the graphical, hypertext portion of the Internet, commonly referred to as the World-Wide Web . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As stated previously, whether P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71, should be given retroactive or prospective effect depends on the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute. The language of P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 74, provides a strong indication that the legislature intended \u00a7 71 of the act to clarify \u00a7 12-407 (2), and therefore necessarily to apply retrospectively. Section 74 of P.A. 00-174 provides: \u201cThe intent of subsections (2), (13), (31) and (32) of section 12-407 of the general statutes, as amended by sections 71 to 73, inclusive, of this act is <em>to clarify that current law </em>subjects the sale of canned software to sales and use taxes as a sale of tangible personal property and <em>subjects the sale of computer and data processing services, as defined in said sections, to sales and use </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>taxes as a sale of services constituting a sale in accordance with subsection (2) of section 12-407 of the general </em>statutes, <em>as amended by this act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The second clause of \u00a7 74 of P.A. 00-174 makes clear that the intent of the amended \u00a7 12-407 (2) is to clarify that current law subjects the sale of computer and data processing services, \u201cas defined in said sections,\u201d namely, \u00a7 12-407 (2) as amended, to sales and use taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The legislative history also contains compelling indi-cia that the legislature intended to clarify, rather than to change, the universe of computer services that are subject to the sales tax. We note in particular that the <em>only </em>statements made in the legislative history of P.A. 00-174 with respect to computer and data processing services are those that emphasize its clarifying nature. In explaining Substitute Senate Bill No. 525, the bill eventually enacted as P.A. 00-174, Senator Martin M. Looney stated: \u201c[T]here is a section of the bill that <em>clarifies </em>the definition of . . . computer [and] data processing services . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 43 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 2000 Sess., p. 2561. Senator William H. Nickerson also stated: \u201cThis [bill] has been carefully reviewed by caucus leaders, [the office of policy and management] and myself and [I] concur in Senator Looney\u2019s comments that by and large it is a <em>technical </em>implementation of necessary changes to the tax laws with <em>no major substantive problems. No major substantive initiatives init.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 2563. During the legislative debate in the House of Representatives, Representative Richard O. Belden stated: \u201cWe <em>clarify </em>the definition of . . . computer [and] data processing services.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 43 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 2000 Sess., p. 6187.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We conclude, on the basis of our analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and the legislative history, that P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71, was intended to clarify the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ing of \u00a7 12-407 (2), namely, that the term computer services encompasses, among other things, the development, creation and production of software. In light of our conclusion that P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71, was intended to clarify, rather than to change, existing law, we do not reach the second question in retroactivity analysis, namely, whether, under the circumstance where the legislature intended a <em>change </em>to existing law, it intended the change to have retroactive effect. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 284; see also <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 540-41. \u201cWhere an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We must therefore determine whether the services at issue in the present case fall within the enumerated class of computer and data processing services. We conclude that the definition of computer and data processing services encompasses the rendered services at issue in this case. Section 12-407 (2), as amended by P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71, makes clear that the term \u201c[c]omputer and data processing services\u201d includes, but is not limited to \u201ctime, programming, code writing, modification of existing programs, feasibility studies and installation and implementation of software programs and systems even where such services are rendered in connection with the development, creation or production of canned or custom software or the license of custom software . . . .\u2019\u2019In the present case, the trial court found that \u201cthe \u2018true object\u2019 of the contracts entered into with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Andersen by [the gas company] and [the electric company] was to provide computer software programs that would meet their business needs. Andersen did not undertake to provide [the gas company] and [the electric company] with services that would meet their objective, but rather developed software programs which in and of themselves would provide [the gas company] and [the electric company] with the informational systems to allow them to operate efficiently and cost-effectively now and into the immediate future.\u201d The trial court further stated that \u201cthe object of the underlying transaction in this case was the creation of informational systems for both [the gas company] and [the electric company], not the creation of the various elements necessary to reach the final product.\u201d These findings bring the services rendered by Andersen within the clarified, expansive definition of \u201ccomputer and data processing services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Andersen argues that P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71, does not apply to the present case because this case does not involve an \u201copen tax [period].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, Andersen argues that its refund claim does not involve an open tax period because it involves the years 1991 through 1993, and the statute of limitations, with respect to the making of a refund claim by a taxpayer or the issuance of an assessment by the commissioner, generally is three years, unless that period is extended. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 12-425 (1), as amended by Public Acts 1999, No. 99-48, \u00a7 9;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> General Statutes (Rev. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>1999) \u00a7 12-415 (f) and (g), as amended by Public Acts 1999, No. 99-48, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree. Rather, we agree with the commissioner that open tax period includes any tax period for which the tax liability in question is still in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">As previously explained, the relevant statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that the legislature intended \u00a7 71 of P.A. 00-174 to be clarifying legislation. Although the term \u201copen tax period\u201d has been neither defined in the General Statutes nor construed by this court, it would be contrary to common sense to construe open tax period in such a manner as to exclude situations in which tax liability for a certain tax period is still in controversy. Such a construction would necessarily result in the bizarre conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the <em>clarifying </em>legislation in this case, which by its language applies to \u201call open tax periods,\u201d is inapplicable to a tax period for which tax liability is still in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Andersen also argues that the legislature\u2019s statement of intent, articulated in \u00a7 74 of P.A. 00-174, is clear only as to the taxation of canned software. In this connection, Andersen argues that, with respect to the second clause of \u00a7 74, the legislature simply made a circular statement, namely, that computer and data processing services are taxable as computer and data processing services. This argument, however, ignores the careful analysis of the statutory language and legislative history articulated previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Andersen further contends that: (1) if the legislature had intended to overrule the trial court decision in the present case, it simply could have stated that the services used to create custom software are taxable as computer and data processing services <em>regardless of the true object of the taxpayer, </em>and (2) the legislature left intact the so-called true object test. Our conclusion, however, that P.A. 00-174, \u00a7 71, subjects the services used to create custom software to sales and use taxes, is not inconsistent with our prior applications of the true object test. We have never applied the true object test, a judge-made rule, so as to exclude from the purview of a statute or regulation a service that, upon applying proper principles of statutory and regulatory construction and absent a finding that the service was merely incidental to the transaction, would otherwise fall under the relevant statute or regulation. Instead, we have applied the so-called true object test in generally two contexts: (1) where what would otherwise bring the transaction under the purview of the relevant taxing statute is merely incidental to the objective of the transaction; see, e.g., <em>Hartford Parkview Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 252-53; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Dine Out Tonight Club </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue Services, </em>210 Conn. 567, 572, 556 A.2d 580 (1989); <em>International Business Machines Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 132, 355 A.2d 236 (1974); and (2) where the applicability of the sales tax depends on the purpose of the sale, which is necessarily a question of intent. See, e.g., <em>American Totalisator Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>210 Conn. 401, 406, 555 A.2d 414 (1989); <em>United Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>145 Conn. 176, 185, 140 A.2d 486 (1958); <em>United Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>141 Conn. 530, 537-38, 107 A.2d 398 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Andersen also relies on <em>Hartford Parkview Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 248, in which we concluded that a hotel\u2019s purchase of reservation services was not subject to the sales tax as \u201ccomputer and data processing services\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (A). In <em>Hartford Parkview Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>the trial court had found that \u201c \u2018[t]he essence of [the reservations] services is obtaining and informing the [t]axpayer of reservations [that the service] has made for the [h]otel.\u2019 \u201d Id., 249. The trial court had concluded that, \u201c[b]ecause the use of a computer to communicate this information was merely incidental to this objective,\u201d those services were not taxable as computer and data processing services. Id., 252-53. Accordingly, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion, reasoning that a contrary conclusion would impose tax liability on any computer use under the guise of computer services. Id., 251-53. That conclusion does not compel a contrary conclusion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Andersen, as did the trial court, also improperly relies on <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 639, and misapplies the principles represented therein. Instead, we conclude that the holding <em>in Northeast Datacom, Inc., </em>is not so broad as to apply to the issue in the present case. In <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc., </em>software owned by the named plaintiff, which included canned software that it had purchased, software custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>mized by outside contractors, and custom software that it had developed, had been assessed as tangible personal property for municipal taxation purposes. Id., 641-42. We concluded that the \u201cphysical devices are only the most tangential incidents of a computer program and the fact that tangible property is used to store or transmit the software\u2019s binary instructions does not change the character of what is fundamentally a classic form of intellectual property.\u201d Id., 644. We further concluded that the taxation of the software at issue, which was primarily custom software, as tangible personal property was improper because it impermissibly linked the incidents of the intellectual, intangible component of the software, namely, \u201cthe right to produce and sell more copies, the right to change the underlying work, the right to license its use to others and the right to transfer the copyright itself,\u201d to \u201cthe tangible medium in which the software is stored and transmitted.\u201d Id., 646. Simply put, what is at issue in the present case, namely, whether the services provided to develop, create or produce software are taxable as computer services, was not at issue in <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Finally, we conclude that a new trial, as opposed to a reversal and directed judgment for the commissioner, is necessary. In the initial phase of Andersen\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court, the trial court was asked jointly by the parties to bifurcate the appeal into two hearings. The purpose of the first hearing was to address whether the payments made to Andersen were: (1) fully nontaxable as a license or purchase of intangible custom software; (2) fully taxable as computer and data processing services; or (3) a combination of nontaxable and taxable components. The parties further requested, and the trial court agreed, that if the court found that the payments involved both nontaxable and taxable components, a further proceeding be held to consider the proper alio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>cation of fees charged by Andersen to the gas company and the electric company between the nontaxable and taxable components. Accordingly, the parties did not present evidence as to the allocation issue. Therefore, in view of our conclusion that computer and data processing services encompasses the development, creation or production of software, the parties shall have an opportunity to present evidence as to the proper allocation, if any, of fees charged by Andersen between the transfer of intangible rights and the services involved in developing, creating or producing the software.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> With respect to whether the services at issue were subject to the sales and use tax, the parties dispute only whether the services were computer and data processing services. We, therefore, limit our analysis accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-407 (2) provides: \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and
