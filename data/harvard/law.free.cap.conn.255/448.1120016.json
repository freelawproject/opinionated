Corp., </em>315 U.S. 447, 62 S. Ct. 676, 86 L. Ed. 956 (1942) <em>(D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine), did not apply to the defendants Carole N. M\u00e1rchese and Anthony J. M\u00e1rchese<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to bar their defenses of setoff and payment of a mortgage note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>issued by them to a savings and loan association that later had been declared insolvent. The plaintiff, OCI Mortgage Corporation (OCI), had acquired the mortgage note after the savings and loan association\u2019s failure, and initiated this foreclosure action on the defendants\u2019 property. The Appellate Court concluded that, because the defendants, pursuant to a subsequent debenture agreement, had loaned the savings and loan association substantially more than the original mortgage note, and because the savings and loan association had defaulted on the interest payments under the debenture, which, subsequent to the debenture, had been tied to the mortgage payments, the defendants had executed a valid setoff prior to the savings and loan association\u2019s insolvency. <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>56 Conn. App. 668, 682, 745 A.2d 819 (2000). We conclude that no setoff occurred in this case prior to the savings and loan association\u2019s insolvency and that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) applies to bar that defense. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court reveals the following facts. On September 13, 1985, the defendants \u201cexecuted a promissory note in the amount of $220,000, payable to Community Federal Savings and Loan Association [association], and secured by a mortgage on property that the defendants owned in Southport. While the note was still outstanding, the defendant Carole N. M\u00e1rchese lent [the association] $900,000 pursuant to a subordinated debenture agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, [the defendant] Carole N. M\u00e1rchese and [the association] agreed that the defendants\u2019 mortgage note would be paid by applying [the association\u2019s] interest payments on the debenture to the defendants\u2019 monthly mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In October, 1989, [the association] defaulted on its interest payments.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u201cThe defendants mailed a letter to [the association] on November 14, 1989, giving written notice pursuant to \u00a7 10.01 of the [subordinated debenture] agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letter stated that if the default was not cured [within the fifteen day grace period provided in the agreement], the defendants \u2018will exercise all rights available to them not only under Section 10.02 of the foregoing Subordinated Debenture Agreement, but also under statutory and common law.\u2019 No further letter or notification followed before [the association\u2019s] demise.\u201d Id., 676 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On December 7, 1989, the association \u201cwas declared insolvent and the Resolution Trust Corporation [Resolution Trust] was appointed as its receiver in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>[Resolution Trust] assigned the defendants\u2019 mortgage and loan documents to Fairfield Affiliates, the original plaintiff [in this action], Fairfield Affiliates then assigned the defendants\u2019 note and mortgage to [OCI] and OCI was substituted as the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u201cThe trial court referred the case to an attorney trial referee [who heard testimony on June 21, 1996 and accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts and exhibits]. After the trial concluded, the attorney trial referee filed her report, in which she recommended that judgment enter in favor of the defendants. Specifically, the attorney trial referee found that [Resolution Trust] knew about the agreements between [the association] and the defendants, and that [a]ll subsequent assignees of the [defendants\u2019] mortgage note . . . including the plaintiff, OCI, accepted assignment of the note with notice of the $900,000 debt owed to the defendants, as well as the defendants\u2019 claim of set-off and payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201c[OCI] moved to correct various portions of the attorney trial referee\u2019s report. The attorney trial referee, however, denied the majority of [OCI\u2019s] requests. [OCI] then filed exceptions to the attorney trial referee\u2019s report, as well as an objection to the acceptance of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u201cThe trial court sustained [OCI\u2019s] objection to the acceptance of the attorney trial referee\u2019s report. The [trial] court ruled that, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e), [Resolution Trust] is entitled to the same protection as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). According to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e), [n]o agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it . . .as receiver of any depository institution, shall be valid against the [FDIC] unless such agreement . . . [is] executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with acquisition of the asset by the depository institution. The [trial] court concluded that because the execution of the defendants\u2019 mortgage and the execution of the subordinated debenture agreement were not contemporaneous, the subordinated debenture agreement was not valid against [Resolution Trust], and, therefore, it was not valid against [Resolution Trust\u2019s] assignees. The trial court remanded the case to the attorney trial referee, directing the referee to proceed in a manner not inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 670-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendants appealed from that decision to the Appellate Court, which dismissed the appeal, concluding that, because the trial court had sustained the objection to the attorney trial referee\u2019s report and ordered that the case \u201c \u2018proceed in a manner not inconsistent with\u2019 \u201d that determination, no appealable final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>had been rendered. <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. Marchese, 48 Conn. App. 750, 752-54, 712 A.2d 449 (1998). Thereafter, the parties entered into a stipulation in order to obtain a final judgment from which the defendants properly could appeal, and, in accordance with that stipulation, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendants then appealed from that judgment to the Appellate Court. See <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The Appellate Court determined that the balance of the mortgage note had been set off against the subordinated debenture by operation of law and that, therefore, no agreement existed as a predicate to the application of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e). Id., 679. Similarly, the Appellate Court concluded that the setoff had extinguished the mortgage note, thereby eliminating it as an asset of the association, before the association had been declared insolvent. Id. In addition, the court determined that the mortgage note and the debenture had been \u201csufficiently bound together to constitute a bilateral agreement for purposes of avoiding [12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) and] the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine.\u201d Id., 682. Finally, citing equitable considerations, the court concluded that allowing OCI to foreclose on the mortgage when the defendants had been owed far more than the balance due on the note by OCI\u2019s predecessor in interest would \u201c[shock] the judicial conscience.\u201d Id., 683. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of strict foreclosure and remanded the case with direction to render judgment for the defendants. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We granted OCI\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) and the doctrine of <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>[supra, 315 U.S. 447], did not apply to the defendants so as to bar their defenses of setoff and payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>mortgage note?\u201d <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>253 Conn. 903, 753 A.2d 937 (2000). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">This case has its origins in the widespread failure of banks and savings and loan associations during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. The federal government, as the insurer of these institutions through the FDIC and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Coiporation and its successor, Resolution Trust; see footnote 6 of this opinion; stepped in to bail out the vast majority of these failed institutions. See 1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience 1980-1994 (1998) pp. 4\u20145 (Managing the Crisis) (noting that at height of banking crisis between 1988 and 1992, there was average of one federally insured bank or savings and loan association failure per day). The FDIC and Resolution Trust successfully controlled, liquidated and resolved literally thousands of federally insured banks and savings and loan associations and, while avoiding any major disruptions, managed to stabilize the nation\u2019s banking system. Id., pp. 4, 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u201cThe Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 . . . gives the receivers of failed savings and loan institutions wide-ranging powers to consolidate and liquidate those institutions.\u201d <em>Nashville Lodging Co. </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., </em>59 F.3d 236, 241 (D.C. Cir. 1995). As the receiver of a failed savings and loan association, Resolution Trust attempts to maximize the return for its assets, often selling them as quickly as possible for the highest available price. See <em>Suffield Bank </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>228 Conn. 766, 778, 639 A.2d 1033 (1994) (discussing FDIC\u2019s role as receiver of failed bank); see also 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 (d) (13) (E); Managing the Crisis, supra, p. 8; 11 Am. Jur. 2d 181, Banks and Financial Institutions \u00a7 1062 (1997). One significant weapon in Resolution Trust\u2019s arsenal for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>achieving its objectives is the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine, codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e). Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1823 (e) in 1950, <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 315 U.S. 447, was the leading case in this field, holding that certain side agreements that would have the effect of deceiving bank examiners in reviewing a failed institution\u2019s records could not be the basis of a defense against the FDIC. <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>484 U.S. 86, 92, 108 S. Ct. 396, 98 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co., </em>a securities dealer had sold bonds to a bank and later defaulted on those bonds. See <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 315 U.S. 454. In order to accommodate the bank and allow it to avoid showing the defaulted bonds on its books, the securities dealer gave the bank promissory notes with a separate understanding that they would never be repaid. Id. The parties had included a written receipt evidencing their agreement that the notes would not be called for payment. Id. The FDIC subsequently acquired one of the notes as collateral for a loan that it had issued to the failing bank and attempted to collect from the securities dealer. Id., 453-54. In rejecting the securities dealer\u2019s defense of lack of consideration for the note, the United States Supreme Court held that, because the securities dealer had lent itself to a scheme to mislead the FDIC, it could not assert that defense to deny liability on the note. Id., 460. The court reasoned that, \u201cone who gives such a note to a bank with a secret agreement that it will not be enforced must be presumed to know that it will \u2022 conceal the truth from the vigilant eyes of the bank examiners.\u201d Id. Given the federal policy of protecting the FDIC from misrepresentations relating to the records of banks that it insures, the court stated that \u201c[t]he test is whether the note was designed to deceive the creditors or the public authority or would tend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>have that effect.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Duraflex Sales &amp; Service Corp. </em>v. <em>W.H.E. Mechanical Contractors, </em>110 F.3d 927, 932 (2d Cir. 1997) (\u201c[p]ut simply, the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine precludes obligors from asserting side deals or secret agreements which may mislead bank examiners against [Resolution Trust]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Title 12 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1823 (e), expanded the common-law <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine and \u201cCongress opted for the certainty of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1823 (e).\u201d <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 484 U.S. 95; see also <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bank of Virden, </em>893 F.2d 139, 143 (7th Cir. 1990) (noting that \u00a7 1823 [e] gives \u201cstatutory backing to the holding of <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme [&amp; Co.] </em>that oral side agreements do not bind the FDIC\u201d or Resolution Trust); <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Hutcheson, </em>674 F.2d 862, 872 n.14 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 826, 103 S. Ct. 60, 74 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1982) (concluding that \u00a7 1823 [e], as Congress\u2019 response to holding in <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>represents broadening protection for FDIC founded on federal policies of protecting banking system).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u201cOne purpose of \u00a7 1823 (e) is to allow federal and state bank examiners to rely on a bank\u2019s records in evaluating the worth of the bank\u2019s assets.\u201d <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 484 U.S. 91. While examining an institution\u2019s records in conjunction with a liquidation of its assets, or other means of handling the insolvency,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the FDIC and Resolution Trust must move \u201cwith great speed, usually overnight, in order to preserve the going concern value of the failed bank and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>avoid an interruption in banking services.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also <em>Volges </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., </em>32 F.3d 50, 52 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1162, 115 S. Ct. 2618, 132 L. Ed. 2d 860 (1995) (\u201c[o]ne of [Resolution Trust\u2019s] primary functions is to dispose of a failed institution\u2019s assets in a way that \u2018maximizes the net present value return from the sale or other disposition\u2019 of assets under its control\u201d). In addition, the statutory requirements of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e); see footnote 1 of this opinion; \u201censure the mature consideration of unusual loan transactions by senior bank officials, and prevent fraudulent insertion of new terms, with the collusion of bank employees, when a bank appears headed for failure.\u201d <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Some courts and commentators have recognized that the common-law holding <em>in.D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>and the provisions of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) embody the same principle, and hence, require a similar, if not identical, analytical approach; see, e.g., <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Dunmar Corp., </em>43 F.3d 587, 593 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 817, 116 S. Ct. 74, 133 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1995) (\u201cThe purposes underlying the <em>[D\u2019Oench, </em>Duhme] doctrine and \u00a7 1823 [e] [are] the same, thus permitting utilization of the same analysis under each. . . . Accordingly, cases interpreting the common law doctrine as well as its statutory counterpart are applicable precedent.\u201d [Citations omitted.]);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while others care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>fully have distinguished between the common-law holding in <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>and the statutory provision. See, e.g., <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Midwest Federal Savings Bank, </em>36 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 1993) (addressing claims under common-law doctrine and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 [e] separately); accord <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>809 F.2d 350, 353 (7th Cir. 1987) (noting that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 [e] \u201cmakes the common law principle both more encompassing and more precise\u201d). In addition, the common-law holding in <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>had been expanded in some federal circuits to afford, as a matter of federal common law, holder in due course status to the FDIC and Resolution Trust. See generally <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Hutcheson, </em>supra, 674 F.2d 874; see also <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Maplewood Investments, </em>31 F.3d 1276, 1290 n.28 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting that <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>decision and holder in due course protections are matters of federal common law); <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>939 F.2d 274, 278 (5th Cir. 1991) (Resolution Trust is holder in due course as matter of federal law); but see <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Houde, </em>90 F.3d 600, 605 n.5 (1st Cir. 1996) (federal holder in due course doctrine applicable only to FDIC in certain circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Whether either of these federal common-law doctrines remains a viable source for consideration in a case such as this is questionable after subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Melveny &amp; Meyers </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>512 U.S. 79, 85, 114 S. Ct. 2048, 129 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1994) (refusing to create federal common-law rule \u201cto supplement federal statutory regulation that is comprehensive and detailed; matters left unaddressed in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 are presumably left subject to the disposition provided by state law\u201d) and <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>519 U.S. 213, 225-27, 117 S. Ct. 666, 136 L.

Currently, there is a split among the federal circuit courts of appeals that have addressed the issue. Compare <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Deglau, </em>207 F.3d 153, 171 (3d Cir. 2000) <em>(D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine is not applicable common law in light of <em>O\u2019Melveny &amp; Meyers </em>and <em>Atherton; </em>\u00a7 1823 [e] is comprehensive and detailed and <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine need not supplement it as separate common-law doctrine), <em>DiVall Insured Income Fund, L.P. </em>v. <em>Boatmen\u2019s First National Bank, </em>69 F.3d 1398, 1402 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that <em>O\u2019Melveny &amp; Meyers </em>removes federal common-law <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine and federal holder in due course doctrine as separate bars to defenses against FDIC) and <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins.

App. 672. Moreover, the provisions of \u00a7 1823 (e) obviate the need to do so under the facts of the present case. That is, because we conclude herein that the requirements of \u00a7 1823 (e) have not been met, it is unnecessary for this court to consider whether the common-law <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine would stand as a separate bar to the defendants\u2019 claims. See <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 484 U.S. 95 (\u201cAn agreement that meets [the requirements of \u00a7 1823 (e)] prevails even if the FDIC did not know of it; and an agreement that does not meet them fails even if the FDIC knew. It would be rewriting the statute to hold otherwise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Our scope of review in the present appeal is familiar: whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) and the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine did not apply in this case is a question of law subject to plenary review. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>252 Conn. 98, 105, 742 A.2d 799 (2000); <em>Steelcase, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>238 Conn. 571, 577, 680 A.2d 289 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The Appellate Court determined that the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) did not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>because there was neither an \u201cagreement\u201d nor an \u201casset\u201d at the time the association went bankrupt. That determination was premised on the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 mortgage note had been set off as a matter of law against the entire subordinated debenture before Resolution Trust took control of the association in receivership. See <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 679. OCI contends that, in reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment of strict foreclosure, the Appellate Court \u201cblurred the distinction between a completed setoff and an inchoate setoff right.\u201d OCI maintains that a setoff could not have occurred as a matter of law prior to the association\u2019s insolvency because: (1) the debenture was, by its own terms, subordinated to other debts of the association; and (2) the explicit language of the subordinated debenture agreement, with which the defendants failed to comply, delineated the means by which the defendants could have accelerated the debenture. The defendants argue that, because the association had defaulted on the debenture by failing to make the quarterly interest payments thereon, the setoff occurred automatically upon default, \u201cregardless of any contractual language\u201d in the subordinated debenture agreement. We agree with OCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In Connecticut, a setoff may be legal or equitable in nature. See <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>225 Conn. 146, 162, 622 A.2d 536 (1993); <em>Savings Bank of New London </em>v. <em>Santaniello, </em>130 Conn. 206, 211, 33 A.2d 126 (1943). Legal setoff is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-139 et seq. and involves mutual debts between parties in any action: (1) to recover on a debt pursuant to \u00a7 52-139; (2) by an assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-140; (3) for trespass to real or personal property or other tort committed without force pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-141; or (4) involving joint debtors pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to General Statutes \u00a7 52-142. See also Practice Book \u00a7 10-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">When the statutes governing legal setoff do not apply, a party may be entitled to equitable setoff, nonetheless, \u201conly to \u2018enforce the simple but clear natural equity\u2019 \u201d in a given case. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 162, quoting <em>Spurr </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>35 Conn. 172, 174 (1868). \u201cThe right to setoff, although it may arise out of a written instrument, is a common law equitable right that is not itself a written instrument.\u201d <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 494, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">An action to foreclose on a mortgage, circumscribed by statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 49-1 et seq.; is an equitable proceeding; <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>244 Conn. 251, 256-57, 708 A.2d 1378 (1998); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>233 Conn. 153, 172, 659 A.2d 138 (1995); and as such, does not implicate the statutes governing setoff. Cf. <em>Savings Bank of New London </em>v. <em>Santaniello, </em>supra, 130 Conn. 211 (noting that strict foreclosure is not action on debt invoking statutory setoff and assuming, without deciding, that defendant had right to file cross complaint for equitable setoff).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Although we have discerned \u201cno meaningful distinction\u201d between setoff rights that may derive from common-law principles and contract versus those that are moored in statute; <em>Fleet Bank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Cari-llo, </em>240 Conn. 343, 351 n.10, 691 A.2d 1068 (1997); \u201c \u2018[i]t is clear that a setoff does not occur automatically\u2019 \u201d but, rather, it must be exercised affirmatively. <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In the usual case, setoff is \u201c[t]he equitable right to cancel or offset mutual debts or cross demands . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>[and is] commonly used by a bank in reducing a customer\u2019s checking or other deposit account in satisfaction of a debt the customer owes the bank.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleet Bank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Cari-llo, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 352.

We previously have determined that a right of setoff in the deposit account context is effectuated \u201conly after [a bank] has performed some binding overt act and has made a record to evidence that action. . . . [Consistent with the certainty and predictability required by banking operations in the commercial world, the act must be unequivocal, objectively ascertainable and final in order to be overt and binding.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 506; see <em>Citizens Bank of Maryland </em>v. <em>Strumpf </em>516 U.S. 16, 18-19, 116 S.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Marine Midland Realty Credit Corp., </em>17 F.3d 715, 722 (4th Cir. 1994) (claim for setoff must exist before insolvency; liability must be absolute and certain, and claim timely made); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Bank of Virden, </em>supra, 893 F.2d 143 (setoffs accomplished before assignment of debt to FDIC not automatically barred by \u00a7 1823 [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The Appellate Court determined that, following the association\u2019s default on the interest payments under the terms of the subordinated debenture agreement, the \u201cdefendants formally demanded full payment on the debenture and informed [the association] of their intention to exercise their right to set off the mortgage.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 670. The court based this conclusion on the letter sent to the association by the defendants\u2019 attorney on November 14,1989, which provided \u201cwritten notice pursuant to \u00a7 10.01 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the [subordinated debenture] agreement [and stated that] if the default was not cured, the defendants <em>\u2018will exercise </em>all rights available to them not only under Section 10.02 of the foregoing [subordinated [debenture [agreement, but also under statutory and common law.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 676 n.3. As the Appellate Court noted, however, the subordinated debenture agreement defined events that constituted default thereunder and provided procedures for accelerating the debt if the association were to default. Id. The parties do not dispute that the language of the subordinated debenture agreement contemplated that a second notice, notice of acceleration of the debt, would be sent to the association after the initial notice of default and that no such notice of acceleration was provided prior to the association\u2019s insolvency. See id. The defendants argue that, consistent with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion, the contractual provisions are \u201cirrelevant\u201d because the association was in default and the setoff occurred by operation of law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">This court has long recognized that \u201c [a] contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 498, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000); see also <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 768-70, 463 A.2d 242 (1983) (\u201c[j]udicial deference to freedom of contract is particularly appropriate in a case . . . where a private lender and a private borrower can be presumed to have had equal access to the financial marketplace when the [agreement] was first negotiated\u201d; due-on-sale clause in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>mortgage enforceable; mortgage properly accelerated where intent to exercise option to accelerate was \u201c \u2018crystal clear\u2019 \u201d). Were we to accept the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the acceleration provisions in the subordinated debenture agreement were irrelevant, we essentially would eviscerate portions of the contract governing the subordinated debenture between the association and the defendants. The defendants necessarily rely on this contract, however, in support of their setoff claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Appellate Court relied on <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>38 F.3d 1490 (9th Cir. 1994), in its decision that the setoff had occurred by operation of law. In <em>Murphy, </em>the plaintiff, who was a beneficiary of a letter of credit, owed $100,000 on a promissory note secured from a bank. Id., 1496. The bank had issued letters of credit to the plaintiff to use as collateral for obligations with one of his commercial suppliers. Id., 1495. Following presentment and dishonor of the letters of credit, the supplier assigned the $585,000 letters of credit back to the plaintiff. Id., 1505. Eight months after the dishonor and assignment of the letters of credit, the bank failed and the FDIC sought to collect on the note while refusing to pay the letters of credit. Id., 1497.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that \u201cset-offs arising by operation of law are not automatically barred by \u00a7 1823 (e), although a particular set-off, if it amounts to a claim based on breach of an agreement, may be barred.\u201d Id., 1504-1505. The court concluded that, because the jury had determined that the plaintiffs supplier had complied strictly with the presentment requirements of the letters of credit, the plaintiff was entitled to set off the $100,000 note against the $585,000 owing on the letters of credit. Id., 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In the present case, although the defendants and the association had agreed to set off quarterly interest pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>merits on the debenture against three months of payments on the mortgage note, the only way that the entire mortgage note balance could have been set off against the full amount of the subordinated debenture was if the debenture had been accelerated. As previously noted, the defendants never forwarded the required notice of acceleration under the terms of their agreement prior to the association\u2019s insolvency. These facts distinguish the present case from <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 38 F.3d 1505. The letters of credit therein had been presented and dishonored to make them fully payable as a liability of the bank. Id. In the present case, the defendants never accelerated the subordinated debenture; the only notice that they had provided indicated that they would do so if the failure of the association to tender that quarter\u2019s interest payment was not cured within the fifteen days provided in \u00a7 10.01 of the subordinated debenture agreement. See <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 676 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In addition, the subordinated debenture agreement provided that no payment of principal may be accelerated without the approval of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, if after giving effect to such payment the association would fail to meet the net worth requirements of the applicable federal regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the defendants received that approval to accelerate and thereby set off the full amount of the debenture. See, e.g., <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>de Jesus Velez, </em>678 F.2d 371, 375 (1st Cir. 1982) (even if 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 [e] had been followed, agreement to set off debentures against notes would be void as against public policy for circumventing FDIC approval requirement for payment of debentures). Although setoff rights do not necessarily require a written instrument, the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>claim in this case \u201carise[s] from a written instrument,\u201d and their failure to comply with the terms of the subordinated debenture agreement for accelerating the debt precludes any setoff herein. See <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 494. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the debenture was set off against the mortgage note as a matter of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">OCI next argues that the Appellate Court improperly concluded, as a further basis for its decision, that the subordinated debenture agreement and the mortgage note had been \u201csufficiently bound together to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>a bilateral agreement for purposes of avoiding the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine.\u201d <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 682. We agree with OCI.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The mortgage note, the subordinated debenture agreement and the subsequent agreement to apply the interest on the debenture to the payments due under the mortgage note were entered into on separate occasions without any single governing document reflecting their connection. Although we recognize that a single, bilateral contract may be valid because it <em>may </em>satisfy the requirements of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e); <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Continental Credit Corp., </em>655 F.2d 743, 747 (7th Cir. 1981) (bilateral obligations in one document may serve as source of defense against FDIC; <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine and \u00a7 1823 [e] apply only where defenses to facially valid notes and guarantees are based on undisclosed agreements); the mortgage note and separate subordinated debenture agreement in <em>this </em>case were not consolidated in a manner that would compel the conclusion that they embodied a single, bilateral agreement. See <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>181 Conn. 207, 210-11, 435 A.2d 1 (1980) (\u201ca promissory note is nothing more than a written contract for the payment of money\u201d); see also <em>Community Bank of the Ozarks </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>984 F.2d 254, 259 (8th Cir. 1993) (bilateral agreement exception is narrow one); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>947 F.2d 196, 206 (6th Cir. 1991) (blanket bonds, unlike promissory notes, impose bilateral obligations); <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>J.B. Centron Development Co., </em>92 Ohio App. 3d 643, 648, 637 N.E.2d 23 (1993) (\u201c[I]f an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>is bilateral, rather than unilateral, Section 1823 [e] may not apply. . . . Promissory notes, however, are unilateral contracts.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). The Appellate Court improperly concluded otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">OCI next contends that, because a set off did not occur by operation of law prior to the association\u2019s insolvency, the defendants\u2019 right to exercise a setoff thereafter was \u201ccut off\u2019 by the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e). The defendants rely on the same arguments that support their theory of setoff and contend that, because \u201cthere was a default on the payment of the [subordinated] debenture agreement which operated to extinguish the defendants\u2019 debt [on the mortgage note] by reason of setoff, and that setoff occurred upon the default,\u201d \u00a7 1823 (e) could not apply. We conclude that \u00a7 1823 (e) applies and that, because the defendants failed to meet its requirements, they are precluded from asserting, as a defense to OCI\u2019s strict foreclosure action on the mortgage, any agreement not memorialized that would allow them to exercise a set-off now.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Title 12 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1823 (e), provides that \u201c[n]o agreement which tends to diminish or defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the interest of the [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it under this section . . . shall be valid against the [FDIC] unless such agreement\u2014(A) is in writing, (B) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution, (C) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and (D) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It is clear that \u201c[a] condition to payment of a note ... is part of the \u2018agreement\u2019 to which the writing, approval, and filing requirements of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) attach.\u201d <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 484 U.S. 96. At some time subsequent to the execution of the subordinated debenture agreement, the association and the defendants \u201cagreed that the defendants\u2019 mortgage note would be paid by applying [the association\u2019s] interest payments on the debenture to the defendants\u2019 monthly mortgage payments.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 670. The parties in this case stipulated that the defendants and the association had \u201cagreed\u201d to satisfy the monthly payments due under the mortgage by applying the quarterly interest payments on the debenture thereto.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>essentially tying the monthly mortgage payments to the debenture interest paid quarterly, significantly altered the terms of both the mortgage note and the debenture, and, according to the defendants, relieved them of any obligation to keep the monthly mortgage payments current in the event of the association\u2019s default on the debenture. We conclude that this agreement conditioned the defendants\u2019 obligation, as long as the debenture remained outstanding and interest payments were due thereon, to take affirmative steps to ensure that then monthly mortgage payments were current. It is precisely the type of side agreement contemplated by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e). The defendants may succeed only if they meet the requirements of the statute. See <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>supra, 91-92 (\u201c[n]either the FDIC nor state banking authorities would be able to make reliable evaluations if bank records contained seemingly unqualified notes that are in fact subject to undisclosed conditions\u201d); see also <em>Federal Deposit Ins.

Unless it satisfies 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e), such an agreement is invalid because it would diminish Resolution Trust\u2019s, and hence, OCI\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>interest in the mortgage note. See <em>Alaska Southern Partners </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>972 P.2d 161, 164 (Alaska 1999) (\u00a7 1823 [e] \u201cnullifies undocumented agreements that could diminish a loan\u2019s worth by altering the terms of payment reflected in the bank\u2019s loan file\u201d); <em>Federal Deposit Ins.

For the defendants to prevail under a setoff theory now, after the association\u2019s insolvency, this court would be required to conclude that: (1) the debenture had been accelerated at some point and for some reason regardless of the notice and approval provisions therein and irrespective of the fact that the association had entered receivership almost one month after the defendants sent the first notice of default; and (2) the agreement tying the mortgage note and the debenture, which effectively modified both and purportedly relieved the defendants of the obligation to make any monthly payments on the mortgage note as long as the debenture remained outstanding, satisfies 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e). We reach neither conclusion in this case. Accordingly, because the defendants agreed to tie their obligations under the mortgage note to the association\u2019s obligations under the debenture and that agreement does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 1823 (e), they are precluded from asserting it against OCI in this foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Finally, OCI claims in its brief that \u201cin what [is] manifestly the real reason\u201d for the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, that court improperly disregarded 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823 (e) because it would have \u201cshockfed] the judicial con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>science\u201d to permit OCI to recover in this case.

See generally <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Texarkana National Bank, </em>874 F.2d 264, 269 (5th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1043, 110 S. Ct. 837, 107 L.

See <em>OCI Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 679. We reach a contrary conclusion in part II C of this opinion. The Appellate Court also reasoned that the setoff had extinguished the mortgage note as an asset of the association at the time of its insolvency. See id. Again, because the debenture had not been accelerated and, for that reason, no setoff occurred in this case, we reach the opposite conclusion. The mortgage note remained intact as a facially valid asset of the association at the time it failed.

The trial court, in sustaining OCI\u2019s objection to the attorney trial referee\u2019s report, recognized that the mortgage note and subordinated debenture agreement had been executed some sixteen months apart and that, therefore, the requirement that the agreement be executed \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d with the acquisition of the mortgage note had not been satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\"> We do note, however, that there is no evidence in the record suggesting that the association\u2019s board approved the agreement to apply the subordinated debenture to the mortgage note; nor is there evidence, other than perhaps the end result of the payment scheme in its quarterly statements, that the association kept any official record of the arrangement.
