Defendants filed an affidavit of defense and the case went to jury trial, where there was a directed verdict for plaintiff and, from judgment entered thereon, defendants brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Prior to the execution of each lease, the parties had entered into,a written contract called a \u201csales proposal,\u201d being a proposition by plaintiff to furnish and deliver the truck to defendants, on terms of payment, etc., similar to those later embodied in the lease. These proposals were accepted by defendants and were in form contracts of sale, but were superseded by the bailment leases, under which the trucks were delivered to the defendants. While the sales proposals remained executory it was competent for the parties to change them to bailment leases, and having done so the latter became the actual final agreements. \u201cThe fact that the original intention of the parties is to make a sale, and that such is the legal effect of their first agreement, does not prevent a change, while it is still executory, into a bailment with an alternative of future conversion into a sale on the compliance with the stipulated conditions\u201d: Goss Printing Co. v. Jordan, 171 Pa. 474; Stiles v. Seaton, 200 Pa. 114, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">No fraud, accident or mistake is' averred; hence, the \u00a1admission of the sale proposals in evidence would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>have changed the legal effect of the transactions; and their exclusion by the trial judge, whether right or wrong, did defendants no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">It is unnecessary for a bailment lease to stipulate for a return of the property, and the absence of a provision to that effect in those here in question is not controlling: Stiles v. Seaton, supra; Edward\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 103; Jones v. Wands et al., 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 269; Porter v. Duncan, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Installments, long overdue, were unpaid when the writ of replevin issued, but by mere indulgence plaintiff did not lose its right to reclaim the property in accordance with the terms of the contracts. There had been no modification of the leases nor any waiver of plaintiff\u2019s rights; on the contrary, twenty-eight days before the writ issued, the use-plaintiff wrote defendants stating, inter alia, \u201cwe will be obliged to repossess these trucks unless <em>the </em>past due [paper] is taken care of in the near future.\u201d This is inconsistent with the claim of a waiver, being in effect a demand for the trucks unless the defaults were promptly made good, which they were not. The leases authorized plaintiff, upon demand, to forthwith take possession of the trucks, but defendants had practically a month\u2019s written notice, in addition to verbal notices as shown by the uncontradicted evidence. Such notice, whether oral or written, need be in no set form of words (1 Cyc. 696), and, as we regard the written notice sufficient, it is unnecessary to determine whether a demand must precede the suit. As defendants made no offer or effort to make good the defaults, either before or after the issuing of the writ, there is no merit in their claim of lack of demand, and nothing which required a submission of that question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Under the correct ruling of the court below, plaintiff rightfully repossessed itself of the trucks; hence, the question as to who would ultimately have been their owner, had defendants made no default, was irrelevant and the trial judge properly excluded parol evidence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>lating thereto; as he also did that tending to prove the damages defendants sustained by loss of the <em>trucks; </em>for the extent of damages is immaterial where none are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The assignments of error are all overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
