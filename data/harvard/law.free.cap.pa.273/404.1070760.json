Custer, still living but who had assigned his interest in the estate to Harry T. Stoddard, trustee, Spartan Building and Loan Association, and Harrison S. Gill; and the fourth had had four children, two of whom were still living and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>other two had died, one of the latter leaving two children and the other one child.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">At the adjudication of the trustee\u2019s account, following its conclusion on prior distributions, the court below held that the great-grandchildren were entitled to share by representation; that the distribution, aside from this, should be per capita; and therefore awarded to each of the grandchildren of testator one-ninth of the residue, to the great-grandchild, who was the only issue of her mother, one-ninth and to the other two-great-grandchildren one-eighteenth each. These five appeals followed: four by grandchildren alleging, as they did in the court below, that the great-grandchildren should not have been permitted to share in the distribution, and hence these appellants claim they are entitled to one seventh instead of one-ninth of the fund; and the fifth appeal, by Sheldon M. Custer and his assignees, who renewed their contention that the division should be per stirpes, in which event his share would be one-third instead of one-ninth.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">It is not necessary to decide whether or not the great-grandchildren should have been awarded a share per capita instead of per stirpes, since they do not appeal and appellants do not, and indeed could not, legally complain regarding the decision on this point, the effect of the decree being to give them one-ninth of the estate, instead of one-tenth, as would have been the case if the great-grandchildren were entitled to take per capita.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In determining the two questions which are raised, it must be steadily borne in mind that it is not the province of the court to consider what the testator possibly intended, but only what intention is expressed in the language used (Hancock\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 532; Glenn v. Stewart, 265 Pa. 208, 211; Ludwick\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 365); a necessary conclusion, since a will is required to be in writing. So, also, it must be remembered that \u201cafter all, as has often been said, rules of construction have very little weight in the case of wills, and \u2018precedents ought never to be allowed an unbending control of any case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>not precisely analogous or even strictly identical\u2019 \u201d; per Penrose, J., in Ashburner\u2019s Est., 159 Pa. 545, 6, his opinion being adopted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In the light of those principles, we desire to add but little to that which was so well said by Judge Gest, in his opinion in the court below on a prior adjudication in this estate, when deciding that the great-grandchildren were entitled to share in the distribution: \u201cConsidering now the effect of the parenthetical clause, \u2018the children and issue of my four daughters,\u2019 it is clear that the words \u2018children of my four daughters\u2019 [if taken alone] would be merely explanatory of the word\u2018grandchildren,\u2019 for that is exactly what the granchildren are, and these words would add nothing to and subtract nothing from the meaning of what goes before them. Do the added words \u2018and issue\u2019 affect the construction placed upon the will? Obviously, this word \u2018issue\u2019 was either intended to add further explanation, perhaps unnecessary, of the word \u2018grandchildren,\u2019 or else was intended to be used in its regular and normal meaning of \u2018descendants,\u2019 thus amplifying the meaning of the word \u2018grandchildren,\u2019 and showing that the testator contemplated the possibility of the death of some of his grandchildren leaving issue before the death of the survivor of his own daughters. Certainly this word \u2018issue\u2019 cannot be used in a restrictive sense; if it has any meaning here at all, it must extend or amplify the scope of the testator\u2019s gift to grandchildren.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It has often been held that a gift to children will include grandchildren, if from other words in the will it appears there was an intention to use the term in a more extensive sense (Steinmetz\u2019s Est., 194 Pa. 611; Puterbaugh\u2019s Est., 261 Pa. 235); a fortiori, a gift to grandchildren, under such circumstances, will include great-grandchildren, since the former is a word of equivocal import: Pemberton v. Parke, 5 Binn. 601, 610. Here we have the added words \u201cand issue,\u201d which are mere surplusage if not construed to extend the gift to the great-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>grandchildren; a result not permissible unless no other is reasonably possible: Ludwick\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 365. As the conclusion reached by the court below gives those words an appropriate and natural meaning, they cannot be rejected. We therefore conclude that the decision upon this point was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Upon the other question involved, it is conceded of course that where distribution is directed to specified children and to the descendants of others, the stirpetal rule should be applied, for under such circumstances the testator has himself designated the classes to whom he desires the distribution made: Sipe\u2019s Est., 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 145. Here, however, he has distinctly provided for but one class, for he gives the estate \u201cto all and singular my grandchildren, the children and issue of my four daughters, that may then be living, to be divided equally between them share and share alike.\u201d The \u201cthem\u201d can only refer to the ones designated as grandchildren, who are the children and issue of the daughters, and the estate is \u201cto be divided equally between <em>them </em>share and share alike.\u201d If the clause had directed the division among the children and issue of the four daughters, leaving out the word \u201cgrandchildren,\u201d there might be some slight room for the contention now made; but the gift is directly to the grandchildren, and the designation of \u201cchildren and issue\u201d is only for the purpose of determining what is meant by the word \u201cgrandchildren,\u201d and not to specify classes or change the method of distribution expressly provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeals are dismissed at the costs of the respective appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
