Mr. Shoemaker had been requested to do this small repair job approximately a week before he undertook to do so. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Close examination of the testimony of Mr. Shoemaker reveals that his occupation is that of carpenter, and that he had been engaged in this type of work since he was sixteen years of age, and he also does some painting and he also stated that he was a general builder. As a matter of fact he was engaged in building a house for Mr. Over-holt at the time he was injured at the Overholt Motor Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">Mr. Shoemaker was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">\u201cQ. You contract for the repair of houses, don\u2019t you, and do repair work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cA. Well, I always just take it by the hour. I never do take any contract work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cQ. You do it then by the hour, you do not do it by the job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cQ. You pick up odd carpenter jobs, you might say? \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cQ. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">\u201cQ. You work for yourself, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">\u201cQ. In other words, you are self employed, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\">\u201cA. Well, something on that line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t have any bosses other than yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As8V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u2018\u2018A. No,, just .myself and tlie one I am working for, whoever it; might he.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASH\">\u201cQ. You do not work for anyone in particular?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7z\">\u201cA. No. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cQ. You haven\u2019t held a salaried job in many years, have you,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cA. No, I have not worked for any contractors for several years. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Mr. Shoemaker also said that he purchased building supplies from Overholt Hardware Company, which adjoined Overholt garage. There are two outside entrances to the garage and there is a connecting door between the Hardware Company and the garage. In the entrance to the garage are overhead sliding doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Mr. Shoemaker built a truck bed for Overholt Hardware Company. However, the work was performed in the Over-holt garage. He did not deal with nor negotiate with Connie Overholt, who managed Overholt Motors, in so far as building or repairing the body or bed on the truck. In that transaction he was working for Clay Overholt, who ran the Hardware Store. Sometime prior to the work on the truck bed Connie Overholt asked Shoemaker to repair the two sliding doors which are referred to above. It was in the repair of one of these sliding doors that Mr. Shoemaker fell and injured himself, for which injury he brought suit uncler the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Earl Lane, an employee of Overholt Hardware Company, assisted Mr. Shoemaker when he,.Lane, had nothing else to do. He assisted in the repair of the garage door.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Mr. Shoemaker was asked whether or not he recalled ever having worked on the garage building before October 21, 1960, the date of his injury. He replied that he had done some carpenter work on the garage building for Mr. Overholt sometime prior thereto. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">Mr. Shoemaker was doing carpentry work, his regular occupation, at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Mr. Connie Overholt testified that Mr. Shoemaker was a good carpenter, and that on October 21, 1960, he was in the act of repairing the garage door when he fell from the ladder and was injured. He was being paid at the rate of $1.50 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">He further said that he operated the Overholt Motors and that the type of work carried on at the garage was \u201cjust general repair, automobile repair, glass repair,\u201d and that he was not engaged in the carpentry business and that he did not recall ever employing any carpenter prior to this date to do any work in or around Overholt Motors.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. How often did you employ carpenters there in the operation of your garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t recall ever employing any before. Usually the boys there in the shop did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201cQ. This was the only occasion then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-12\">\u201cQ. On October 21, 1960?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">\u201cA. That is the only one I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-14\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. How long have you known Mr. Shoemaker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-15\">\u201cA. Oh, 10 or 12 years, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201cQ. Do yon know what kind of business he was engaged in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201cQ. What kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cA. Carpenter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Is he a mechanic ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201cA. No, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\u201cQ. How did you obtain his services to repair that door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">\u201cA. Well, he was doing some work for the hardware store on a truck bed, and I had noticed the doors had some rotten boards up over them, and I asked Ed if he could repair them when he got through there, and he said he could after he got through at Overholt\u2019s. I didn\u2019t know he was working that day. I imagine that was a week before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">No agreement was reached about the exact amount of compensation to be paid Mr. Shoemaker for his work for doing work on his home, and in regard to the amount but Overholt knew what Mr. Shoemaker had charged him to be charged for this particular work he was asked this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">\u201cQ. He was to submit a bill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-15\">\u201cQ. Whatever he was going to charge and you would pay it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-17\">\u201cQ. Pay it out of the garage funds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201cQ. Was the work which Mr. Shoemaker was doing aside from and independent from your usual trade or business or profession or occupation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201cQ. Was Mr. Shoemaker regularly employed by you in the operation of your garage there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cQ. Did you tell him how to do this particular work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think I pointed out these rotten boards. I believe that is about all I told him. Of course, the door wasn\u2019t working too good. I don\u2019t think I mentioned that to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201cQ. Did you tell him how to do the work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">\u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cQ. Did you tell him when to start?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">\u201cQ. Did you know when he went to work on the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">\u201cA. No. I don\u2019t know until after this happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">\u201cQ. Were you or was anybody of your garage employees or mechanics supervising this work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not that I know of. I don\u2019t know that they knew about it. Of course, they would have to know that he was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-16\">\u201cQ. Did you have any control over his work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-18\">\u201cQ. Was Mr. Shoemaker to continue working for you after he finished repairing the garage doors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-3\">\u201cQ. This was a one-job proposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">\u201cA. That is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The only witnesses testifying as to the pertinent facts of the case on behalf of petitioner were Edgar Shoemaker and his employer, Connie Overholt, and the testimony of these witnesses material to the disposition of this petition to rehear has been quoted, and their entire testimony has been carefully reviewed again by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We observe that Overholt Motors was engaged in the business of operating a garage for the general repair of automobiles, and the doing of carpentry work was not a pail of the business of Overholt Motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">It is true that the lessee of the building Overholt Motors was obligated to keep the building in reasonable and proper repair, but, of course, the obligation to do this was not a part of the operation of the business of Overholt Motors, although it might be considered incidental thereto, and if performed by regular employees of Overholt Motors resulting in injuries, such employee might be permitted to recover for injuries sustained while making such repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">However, in the case before us Mr. Shoemaker was not an employee of Overholt Motors within the meaning of the Act for several reasons. One is that he is a carpenter by trade and occupation and has been so engaged since he was sixteen years of age. He' charged a fixed sum, usually, $1.50 per hour for his services. He says that he was going to charge Mr. Overholt at this rate on this particular job. Mr. Overholt did not know the rate to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>charged him but he did expect to receive a hill from Mr. Shoemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">This was the only occasion that Mr. Shoemaker had ever been employed by Overholt Motors to do any carpentry work on the garage door. It is true that he had been doing some work for the Hardware Company, which was operated by a brother of Mr. Overholt and Mr. Connie Overholt possibly had an interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Earl Lane, who assisted Mr. Shoemaker in the repair of the garage door, was an employee of Overholt Hardware Company.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">T.C.A. Section 50-906(b) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law shall not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201c(b) Any person whose employment at the time of injury is casual, that is, one who is not employed in the usual course of trade, business, profession, or occupation of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">In the case of <em>Dancy v. Abraham Bros. Packing Co. et dl., 171 </em>Tenn. 311, 102 S.W.2d 526, this Court held that the test was not whether the workman was engaged in the usual course of workman\u2019s trade or occupation, but the test was, under our Act, whether or not the workman was employed when injured in the usual course of trade, business, profession, or occupation of the employer. This same test was approved by this Court in the case of <em>Gibbons v. Roller Estate, Inc., </em>163 Tenn. 373, 43 S.W.2d 198, and therein this Court cited the case of <em>Murphy v. Gaylord, </em>160 Tenn. 660, 28 S.W.2d 348. In the Dancy case, supra, this Court said, pages 313-314 of 171 Tenn., page 526 of 102 S.W.2d, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201cNow these facts, as will be seen, relate mainly to the trade or occupation of the employee, wbicb was that of carpenter. It may be conceded that they show that be was engaged \u2018in the usual course\u2019 of bis trade or occupation. But this is not determinative. Under our act, Code, sec. 6856(b), the test is whether or not the workman was employed when injured \u2018in the usual course of trade, business, profession, or occupation of the employer. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cCan the carpenter work of repairing* these doors, windows, salt or coal bins, or inclosures of the control valves of the sprinkler system, be said to have been in the usual course of this employer\u2019s trade, business, or occupation? Was not this work rather of an occasional, now and then, exigency, unusual nature? The \u2018occupa-ation\u2019 of the packing company was not carpentering, constructing, or repairing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201c[2] It does not appear that this packing company maintained a force of carpenters for such work, or was prepared by or through its regular employees to perform it. The company did not maintain any mechanical department for the purpose of performing repair or construction work in connection with the operation of its plant. But, when and as the need arose, from time to time, acting through its chief engineer, a workman was called in for such purposes. The odd carpenter job or jobs the occasion appeared to demand being accomplished, the workman called in to perform this work would be released. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">We also believe upon reconsideration that the case of <em>Harper v. Grady Counce &amp; Son, </em>194 Tenn. 279, 250 S.W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>2d 371, written by the late Chief Justice Prewitt is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">In that case a plumber was called in to perform plumbing work at an automobile garage and fell from a ladder while in the process of installing a water pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">At page 281 of the opinion in 194 Tenn., at page 371 of 250 S.W.2d the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cThe plumbing business was not part of the business of the defendants or even incidental thereto. The hiring of plaintiff as a plumber to install the water pipe at the place of business of the defendants made him a casual employee only.\u201d Citing cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">It is now obvious to us that Mr. Shoemaker was really engaged as an independent contractor in carrying-on his occupation of carpentry. He was following his occupation in carrying out his duties with Overholt Motors and in our opinion was an independent contractor. But if he be considered an employee within the meaning of the Act he could be no more than a casual employee as that term is defined hereinabove and therefore is not covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">To permit one to recover for injuries sustained while engaged in industry he is required under the Act to prove:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">1. That he is an employee: 2. That he sustained an accidental injury, and 3, that such accident and injury grew out of and in the course of his regular employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Although, we are bound by the findings of the trial judge when supported by any material evidence, we are not bound to follow the law as interpreted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In this case we think the trial judge erroneously construed the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law in permitting a recovery by the petitioner in this case. It then becomes our duty to reverse his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">In the case of <em>Wilson v. Van Buren County, </em>196 Tenn. 487, 488, at page 495, 268 S.W.2d 363, at page 366, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">\u201cWhile this Court has always considered itself to be bound by the findings of the trial judge on questions of fact when supported by any material evidence, it has not considered itself to be bound by the conclusions drawn by the trial court from undisputed facts. Therefore, it has always reserved unto itself the prerogative of reaching a different legal conclusion from that of the trial court on the same findings of fact. <em>King v. Buckeye Cotton Oil Co., </em>155 Tenn. 491, 296 S.W. 3, 53 A.L.R. 1086.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The petition to rehear is, therefore, granted. The prior opinion of this Court in this case is withdrawn and this opinion is substituted therefor. An order will be entered reversing and dismissing this case at the cost of the defendant in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
