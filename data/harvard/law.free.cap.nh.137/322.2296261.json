On appeal, the defendant raises several arguments, which may be summarized as follows: that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of felony criminal mischief; that the trial court erred in allowing the State to amend its witness list; that the trial court erred in refusing his request for a jury nullification instruction; and that his convictions for felony criminal mischief and felonious use of a firearm subjected him to double jeopardy. We reject these arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">At approximately 1:00 a.m. on July 13, 1989, John Carroll was driving through Manchester when a car driven by the defendant came to a stop in the center of the road. The defendant, who had been returning home from a Manchester lounge, waited until Carroll pulled up behind him, and then proceeded for several blocks before again coming to a complete stop in the center of the road. Carroll again stopped his car, and the defendant again drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">After this sequence of events was repeated several more times, Carroll resolved to obtain the license plate number of the defendant\u2019s car and report the incident to the police. He followed the car until it turned into the driveway of the defendant\u2019s home on St. James Avenue in Manchester. As Carroll passed the driveway, the defendant got out of his car and aimed a .32 caliber pistol at Carroll\u2019s car, a 1987 Ford Tempo. When Carroll ducked his head below his dashboard, he heard a bullet strike his car. The defendant fired six or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>seven additional shots as Carroll drove away from the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">While attempting to return to the main roadway, Carroll, who was unfamiliar with the defendant\u2019s neighborhood, inadvertently followed a street that brought him directly behind the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant saw Carroll\u2019s car and again opened fire, this time using a .25 caliber pistol that he had retrieved from his car after emptying the .32 caliber pistol. The defendant\u2019s shooting left several bullet holes in Carroll\u2019s car and flattened two tires. The defendant did not deny that he intended to fire at, and hit, Carroll\u2019s car. He claimed, however, that he fired in self-defense, with the objective of \u201cblowing] out [Carroll\u2019s] tires ... so he wouldn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The defendant was arrested and indicted for felony criminal mischief and felonious use of a firearm. Under the criminal mischief statute, a party is guilty of a misdemeanor if he purposely or recklessly damages the property of another. <em>See </em>RSA 634:2, I <em>&amp; </em>III (1986). The crime is treated as a class B felony if the party purposely causes or attempts to cause pecuniary loss exceeding $1,000. RSA 634:2,11(a) (Supp. 1992). At trial, the State, to establish the amount of pecuniary loss, called as a witness Leo Brosseau, an estimator of damaged vehicles who had inspected Carroll\u2019s car two days after the shooting. At his insurance company\u2019s request, Carroll had brought his car to Brosseau to obtain an independent estimate of the car\u2019s damage. Brosseau estimated that the labor and materials required to repair the car would cost $1,771.36. This sum did not include the cost of replacing the two damaged tires. Carroll received an insurance benefit payment totaling $1,705.45. An acquaintance of Carroll\u2019s performed the repair work at a discounted price, and Carroll did not spend the entire amount on repair work. He testified that he used the \u201cmajority\u201d of the funds to pay for the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As further evidence of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car, the State produced the detective and police officers who examined the car after the incident. The State also called a firearms expert, who testified that two of the car\u2019s tires had sustained bullet holes. Finally, the State introduced photographs showing damage caused by the shooting to Carroll\u2019s car. Based on this evidence, the jury convicted the defendant of felony criminal mischief and felonious use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">7. <em>Pecuniary Loss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">On appeal, the defendant first argues that the State failed to prove that he caused or attempted to cause a pecuniary loss in excess of $1,000. According to the defendant, Carroll\u2019s pecuniary loss within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the meaning of RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992) constituted only the net, out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a direct result of the shooting. The State\u2019s evidence, the defendant contends, failed to establish that Carroll spent more than $1,000 to repair damage caused by the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"> To prevail on this argument, the defendant must demonstrate that no rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence most favorably to the State, could have found a pecuniary loss exceeding $1,000. <em>See State v. Amell, </em>131 N.H. 309, 311, 553 A.2d 286, 288 (1988). Although the State must prove each element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt, it may fulfill its burden by relying on circumstantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992) does not define \u201cpecuniary loss.\u201d The term, however, generally has been defined as the \u201closs of money, or of something by which money or something of value may be acquired.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1131 (6th ed. 1990). When the State must prove the value of property in order \u201cto bring a crime within the ambit of a particular criminal statute, any evidence from which the trier of fact can reasonably infer value is admissible.\u201d <em>State v. Hammell, </em>128 N.H. 787, 790, 519 A.2d 307,309 (1986) (quotation omitted); <em>cf. </em>RSA 637:2, V(a) (Supp. 1992) (term \u201cvalue\u201d under theft statute \u201cmeans the highest amount determined by any reasonable standard of property or services\u201d). The evidence need not be infallible, <em>Hammell, </em>128 N.H. at 790, 519 A.2d at 309, since determining the weight given a particular piece of evidence \u201cis the very essence of a jury\u2019s function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also State v. Pierce, </em>231 Neb. 966, 975, 439 N.W.2d 435, 442 (1989) (\u201cthere is no universal and comprehensive formula or method to determine the extent of pecuniary loss in relation to criminal mischief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">To establish the value of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car, the State introduced Brosseau\u2019s estimate that repairing Carroll\u2019s car would cost $1,771.36, well over the threshold amount for a felony conviction under RSA 634:2,11(a) (Supp. 1992). Insurance estimates have provided the basis for past felony convictions under this statute. <em>See State v. Robidoux, </em>125 N.H. 169, 171, 480 A.2d 67, 69 (1984) (insurance adjuster\u2019s estimate provided evidence of \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d over $1,000). Evidence that Carroll\u2019s insurer paid $1,705.45, an amount exceptionally close to Brosseau\u2019s estimate, lent credibility to the accuracy of the estimate. In addition, the jury saw photographs, and heard testimony, detailing the damage caused by the defendant. The defendant had ample opportunity to challenge the credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the State\u2019s evidence on cross-examination. We find that based on this evidence, the jurors reasonably could have concluded that the shooting caused pecuniary loss greater than $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The defendant also argues that property damage does not constitute a pecuniary loss under RSA 634:2,11(a) (Supp. 1992), if a victim receives insurance to cover the cost of repairing the damage. Under this interpretation, the statute would cover only the narrow category of cases where pecuniary losses were incurred by uninsured or underinsured victims. We cannot conceive that the legislature intended this result. RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992) does not require a loss specific to the victim. Rather, it requires only a general pecuniary loss, which could be absorbed by the victim, the insurer, or a combination of the two. The $1,000 pecuniary loss provision in the statute provides a means of grading the severity of a crime; it should not allow defendants to rely on factors unrelated to their conduct\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>the existence or amount of their victims\u2019 insurance \u2014 to limit their criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The defendant further argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he <em>intended </em>to cause more than $1,000 in pecuniary losses. According to the defendant, felony criminal mischief is a specific intent crime requiring the State to do more than simply show that the defendant purposely caused damage. The defendant contends that to elevate the crime to a class B felony, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with the specific intent to cause more than $1,000 in damage. We do not agree that the State must provide such proof to sustain a conviction for felony criminal mischief. RSA 634:2,11(a) (Supp. 1992) enhances the crime of criminal mischief from a misdemeanor to a class B felony if the State proves that the defendant purposely caused or attempted to cause pecuniary loss. The State must also prove that the amount of pecuniary loss exceeded $1,000. The intent requirement under RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992) relates to the causation, not the amount, of pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Our interpretation of RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992) finds support in the 1969 \u201cReport of Commission to Recommend Codification of Criminal Laws.\u201d The comments to what is now RSA 634:2 state that \u201c[t]he grading of this offense is based upon considerations of seriousness similar to those that govern theft offenses, namely, the amount of property lost, and upon the seriousness as measured by effects on essential public services.\u201d Theft is divided into different grades of offenses by RSA 637:11 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1992). The statute contains no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>intent requirement, and value is one factor that governs the seriousness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In the present case, the evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant, in firing seven or eight rounds at Carroll\u2019s car, purposely caused pecuniary loss. The amount of this loss simply established the grade of the defendant\u2019s offense. <em>See Pierce, </em>231 Neb. at 971-72, 439 N.W.2d at 440. The State did not have to prove that the defendant intended to cause the amount of pecuniary loss needed to enhance the crime to a class B felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>II. Amendment to Witness List</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence, the defendant contends that the trial court erred by allowing the State to amend its witness list during trial to permit an expert witness, Leo Brosseau, to testify. Prior to trial, the trial court directed the parties to submit \u201cthe names and addresses of all witnesses expected to testify and a list of all exhibits to be offered.\u201d The State did not disclose Brosseau or his damages estimate. At trial, the State attempted to establish the value of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car by questioning Carroll about Brosseau\u2019s estimate, and about the amount of payment he received from his insurer. When the trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to this questioning, the State requested permission to call Brosseau. The State explained that it had not earlier disclosed Brosseau or his estimate because it had intended to rely on Carroll and his insurance company to establish the value of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed Brosseau to testify, noting that the defense knew that the value of pecuniary loss was an element of the criminal mischief charge, and that the defense \u201cprobably assumed . . . [that the amount of loss] was going to be proven by testimony of just somebody like Mr. Brosseau . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the State failed to identify Brosseau before trial, and failed to provide the defendant with a copy of Brosseau\u2019s estimate, as required by Superior Court Rule 98. As an initial matter, we note that Rule 98, which concerns evidence the State has obtained from a defendant and intends to use at trial, has no application to this case. The State did not obtain Brosseau\u2019s estimate from the defendant, and this evidence never belonged to the defendant. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s misplaced reliance on Rule 98, even if the defendant were to argue that the State had a duty by analogy to Superior Court Rule 62(1), applicable to civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>cases, to indicate its intended use of Brosseau and his estimate, the argument would not avail him. Under Rule 62(1), \u201c[e]xcept for good cause shown, no witness not listed in the pretrial stipulation or statement will be allowed to testify, and no exhibit, not so listed, will be received in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The \u201cdiscovery of truth in the context of a criminal trial. . . should not suffer by an overly technical application of rules of court.\u201d <em>State v. Comtois, </em>122 N.H. 1173, 1175, 453 A.2d 1324, 1325 (1982). The admissibility of evidence is generally a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See State v. Nadeau, </em>126 N.H. 120, 124, 489 A.2d 623, 626 (1985). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence despite noncompliance with discovery rules, unless the decision constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Evidence that the prosecution made a good faith effort to comply with discovery is one factor that guides the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 124-25, 489 A.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State to call Brosseau as a witness. The State concedes that Brosseau\u2019s name was not on its witness list, and that it had not supplied the defendant with a copy of Brosseau\u2019s estimate before trial. The State, however, did not withhold this evidence to gain a strategic advantage. <em>Cf. State v. Arthur, </em>118 N.H. 561, 563, 391 A.2d 884, 885 (1978) (prosecutor\u2019s deliberate delay in complying with court-ordered discovery, for purpose of making evidence less useful to accused, did not necessarily warrant \u201ca new trial or the drastic remedy of reversal\u201d). The State had not anticipated using Brosseau\u2019s testimony or his estimate, and it turned to this evidence only after learning that it could not rely on Carroll or his insurer to establish the value of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car. Moreover, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that allowing Brosseau\u2019s testimony and his damage estimate would not unfairly prejudice the defendant. The defendant knew that the State had to prove the value of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car. Although the defendant had not known of Brosseau\u2019s damage estimate before trial, he had obtained a letter from Carroll\u2019s insurance company indicating that it paid a $1,705.45 claim to cover the estimated amount of damage to Carroll\u2019s car. Additionally, the defendant did not request a continuance to prepare for cross-examination of Brosseau, whose testimony was based in large part on price listings in motor vehicle parts manuals and could have been challenged through reasonable efforts by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The defendant also argues that Brosseau\u2019s estimate was irrelevant because it did not mirror the amount of coverage provided by Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>roll\u2019s insurer, or the amount Carroll actually paid to repair his car. Whether evidence is relevant, and thus admissible, is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>See Hammell, </em>128 N.H. at 789, 519 A.2d at 308. As discussed above, Brosseau\u2019s estimate was circumstantial evidence of the amount of Carroll\u2019s pecuniary loss. This evidence did \u201cnot have to be infallible to be admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790, 519 A.2d at 309 (quotation omitted). Weaknesses in this evidence, such as the discrepancy between the estimate to repair and the amount paid to Carroll for his loss, and the amount paid by Carroll to effect the repairs, were \u201ca matter of defense\u201d affecting the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 790-91, 519 A.2d at 309 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"> The defendant also argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by the admission of Brosseau\u2019s estimate. He contends that the estimate was nothing more than \u201ca general calculation which falls into the realm of speculation,\u201d and that its admission unfairly influenced the jury. The determination as to whether the probative value of relevant evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See State v. Trainor, </em>130 N.H. 371, 375, 540 A.2d 1236, 1239 (1988). To show that the trial court abused its discretion, the defendant must \u201cdemonstrate that the discretionary ruling [was] clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Cochran, </em>132 N.H. 670, 672, 569 A.2d 756, 757 (1990). \u201c[T]he prejudice required to predicate reversible error is an undue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Brosseau\u2019s estimate was not \u201cunreasonable or untenable.\u201d As discussed above, estimates have provided the basis for past felony convictions under RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992). <em>See Robidoux, </em>125 N.H. at 171, 480 A.2d at 69. In addition, while Brosseau\u2019s calculation of damage was an estimate, not a factual certainty, a witness qualified as an expert may provide opinion testimony as to scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that will assist the trier of fact. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 702. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Brosseau\u2019s estimate would assist the jury in determining whether the amount of damage to Carroll\u2019s car triggered the felony enhancement provision of RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>III. Qualification of Expert</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> The defendant next contends that the State did not establish Brosseau\u2019s qualifications as an expert. The party offering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>witness as an expert carries the burden of establishing the witness\u2019s qualifications. <em>See State v. Coleman, </em>133 N.H. 713, 715, 584 A.2d 755, 757 (1990). The trial court has wide discretion in admitting or excluding an expert opinion, and we will not reverse its decision unless we find a \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Tullgren v. Phil Lamoy Realty Corp., </em>125 N.H. 604, 609, 484 A.2d 1144, 1148 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In the present case, the trial court did not err in finding Brosseau qualified to testify. First, the State provided ample evidence attesting to Brosseau\u2019s qualifications to testify as to the estimated value of the damage to Carroll\u2019s car. Brosseau had worked in the auto body field for approximately twenty-seven years. When he examined Carroll\u2019s car, Brosseau was specifically employed as an estimator of damaged vehicles, a position requiring him to appraise between ten and twenty vehicles each day. Brosseau had earlier'been qualified in a Massachusetts district court to give expert testimony as to. motor vehicle damage. The trial court was justified in concluding that Brosseau was \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to testify on the cost of repairing damage to automobiles. Moreover, we have already found Brosseau\u2019s estimate probative of the cost of repairing Carroll\u2019s car. Thus, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that Brosseau\u2019s testimony would not assist the jury in determining the amount of pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>IV. Jury Nullification Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred in refusing his request for a jury nullification charge. Such a charge is used to inform the jury of its \u201chistorical prerogative\u201d to acquit a defendant even if the verdict is contrary to the law and the facts of the case. <em>State v. Brown, </em>132 N.H. 520, 526, 567 A.2d 544, 548 (1989). Here, the defendant was not entitled to a nullification charge as a matter of law, and it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to decide whether such an instruction was warranted. <em>See id. </em>at 527, 567 A.2d at 548. The defendant argues, however, that the trial court should have stated on the record the grounds for its refusal to give a nullification charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">We find that the trial court adequately responded to the defendant\u2019s request for a nullification charge when it noted that it was prepared to give the jury a so-called \u201creasonable doubt <em>Wentworth </em>Charge.\u201d <em>See State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 838-39, 395 A.2d 858, 860 (1978) (setting forth model jury charge on burden of proof, presumption of innocence, and reasonable doubt). The trial court instructed the jurors that \u201cif you find that the State has proven all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt, you <em>should </em>find the defendant guilty.\u201d We have recognized that use of the term \u201cshould\u201d in a <em>Wentworth </em>charge provides \u201cthe equivalent of a jury nullification instruction,\u201d in that the jurors are notified that they may acquit the defendant even if the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offenses charged. <em>Brown, </em>132 N.H. at 527, 567 A.2d at 548 (quotation omitted). In this case, a more specific response to the defendant\u2019s request was not required. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>V. Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The defendant finally argues that his conviction for felony criminal mischief and felonious use of a firearm subjected him to multiple punishments for the same offense, in violation of the guarantees against double jeopardy in the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In accord with <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 471 A.2d 347 (1983), we first address the defendant\u2019s State constitutional claim. Under the double jeopardy clause of the New Hampshire Constitution, <em>see </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 16, the legality of a defendant\u2019s indictment for separate crimes stemming from the same incident depends on whether \u201cproof of the elements of the crimes <em>as charged </em>will in actuality require a difference in evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Stratton, </em>132 N.H. 451, 454, 567 A.2d 986, 988 (1989) (quotation omitted). We have adopted this \u201cdifference in evidence\u201d test as \u201cthe benchmark for evaluating double jeopardy claims under the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In essence, the defendant contends that because proof of the elements of felony criminal mischief and felonious use of a firearm, as charged and in actuality, required no difference in evidence, his conviction for both crimes subjected him to double jeopardy. He argues that support for his argument lies in our decision in <em>Heald v. Perrin, </em>123 N.H. 468, 473-74, 464 A.2d 275, 278 (1983), where we held that Heald\u2019s convictions for robbery while armed with a deadly weapon and for felonious use of a firearm violated double jeopardy. We held that where use of a gun triggers a statute\u2019s enhancement provision, felonious use of a firearm \u201ccannot <em>also </em>be charged for commission of the same felony with the same gun because the elements of neither crime will require a single difference in evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 464 A.2d at 278 (emphasis in original). We were careful to caution against interpreting our holding too broadly and noted that \u201cfelonies which themselves are not enhanced because of the defendant\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>a gun are also not likely to run afoul of the double jeopardy prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 464 A.2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The case at hand concerns two statutory enhancements. The first is RSA 634:2,11(a) (Supp. 1992), which elevates the offense of criminal mischief from a misdemeanor to a class B felony where the \u201cactor purposely causes or attempts to cause pecuniary loss in excess of $1,000.\u201d The second enhancement is RSA 650-A:l (1986), which provides a second class B felony penalty for commission of a felony when armed with a firearm. A literal reading of <em>Heald, </em>without regard to our express caution in that case, would tend to support the defendant\u2019s argument. We must assess his argument, however, in the context of two later cases that further develop the \u201cdifference in evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>State v. Elbert, </em>128 N.H. 210, 512 A.2d 1114 (1986), we affirmed a defendant\u2019s convictions for attempted murder and for felonious use of a firearm, even though the murder attempt was perpetrated through use of a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 512 A.2d at 1115. In <em>Elbert, </em>the same evidence was used to prove the elements of the two crimes, as charged, but there was only one statutory enhancement, arising by virtue of the felonious use of a firearm. <em>Id. </em>We distinguished <em>Heald </em>as involving multiple penalty enhancements based on the same evidence; Heald\u2019s use of a gun not only enhanced the robbery offense to a class A felony, but it also allowed the imposition of a cumulative sentence under the felonious use statute. <em>See id. </em>at 214, 512 A.2d at 1116. In a second case, <em>State v. Houtenbrink, </em>130 N.H. 385, 539 A.2d 714 (1988), we applied the \u201cdifference in evidence\u201d standard of <em>Heald, </em>as developed in <em>Elbert, </em>and held that the defendant\u2019s convictions for first degree assault and for felonious use of a firearm violated double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 539 A.2d at 719. In <em>Houtenbrink, </em>the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm had already enhanced the underlying crime of assault to a class A felony. <em>Id. </em>We found unconstitutional the further enhancement for felonious use of a firearm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It is clear from <em>Elbert </em>and <em>Houtenbrink </em>that in cases involving multiple penalty enhancements, the double jeopardy analysis turns on the requirements of the enhancement statutes. As we stated in <em>Houtenbrink:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201c[I]f the underlying criminal statute has an enhancement provision for firearm use, which was charged in <em>Heald, </em>then a further enhancement for the felonious use of a firearm will be a double jeopardy violation. However, if the underlying criminal statute does not have an enhancement provision for use of a firearm, then an enhancement for the felonious use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>of a firearm does not result in a double jeopardy violation. The legislature may twice punish a defendant for the same act, and the decision to punish a defendant more severely if he uses a firearm in the commission of a felony is a permissible legislative decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 392, 539 A.2d at 719 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In this case, only one penalty enhancement, RSA 650-A: 1 (1986), turned on the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm. The enhancement provision in the underlying criminal mischief statute, RSA 634:2, 11(a) (Supp. 1992), was triggered not by use of a firearm, but by purposely causing pecuniary loss exceeding $1,000. We find that the defendant\u2019s convictions for both crimes did not run afoul of the double jeopardy clause of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The defendant\u2019s double jeopardy argument under the Federal Constitution requires a different analysis. The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment provides three protections: \u201cIt protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 516 (1990) (quotation omitted). The defendant\u2019s claim in the present case concerns the third category of protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Although the fifth amendment prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense, a single transaction can give rise to multiple, distinct offenses without violating the double jeopardy clause. <em>See Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 344 n.3 (1981). Where the same conduct violates two statutory provisions, \u201cthe touchstone of whether the double jeopardy clause is violated ... is the legislature\u2019s articulated intent. ...\u201d <em>State v. Bailey, </em>127 N.H. 811, 814, 508 A.2d 1066, 1069 (1986). If the legislature\u2019s intent to impose multiple punishments is clear from the face of a statute, or from the legislative history, the punishments will not violate the double jeopardy clause. <em>See Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368-69 (1983). We have expressly found that the New Hampshire Legislature \u201cclearly intended to authorize the imposition of separate sentences\u201d where a defendant\u2019s conduct both triggers the enhancement provisions in an underlying criminal statute, and satisfies the elements of the felonious use of a firearm statute. <em>Heald, </em>123 N.H. at 471, 464 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>276. The defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim under the Federal Constitution must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AP-\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
