The Concord District Court <em>{Sullivan, </em>J.) ruled in favor of the defendants, finding that the plaintiff had not performed a condition precedent to payment. The plaintiff appeals this decision, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-21\">In early August 1991, the defendants hired the plaintiff to help them subdivide a plot of land. The parties\u2019 contract specifies the \u201cOb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>jectives and Scope of Services\u201d as follows: \u201cConduct boundary survey of 19 acre parcel, subdivide 1 acre abutting Cole lot. Prepare minor subdivision plan for submission to City of Concord. To present subdivision plan and procure Planning Board approval.\u201d Under the heading, \u201cBudget Estimate,\u201d the contract states, \u201cWork to be done at standard hourly rates. Lump sum figure $3,000.00.\u201d Immediately following the number, \u201c$3,000.00,\u201d appear the handwritten words, \u201c(Not to exceed),\u201d and defendant Jerry McCarthy\u2019s initials. Paragraph eleven of the contract states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u2019\u2019Billing/Payments. Invoices for [the plaintiff\u2019s] services shall be submitted on a semi-monthly basis .... All such invoices shall be payable within fifteen (15) days after the date thereof and shall, in the event that payment is not duly made, bear interest at the rate of two percent (2%) a month from date of original billing .... It is further understood that if there be failure by [the defendants] to pay any invoice due to the [plaintiff] within fifteen (15) days after the date thereof, the [plaintiff] may . . . terminate its performance hereunder. In the event that the [plaintiff] places any invoice which is unpaid after the due date in the hands of any agency or an attorney for collection, [the defendants] shall pay all costs and expenses of such collection, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">At the end of this paragraph appear more handwritten words\u2014 \u2019\u2019Based upon Percentage of Completion\u201d \u2014 and, again, Jerry McCarthy\u2019s initials. Both parties agree that the handwritten words are binding amendments to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The plaintiff performed \u201ca substantial amount of work\u201d under the contract and obtained conditional approval from the Concord Planning Board for the defendants\u2019 proposed subdivision.on September 18, 1991. The conditions placed on final approval stemmed from the discovery that the defendants\u2019 land contains a habitat for the Earner Blue butterfly, an endangered species. The conditions require \u201c[t]he conveyance of a buffer easement to the New Hampshire Natural Heritage Inventory (NHNHI) for lot 19 for the area so noted on the subdivision plan ... [and] [t]he development of a management agreement between the owner of lot 12 for the Earner Blue Habitat on said lot.\u201d These two conditions apparently have not been met, and therefore, the defendants have yet to receive final board approval for their proposed subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The defendants have also yet to pay the plaintiff for any of the work performed under the contract, although the plaintiff sent them four invoices for services rendered. The invoices were dated August 9,1991, August 23,1991, September 6,1991, and November 15,1991, and listed, respectively, the following amounts due: $65, $3,010, $100, and $1,185.51. In response to the plaintiff\u2019s suit to recover these amounts, the defendants claimed that the parties\u2019 contract obligates the plaintiff to procure final board approval and makes such approval a condition precedent to any payment. The plaintiff disagreed, maintaining that it fully performed under the contract, and that the conditions imposed by the board for final approval were unforeseeable and beyond the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s expertise. Each party alleged that the other failed to cooperate in attempting to obtain final approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The district court held a hearing and admitted extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract. The court decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cWhile the testimony is clearly in conflict, I conclude that based upon my review of the testimony and documentary evidence the Plaintiff has not completed the contract as envisioned by the parties. Final sub-division approval has not been obtained and I conclude that the Plaintiff is not entitled to be paid under the contract as I interpret its terms and conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Before this court, the plaintiff makes the same arguments it made below and asks that we enter judgment in its favor. The defendants also repeat their earlier contentions, arguing first that the contract provision regarding the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to procure board approval is ambiguous. Consequently, they contend, the district court properly admitted extrinsic evidence to determine whether such approval is a condition precedent to payment under the contract. <em>See Erin Food Servs., Inc. v. 688 Props., </em>119 N.H. 232, 235, 401 A.2d 201, 203 (1979). Because the plaintiff has not provided us with a transcript of the trial proceedings, the defendants maintain that the district court\u2019s findings are presumed to be supported by the evidence and, hence, are unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> We note that the interpretation of a contract, including whether a contract term is ambiguous, is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. <em>See Gamble v. University of New Hampshire, </em>136 N.H. 9, 13, 610 A.2d 357, 360 (1992). As elaborated below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>our review of the entire contract persuades us that the provisions relating to board approval are not ambiguous and, in fact, manifestly support the plaintiff\u2019s argument that final board approval is not a condition precedent to payment. Accordingly, extrinsic evidence should not have been used to contradict the contract, <em>see Parkhurst v. Gibson (Parkhurst), </em>133 N.H. 57, 62, 573 A.2d 454, 457 (1990); <em>Logic Assoc\u2019s, Inc. v. Time Share Corp., </em>124 N.H. 565, 572, 474 A.2d 1006, 1010 (1984), and we need not accord deference to any findings based on such evidence. Instead, we conduct an independent examination of the contract and derive its meaning therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We turn now to the question of final board approval and the plaintiff\u2019s right to collect payment in the absence thereof. We first note that \u201cconditions precedent are not favored, and we will not so construe such conditions unless required by the plain language of the agreement.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Kelly, </em>130 N.H. 773, 781, 547 A.2d 284, 289 (1988). \u201cAs a rule of thumb, provisions which commence with words such as \u2018if,\u2019 \u2018on condition that,\u2019 \u2018subject to\u2019 and \u2018provided\u2019 create conditions precedent.\u201d J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, The Law of Contracts \u00a7 11-9, at 448 (3rd ed. 1987). In the provision of the contract relied on by the defendants, none of these signal words appear to alert a party that a condition precedent may exist. Instead, the provision labelled \u201cObjectives and Scope of Services\u201d simply reads, in relevant part: \u201cTo present subdivision plan and procure Planning Board approval.\u201d Payment is not discussed until the following section, and no hint is given in either place that the latter is contingent upon performance of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Moreover, any possible doubt concerning payment is resolved by paragraph eleven of the contract, entitled \u201cBilling/Payments.\u201d This provides that \u201c[i]nvoices for [the plaintiff\u2019s] services shall be submitted on a semi-monthly basis\u201d and that interest will accrue whenever the defendants fail to pay within fifteen days of the billing date. Defendant Jerry McCarthy\u2019s handwritten note adds that payment shall be \u201c[b]ased upon [percentage of [e]ompletion.\u201d Viewing this paragraph in relation to the provision regarding planning board approval, the defendants could not reasonably assume they would not have to pay the plaintiff anything until final board approval was obtained. The paragraph plainly envisions periodic payments by the defendants during the course of the plaintiff\u2019s performance. In addition, Jerry McCarthy\u2019s handwritten amendment, if read with the defendants\u2019 interpretation in mind, is utterly inexplicable. It is inconceivable that the parties would specifically agree that payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>be based on \u201cPercentage of Completion\u201d if they understood the payment obligation to commence only upon procurement of final board approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Finally, we note that final board approval is, in the last analysis, out of the plaintiff\u2019s control. Only the planning board \u2014 or a reviewing court \u2014 possesses the authority to grant such approval. Although the plaintiff should be held to take all reasonable steps to help attain this goal, its compensation should not depend upon a favorable vote of the planning board, which has considerable discretion, absent clear language to the contrary. \u201cThis court will, where possible, avoid construing a contract in a manner that leads to harsh and unreasonable results or places one party at the mercy of the other.\u201d <em>Thiem v. Thomas, </em>119 N.H. 598, 604, 406 A.2d 115, 119 (1979). Accordingly, we hold that final board approval of the defendants\u2019 subdivision plan is not a condition precedent to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AaE2\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
