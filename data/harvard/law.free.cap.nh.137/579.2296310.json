J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWx\">Defendant Sentry Insurance Company (Sentry) appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Barry, </em>J.) requiring Sentry to provide $300,000 in coverage in connection with an automobile accident in 1986 that killed James O\u2019Connell. On appeal, Sentry argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that O\u2019Connell did not qualify as a \u201cresidence employee\u201d under the applicable insurance policy and, therefore, no coverage is available. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Bruce and Debbie Allen operate Allen\u2019s Coal Company, Inc. (Allen\u2019s Coal) from their home in Derry. Allen\u2019s Coal sells coal for fuel to customers in southern New Hampshire. The coal is stored in bulk and packaged at the Allens\u2019 residence and is then delivered by truck to customers. Debbie Allen is the sole stockholder of Allen\u2019s Coal, and Bruce Allen is an employee of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In December 1984, Sentry issued a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy to Bruce and Debbie Allen to protect their residence in Derry. This policy contained endorsements that extended coverage for the workers\u2019 compensation claims of residence employees and for the business use of the residence premises. The business use endorsement noted that the Allens\u2019 residence was used for the business purpose of selling and delivering coal. This policy was in effect at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On August 25,1986, James O\u2019Connell died from injuries sustained when Allen\u2019s Coal\u2019s delivery truck collided with another motor vehicle in Manchester. O\u2019Connell was a passenger in the truck being driven by Bruce Allen, as the two were returning from a coal delivery. O\u2019Connell worked in the Allens\u2019 coal business and did chores around the Allens\u2019 house and yard. His wages were paid entirely by Allen\u2019s Coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Bruce Allen filed a petition for declaratory judgment against Sentry and Marianne DeWyngaert, the administratrix of the estate of James O\u2019Connell. The petition was later amended to include Allen\u2019s Coal as a plaintiff. The plaintiffs sought to establish that Sentry was obligated to provide coverage for liability arising from O\u2019Connell\u2019s death. The trial court ruled that O\u2019Connell was a \u201cresidence employee\u201d under the Allens\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy and, therefore, Sentry was obligated to provide coverage under the business use endorsement. Sentry appeals from the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> The interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Laconia Rod &amp; Gun Club v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co., </em>123 N.H. 179, 182, 459 A.2d 249, 250 (1983). \u201cWe construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Niedzielski v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>134 N.H. 141, 146, 589 A.2d 130, 133 (1991) (quotations omitted). Ambiguous language in the insurance contract will be construed against the insurer. <em>Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>130 N.H. 117, 120, 536 A.2d 164, 166 (1987). The specific expectations of the insureds are relevant to our analysis \u201conly in light of an ambiguity in the policy, or, in the absence of an ambiguity, if it is proved that the parties\u2019 prior dealings led the insured[s] to form a reasonable belief that the policy provided the claimed coverage.\u201d <em>V &amp; V Corp. v. American Policyholders\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>127 N.H. 372, 380, 500 A.2d 695, 700 (1985) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The homeowner\u2019s insurance policy held by the Allens generally provides coverage for \u201call sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury.\u201d The policy specifically excludes coverage for bodily injury \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of . . . any motor vehicle owned or operated by . .. any Insured.\u201d This motor vehicle exclusion, however, does not apply \u201cto bodily injury to any residence employee arising out of and in the course of his employment by any Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The first question we must address is whether James O\u2019Connell was a \u201cresidence employee\u201d as defined in the policy. Unless he qualified as a residence employee, coverage under the policy for liability arising from the collision is excluded by the motor vehicle exclusion. The policy defines a residence employee as <em>\u201can employee of any Insured </em>whose duties are in connection with the maintenance or use of the insured premises, including the performance of household or domestic services, or who performs elsewhere duties of a similar nature not in connection with any Insured\u2019s business.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">O\u2019Connell was not a residence employee under the policy\u2019s definition because he was not an employee of an insured. The homeowner\u2019s policy unambiguously designates Bruce and Debbie Allen as the policy\u2019s insureds. At the time of the accident, however, O\u2019Connell was serving as an employee of Allen\u2019s Coal, which was not an insured under the policy. The plaintiffs and O\u2019Connell\u2019s estate argue that O\u2019Connell worked for the Allens doing yard work and chores around their home as well as in the coal business. His wages, however, were paid entirely by Allen\u2019s Coal. Moreover, even if O\u2019Connell could be considered an employee of the Allens when he did chores around their house, his employee status during those tasks would not carry over into his work in the coal business, which was for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Allen\u2019s Coal, and in which O\u2019Connell was engaged at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">Despite the clear language of the policy designating Bruce and Debbie Allen as insureds, the plaintiffs and O\u2019Connell\u2019s estate argue that we should find coverage under the policy in accordance with the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201c[biased on the parties\u2019 discussions, the Al-lens had a reasonable belief that liability coverage would be provided by Sentry for their coal business.\u201d The Allens had requested insurance for their business when they approached Sentry\u2019s agent about purchasing a policy, and Sentry\u2019s agent had reviewed Allen\u2019s Coal\u2019s existing business policy before issuing the homeowner\u2019s policy in dispute. The plaintiffs and O\u2019Connell\u2019s estate contend that because the Allens believed that Sentry would provide liability coverage for the coal business, Allen\u2019s Coal should be considered a named insured under the homeowner\u2019s policy, thus making O\u2019Connell an employee of an insured at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The trial court\u2019s finding regarding the insureds\u2019 expectations does not lead us to find coverage in this case. As noted above, the insureds\u2019 expectations are relevant to our interpretation of an unambiguous insurance contract only when the parties\u2019 prior dealings led the insureds to reasonably believe that the policy provided for the coverage now claimed. <em>See V &amp; V Corp., </em>127 N.H. at 380, 500 A.2d at 700; <em>Karol v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>120 N.H. 287, 290-91, 414 A.2d 939, 941 (1980). As a preliminary matter, no evidence was presented at trial to suggest that the parties\u2019 dealings led the insureds to a specific expectation that liability arising from an automobile collision involving an employee like O\u2019Connell would be covered under the homeowner\u2019s policy. Assuming that the Allens believed Sentry would provide liability coverage for the coal business, there is still no indication that they reasonably expected that sort of coverage to insure this type of accident. If the Allens had obtained a general liability policy from Sentry to insure Allen\u2019s Coal, that policy likely would have contained a motor vehicle exclusion similar to the one in the homeowner\u2019s policy, which would have precluded coverage in this case. <em>See </em>R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law 1253 (practitioner\u2019s ed. 1988). The expectation that Sentry would provide liability coverage for the business is certainly not the same as expecting Allen\u2019s Coal to receive all the benefits and coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy as a named insured. Without evidence of a reasonable expectation of specific coverage, we will not reform the unambiguous wording of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>homeowner\u2019s policy, and we conclude that Sentry is not obligated to provide coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AEqO\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
