He argues that a police officer\u2019s statements at trial constituted impermissible opinion testimony, warranting reversal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The defendant was convicted of sexually assaulting a thirteen-year-old girl. At trial, Officer Paula Glennon described an interview she conducted with the victim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201cWe start off \u2014 I\u2019ll start off and ask her basically what happened and have her go through the entire story, jot down notes while she\u2019s saying it. Then from the notes, I\u2019ll get clarification in certain areas, go back, jump from point to point within the story so that I know that there\u2019s a consistency in the story and that she is telling the truth about did what [sic] happen. Sometimes what happens is that in doing so, you start to get the feeling that it may not \u2014 the victim may not be telling the truth and is possibly doing this for some other reason. And that was not the case with [this victim].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Defense counsel objected that Officer Glennon impermissibly gave an opinion about the victim\u2019s credibility, and moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion and gave the following curative instruction to the jury: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, it is for you, of course, to decide who is telling the truth in this matter; and other people\u2019s opinions about who might be telling the truth are not for you to consider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Later on in her testimony regarding the interview, Officer Glennon stated that the victim was apprehensive about \u201ctalking about her body, the different parts of her body and what had happened to her.\u201d The prosecutor then asked the officer whether she had encountered that type of apprehension before. Defense counsel objected on the grounds of relevancy, and the prosecutor replied, \u201cI\u2019m trying to have the witness explain from her experience why this witness would be apprehensive.\u201d Defense counsel made no further comment, and the court overruled the objection. The prosecutor then repeated his question to Officer Glennon, who answered as follows: \u201cYes. In adults as well as juveniles. People just don\u2019t want to \u2014 that\u2019s right, very quiet about talking \u2014 they\u2019re talking about their own parts of the body, and it\u2019s just something that\u2019s not commonly discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Regarding the first claim of error, the State concedes that Officer Glennon impermissibly offered her opinion of the victim\u2019s credibility when she stated that she did not \u201cget the feeling\u201d the victim was lying. The State, however, maintains that this testimony did not warrant a mistrial because the trial court\u2019s curative instructions sufficiently diminished the impact of any prejudice that might have resulted from the introduction of these statements. We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cThe standard of review of the denial of a motion for a mistrial is whether the trial court abused its discretion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>basis for granting a mistrial is the existence of some circumstances which indicates that justice may not be done if the trial continues to verdict. <em>The remarks or the conduct must be more than merely inadmissible; they must constitute an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions. </em>Thus, even if prejudicial testimony was introduced against the defendant, the motion for mistrial may be denied because curative instructions are presumed to be followed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><em>State v. Lemire, </em>130 N.H. 552, 554-55, 543 A.2d 425, 426-27 (1988) (emphasis added) (citations and quotation omitted). Here, the curative instructions squarely addressed the defendant\u2019s fear that Officer Glennon\u2019s opinion would encourage the jury to shirk its responsibility to determine the victim\u2019s credibility. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s concise statement to the jury accomplished this without unduly highlighting the objectionable testimony. <em>Cf. State v. LaBranche, </em>118 N.H. 176, 179-80, 385 A.2d 108, 110 (1978). We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Turning to the defendant\u2019s second claim of error, concerning Officer Glennon\u2019s testimony that people are normally apprehensive about discussing parts of their bodies, we first note that the sole ground of objection below was relevancy. Therefore, we do not address the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal that Officer Glennon\u2019s testimony constituted impermissible lay opinion testimony. <em>See State v. VanDerHeyden, </em>136 N.H. 277, 282, 615 A.2d 1246, 1249 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We also dismiss his relevancy argument. New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 401 defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d The defendant concedes in his brief that \u201cevidence that would help the jury determine [the victim\u2019s] credibility would have been relevant.\u201d The jury heard testimony describing the victim\u2019s apprehensive demeanor and hesitancy during her interview with Officer Glennon, and this could have raised doubts regarding her credibility. The officer\u2019s testimony that people are normally apprehensive discussing parts of their bodies was relevant to dispel such doubts. <em>See VanDerHeyden, </em>136 N.H. at 283, 615 A.2d at 1249. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
