The issue before us is whether these policies afford such coverage, where the hospital reported the incidents giving rise to the lawsuits to the JUA during the policy periods. We hold that the policies do provide such coverage and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The hospital purchased three substantially identical one-year professional liability insurance policies from the JUA for the period of July 29, 1986, through July 29, 1989, and thereafter purchased its insurance from Conn Med. Each JUA policy is labelled, \u201cHOSPITAL PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM \u2014 CLAIMS MADE,\u201d and at the top of the first page of the policies is a box entitled, \u201cTO OUR POLICYHOLDER,\u201d which reads as follows: <em>\u201cThis is a claims made policy. It covers claims </em>arising from the performance of professional services subsequent to the retroactive date indicated <em>ami first brought against you while the policy is in force. </em>Please review the policy carefully and discuss the coverage with your insurance agent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under the box is the caption, \u201cINSURING AGREEMENTS,\u201d the first of which, \u201cCOVERAGE,\u201d states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cTo pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages <em>because of any claim or claims made against the insured during the policy period </em>arising out of the performance of professional services rendered or which should have been rendered, subsequent to the retroactive date, by the insured or by any person for whose acts or omissions the insured is legally responsible . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">(Emphasis added and omitted.) Several words and phrases, such as \u201cinsured\u201d and \u201cpolicy period,\u201d are defined in the policy, but the word \u201cclaim\u201d is not. Section II of the policies is entitled \u201cCOVERAGE PERIOD\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cThis insurance applies only to professional services rendered or which should have been rendered after the retroac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tive date stated in the declarations and then <em>only if claim is first made during the policy period.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\"><em>If any claim, is first made during the policy period alleging injury to an individual </em>that would be covered by this policy, any additional claims made subsequent to the policy period for damages resulting from the same injury to the same individual shall be considered a claim hereunder. <em>A claim shall be considered to be first made when the company first receives written notice of the claim or occurrence. </em>(See Condition 3 for insured\u2019s rights to have extended reporting endorsements issued.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">(Emphasis added and omitted.) On July 27,1989, two days before the last JUA policy expired, the hospital notified the JUA in writing of thirty-six \u201cpatient events.\u201d On August 1, 1989, the hospital declined the JUA\u2019s offer to purchase an \u201cextended reporting period endorsement,\u201d explaining that \u201cour new policy\u2019with Conn Med will pick up prior acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Since the JUA policies expired, some of the \u201cpatient events\u201d reported to the JUA have resulted in malpractice suits filed against the hospital. Although Conn Med undertook the hospital\u2019s defense of these suits, a deductible in the Conn Med policies has left the hospital with $50,000 in out-of-pocket losses. The hospital asked the JUA for coverage, citing the third sentence of section II, but the JUA refused. The hospital then sued the JUA in a declaratory judgment action, and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The JUA\u2019s motion included a plea to dismiss the hospital\u2019s action as untimely filed. The superior court ruled the action timely, but agreed with the JUA that its policies were \u201cclaims made\u201d and thus did not cover claims filed against the hospital after the policies expired. As the court found no evidence of such a claim made during the policy period, it granted the JUA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The hospital appeals, arguing that the trial court misinterpreted the language of the JUA policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\"> It is ultimately for this court to interpret the language of insurance policies. <em>See Gagnon v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>133 N.H. 70, 73, 573 A.2d 137, 139 (1990). Where disputed terms are not defined in the policy or by State judicial precedent, we construe them in context, <em>see Amica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Morrison, </em>130 N.H. 250, 252, 255, 536 A.2d 199, 200, 202 (1987), and \u201cin the light of what a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an ordinarily intelligent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>sured,\u201d <em>Aetna Insurance Co. v. State Motors, </em>109 N.H. 120, 125, 244 A.2d 64, 67 (1968); <em>see also Coakley v. Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>136 N.H. 402, 409-10, 618 A.2d 777, 781 (1992). This is an objective standard. <em>Karol v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>120 N.H. 287, 290, 414 A.2d 939, 941 (1980). Where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 771, 423 A.2d 980, 984 (1980). Ambiguities, however, are construed against the insurer, <em>see Gagnon, </em>133 N.H. at 74-75, 573 A.2d at 140; <em>Trombly, </em>120 N.H. at 770-72, 423 A.2d at 984-85, and the burden is on the insurance carrier to prove a lack of coverage, RSA 491:22-a (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Turning to the words of the JUA policies at issue here, we first note that the title and the first sentence of the policies declare the contracts to be of the \u201cclaims made\u201d variety. As the JUA points out, the term \u201cclaims made\u201d in insurance law refers to liability policies that afford coverage for tort claims that are both made against the insured and reported to the insurance company during the policy period. <em>See Chas. T. Main, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 862, 863-64, 551 N.E.2d 28, 29 (1990). Assuming \u2014 as the JUA does \u2014 that the tort claims at issue here were not made against the hospital until after the JUA policies expired, we agree that the hospital would not be entitled to coverage under a standard \u201cclaims made\u201d policy. The JUA policies, however, are not \u201cclaims made\u201d simply because they say they are. \u201cClaims made\u201d is a category of policies that contain certain provisions; without those provisions, no amount of labelling can make these policies \u201cclaims made\u201d or induce us to treat them as such. The layperson of average intelligence does not know what \u201cclaims made\u201d refers to and cannot be expected to read crucial provisions into the term. <em>Cf. Coakley, </em>136 N.H. at 414-15, 618 A.2d at 784-85 (discussing plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cdamages\u201d). The insurance company must spell out the provisions of a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Accordingly, we disregard the labels attached to the JUA policies and examine the various provisions themselves. We agree with the JUA that the first three relevant policy provisions support its contention that the policies are indeed \u201cclaims made.\u201d The first provision states that the policy \u201ccovers claims . . . first brought against you while the policy is in force.\u201d The second promises to pay all sums the hospital becomes obligated to pay as damages \u201cbecause of any claim or claims made against the [hospital] during the policy period.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) The third states, \u201cThis insurance applies only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>... if claim is first made during the policy period.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Again, on the assumption that no \u201cclaims\u201d were made against the hospital before the JUA policies expired, these provisions \u2014 when read in isolation \u2014 would preclude coverage for the defense and indemnification of the lawsuits at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">A fourth provision of the JUA policies, however, explains and modifies the third provision\u2019s requirement that claims be \u201cfirst made\u201d during the policy period. This fourth provision, found in section II of the policies, reads, \u201cA claim shall be considered to <em>he first made </em>when the company first receives written notice of the claim <em>or occurrence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The JUA does not dispute that the \u201cpatient events\u201d described by the hospital are \u201coccurrences.\u201d Because the hospital notified the JUA of the \u201cpatient events\u201d two days before the policies expired, this fourth provision supports the hospital\u2019s view that its \u201cclaims\u201d were, in fact, \u201cfirst made\u201d during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The JUA objects that the hospital reads this provision out of context. In the interest of clarity, we set forth again section II of the policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cThis insurance applies only to professional services rendered or which should have been rendered after the retroactive date stated in the declarations and then only if claim is first made during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">If any claim is first made during the policy period alleging injury to an individual that would be covered by this policy, any additional claims made subsequent' to the policy period for damages resulting from the same injury to the same individual shall be considered a claim hereunder. <em>A claim shall be considered to be first made when the company first receives written notice of the claim or occurrence. </em>(See Condition 3 for insured\u2019s rights to have extended reporting endorsements issued.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">(Emphasis added and omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The JUA argues in its brief that the sentence emphasized above and relied on by the hospital modifies only the sentence immediately preceding it, concerning delayed manifestation injuries. We find that it modifies the first sentence of section II as well. An examination of the wording of the section supports this. The first sentence ends and the second sentence begins with virtually the same phrase \u2014 \u201dif [any] claim is first made during the policy period\u201d (emphasis omitted)\u2014 thus indicating continuity of thought and subject matter. The third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>sentence then appears to explain what this phrase means: \u201cA claim shall be considered to be first made when the company first receives written notice of the claim or occurrence.\u201d It is logical for a reader to assume that if the third sentence of section II explains the meaning of a phrase in the second sentence, it should also explain the meaning of an identical phrase found in the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Moreover, under the JUA\u2019s interpretation of the third sentence, the policies would contain no reporting requirement for claims not arising from delayed manifestation injuries, such as the ones at issue here. The third sentence of section II contains the JUA policies\u2019 only requirement that the insured report \u201cclaims\u201d to the JUA. Thus, if this sentence modified only the preceding sentence, relating to delayed manifestation injuries, the policies\u2019 only reporting requirement would apply solely to delayed manifestation injury claims. Because part of the JUA\u2019s definition of a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy is that all tort claims against the insured must be reported to the insurance company within the policy period, the JUA\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the third sentence would support a finding that their policies are not \u201cclaims made\u201d policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The JUA next contends that, in the first sentence of section II, the word \u201cclaim\u201d means a tort claim brought against the hospital, but that, in the second and third sentences, \u201cclaim\u201d refers only to the hospital\u2019s claim for insurance coverage. This is a variation of the JUA\u2019s earlier argument that the third sentence does not modify the first sentence\u2019s requirement that \u201cclaims\u201d be \u201cfirst made during the policy period.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) It is unlikely, however, that a layperson of average intelligence would so interpret the policies. Nothing in section II or any other part of the policies mandates the interpretation that \u201cclaim\u201d sometimes means \u201ctort claim\u201d and other times means \u201cinsurance claim.\u201d On the contrary, as described above, the language of the section strongly suggests that the three sentences should be read as a whole. If \u201cclaim\u201d means \u201ctort claim\u201d in the first sentence, it means \u201ctort claim\u201d in the second and third sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Moreover, if we hold the JUA to its earlier argument that the third sentence modifies only the second sentence, the word \u201cclaim\u201d in the third sentence must mean \u201ctort claim\u201d because the word means \u201ctort claim\u201d in the second sentence. The second sentence, after all, refers to \u201cclaim[s] . . . alleging injury to an individual\u201d and \u201cclaims . . . for damages resulting from the same injury to the same individual.\u201d These \u201cclaims\u201d are obviously \u201ctort claims,\u201d not \u201cinsurance claims.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Also, the JUA\u2019s argument that the word \u201cclaim\u201d means \u201cinsurance claim\u201d in the third sentence would again leave the JUA with no reporting requirement for non-delayed manifestation injury claims, thus defeating its contention that these are \u201cclaims made\u201d policies. We conclude that the JUA policies clearly and unambiguously provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The JUA also argues that, regardless of the language of the policies, we should interpret them not to provide coverage here because the hospital bought the policies believing it would not be covered for claims such as these. In support of this argument, the JUA cites <em>Town of Epping v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., </em>122 N.H. 248, 444 A.2d 496 (1982), in which this court held that the parties\u2019 actual belief regarding coverage controlled the interpretation of a policy, even though the same language had been held ambiguous in another case. This case is inapplicable here, however, because the JUA policies are unambiguous. Absent ambiguity, our search for the parties\u2019 intent here is limited to the words of the policies. <em>Cf. Parkhurst v. Gibson (Parkhurst), </em>133 N.H. 57, 62, 573 A.2d 454, 457 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The JUA next argues that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling because doing so would not cause the hospital to suffer any net loss. The JUA explains that the hospital\u2019s Conn Med policies have been much cheaper than the JUA policies would have been for the same periods \u2014 in part because of the $25,000 per claim deductible \u2014 and have provided more coverage in some areas. The hospital, in fact, has saved several hundred thousand dollars by switching to Conn Med. Thus, the JUA states, the hospital will still \u201ccome out ahead\u201d if it is forced to pay the $50,000 not covered by Conn Med and now sought under the JUA policies. Whether or not the hospital already \u201ccomes out ahead,\u201d however, is irrelevant to the question of coverage. We cannot fault the hospital for attempting to minimize its losses by making reasonable claims under its JUA policies. Concededly, it would be unfair for the hospital to seek coverage it did not pay for. But whether the JUA policies cover the claims at issue is the entire subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Finally, the JUA asserts that the hospital\u2019s declaratory judgment action was untimely filed in the superior court. The superior court, however, ruled that it was timely filed. Because the JUA did not file a cross-appeal or move to add this question on appeal, we will not review it. <em>See In re \u201cK\u201d, </em>132 N.H. 4, 16, 561 A.2d 1063, 1071 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>In sum, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling and hold that the JUA policies cover the defense and indemnification of the lawsuits described. The incidents giving rise to the lawsuits occurred \u2014 and were reported to the JUA \u2014 during the policy periods, and under our reading of the policy language, coverage must follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AUV_\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
