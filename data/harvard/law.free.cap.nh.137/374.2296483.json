Peterson, sued the defendant, Lawrence N. Gray, M.D., for medical malpractice. Following a jury verdict for the defendant, the plaintiff moved to set it aside and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Superior Court <em>(Gray, </em>J.) denied the motions, and the plaintiff appeals, arguing that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and that the trial court\u2019s instructions were erroneous. We agree that the court\u2019s charge to the jury contained erroneous instructions on the issues of proximate cause and aggravation of pre-existing conditions. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The plaintiff sought treatment from the defendant, a hand surgeon, because she was experiencing pain in her left hand. The defendant diagnosed arthritis in her carpal metacarpal joint, as well as de Quervain\u2019s disease, a type of tendonitis. To relieve the pain caused by the arthritis, the defendant recommended and performed a trapeziectomy \u2014 that is, the removal of the trapezium, one of eight bones in the wrist \u2014 and filled the space with folded tendons in a procedure known as the \u201canchovy procedure\u201d because the tendons are folded over like anchovies. Following the operation, another wrist bone, the scaphoid, rotated into the space where the trapezium had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>been, despite the \u201canchovy procedure,\u201d causing the plaintiff\u2019s wrist to collapse and necessitating the fusion of her wrist bones. The plaintiff can now use her left hand only in an \u201cassistive\u201d capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Both parties agree that, during the course of the trapeziectomy, the defendant initially misidentified the scaphoid as the trapezium and mistakenly severed at least three ligaments that connected the scaphoid to two neighboring bones, the lunate and the radius. At trial, the defendant testified that he quickly recognized and repaired his mistake, causing the plaintiff no ill effects. The plaintiff, on the other hand, questioned the effectiveness of the defendant\u2019s repair and argued that the error amounted to negligence and proximately caused the collapse of her wrist. The defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, maintaining that the wrist collapse was an inherent risk of the medically accepted trapeziectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury as to the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s case, including proximate cause. The trial court\u2019s instruction on proximate cause was particularly important in this case because there was no question that the plaintiff had a pre-existing condition relative to her left wrist. The trial court initially defined proximate cause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201cAn injury or damage is proximately caused by an act or a failure to act whenever you judge from the evidence in the case that the act or omission probably played a substantial part in bringing about or actually causing the injury, and that the injury or damage was either a direct result or a reasonably probable consequence of the act or omission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Although the court occasionally spoke of the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s act or failure to act was a substantial factor in bringing about the alleged injury,\u201d the court twice instructed the jury not to award damages to the plaintiff unless she proved that the defendant\u2019s actions were <em>\u201cthe </em>proximate cause\u201d of her injuries. (Emphasis added.) Eegarding the plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing wrist problems, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">\u201cShould you have occasion to consider the issue of damages in this case, you may not include in the award any amount to cover any physical condition which pre-existed the events complained of. You may only consider those injuries which you find to have been a natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s fault, if any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The plaintiff objected to the court\u2019s causation instructions, maintaining that they implied the plaintiff could only recover damages if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>proved that the defendant\u2019s mistake was the sole cause of her injuries. In response, the trial court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cDid the defendant breach the standard of care, and were those injuries \u2014 was that breach a substantial cause of the injuries and the damages of which she presently complains, <em>keep in mind with respect to her prior injuries or the status of her health. </em>If you find such \u2014 for whatever degree you may find the prior condition of her health, while that\u2014 they\u2019re not a factor in this case; <em>anyone takes someone as they find them,. </em>So that prior injuries <em>may or may not </em>figure in, if you find \u2014 if you further first find negligence, <em>you may find that prior injuries were aggravated by or prior conditions were aggravated by that negligence. That\u2019s okay for you to do that, </em>if you do that \u2014 you choose to do that; but you must find, to award a verdict for the plaintiff in this case\u2014 you must find that she has met her burden of proof as to the fact that \u2014 if you find that fact as to the doctor\u2019s negligence, in accordance with that standard of care I gave you, as to the causation and as to the damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff objected to this statement of the law, too, but the trial court gave no further instructions. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed, arguing as she did below that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the issues of proximate cause and aggravation of pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The standards for reviewing a court\u2019s jury instructions are well established. \u201cThe purpose of jury instructions is to identify the factual issues which are material for a resolution of the case, and to inform the jury of the appropriate standards by which they are to decide them.\u201d <em>Johnston v. Lynch, </em>133 N.H. 79, 89, 574 A.2d 934, 940 (1990). \u201cIt [is] the duty of the Trial Court to fully and correctly instruct the jury as to the law applicable to the case . . . .\u201d <em>Cyr v. Sanborn, </em>101 N.H. 245, 250, 140 A.2d 92, 96 (1958). Accordingly, \u201cthe test for determining whether an erroneous civil jury charge is reversible error is whether the jury <em>could have been misled\u201d </em>into basing its verdict on a misperception of the law. <em>Bernier v. Demers, </em>121 N.H. 217, 218, 427 A.2d 514, 515 (1981). \u201cIt is not necessary that a court use the exact words of any party\u2019s request. Rather, the test of adequacy of any charge is whether, taken as a whole, it fairly presented the case to the jury in such a manner that no injustice was done to the legal rights of the litigants.\u201d <em>Rawson v. Bradshaw, </em>125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>N.H. 94, 100, 480 A.2d 37, 41 (1984) (citation and quotation omitted). After reviewing the trial court\u2019s charge as a whole, we conclude that the jury could have been misled by the court\u2019s instructions and that an injustice was done to the legal rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"> Examining the instructions relating to proximate cause first, we note the principle that a defendant\u2019s negligence need not be \u201cthe sole cause\u201d of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries to warrant an award of damages. <em>See </em>W. Keeton <em>et al, </em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 41, at 266 (5th ed. 1984). \u201cIt is for this reason that instructions to the jury that they must find the defendant\u2019s conduct to be \u2018the sole cause,\u2019 or \u2018the dominant cause,\u2019 or \u2018the proximate cause\u2019 of the injury are rightly condemned as misleading error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court here twice stated that the plaintiff had to prove the defendant\u2019s actions were <em>\u201cthe </em>proximate cause\u201d of her injuries before she would be entitled to damages. Although the court also used the words <em>\u201ca </em>proximate result\u201d and \u201ca substantial factor,\u201d the court never explained the basic principle that a plaintiff does not have to show that a defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of his or her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We find that the jury could have been misled by these instructions. <em>Bernier, </em>121 N.H. at 218, 427 A.2d at 515. The question of causation was undoubtedly the crucial issue in this case, and no one disputed that the defendant operated on the plaintiff\u2019s hand because she had arthritis. In the chain of causation leading to her wrist fusion, the plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing arthritis obviously played a major part. But if the jury determined that the plaintiff\u2019s arthritis was <em>\u201ca </em>proximate cause\u201d of her wrist fusion, then the defendant\u2019s actions could not possibly have been <em>\u201cthe </em>proximate cause.\u201d The court\u2019s instructions thus encouraged the jury to find for the defendant even if the plaintiff met her burden of proving that his error was a proximate cause of the wrist fusion. As the instructions could have misled the jury into such faulty reasoning, we hold that an injustice was done to the legal rights of the plaintiff, warranting reversal. <em>See Rawson, </em>125 N.H. at 100, 480 A.2d at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We next turn to the court\u2019s instructions regarding aggravation of pre-existing conditions and find that, like the instructions on proximate cause, they did not fairly state the law and could have misled the jury. The court\u2019s first instructions on the issue did not define the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for the aggravation of a pre-existing condition at all, <em>see Valliere v. Filfalt, </em>110 N.H. 331, 332-33, 266 A.2d 843, 844-45 (1970), but merely stated that \u201cyou may not include in the award any amount to cover any physical condition which pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>existed the events complained of. You may only consider those injuries which you find to have been a natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s fault, if any.\u201d While correct, this instruction is misleading because it explains only the defendant\u2019s half of the aggravation of injury doctrine. <em>See 2 </em>M. Minzer <em>et al., </em>Damages in Tort Actions \u00a7 15.41, at 15-119 to -120, \u00a7 15.43[5], at 15-128 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The court\u2019s supplemental instructions, apparently given to meet the plaintiff\u2019s objections, appear to have confused the issue further. <em>Cf. State v. Pinardville Athletic Club, </em>134 N.H. 462, 468, 594 A.2d 1284, 1287-89 (1991) (no error in trial court\u2019s charge where possibly ambiguous language was later clarified). The court told the jury that prior injuries are \u201cnot a factor in this case,\u201d but then stated that \u201cprior injuries may or may not figure in.\u201d The court also admonished the jury to \u201ckeep in mind with respect to her prior injuries or the status of her health,\u201d but did not explain the effect the prior injuries should have on the jury\u2019s determination of liability or damages. Similarly, the court stated, without elaboration, \u201cyou may find that. . . prior conditions were aggravated by that negligence. That\u2019s okay for you to do that . . . .\u201d Finally, although the jury was informed that \u201canyone takes someone as they find them,\u201d this legal catch phrase for the aggravation of injury doctrine, <em>see </em>Minzer, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 15.01, at 15-6, was never deciphered for the lay jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We conclude that the court did not fairly and adequately explain the law and could have misled the jurors into believing they could withhold recovery for the plaintiff if they found that her present injuries stemmed from a pre-existing condition. As the plaintiff admitted that she sought treatment from the defendant because of a preexisting condition, the court\u2019s instructions on the aggravation of injury doctrine unfairly prejudiced the case against her and thus caused an injustice to her legal rights. <em>See Rawson, </em>125 N.H. at 100, 480 A.2d at 41. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
