(the Moore Center). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">On November 15, 1988, Mary Cilley was struck by an automobile and severely injured while crossing the street. The driver of the automobile was underinsured. At the time of the accident Mary Cilley was a resident of a group home operated by the Moore Center. The Moore Center is a non-profit organization providing care and education for developmentally disabled individuals. Mary Cilley\u2019s mother, Frances Colburn Raudonis, was and is her legal guardian. The plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether the underinsured motorist coverage held by the Moore Center covered the injuries received by Mary Cilley. The trial court found that endorsement CA 0111 01 87 of the policy unambiguously defines who is an insured for the purposes of underinsured motorist coverage. The endorsement defines the term \u201cinsured\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">\u201c1. You and, if you are an individual, any \u2018family member.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">2. A private chauffeur or domestic servant, while engaged in employment by you or your spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">3. Anyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 an \u2018insured motor vehicle\u2019 or a temporary substitute for an \u2018insured motor vehicle.\u2019 The \u2018insured motor vehicle\u2019 must be out of service because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-14\">4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by another \u2018insured.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Because none of these definitions applied to Mary Cilley, the trial court found no coverage under the policy. The plaintiff raises several arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"> In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, we note that the interpretation of the insurance policy language is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Laconia Rod &amp; Gun Club v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co., </em>123 N.H. 179, 182, 459 A.2d 249, 250 (1983). \u201cWe construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Niedzielski v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>134 N.H. 141, 146, 589 A.2d 130, 133 (1991) (quotations omitted). We will review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, however, with the appropriate deference and will not disturb such findings unless they are \u201clacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Gelinas v. Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>131 N.H. 154, 160-61, 551 A.2d 962, 966 (1988) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The plaintiff first argues that the trial court erred because it failed to consider one of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist endorsements, endorsement CA 2X 17. The plaintiff contends that the language of this endorsement, defining the policy\u2019s insured as \u201c[y]ou or any family member,\u201d provides uninsured motorist coverage for Mary Cilley as a \u201cfamily member\u201d of the Moore Center. Endorsement CA 2X 17 expired prior to Mary Cilley\u2019s accident and was replaced by the endorsement relied upon by the trial court in denying coverage. Nevertheless, the plaintiff argues that endorsement CA 2X17 should be considered part of the policy because the multiple endorsements created an ambiguity with respect to who was eligible for uninsured motorist benefits under the policy, and because the Moore Center was never notified by the defendant about the alleged changes in coverage that resulted when endorsement CA 2X 17 was replaced with CA 01 11 01 87. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">There is no dispute that endorsement CA 2X 17 expired almost three months before the accident and was replaced by endorsement CA 01 11 01 87 when the Moore Center\u2019s coverage was renewed for the following year. This change created no ambiguity within the policy. The forms and endorsements that constituted the policy in effect on the date of the accident were clearly cataloged in the policy. We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that endorsement CA 01 11 01 87 defines who is an insured for the purposes of this case, and do not believe that endorsement CA 2X 17, simply by its very existence, creates an ambiguity within the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number> The plaintiff\u2019s claim that endorsement CA 2X 17 should be considered part of the policy because the Moore Center was never notified about a change in coverage is a statutory claim grounded in RSA 412:2-c (1991). Because this issue was neither raised below nor properly preserved for consideration on appeal, we will not address it. <em>See Appeal of Bosselait, </em>130 N.H. 604, 606-07, 547 A.2d 682, 685-86 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 1011 (1989). The plaintiff makes no reference to RSA 412:2-c in either her notice of appeal or the record of proceedings below. A passing reference to this statute was first made in the plaintiff\u2019s brief before this court and was only pursued in earnest at oral argument. The plaintiff does mention the issue of notice as part of an argument involving the Moore Center\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage, which we will address below, but this can hardly be construed as the initiation of a distinct statutory claim. Where a statutory claim is not properly raised below so as to \u201cput the tribunal on notice that it should address the factual as well as legal issues peculiar to such a... claim,\u201d we will not review the claim on appeal. <em>Id.; see Perron v. City of Somersworth, </em>131 N.H. 303, 305, 553 A.2d 283, 284 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We conclude that the trial court properly disregarded endorsement CA 2X 17 in determining whether Mary Cilley was an insured under the Moore Center\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. Because endorsement CA 2X 17 is not relevant to this case, we need not decide whether Mary Cilley is a \u201cfamily member\u201d of a corporation, the Moore Center, for the purposes of uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s next claim of error involves former RSA 264:15, I, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cNo policy shall be issued or delivered in this state . . . unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto at least in the amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles, and hit-and-run vehicles because of bodily injury .... When an insured elects to purchase liability insurance in an amount greater than the minimum coverage required by RSA 259:61, his uninsured motorist coverage shall automatically be equal to the liability coverage elected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">RSA 264:15, I (1982) (amended 1988 &amp; 1991). The plaintiff argues that RSA 264:15,1, requires every motorist insurance policy to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>vide uninsured motorist coverage with the same scope as the liability coverage under the same policy. Every possible insured under the policy\u2019s general liability coverage therefore should receive uninsured motorist coverage as well. Because Mary Cilley could be an insured for the purpose of general liability coverage if she ever drove one of the Moore Center\u2019s vehicles, the plaintiff argues that she also should be covered in any accident involving an uninsured motorist. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">RSA 264:15,1, requires that uninsured motorist coverage be provided with the same monetary limits as are provided under a policy for general liability coverage. <em>See Descoteaux v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>125 N.H. 38, 44, 480 A.2d 14, 19 (1984) (decided under former RSA 268:15-a). The statute also requires that a person who is an insured in a particular situation under a policy\u2019s general liability coverage also be covered in that situation under the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist section. Mary Cilley was not an insured under the general liability section of the Moore Center\u2019s policy when she was injured while crossing the street on foot. Therefore, RSA 264:15,1, does not mandate that she be covered under the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist section.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that RSA 264:15, I, requires every possible insured under the policy\u2019s general liability section to be insured for injuries sustained in any accident involving an uninsured motorist is based on an overly broad reading of the statute that leads to an absurd result. Subject to the terms of a specific policy, general liability coverage usually insures anyone who is using the named insured\u2019s covered automobile with the insured\u2019s permission. Theoretically, all persons able to drive could be an insured for these purposes. Under the plaintiff\u2019s argument, any and all persons who are able to drive a car and are injured by an uninsured motorist would be covered under the Moore Center\u2019s policy. \u201cIt is not to be presumed that the legislature would pass an act leading to an absurd result and nullifying to an appreciable extent the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Hart, </em>130 N.H. 325, 327, 540 A.2d 859, 860 (1988) (quotation omitted). We therefore reject the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of RSA 264:15, I, and hold that the statute does not afford uninsured motorist coverage to Mary Cilley in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments require only brief mention. The plaintiff argues that Mary Cilley was covered under an additional endorsement to the Moore Center\u2019s policy as an employee of the Moore Center. Assuming that she was in fact an employee, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>not find any coverage under the policy. Employees were clearly not covered as pedestrians. Because Mary Cilley was injured while crossing a street on foot, she could not be covered as an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Finally, the plaintiff relies on the rationale expressed in <em>Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. Granite State Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. 760, 762-63, 435 A.2d 507, 509 (1981), to argue that we should find coverage based on the reasonable expectations of the insured. The plaintiff contends that the Moore Center developed reasonable expectations through its initial dealings with the defendant that an accident such as Mary Cilley\u2019s would be covered. To show that the Moore Center\u2019s expectations had not changed, the plaintiff asserts that the Moore Center was never specifically notified about any reductions in coverage during the following years in which the defendant supplied coverage to the Moore Center. The plaintiff argues that at the very least the defendant should be estopped from denying coverage because the defendant\u2019s knowledge about the Moore Center\u2019s activities and the defendant\u2019s representations concerning the coverage led the Moore Center reasonably to expect coverage for this type of accident. The trial court found, however, that the defendant\u2019s agents clearly described the extent of the policy\u2019s coverage to the Moore Center and that the Moore Center had no basis for believing that Mary Cilley would be entitled to uninsured motorist coverage in an accident such as this. The trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the record, and we therefore hold that Mary Cilley is not entitled to coverage based on the reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AGY\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
