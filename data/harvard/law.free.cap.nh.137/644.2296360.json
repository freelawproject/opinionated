RSA 262:23 (Supp. 1992). He appeals, arguing that double jeopardy barred his conviction for violating the habitual offender statute, and that the trial court erred in not granting a mistrial after the arresting officer testified about the defendant having been charged with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DWI) during the trial on the habitual offender charge. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">On March 2, 1991, State Trooper Richard Blair stopped a vehicle that was being driven erratically. The defendant, the driver of the vehicle, failed a field sobriety test; he also told Trooper Blair that he had had four or five beers before driving. Trooper Blair arrested him for DWI. As the defendant was being booked at the Nashua Police Department, police learned that his license to drive in New Hampshire had been revoked due to his 1989 certification as an habitual offender. The defendant was convicted of DWI in the Nashua District Court. Prior to his superior court trial on the habitual offender charge, the court ruled that the DWI conviction would not be allowed into evidence, but that evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the arrest would be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">On direct examination, Trooper Blair testified that he had \u201cconducted some field sobriety tests on the roadside and [the defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>was placed under arrest for driving while intoxicated, [and] brought to the Nashua P.D.\u201d The defendant did not object to this testimony. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked the court to direct the witness to produce his notes of the arrest. After Trooper Blair gave the requested documents to defense counsel, counsel noted that there were several sets of notes and reports relating to the case. Defense counsel pursued a line of questioning about the content of the different reports, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cQ And you\u2019ve put some additional things here that weren\u2019t in there originally, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">A I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">Q Well, let me just show you this material about left wheels crossing the center line. Was this in there previously or have you added that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">A This was taken off of the criminal report and put on to these notes because these are the ones I used on the stand last time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">Q Right. But my question is[,] is this something that\u2019s been added to your \u2014 these were your original notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">A No. These were taken from my handwritten notes. These are discovery under district court rule which was given to you. The additional notes-on here came from a criminal report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">Q So this was not complete in and of itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">A Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-13\">Q But you had to add some things to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-14\">A From my recollection I did so I wouldn\u2019t have to take two reports to the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-15\">Q Well, let me just run through this one step at a time. There were notes before this, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-17\">Q What happened to those notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-18\">A Those notes were transcribed onto a criminal report and a discovery report, two different reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-19\">Q What happened to those notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-20\">A Those notes were destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-21\">Q They weren\u2019t provided to us, were they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-22\">A Yes. They were transcribed onto the notes you have in your right hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-23\">Q Exactly. Verbatim? Exactly verbatim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>A They were a rough draft, and I took those rough drafts and chronologically put them in order onto a discovery report for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">Q So when you say \u201crough draft\u201d, you mean it was different from what I got, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">A No. Everything, everything, I believe is included except for I said he was doing forty in a fifty zone. I put down that he was driving erratically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">Q And this wasn\u2019t the last report either?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">Q What happened after this one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">A You have the next one in your left hand. That\u2019s a typewritten report. That goes to the county attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">Q Okay. So this [report is] number three or number four?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">A That would have been probably number two or three. There\u2019s a criminal report bec[ause] he\u2019s an habitual offender. He was also charged with DWI. Because the DWI was appealed, we have to do a motor vehicle appeal report so the county attorney \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">At this point in the testimony, the prosecutor asked to approach the bench. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion and asked defense counsel if he wanted any kind of instruction to the jury. Defense counsel indicated that he did not think an instruction could cure the damage, and the court gave none at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">The State\u2019s next witness, Trooper Daniel Roche, had transported the defendant to Nashua District Court and had warned him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Trooper Roche testified that after the defendant indicated he understood those rights and agreed to talk, \u201c[h]e stated he was arrested for DWI.\u201d The defendant did not object to this testimony. When Trooper Roche asked the defendant why he was driving, the defendant said \u201che had been drinking like eight or nine beers and that it was stupid to drive\u201d and that \u201c[his] friend was drunk and he needed to drive.\u201d The prosecutor again asked to approach the bench, where defense counsel renewed his objection based on double jeopardy grounds and was overruled. The judge informed counsel, however, that he would instruct the jury not to consider the DWI, and defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d The judge then instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-15\">\u201cI\u2019d like to make one thing clear to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I think this is as good a time as any. You\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>heard some testimony in this case that in addition to the charge before you there was also a charge against the defendant where he was arrested for driving while intoxicated. That fact is not to be considered by you in any way when you deliberate your verdict. It has no relevance to this case.and is not a concern of yours whatsoever. You are to ignore that and not consider it in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">You may consider, however, the evidence of the state of sobriety or the condition of sobriety of the defend[an]t at the time of this incident as that may relate to his state of mind at the time that the acts that are complained of in this particular case were alleged to have been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The defendant was convicted of violating the habitual offender statute and raises a double jeopardy claim on appeal. The defendant argues that because he engaged in a single act of driving a motor vehicle on March 2, 1991, his DWI and habitual offender convictions are based on the same evidence, and thereby violate his constitutional protections against double jeopardy. We decided the same issue of double jeopardy against the defendant in <em>State v. Brooks, </em>137 N.H. 541, 629 A.2d 1347 (1993), and therefore will not address it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The defendant also contends that Trooper Blair\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, in violation of the court\u2019s ruling that the defendant\u2019s DWI conviction would not be allowed into evidence, was so prejudicial as to require a mistrial. The trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Lemire, </em>130 N.H. 552, 554, 543 A.2d 425, 426 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Prejudice is inherent when the jury is exposed to evidence of other similar crimes committed by the defendant. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>135 N.H. 1, 4, 599 A.2d 477, 479 (1991). Introduction of such evidence, however, does not automatically require a mistrial. <em>See id. </em>at 7, 599 A.2d at 481. To warrant a mistrial, the \u201cremarks or the conduct must be more than merely inadmissible; they must constitute an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions.\u201d <em>Lemire, </em>130 N.H. at 555, 543 A.2d at 426. We do not find that the defendant was so prejudiced as to require a mistrial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Defendant contends that the reference to the fact that he had been <em>charged </em>with DWI prejudiced his trial on the habitual offender charge. We disagree. Testimony was admitted without objection that the defendant had been arrested for DWI, and that he had admitted to the State troopers that he had \u201cfour or five\u201d or as many as \u201ceight or nine\u201d beers before driving. Evidence of the actual charge result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ing from the defendant\u2019s conduct and arrest was merely cumulative of this other evidence and thus not prejudicial. <em>See State v. Lemieux, </em>136 N.H. 329, 331, 615 A.2d 635, 636 (1992) (erroneous admission of hearsay harmless where merely cumulative). To the extent that the defendant argues that this reference to the charge was indirect evidence of defendant\u2019s conviction for DWI, we similarly find that any resultant prejudice was mitigated by the other evidence of the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication and arrest, which evidence was admitted without objection. We fail to see how the indirect reference to the DWI conviction informed the jury of any criminal behavior of which they were not already aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Additionally, the degree of prejudice inherent in a reference to another charge may depend upon the similarity of the \u201cother incident\u201d to that for which the defendant is currently on trial. <em>See Ellison, </em>135 N.H. at 4, 599 A.2d at 479 (prejudice inherent in evidence of other similar crimes); <em>State v. Woodbury, </em>124 N.H. 218, 220, 469 A.2d 1302, 1304-05 (1983) (testimony explicitly revealed evidence of identical crime); <em>State v. LaBranch, </em>118 N.H. 176, 179, 385 A.2d 108, 110 (1978) (evidence of closely related charge); <em>cf. Gordon v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 936, 940 (D.C.Cir. 1967) (where prior conviction is same as offense charged, there results \u201cinevitable pressure on lay jurors to believe that \u2018if he did it before he probably did so this time\u2019\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1029 (1980). In this case, the offense charged, driving after certification as an habitual offender, differed significantly from a charge for driving while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Moreover, the trial court, with the consent of the defendant, later instructed the jury that \u201cthere was also a charge against the defendant where he was arrested\u201d for DWI, but that the DWT charge \u201cis not to be considered by you in any way when you deliberate\u201d and that it was irrelevant to the habitual offender charge. We presume that jury members follow the instructions provided by the court, <em>State v. Novosel, </em>120 N.H. 176, 178, 412 A.2d 739, 740 (1980), and we have recognized that appropriate instructions can cure prejudice to the defendant. <em>See State v. Fowler, </em>132 N.H. 540, 547, 567 A.2d 557, 561 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Accordingly, given both the circumstances surrounding the testimony complained of and the judge\u2019s curative instruction, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
