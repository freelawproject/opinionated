The record showed that after a reference had, with no stipulation as to the referee\u2019s fees, the referee sent a notice to both parties that the report was complete, and that his charges were $1,500; that the attorney for plaintiff saw the report, which was complete in all its details, and showed plaintiff entitled to recover $3,888.98. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney told the referee that he would see his client as to the fee, and a few days thereafter wrote the referee that his client would pay no more than the statutory fees, which were about $700. The referee had, prior to such notice, on an ex parte hearing on the part of defendants, reduced the amount of recovery to $1,512.01, and thereupon signed his report as so altered, and received from the attorney for the defendants his fee of $1,500. Motion of plaintiff to set aside the referee\u2019s report was denied, and he appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AQK\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-12\">See 65 N.

The order should therefore be reversed, with $io costs and disbursements,, and the action remitted to the court below for the appointment of a new referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">INGRAHAM, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
