The single question urged upon this appeal from the judgment entered on the verdict of the jury in favor' of the plaintiff for $1,500 is whether error was committed by the court in permitting one of the physicians to be asked whether the asthmatic condition which he observed in the plaintiff, and the attack of asthma which he found to have occurred a few days .after the accident, \u201ccould have been caused\u201d by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s receiving an injury by coming into contact with some large body with sufficient violence to cause the injury he observed. The question was objected to as incompetent and improper, but was allowed under exception, and the answer was: \u201cThis asthmatic condition, in my opinion, could have been the result of some violence. That is as far as I know.\u201d The question was not asked whether, in his opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s asthma was so caused. Previously, however, the physician had testified that a few weeks prior to the accident he had noticed no difficulty with her breathing, and that on the evening of the accident he found her suffering great pain and difficulty in breathing, and he examined her chest, and found she was suffering from an attack of asthma and coughing. And he explained that asthma has its typical sign, which is difficulty in getting breath through the bronchial tubes, pain under the chest bone and on the side, increased by any exertion, which gives rise to the peculiar breathing, and \u201cthat is all there is to the attack of asthma.\u201d He also said, \u201cAn attack of asthma always \u00a1presupposes that there must be an asthmatic condition of the patient at the time,\u201d and it sometimes comes from nervous shock, or fright would bring it on. No exception was taken to this, which is similar testimony to that excepted to. The physician also testified that he set the plaintiff\u2019s ribs. The plaintiff testified that the doctor was sent for to relieve her difficulty in breathing; that she had never had trouble in breathing before the accident, but now had severe attacks of asthmatic trouble. Another physician testified that he had seen the plaintiff two days before the accident, as she had a severe headache, and she then had no symptoms of asthma,\u2014none whatever,\u2014and that asthma was one of his specialties. He was then asked if, with reasonable certainty, he could give an opinion whether that attack of asthma could have been produced by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s coming in violent contact with a. heavy body; and, after some colloquy with the court, he answered that, in his opinion, physical injuries may be the cause of asthmatic conditions, but he had no knowledge of this case. It will be seen that substantially the same question was asked of the two physicians, except that in the latter case the words \u201creasonable certainty\u201d were used, and both answered affirmatively that physical injuries might produce asthmatic- conditions. The first question, therefore, although it did not include the words \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d was not really prejudicial; and, moreover, the question whether the injury here resulted in asthma was not asked. Apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>from this, however, we have the positive testimony that the plaintiff was never before troubled with her breathing or with asthma, and, when seen by physicians before the accident, showed no such symptoms., but when seen after it, and as she herself testifies, she had an attack of asthma. When it is further remembered that the plaintiff broke a rib, which had to be set, and that she suffered pain, and had difficulty with her breathing, as the result of the accident, and that asthma is such difficulty in breathing, and that the complaint avers that the accident and shock brought on an attack of asthma, there was sufficient evidence properly presented upon which the jury could return a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">There was no exception to the charge, nor any request to charge. No mention was made in it of asthma; but the jury was left to determine on the whole evidence what with reasonable certainty were the direct and natural results of the defendant\u2019s negligence. We think, therefore, that the error, if any, was not prejudicial, or such as would require a reversal. The judgment and order should accordingly be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
