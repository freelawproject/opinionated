At the time the testator became a member of the society, he was permitted by the by-law to designate in his lifetime to whom the sick or death benefit should be paid in the event of his mental derangement or death. This was to be effected by the signing of a paper adopted and used by the society, and called a \u201ctestamentary disposition.\u201d By amendment of the by-laws it was there\u00e1fter provided that the benefit should be paid to \u201cthe husband, wife, affianced husband, affianced wife, child, child by legal adoption, parent, parent by legal adoption, relatives of, or persons dependent upon, the member.\u201d These beneficiaries constitute a class from which selection is to be made at the option of the member, even if it is not obligatory that he select therefrom in the order in which they are named, if there is a person living bearing the specified relation to the member. And it is further provided that if, in any instance where a death-benefit certificate has.been issued to any of the parties designated in the foregoing class, all of the class shall have died, the member may direct that the death benefit shall be paid to any other person. It is stipulated by the parties hereto that the testator left \u201cno relatives.\u201d The plaintiff sues as executrix of his will, and claims to be entitled to the benefit, as the person designated therein to whom the benefit has been specifically bequeathed. The question whether she can sue in her representative capacity, instead of individually, as the legatee of the benefit named in the will, is suggested, but is unimportant, in view of the conclusion reached hereon. As stated at the outset in this opinion, the testator's right to make disposition of the benefit arose out of the contract which he made with the association, and was limited and qualified by the statute, and by the constitution and by-laws of the society adopted thereunder. It was also subject to modification by such changes or amendments as might thereafter be made in the constitution and by-laws not inconsistent with law. Neither the statute nor the constitution nor the by-laws in force at the time the testator became a member of the society, or at the time of his death, authorized a disposition of the benefit by will, or the designation of a beneficiary in that manner. The naming of the plaintiff in the will as the legatee of the benefit was not the \u201ctestamentary disposition\u201d provided to be made, as has been intimated above. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint, therefore, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Hellenberg\u2019 v.
