In July, 1892, Louis Goetting, plaintiff\u2019s father, was adjudged to be a lunatic, and was confined in a hospital; his wife, Elizabeth Goetting, being duly appointed as the committee of his estate. Subsequently, and on the 12th day of November, 1892, the said Louis Goetting was judicially declared to be of sound mind and competent to manage his property; and the committee of his estate was discharged, after making an accounting of the property which had come into her hands. On the 26th day of October, 1897,\u2014five years later,\u2014the said Louis Goetting made and executed a deed of the premises involved in this action to John G. Weber, defendant, for the expressed consideration of \u201cone dollar and other good and valuable considerations\u201d; and this deed seems to have been recorded late in the afternoon of April 11, 1898, in the office of the register of deeds of Kings county. At about the same time, although the instrument bears date of the following day, the following writing was entered into between the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-7\">\u201cGoetting v. Weber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-8\">\u201cLouis Goetting, having made a deed to John George Webber of the property 103 &amp; 105 Scholes street, Brooklyn, in October last, this day authorized Towns &amp; McCrossin to place said deed on record; Webber to deed back said property to Goetting on payment of whatever sums he may have advanced to Goetting, or paid upon said property, with interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-9\">\u201cWitnesseth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-10\">\u201cAgnes Paureiss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-11\">\u201cWm. Burk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-12\">\u201cJohn G. Weber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-13\">\u201cLouis Goetting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">The defendant, in his amended answer, alleges the existence of this agreement, and asks that he be allowed the amount of his disbursements, less the sums received for rents, etc., as a condition of the reconveyance of the premises to the plaintiff, sole heir of the said Louis Goetting. The learned court at special term, after a patient hearing of the case, and allowing the plaintiff great latitude in the introduction of evidence, has decided that the allegations of fraud made in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are not sustained, \"and that there was no fraud on the part of the defendants in obtaining the conveyance of the property described in the complaint herein; that the allegations set out in the complaint as to the insanity of Louis Goetting at the time of the conveyance of said property were not proven\u201d; and \u201cthat the defendant John George Weber took' the said property upon an agreement to reconvey the same to Louis Goetting, or his heirs, upon being paid wh\u00e1tsoever sums he may have expended for the said Louis Goetting, or upon said property, at the time of such reconveyance.\u201d The learned court then finds \u25a0that certain claims, aggregating $2,978.36, were proven by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>fendants, and that the latter had received from rents, etc., $2,020.50, leaving a balance of $955.86 due to the defendants, and judgment was directed accordingly. From the judgment entered, the plaintiffs appeal to this court, urging a great variety of technical objections, and, in effect, asking this court to review in detail the items of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">As we understand this case, neither fraud on the part of the defendant, or insanity on the part of Louis Goetting, having been established, the defendant holds the property as security for whatever sums he may have expended for the said Louis Goetting, or upon the property. The deed is in the nature of a mortgage to secure the payment of moneys expended for the benefit of Louis Goetting, and there are no charges which do not appear to have been legitimate, or which might not be properly paid, within the terms of the agreement. The evidence, we believe, is sufficient to support the judgment; and the plaintiffs, having appealed to the equitable jurisdiction of this court, are hardly in a position to say that the accounting had under the eye of the court is not a proper determination of the facts. The conveyance having been made without fraud, and by a competent party, for a good consideration, the plaintiffs can demand a reconveyance only by complying with the terms of the agreement; and the evidence, independently of that to which'objection was made, being sufficient to support the judgment, and it appearing that substantial justice has been done, a court of equity is justified in refusing to direct a reconveyance, except upon the terms fixed by the agreement between the parties to the original transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We have examined the exceptions to the evidence on the ground that it was in conflict with the provisions of section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and we are convinced that the court at special term did not err. For instance, it is alleged by the plaintiffs that objectionable evidence was admitted. The witness was Clementine Sommer, who had charge of the cleaning, and acted as janitress of the premises in dispute. She testified that she knew Louis Goetting; that \u201cI gave him such money every day as he needed.\u201d There was no exception to this. Witness was shown a book, and was asked whose handwriting the book was in. She replied that it was Mr. Goetting\u2019s handwriting. She was then asked to state what was written there. To this, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected, as being within the inhibition of section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure; some of the items of Weber\u2019s account being for moneys paid to Louis Goetting through the witness, or by the repayment of moneys advanced by her. The objection was overruled, and plaintiffs excepted, and the court asked, \u201cWhat does the book show?\u201d To this defendant\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cIt shows an entry of money received from this witness.\u201d The book was subsequently admitted in evidence over the plaintiffs\u2019 objections and exceptions. We are of opinion that this book was competent evidence, as an admission, and that the witness was not testifying to a personal transaction or conversation between herself and Louis Goetting, deceased, in stating that the book was in the handwriting of Mr. Goetting. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Card v. Card, 39 N. Y. 317, 318; Cary v. White, 59 N. Y. 336; Simmons v. Havens, 101 N. Y. 427, 433, 5 N. E. 73. The other objections and exceptions proceed upon a like theory, and were properly overruled. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
