It also appears from the testimony that the doctor had photographed the plaintiff, because of the peculiar nature of the disease from which he suffered, some years before the accident, and subsequently he published an article concerning him in some medical journal, and that the witness exhibited the plaintiff about four or five times publicly to members of the witness\u2019 profession. It was after this testimony was produced and proved that the following question was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cNow, then, prior to the preparation of the article published by you in the Medical Journal of February 1, 1896, did this plaintiff tell you that 17 years previously he had severe pains in the legs, lasting day and night, and forcing him to stay abed for fully seven years?\u201d To this objection was taken, upon the ground that the matter was privileged and the information was obtained by the physician in a professional capacity while in attendance upon the plaintiff. \u25a0 The court overruled the objection, upon the ground that, the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s disease having been made public by the consent of the plaintiff, the privilege was waived.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b649-14\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

On this subject it was said in the case of Holden v. Insurance Co., 165 N. Y. 17, 58 N. E. .772:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-18\">\u201cThe statute [sections 834 and 836 of the Code of Civil Procedure], as it now stands, in positive and express terms requires the waiver to be made upon or at the time of the trial or examination. * * * The apparent purpose was to protect parties, their representatives and successors, from waivers which should be inadvertently or improperly obtained previous to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>trial of an action or the examination of the witness. That in many cases injustice had resulted from such waivers * * * was doubtless the reason which induced the legislature to adopt this amendment, requiring the waiver to be made in the presence and under the supervision of the court before which the trial or examination was had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">There being no waiver \u201cupon the trial or examination,\u201d as provided by section 836 of the Code, but, on the contrary, an objection made to the physician\u2019s violating the privilege, the ruling admitting the testimony was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">It is claimed, however, that such ruling was harmless, because the jury found that the defendant was not responsible for the injuries, and, as there was no liability of the defendant, the introduction of the evidence relating to the extent of the injuries could, at most, affect only the credibility of the plaintiff. This, it seems to us, is begging the whole question, as there was a sharp conflict as to the manner in which the accident occurred. It is not, therefore, a strained inference to conclude that the testimony of the plaintiff had a material bearing upon the burden which he had to sustain, of showing the defendant\u2019s liability for his injuries; and it is evident that the direct refutation by his physician of what he had stated concerning his physical condition before the accident would tend to discredit his whole case. If upon the extent of his injuries it was shown that- he had testified falsely, which was the tendency of the erroneous evidence admitted, then the jury would have the right, as it would have been the duty of the judge, if requested, to charge, if they believed that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was willfully and knowingly false on one important particular of his case, and they were at liberty, to disregard his entire evidence. It seems to us, therefore, that, upon the question of the defendant\u2019s liability, the extent to which the jury would credit the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was most material; and, his credibility having been assailed and affected by improper and erroneous evidence, the error committed cannot be regarded as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We think, therefore, that the judgment appealed from is wrong, and should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">VAN BRUNT, P. J., and EAUGHEIN, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b650-8\">PATTERSON, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AEjq\">Judgment for the defendant was entered in this action upon a general verdict of a jury in its favor. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal from that judgment is brought up on what may be called a \u201cbill of exceptions,\u201d presenting but a single question, which relates to the competency of testimony of a physician as to statements made by the plaintiff to him concerning a subject in no way connected with the issues in the case, except, perhaps, as to the question of damages. The action was brought to recover damages for personal injuries claimed to have been sustained by the plaintiff through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants in managing or operating a street railway car. The record before us gives no information as to the alleged accident in which the plaintiff suffered injury, how it occurred, what the fault or negligence ascribed \u25a0to the defendant\u2019s servants may have been, nor anything upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>subject of contributory negligence. The verdict of the jury being a general one, either or both of the issues of negligence of the defendant and the want of contributory negligence of the plaintiff must have been found in the defendant\u2019s favor. It appears in the record before us that the plaintiff had testified that, some 17 years^ before the accident occurred, he had suffered from serious illness in Germany for a period of about 7 years, during the greater part of which time he had been in a hospital, and confined to his bed. The defendant called as a witness a physician connected with a hospital in the city of New York to which the plaintiff resorted for treatment after the alleged accident referred to in the complaint. That physician was permitted to testify that he treated the plaintiff, who was suffering from a very rare disease, of so interesting a character that the plaintiff was exhibited before a society of physicians at a public meeting, and an account of the plaintiff\u2019s peculiar disease was published by the witness in the New York Medical Journal; and he swore that the account was published with the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and approval. In the course of his examination this witness was asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\">\u201cQ. Now, then, prior to the preparation of the article published by you in the Medical Journal of February 1, 1896, did this plaintiff tell you that 17 years previously he had suffered pains in the legs, lasting day and night, which forced him to stay in bed for 7 years?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">That was objected to on the ground that it was privileged. The objection was overruled. This question was in no way related to the subject-matter of the action, so far as the issues upon which the question of the liability of the defendant depended. Assuming that all communications made by the plaintiff to this physician were privileged, and he was improperly allowed to give this testimony, it still remains that it has been found by the jury that the defendant is not responsible for any injuries sustained by the plaintiff in this action, and we are concluded by that finding. If there is no liability of the defendant, the question sought to be raised on this record is a moot one. It is said that the testimony affected the credibility of the plaintiff, but that is pure assumption, for what the plaintiff testified to with respect to the main issues does not appear. On the finding of the jury, there was no negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants, and therefore there could have been no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
