The plaintiff gave evidence tending to show that she was free from negligence, and was injured through the negligence of the defendant. The material facts were controverted by the testimony introduced on the part of the defendant. The record indicates that the learned trial-justice considered that the evidence preponderated in favor of the defendant, and accordingly, at the close of the evidence and upon defendant\u2019s motion, a verdict was directed in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">The authority of the court to direct a verdict in accordance with tliepreponderance of the evidence, where the court would set the verdict aside as against the weight of the evidence if rendered in favor of the other party, was not at that time definitely settled by the decisions. Subsequently, however, the court of appeals in McDonald v. Railway Co., 167 N. Y. 69, 60 N. E. 282, decided that in such circumstances, the case must be submitted to the jury in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial;, granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
