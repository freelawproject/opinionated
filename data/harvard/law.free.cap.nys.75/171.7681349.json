It was in the daytime, and she was crossing the avenue from the west. Before attempting to cross she looked up and down the avenue. From the south a car was coming up, and was then a little above 103d street. From the north a car was coming down, and was then at 106th street. When she had crossed the downtown track, the uptown car was so close to her that she could not cross that track with safety, and while she stood between the tracks waiting for that car to pass the downtown car came along quite fast, and without the warning of the gong, and the injury was occasioned. The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence was scarcely raised upon the trial. No witnesses were examined upon the trial, and no discussion is necessary to establish the fact that a jury may find negligence from the circumstances presented by the record. It was claimed below, however, and it is insisted upon the appeal, that the plaintiff was chargeable with contributory negligence, on the authority of Davenport v. Railroad Co., 100 N. Y. 632, 3 N. E. 305. The cases are essentially different. In that case the plaintiff desired to board a car on the southbound track. He was standing on the westerly side of the tracks when he saw it coming,\u2014the proper side from which to board it. Instead of remaining there until the car reached him, he crossed both tracks to the easterly side, signaled the car, and endeavored to board it from between the two tracks, while, as he knew, a car was approaching on the north-bound track, by which latter car he was injured. He saw the peril before he placed himself in the way of the collision, and after he took his unnecessary position of danger he had time to have returned to the easterly side of the tracks, or even, as the court found, to have gotten upon the car in safety, had he chosen to do so. The result was that it was impossible for the injury to have resulted without some carelessness on his part. Whether the plaintiff was negligent in this case was a question of fact. She was not bound to assume that it would be dangerous to attempt to cross a street with a car on the nearer track two blocks away, or that that car would come upon her without warning before another car less than half the distance from her would pass upon the farther track; and whether, under such circumstances, she failed in the exercise of ordinary care, was clearly for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except WOODWARD, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
