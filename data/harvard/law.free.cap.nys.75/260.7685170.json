The \u2022complaint thereupon prays for a judgment requiring the defendant to perform the agreement, and pay the purchase price to the plaintiff. The answer -denies, among other things, the making of the contract, and sets up various \u25a0other matters by way of defense. With the answer the defendant served a demand that the place of trial be changed from Franklin to Hamilton \u25a0county. This demand being disregarded, the defendant moved, upon the pleadings and upon an affidavit showing service of the demand, for an order changing the place of trial to Hamilton county, upon the ground that the action related to lands situate in that county, and is therefore local in character. The motion was denied at special term, and from the order denying dt this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Argued before PARKER, P.

It is not an action for damages for a breach of contract, but to enforce performance of a contract relating to lands,\u2014t.o compel the acceptance of a title to lands. It is in no sense an action for damages. It is simply an action to compel a specific performance of a contract relating to the sale and transfer of title to real property. If the action had been brought by the defendant against the plaintiff to compel the execution and deliver)'- of a deed, there can, of course, be <em>no </em>doubt that the action would be local, because section 982 expressly declares that such an action must be brought in the county where-the subject-matter of the action is situated. In what way does such an action differ from one to compel the acceptance of a deed? We think the subsequent clause of the section above quoted was intended' to embrace actions of this character, and, indeed, all actions affecting the transfer of title to real property not therein before enumerated. The action, as above indicated, is not alone to recover the purchase price,\u2014certainly not to recover damages for a breach of contract,\u2014 but to compel the defendant to take title to the land described in the complaint, as well as\" to pay the purchase price therefor. We think, therefore, that the action is governed by section 982, and must be tried in Hamilton county, or, according to the provisions of the Code, in Fulton county; Fulton and Hamilton counties being regarded as one. Code, \u00a7 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
