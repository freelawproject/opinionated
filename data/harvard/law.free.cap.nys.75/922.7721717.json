We are asked to pass upon inferences which may be drawn from the submission, rather than upon facts which are affirmatively stated therein; and thus our conclusion would necessarily be based upon such inferences. As said in Fearing v. Irwin, 55 N. Y. 489:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-4\">\u201cIn those cases of a submission of a controversy without action the court is confined to the facts agreed upon, and can make no inferences, or in any way depart from or go beyond the statement presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The submission, therefore, must be dismissed, without costs, and without prejudice to any action the parties may see fit to bring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
