Green took back a mortgage from Cohen upon the premises, subject to the mortgage securing the building loan. By the terms of the contract under which the houses were erected Green was to advance to Cohen the sum of $5.75\u00b0 when the buildings should be inclosed. This was called the \u201cinclosure payment.\u201d Cohen made and entered into a contract with the plaintiff\u2019s assignors to furnish stone to be used in the construction of the buildings. The evidence on the part of the plaintiff tended to show that Cohen made default in payment for the stone delivered pursuant to such contract, and that by reason of such default plaintiff\u2019s assignors refused to deliver further stone thereunder until payment was made for that already delivered. This being the situation, and the defendant being anxious that Cohen should fulfill the contract and complete the houses, he applied to the plaintiff\u2019s assignors to furnish the stone, and, in order to induce them so to do, he entered into the following contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cNew York, November 2, 1899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">\u201cReceived from Samuel Green his check for ($100) four hundred dollars, for which we promise to deliver the stones needed for the six houses which David Cohen is building on 113th St, between 1st and 2nd avenues. It being understood that David Cohen has given to Samuel Green an order for the total sum of the inclosure payment he is to receive upon five of said houses, and that Samuel Green promises to hold an additional sum of eight hundred dollars for us until the six buildings are inclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cNew York, November 2, 1899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u201cI agree to withhold 8800 from the amount of the inclosure payment &amp; pay the same to S. Pizzutiello and Sons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201c[Signed] Samuel Green.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Pursuant to this engagement, Pizzutiello &amp; Sons furnished the stone, and in all substantial respects made compliance with the contract. After its execution, but before the buildings were entirely inclosed, Green obtained from the building loan fund, pursuant to the order which had been delivered to him by Cohen, $4,950, leaving a balance due upon the inclosure payment, if the contract had been fulfilled, of the sum of $800. The defendant paid to Cohen the amount that he received of the inclosure payment prior to the time when it was due according to the terms of Cohen\u2019s contract. After such payment Cohen abandoned his contract, leaving the same uncompleted, and never in fact entirely inclosed the buildings. Green assigned his mortgage to a party, who foreclosed the same, and upon the sale he bought in the premises, and subsequently resold the same. Plaintiff\u2019s assignors applied to the defendant after they had delivered the stone, and asked for payment. Defendant requested them to wait, as he would be obliged to foreclose his mortgage, and when the matter was straightened out he would pay the money. It never having been paid, Pizzutiello &amp; Sons assigned their contract to the plaintiff, who brings this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The rights of the parties are to be determined from a construction of defendant\u2019s contract under which he assumed the payment of the $800. It is undisputed that Green had a substantial interest in pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>curing the contract made by Cohen to be fulfilled. His mortgage security very largely depended for its value upon such fulfillment. It was clearly for tiis benefit that the stone was furnished, and by virtue of his undertaking he procured its delivery, and had the benefit of plaintiff\u2019s material in the construction of the buildings, and he had it within his power at all times to protect Pizzutiello &amp; Sons from any loss in connection with the transaction. The equitable features, therefore, which the case presents are clearly with the plaintiff. By the terms of the defendant\u2019s agreement, no particular sum was reserved from the inclosure payment to which it could be made applicable. Such payment was all due at one time, and, when due, $800 thereof belonged primarily to plaintiff\u2019s assignors, and defendant was bound at his peril to see that they received it. While the defendant had the right to stand upon the terms of his contract with Cohen, and make no payment until the houses were inclosed, it was nevertheless competent for him to waive strict performance of the contract, and make such payment; but he could not so pay if thereby the plaintiff\u2019s assignors were prejudiced. Eight hundred dollars of the inclosure payment belonged equitably to the plaintiff\u2019s assignors, and, if the defendant chose to recognize Cohen\u2019s right to receive the inclosure payment, the right of plaintiff\u2019s assignors to be paid immediately attached thereto. This money became due to them the moment that the defendant recognized Cohen\u2019s right to receive the same, and he did so recognize it when he made the payment. The act of payment upon the part of the defendant was distinctly prejudicial to the right of plaintiff\u2019s assignors, and, as defendant was obligated to pay this debt from the inclosure payment, he had no right, under the terms of the contract, to deplete the fund, without protecting the interest of plaintiff\u2019s assignors therein. Beardsley v. Cook, 143 N. Y. 143, 38 N. E. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It being conceded that Green paid upon the inclosure payment $4,950 in utter disregard of his contract to pay for the stone which had been furnished for the building, we think he may not shelter himself from liability by now setting up the claim that he had retained a sum sufficient from the inclosure payment to meet this claim, and would have paid it had Cohen fulfilled his contract. We think that such is not the fair construction of his engagement. On the contrary, we are of opinion that when he recognized the right of Cohen to receive payment for his part of the work he was immediately charged with an obligation created by his contract to pay the plaintiff\u2019s assignors. We' therefore conclude that the construction placed upon the contract by the court below was correct, and that, the defendant having received and paid to Cohen more than was sufficient to discharge this claim, he became liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Under this view of the case, there are no other questions which require consideration. It follows that the judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">O\u2019BRIEN, INGRAHAM, and McRAUGHEIN, JJ., concur. VAN BRUNT, P.
