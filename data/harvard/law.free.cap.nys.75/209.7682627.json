The special term interpreted the statute as giving to the president such right. I think in this the learned court was in error. The common council mentioned in the act (chapter 182, Laws 1898) is a legislative body. \u201cIts authority, except as otherwise provided in this act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>or by other laws of the state, is legislative only.\u201d Section 12. The common council is composed of one alderman from each ward, and a president elected from the city at large. The wards have equal representation in the legislative body if we do not give to the president aldermanic powers, and, ;f we do, the ward in which the president happens to reside has a representation in the legislative body for all purposes twice that of any other ward. Such a scheme might be the subject of just criticism. That it was not the intention of the legislature to give to the president all the powers possessed by the aldermen is manifest by the provisions of section 14: \u201cThe president may vote like other members of the common council upon all resolutions and ordinances submitted to the body for its action in case of a tie vote.\u201d If the president had, by the general provisions of the act, the right to vote as alderman, there would have been no need of giving him the right to vote in case of a tie vote. This must be interpreted as a denial of the right to vote in all other cases. Counsel for the Press Company asks us to interpret the legislative intention as meaning \u201cmust vote,\u201d instead of \u201cmay vote,\u201d when there is a tie vote on resolutions and ordinances; but this could hardly be counted a cure for deadlocks. If the president had the same right as aldermen to vote on all propositions, his vote might as often make a tie'as dissolve one. But the reasoning of the learned counsel illustrates the difficulty of maintaining any middle ground. It was either the intention of the legislature to give to the president the right to vote the same as aldermen on all propositions, or it was its intention to give him the right to vote only in case of a tie vote upon resolutions and ordinances. It appears to me that there is no escape from this conclusion. That it was not the intention of the legislature to invest the president with all the powers of an alderman in the legislative body seems to me very clear. The status and functions \u00f3f the president are different from those of aldermen. He is elected as a city officer by the city at large, and is to receive a salary fixed by the act. His duties are defined by the act, and are not the duties imposed upon the aldermen. He is to preside at the meetings of the common council. He has power to convene the common council. Pie is made a member of the board of estimate and apportionment. He is required to \u201cdischarge such other duties as president as may be defined by ordinances of the common council and other provisions of this act\u201d (section 14), and he has the right to vote on ordinances and resolutions in case of a tie. \u201cThe president and aldermen thus elected shall constitute the common council.\u201d Without doubt he may be regarded as a member of that body, but a member with different powers .than those possessed by the aider-men, and not clothed with aldermanic powers. Great stress is laid upon the wording in section 29, \u201ceach member shall be entitled to vote for one of the papers,\u201d and it is urged that this gives the president express authority to vote on this question. There appears to be no special reason why he should be permitted to vote on this question unless he is a voting member of the council, and entitled to \u25a0vote on every question. I see no particular significance in the use of the term \u201ceach member.\u201d \"It was a provision restricting a mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ber from voting for more than one paper, and was naturally expressed in this way. If the legislature had intended to give to the president a right to vote on this question, it would have included it in the provision (section 14) conferring a power to vote in case of a tie. The term \u201cmember\u201d is used very often in this act, and it does not appear to me that in its use the legislature intended to refer to any one other than the aldermen, and did not intend to include the president, or to give him the right to vote in matters referred to. Section 15 provides for the choosing of a clerk \u201cby a vote of three-fourths of all the members.\u201d Section 16: \u201cThe president of the common council or a majority of its members may call a special meeting.\u201d Section 17: \u201cA majority of all its members shall be a quorum.\u201d Section 19: \u201cNo appropriation of money shall be made * * * except by ordinance passed by three-fourths of all the members. * * * No ordinance shall be passed * * * authorizing * * * a sale or lease * * * except by a vote of three-fourths of all the members of the common council.\u201d Section 21: After the mayor\u2019s veto the ordinance cannot be passed \u201cunless three-fourths of all members of the common council\u201d vote for it. Section 25: \u201cThe common council may by ordinances passed by two-thirds of all its members\u201d regulate the powers and duties of \u00e1ny city officer or department. Section 27: No expulsion shall take place or vacancy be declared \u201cexcept by the vote of three-fourths of all the members of the common council.\u201d Then follows section 29, before quoted, as the sole reliance for authority in the president to vote: \u201cEach member shall be entitled to vote for one of the papers.\u201d Following this, in the same section, it is provided: \u201cIn case any of the official papers shall refuse or fail to act or perform as such the common council may designate another paper in its place.\u201d The inquiry is pertinent here, can the president vote on this proposition? The \u201ccommon council\u201d must designate; that is, the members of the common council\u2014each member\u2014may vote. The act authorizes the \u201ccommon council\u201d to do many things; that is, it authorizes each, member of the common council to vote on the subject. And the act would have no greater significance if it had said \u201ceach member shall be entitled to one vote\u201d on the question before the common council. To give, therefore, to this form of expression, occurring in section 29, the meaning claimed for it,\u2014that it confers upon the president the-power to vote, and thereby changes the voting force in the common: council,\u2014it seems to me does violence to the otherwise apparent intention of the legislature. It punctures and distorts a reasonable-governmental scheme, and creates unnecessary confusion and doubt as to when and on what occasions the president may exercise the functions of the alderman and when not, when he must be counted in determining a majority vote, or a two-thirds or three-fourths vote, or a quorum. If, as I believe, it was the intention of the legislature not to make the president, elected by the city, a member of the legislative body except so far as specific functions are conferred, viz., the right to call the council together, to preside at their meetings, with a vote upon the passage of ordinances and resolutions when there is a tie in the legislative body, then we have a scheme work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>able and comprehensible, a legislative body constructed on a plan analagous to that of other legislative bodies, composed of members from each separate ward of the city, giving to each section equal representation, and with no confusion as to the meaning of the plan \u25a0or as to powers of its component parts. This is a general act, and affects all cities of the second class, and no confusing interpretation should be read into it unless it is impossible to read it otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements against the Press Company, and writ of mandamus prayed for be directed to issue, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
