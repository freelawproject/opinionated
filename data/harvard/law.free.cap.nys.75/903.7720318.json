It does not seem to me that the allegations of the complaint \u201care so indefinite or uncertain that the precise meaning or application thereof is not apparent,\u201d as required by section 546 of the Code, in order to justify granting such an application. The complaint states two separate and complete causes of action arising out of one transaction, and the purpose of the motion seems to have been to compel the plaintiff to elect in advance of the trial whether she would attempt to recover on the contract which she sets out or independently of the contract. The appellants find authority for such an application in the case of Faulks v. Kamp, 40 N. Y. Super. Ct. 70; but that decision is adverse to the view of the subject which has been taken in the supreme court. Longprey v. Yates, 31 Hun, 432; Blank v. Hartshorn, 37 Hun, 101; Lyke v. Post, 65 How. Prac. 298. The case last cited is a special term decision, but it is in harmony with the opinion in Velie v. Insurance Co., Id. 1, from which the general term of the Fifth department quotes approvingly in Blank v. Hartshorn, supra. The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
