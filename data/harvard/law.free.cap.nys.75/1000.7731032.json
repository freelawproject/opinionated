At the time this action was commenced, the Thomson-Houston Electric Light Company had gone out of existence, having been succeeded by and merged into the Manhattan Electric Light Company. Pending this action, and prior to the service of an amended complaint herein, the Manhattan Electric Light Company went out of existence, and became merged into the Edison Electric Illuminating Company. The answer to the amended complaint was thereupon made by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, as successor of the Manhattan Electric Light-Company, and duly verified by the treasurer of the Edison Company, and accepted without objection by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. When service of the amended complaint was made upon defendants\u2019 attorneys, they stipulated with plaintiff\u2019s attorneys that when answer was served the issue was \u201cto remain as of original date, without prejudice to the position of the case upon the calendar,\u201d and that \u201cneither side shall be required to serve a new notice of trial.\u201d The case was reached for trial, and the defendants\u2019 attorneys moved to have the case stricken from the calendar, inasmuch as \u201camended pleadings were served, and after they were served no new note of issue was filed, and no new notice of trial was served by either party.\u201d The motion was denied, and defendants excepted. This court will not interfere with the calendar practice of the lower court, and besides it scarcely lies with the defendants to raise this objection in view of the stipulation signed by their attorneys. Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys thereupon moved for judgment upon the ground that the answer to the amended complaint was by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, not a defendant in this action, not sued here, and is verified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>by some officer of the Edison Electric Company, and \u201cthat there is no answer here whatever.\u201d The motion was granted, the trial judge holding that \u201cthere is no answer here on behalf of the defendants named in the complaint,\u201d and then directing a verdict for the plaintiff, under objection by the defendants\u2019 attorneys and exception duly taken. Defendants\u2019 attorneys also asked for leave to interpose a proper answer, and for the withdrawal of a juror, but both requests were denied.^ At the threshold of the consideration of the appeal it is apparent that, if the answer served by the Edison Company was equivalent to no answer, then judgment in the case should have been entered as upon a default of answer. In this aspect the case had no place upon the trial calendar. It is well settled .that the effect of a merger is to dissolve the previous corporation into the new one, and to extinguish the precedent company. Copp v. Iron Co., 29 Misc. Rep. 109, 60 N. Y. Supp. 293; People v. Rice, 57 Hun, 486, 11 N. Y. Supp. 249, affirmed 128 N. Y. 591,28 N. E. 251. The entities of the former corporation had, when the answer to the amended complaint was served, been extinguished, and the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, under the business corporation law (section 12), wasdiable for all obligations \u201cfor any money due or to become due to any person or persons\u201d by the corporation named in the summons in this action. Section 12 of the business corporation law also provides that the new corporation may be \u201csubstituted as a party in place of any corporation so consolidated, by order of the court in which such action or proceeding may be pending,\u201d or \u201cit may be prosecuted to final judgment, as though no consolidation had been entered into.\u201d The law has provided for a simple method for prosecuting or defending in cases of consolidation of corporations. The defendant should have followed the proceeding outlined by law, and the plaintiff, if he desired to take advantage of defendants\u2019 error or neglect in complying with the provisions of the law, should have refused to receive the answer from the Edison Electric Illuminating Company. By retaining the answer of the Edison Company, the plaintiff should be deemed to have waived any objection to its having been made a party not named in the summons. It certainly was not just to the defendants to retain the answer, and then claim no answer had been served. If this judgment was permitted to stand, 1101 opportunity would be afforded the defendants to defend. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
