The draft or order for\" the payment of the money which stood to the credit of the deceased was made on the 16th day of March, 1900, and was drawn on the 26th day of March. On the 19th of April Mrs. Ditton died, and the contention of the plaintiff is that the money, or the books and papers on which the money was drawn, were taken from the deceased by fraud, forgery, and deception practiced upon her while in her last illness. The complaint alleges \u201cthat on the sixteenth day of March, 1900, the said Bridget Ditton, being in ill health and very feeble mentally and physically, and lying upon her deathbed, and being ill with pneumonia and la grippe, acompanied with high fevers, and all through the course of her sickness delirious and non compos mentis\u201d; but there is not a particle of evidence in the case to show that Mrs. Ditton was non compos mentis, or that she wasrincapable of transacting business. The evidence shows that she was ill, but she lived more than one month after the execution of the papers on which the money was drawn, and which were acknowledged before a notary public, and more than three weeks after the money had actually come into the possession of these defendants; and in the absence of some proof of fraud, collusion, undue influence, or other vitiating circumstance, the plaintiff has clearly failed to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>cause of action, and the complaint was properly dismissed upon the merits. The presumptions in this case are with the defendants, and the plaintiff must, to be entitled to question the acts of the decedent, be prepared to show that she was mentally incapacitated, and in this he has utterly failed. Mere physical weakness, and the evidence did not go beyond this, is not sufficient to show mental infirmity, and without this the plaintiff has no case. We think, however, that the judgment should be modified by striking out the wmrds \u201con the merits,\u201d and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
