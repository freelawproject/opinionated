The action is for negligence, and the allegation of the complaint asserts that \u201cthe plaintiff was injured and bruised in his person, and rendered sick, sore, and lame.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>There is no allegation of permanent injury. The defendant asked, among other things, that the plaintiff furnish a bill of particulars of \u201cthe nature, location, and probable duration of each and every injury alleged in the complaint, except as specifically stated therein, showing particularly how plaintiff was \u2018injured and bruised, and rendered sick, sore, and lame,\u2019 as alleged in paragraph three of the complaint.\u201d This demand was refused in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The case of Steinau v. Railway Co., 63 App. Div. 126, 71 N. Y. Supp. 256, supports the order. The court there said (page 127, 63 App. Div., and page 257, 71 N. Y. Supp.): \u201cWe do not think the plaintiff should be compelled to specify by a bill of particulars the injury complained of, its nature, location, and extent.\u201d The same court held in Curtin v. Railway Co., 65 App. Div. 610, 72 N. Y. Supp. 580, that such a bill of particulars should be required in the case of permanent injuries, but thi's has no application to the present case. The defendant may, of course, move in a proper case to compel the plaintiff to make his complaint more definite and certain, and may also apply under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure for a physical examination of the plaintiff. No reason therefore exists for restricting a plaintiff to proof upon the trial of definite items of injury not permanent in character, but which may be progressive in their nature and effects, and of which he may not be aware at the time when the bill of items is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
