Our review of the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, however, reveals that the hearing court properly concluded that the police entry was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The trial court also properly refused defendant\u2019s request to charge assault in the third degree as a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree as charged in the indictment because there was no reasonable view of the evidence that the victim of the assault suffered only physical, but not serious physical injury <em>(People v Glover, </em>57 NY2d 61; <em>People v Green, </em>56 NY2d 427). On the contrary, the evidence established that the victim suffered third degree burns over a third of his body resulting in serious and protracted disfigurement (Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [10]). Defendant\u2019s remaining claims are without merit. (Appeal from judgment of Supreme Court, Monroe County, Reed, J. \u2014 assault, second degree.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P. J., Den-man, Green, Pine and Balio, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
