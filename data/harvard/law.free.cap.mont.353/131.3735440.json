We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AXz\">\u00b62 Whittinghill was charged with DUI and speeding in Helena City Court after an accident in February, 2007. Prior to trial he successfully moved in limine to exclude evidence of a tow truck driver\u2019s statement to police that Whittinghill was intoxicated. The prosecution\u2019s only witness at the City Court trial was the arresting officer. Early in the officer\u2019s direct testimony one of his answers stated that he had responded to a tow truck driver\u2019s report of an accident involving a drunk driver. Whittinghill moved for a mistrial, and the City Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b63 A second trial was set in City Court and Whittinghill moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that a re-trial would subject him to double jeopardy. The City Court denied the motion, finding that while the officer\u2019s testimony was \u201ccareless,\u201dit was not a purposeful act, and that a double jeopardy issue would arise only if the testimony \u201cwere part of an effort by the prosecution to purposely gain an advantage.\u201d Whittinghill was convicted in the second City Court trial and appealed to the District Court of the First Judicial District. He again moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, and the District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u00b64 Whittinghill moved for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy. The District Court, acting as a court of review of the City Court, denied the motion to dismiss concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>there was no evidence of a double jeopardy violation. Whittinghill filed a notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b65 Whittinghill moved the District Court for leave to prepare a statement of unavailable evidence as provided for in M. R. App. P. 8(7), asserting that the record transmitted from the City Court to the District Court was incomplete. The District Court denied the motion, finding that the record was complete and was sufficient to rule on the double jeopardy issue. The District Court held that a trial de novo was the appropriate remedy for any City Court error. Whittinghill appeals this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b66 Whittinghill presents issues for review that we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Api\">\u00b67 Issue One: Whether the District Court properly denied Whittinghill\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges against him on the ground of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b68 Issue Two: Whether the District Court should have held an evidentiary hearing on whether the defense was goaded into making a motion for a mistrial by conduct of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b69 Issue Three: Whether the District Court properly denied Whittinghill\u2019s motion for leave to prepare a statement of unavailable evidence pursuant to M. R. App. P. 8(7)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b610 The decision on a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy presents an issue of law that this Court reviews to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law was correct. <em>State v. Matt, </em>2005 MT 9, \u00b6 6, 325 Mont. 340, 106 P.3d 530. A decision to deny an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Tucker, </em>2008 MT 273, \u00b6 13, 345 Mont. 237, 190 P.3d 1080. The decision on a request to supplement a record is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Public Lands Access Assoc. v. Jones, </em>2004 MT 394, \u00b6 17, 325 Mont. 236, 104 P.3d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\u00b611 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly denied Whittinghill\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges against him on the ground of double jeopardy. </em>Whittinghill was charged and prosecuted in Helena City Court. City courts are part of the court system of this state, \u00a73-1-</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">101, MCA, but are not one of the \u201ccourts of record\u201d designated by \u00a73-1-</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">102, MCA. A court of record ordinarily provides for transcripts of trials and other proceedings, <em>Malley v. Malley, </em>190 Mont. 141, 143, 619 P.2d 531, 532 (1980), but courts not of record do not. A city court has records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of its cases even though its proceedings are not transcribed. <em>See e.g. </em>Rule 3, Uniform Rules for Justice and City Courts (providing that the court is the custodian of all court files, including all exhibits received); \u00a725-33-104, MCA (providing that upon appeal from a city court, the judge must transmit to the district court a \u201ccertified copy of the docket, the pleadings, all notices, motions and other papers filed in the cause\u201d); and \u00a746-17-311, MCA (providing that in criminal case appeals from city court, the court must \u201ctransfer the entire record\u201d to the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b612 The district courts have appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases arising from city court, \u00a7 3-5-503, MCA, and all appeals from criminal cases must be tried \u201canew\u201d or \u201cde novo\u201d in the district court. Sections 25-33-301 and 46-17-311, MCA; <em>City of Three Forks v. Schillinger, </em>2007 MT 331, \u00b6 13, 340 Mont. 211, 173 P.3d 681. The defendant in a city court prosecution must perfect the appeal by filing a timely notice of appeal, and when he does so the city court has the duty to transmit the entire record to the district court. <em>State v. Speith, </em>244 Mont. 392, 394, 797 P.2d 221, 222 (1990); <em>State v. Sol, </em>282 Mont. 69, 74-75, 936 P.2d 307, 310-11 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b613 There are narrow exceptions to the rule of a district court trial de novo in appeals from city court. One exception arises when the second trial in district court would violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. In that instance the district court first sits in review of the proceeding in city court. <em>Schillinger, </em>\u00b6 16. If the district court concludes that a trial de novo would not subject the defendant to double jeopardy, then the trial de novo proceeds. <em>Schillinger, </em>\u00b6 17. This is what happened in Whittinghill\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b614 Both the United States Constitution (Fifth Amendment) and Montana Constitution (Art. II, \u00a7 25) provide that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. Once jeopardy attaches in a prosecution, retrial for the same offense presents potential double jeopardy issues. <em>State v. Barron, </em>2008 MT 69, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 100, 179 P.3d 519. The general rule is that when a defendant consents to termination of the prosecution, such as by successfully moving for a mistrial, double jeopardy does not bar retrial on the same charge. Section 46-11-503(2), MCA; <em>State v. Cates, </em>2009 MT 94, \u00b6 27, 350 Mont. 38, 204 P.3d 1224; <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 18, 326 Mont. 165, 109 P.3d 209. The narrow exception to that general rule occurs when the prosecution, through intentional misconduct, goads the defendant into moving for a mistrial. In that case, the guarantee against double jeopardy may prevent a retrial but a defendant arguing that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>mistrial motion was goaded by prosecutorial misconduct \u201cwill succeed only with great difficulty.\u201d <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b615  This Court has emphasized the narrow and difficult grounds for avoiding a retrial after a defense motion for a mistrial, quoting the following language with approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u2018In cases of mistrial, there must be a finding of \u2018Machiavellian\u2019 design and a vision of future moves worthy of a chess master: first the prosecutor\u2019s perception that the case has gone amiss in some unanticipated way, coupled with an assessment that if only the trial could start over things would improve; then, the decision to goad defense counsel into naively doing the prosecutor\u2019s concealed bidding by moving for the mistrial that the prosecutor secretly desires; followed by some feigned but half-hearted opposition to the defense counsel\u2019s motion; all the while hoping that the trial court thereby has been successfully manipulated into granting it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\"><em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting Rosenthal, <em>Prosecutor Misconduct, Convictions and Double Jeopardy: Case Studies in an Emerging Jurisprudence, </em>71 Temple L. Rev. 887,911 (1998)). The issue turns upon the prosecutor\u2019s intent, based upon \u201cobjective facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 675, 102 S. Ct. 2083, 2089 (1982). Even when the prosecutor\u2019s conduct prompting a motion for mistrial constitutes harassment or overreaching, it is insufficient to bar a retrial \u201cabsent intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 675-76, 102 S. Ct. at 2089.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b616 Whittinghill successfully moved for a mistrial in City Court because the arresting officer referred to the tow truck driver\u2019s report of an intoxicated motorist. He unsuccessfully sought to block a second trial in City Court on the ground of double jeopardy, and then appealed to the District Court. Whittinghill contends that the District Court erred in relying upon the determination of the City Court that the prosecution did not orchestrate the motion for a mistrial so as to bar re-trial on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b617 We find no basis upon which to overturn the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Whittinghill failed to demonstrate that a trial de novo would violate his right to be free from double jeopardy. Helena City Court Judge Bob Wood presided over the first trial and granted Whittinghill\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Judge Wood considered the briefs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>filed by the parties, but rejected Whittinghill\u2019s arguments that the motion for a mistrial was goaded by the prosecution. Judge Wood applied the proper legal standard, citing <em>Billings v. Mouat, </em>2008 MT 66, 342 Mont. 79, 180 P.3d 1121, that the offending testimony that prompted mistrial must have been \u201cpart of an effort by the prosecution to purposely gain an advantage.\u201d He concluded, from his personal observation and knowledge of the event (see <em>Mallak </em>\u00b6 19), that though he was \u201cdismayed at the careless testimony of the officer\u201d he did not believe it was a purposeful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b618 Judge Wood applied the proper legal standard to the facts of the case before him. Whittinghill has not presented any substantial ground to support an argument that Judge Wood\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Even under Whittinghill\u2019s recitation of the events in City Court, the prosecutor simply asked the officer how he had heard about the accident. There is no evidence or even a serious contention that the prosecutor intended to solicit a response from the officer that disclosed the tow truck driver\u2019s opinion on intoxication. The prosecutor had agreed before trial that evidence of the tow truck driver\u2019s opinion about intoxication was not admissible. The prosecution did not resist Whittinghill\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of the tow truck driver\u2019s opinion. There is no evidence that the prosecution\u2019s case had taken any unfortunate turn and could be rescued only by a mistrial. The prosecutor resisted the motion for a mistrial, and the City Court initially denied it, granting the motion only after further consideration during a break. In summary, Whittinghill failed to present anything substantial to indicate that the City Court made an error of fact or law. The District Court concluded that there was nothing more to review and that a re-trial de novo was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b619  The events in this case are similar to those in <em>Mallak, </em>where the prosecution elicited testimony in violation of a motion in limine. We concluded in that case that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b620 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court should have held an evidentiary hearing on whether the defense was goaded into making a motion for a mistrial by conduct of the prosecutor. </em>Whittinghill contends that the District Court, sitting in review of the City Court, should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the prosecutor goaded him into moving for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b621 Taking the factual assertions in Whittinghill\u2019s briefs at face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>value,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nothing in those facts indicates that a hearing would have been anything more than a fishing expedition. Whittinghill did not make a showing in the District Court, such as by an affidavit or offer of proof, of the witnesses he would call and the evidence he anticipated presenting at a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b622 On appeal, Whittinghill lists what he calls the \u201csanitized\u201d facts that would have shown that the defense was goaded into moving for a mistrial. While the parties disagree on whether these facts are properly before this Court, considering them for purposes of the argument, they do not change the outcome. In summary, Whittinghill contends that the prosecution identified the arresting officer as its only witness, and that the prosecution and defense attorneys agreed before trial that the tow truck driver\u2019s statements were inadmissible. The defense moved in limine to exclude such evidence and the City Court granted the motion, which defense counsel invoked once the officer began his testimony. The officer responded to a question by stating in part that the tow truck driver reported an accident involving a drunk driver and the defense moved for a mistrial. The City Court granted the motion and set a second trial at which the prosecution called the tow truck driver as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b623  Whittinghill speculates about the officer\u2019s motive in giving the offending answer, but he has not presented any cogent argument or statement of available evidence to indicate that the situation was a product of misconduct by the prosecutor seeking to \u201csubvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 676, 102 S. Ct. at 2089. There is no showing in these \u2018facts\u201d that the prosecutor perceived his case going badly in an unanticipated way. To the contrary, the parties had agreed before trial that the tow truck driver\u2019s statements were inadmissible. There is no showing that the prosecutor was presented with a situation in which a conviction could be secured only through a second trial. There is no showing that the prosecutor did anything to goad the defense into moving for a mistrial. <em>See generally Mallak, </em>\u00b6 20. The District Court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>its discretion denying Whittinghill\u2019s request for a hearing. The District Court properly held that Whittinghill\u2019s remedy, as the appellant from his City Court conviction, was a trial de novo in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b624 <em>Issue Three: Whether the District Court properly denied Whittinghill\u2019s motion for leave to prepare a statement of unavailable evidence pursuant to M. R. App. P. 8(7)(c). </em>Appellate Rule 8(7) provides that if \u201ca trial or other proceeding was not reported in whole or in part, or if a transcript is, otherwise, unavailable, a statement of the evidence of the trial ... may be prepared.\u201d If the parties do not agree on a statement of unavailable evidence, then the party wishing to proceed can move the district court for leave to \u201cprepare a statement of the unavailable evidence from the best available means, including the party s recollection.\u201d M. R. App. P. 8(7)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b625  Whittinghill invoked that provision in this appeal by moving the District Court for leave to file a statement of unavailable evidence. The District Court properly denied the motion. Rule 8 is not designed to allow a party or attorney to present other evidence, arguments or personal opinions to support its position. Here, Whittinghill made no showing that a reconstructed transcript of the original City Court trial would yield anything relevant to the issue of whether the protections against double jeopardy would prevent a re-trial. Whittinghill did not present any argument that a reconstructed transcript would show evidence that would meet the standard set out in <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 20. Therefore, Whittinghill failed to present a \u2018tenable theory as to possible error\u201d that would be revealed through a reconstructed record. <em>State v. Deschon, </em>2004 MT 32, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 320 Mont. 1, 85 P.3d 756. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant leave to prepare a statement of unavailable evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b626 The District Court is affirmed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> Whittinghill\u2019s arguments on double jeopardy in City Court were similar to his arguments on appeal to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> Whittinghill asserts that \u2018Tacts\u201d stated in his briefs below should have been accepted as established because they were not overtly contested in the prosecutor\u2019s briefs or in orders from the courts. A party can not establish facts in a case by asserting them in a brief. Those are nothing more than an attorney\u2019s statements, which are not evidence. <em>State v. High Elk, </em>2006 MT 6, \u00b6 17, 330 Mont. 259, 127 P.3d 432. Absent competent proof, such as by testimony, stipulation, or judicial notice, an attorney\u2019s statements do not constitute proof of facts. The fact that neither the prosecution nor the court overtly quarrels with an attorney\u2019s assertions is irrelevant to the existence of a fact. b</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
