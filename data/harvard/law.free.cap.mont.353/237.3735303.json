(Big Sky), Treasure State Electrical Contracting Inc. (Treasure State), and Mankin Construction Inc. (Mankin) (collectively, \u201ccontractors\u2019). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u00b63 Whether the contractors\u2019 construction liens have priority over RMB\u2019s trust indenture under \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">\u00b64 In December 2004 Blackhawk Inc. (Blackhawk) took out a construction loan of approximately $5 million from RMB for the purpose of funding the construction of a casino and restaurant, the 12th Planet Entertainment Complex (12th Planet Complex), on property that it owned at 304 South 24th Street, Billings, Montana. In addition to other security for the loan, RMB recorded a trust indenture on the property at 304 South 24th Street. Thereafter, Blackhawk contracted with SPL to install audio and video systems in the 12th Planet Complex for approximately $1.4 million. As SPL performed the contract, Blackhawk initially made payments corresponding to SPL\u2019s progress. As of November 2005, however, Blackhawk stopped making scheduled payments. Nevertheless, SPL continued its work at the 12th Planet Complex, and Blackhawk made no objections to the work performed. Importantly, on November 15,2005, Blackhawk withdrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the last of the proceeds from the construction loan but apparently did not use them to pay SPL. In response to Blackhawk\u2019s non-payment, SPL filed a construction lien on March 23, 2006. SPL substantially completed its work later in March 2006, and subsequently, Blackhawk made one final, partial payment. After this payment, Blackhawk still owed SPL approximately $1 million. In April 2006 SPL filed an amended construction lien. Because Blackhawk failed to pay the remainder of its debt to SPL, SPL sued Blackhawk for breach of contract and to foreclose its construction lien. SPL also sought to have its construction lien adjudged to be prior and superior to any interest of RMB in Blackhawk\u2019s property at 304 South 24th Street. RMB answered, generally denying SPL\u2019s allegations and asserting that its trust indenture had priority over SPL\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">\u00b65 In October 2006 SPL moved for partial summary judgment, seeking, among other things, a ruling that its construction lien was superior to RMB\u2019s trust indenture. SPL argued for priority under \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, because the trust indenture was taken to secure financing for the construction of the 12th Planet Complex. RMB opposed SPL\u2019s motion, arguing first that under \u00a771-3-542(3), MCA, the priority of SPL\u2019s construction lien was limited to the value of those items that could be severed from the 12th Planet Complex without harming the rest of the property. Second, RMB argued that SPL\u2019s construction lien was not entitled to priority under \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, because SPL continued work after RMB made its final loan distribution to Blackhawk. The District Court rejected RMB\u2019s arguments and granted summary judgment to SPL, ruling that under \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, SPL\u2019s construction lien had priority over RMB\u2019s trust indenture because the trust indenture was taken to secure the construction loan made for the purpose of paying for the improvements liened4he construction of the 12th Planet Complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b66 In June 2008 RMB moved the District Court under Rule 59(g), M. R. Civ. P., to alter or amend its prior ruling on the question of priority. In support of its motion, RMB first asserted that a portion of its construction loan to Blackhawk was used to repay existing debt that Blackhawk owed to RMB. Consequently, RMB argued, that portion of the construction loan was not subject to \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, and was entitled to priority over SPL\u2019s construction lien. Second, RMB reasserted its argument that its trust indenture was entitled to priority over that amount of SPL\u2019s construction lien that was incurred after RMB distributed the last of the loan proceeds to Blackhawk on November 15, 2005. SPL opposed this motion, contending that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>motion was procedurally improper and unsustainable on the merits. The District Court did not rule on the motion within the 60-day period provided by Rule 59(g), M. R. Civ. P., and the motion was deemed denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b67 In the meantime, the District Court consolidated SPL\u2019s case with those of other contractors-Big Sky and Treasure State-who had filed construction liens against Blackhawk for services and materials provided for the construction of the 12th Planet Complex. Mankin, who had also filed a construction lien against Blackhawk in relation to the 12th Planet Complex, subsequently appeared in the case. Big Sky, Treasure State, and Mankin all moved for summary judgment, contending that their construction liens had priority over RMB\u2019s trust indenture on the basis of SPL\u2019s arguments and the District Court\u2019s prior grant of summary judgment to SPL. RMB opposed these motions, reasserting the arguments it made in opposition to SPL\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the additional argument it raised in its Rule 59(g), M. R. Civ. P., motion to alter or amend. The District Court granted summary judgment to Big Sky and Treasure State, ruling that their construction liens were superior to RMB\u2019s trust indenture. The District Court also issued a one-sentence judgment in favor of Mankin without addressing whether Mankin\u2019s construction lien was entitled to priority over RMB\u2019s trust indenture. Consequently, Mankin filed a motion under Rule 60(b)(6), M. R. Civ. P.wvhich RMB opposed-feo amend the judgment to, among other things, give its construction lien priority over RMB\u2019s trust indenture. In early 2009 the District Court granted Mankin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b68 After the District Court granted summary judgment to Big Sky and Treasure State, RMB filed another Rule 59(g), M. R. Civ. P., motion to amend and renewed its earlier motion to amend the grant of summary judgment to SPL. The District Court subsequently denied RMB\u2019s renewed motion to amend, reasoning that it had lost jurisdiction to address the issues when it failed to rule on RMB\u2019s initial motion to amend, which had raised the same issues, within the 60-day time period under Rule 59(g), M. R. Civ. P. RMB timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the district court under Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2009 MT 286, \u00b6 15, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675. Under Rule 56(c), M. R. Civ. P., summary judgment is only appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute for correctness. <em>Holm-Sutherland Co., Inc. v. Town of Shelby, </em>1999 MT 150, \u00b6 8, 295 Mont. 65, 982 P.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the contractors\u2019 construction liens have priority over RMB\u2019s trust indenture under \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b612 RMB argues that its trust indenture should receive priority over the contractors\u2019 construction liens in two respects. First, RMB contends that the portion of the trust indenture used to repay Blackhawk\u2019s preexisting debt should receive priority over the contractors\u2019 construction liens. Second, RMB asserts that its entire trust indenture should receive priority over the lien amounts for labor and materials provided after Blackhawk had exhausted its loan from RMB. We find no merit to either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b613 RMB did not present its first argument to the District Court when SPL initially moved for summary judgment, but only raised the argument later in its Rule 59(g), M. R. Civ. P., motion to amend. We do not consider arguments that were not presented to the District Court, but raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>2005 MT 154, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 413, 114 P.3d 269. Nor may a party use Rule 59, M. R. Civ. P., to \u201craise arguments which could have been raised prior to judgment or [to] give a litigant a second bite at the apple.\u201d <em>Hi-Tech Motors, Inc. v. Bombardier Motor Corp. of Am., </em>2005 MT 187, \u00b6 34, 328 Mont. 66, 117 P.3d 159. Because RMB did not properly raise its first argument before the District Court, we decline to address it on appeal. \u00b614 RMB contends that it did, in fact, raise its argument for partial priority of the portion of the trust indenture used to repay Blackhawk\u2019s preexisting debt in response to SPL\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. This, however, is overstatement. While RMB did mention that a portion of the proceeds provided pursuant to the trust indenture \u201cwere used to pay off an existing debt Blackhawk owed to Rocky Mountain Bank,\u201d it did so only in the factual introduction of its brief. RMB did not present any analysis or argument based on these facts in the argument section of its brief. We do not address new legal theories on appeal because it \u201cwould be \u2018fundamentally -unfair\u2019 to fault the District Court in not ruling on an issue never before presented.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Dayberry v. City of E. Helena, </em>2003 MT 321, \u00b6 24, 318 Mont. 301, 80 P.3d 1218. Here, it would be fundamentally unfair to fault the District Court for failing to discern a phantom argument that the facts of the case might have suggested, but which was not actually presented by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b615 To address RMB\u2019s second argument, we must consider and interpret the controlling statute, \u00a771-3-542, MCA. Section 71-3-542, MCA, provides this state\u2019s method for determining priority between construction liens and other encumbrances on property. Section 71-3-542(1), MCA, presents the default \u2018first in time, first in right\u201d rule: a construction lien has priority over encumbrances that attach to an improvement or the real property on which the improvement is located and that are filed after the construction lien has attached. Section 71-3-542(2), MCA, presents the converse application of the \u2018first in time, first in right\u201drule: encumbrances on an improvement or real property that are filed prior to the attachment of a construction lien have priority over the construction lien. Exceptions to the application of \u00a771-3-542(2), MCA, are found in \u00a771-3-542(3), (4), MCA. Section 71-3-542(3), MCA, provides that a construction lien has priority, to the extent of the value of work performed or the value of the improvement, over a previously filed encumbrance if the improvement is severable. Section 71-3-542(4), MCA, which is directly at issue here, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">A construction lien has priority over an interest, lien, mortgage, or encumbrance that is filed before the construction lien attaches if that interest, lien, mortgage, or encumbrance was taken to secure advances made for the purpose of paying for the particular real estate improvement to which the lien was attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b616 When interpreting a statute, our objective is to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent from \u201cthe plain meaning of the language\u201d of the statute. <em>Contreras v. Fitzgerald, </em>2002 MT 208, \u00b6 14, 311 Mont. 257, 54 P.3d 983 (quoting <em>In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, 977 P.2d 967). It is not our role to \u201cinsert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. \u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, </em>2002 MT 8, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 111, 39 P.3d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b617 RMB proposes that the plain language of \u00a7 71-3-542(4), MCA, requires us to grant RMB\u2019s trust indenture priority over those amounts of the contractors\u2019 construction liens that are attributable to labor and materials provided after RMB had fully disbursed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Blackhawk\u2019s loan proceeds. We find no support in \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, or any other subsection of \u00a771-3-542, MCA, for this proposition. On the contrary, \u00a771-3-542, MCA, addresses encumbrances and construction liens. It does not discuss or provide any means of partitioning encumbrances or construction liens and then assigning priority among resultant parts. Nor is there any indication how such a procedure would operate. For these reasons and because construction liens are \u201cremedial in nature, with [their] foundation in equity and natural justice,\u201d <em>Beck v. Hanson, </em>180 Mont. 82, 87, 589 P.2d 141, 144 (1979), we decline to insert the nuances advocated by RMB into \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA. Instead, consistent with the plain language of the statute, we will consider each party\u2019s encumbrance-RMB\u2019s trust indenture and each contractor\u2019s construction lien-as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">\u00b618  Here, it is undisputed that Blackhawk executed the trust indenture for the nonexclusive purpose of securing advances for the construction of the 12th Planet Complex. Nor is it disputed that the construction liens at issue attached to the 12th Planet Complex, for which the contractors provided services and materials. Consequently, under a plain reading of \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, the construction liens, in their entirety, have priority over the entirety of the trust indenture. Thus, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the contractors on the issue of the priority of their construction liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b619 In opposition to this conclusion, RMB argues for priority with regard to lien amounts incurred after November 15, 2005, when RMB distributed the last of the construction loan proceeds to Blackhawk. After that date, RMB submits, the contractors were in a better position than RMB was to protect their interests. To support this argument, RMB cites <em>American Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Schenk, </em>241 Mont. 177, 785 P.2d 1024 (1990). In <em>Schenk, </em>the landowner borrowed money from the lender to purchase a bar. 241 Mont. at 178, 785 P.2d at 1025. The lender secured the loan with a deed of trust on the bar property. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 178, 785 P.2d at 1025. Nearly a year later, and unbeknownst to the lender, the landowner contracted with the builder to remodel the bar. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 178, 180-81, 785 P.2d at 1025, 1027. Apparently, the landowner failed to pay for the remodeling, prompting the builder to file a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 178, 785 P.2d at 1025. The issue on appeal was whether the mechanic\u2019s lien had priority over the deed of trust. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 178, 785 P.2d at 1025. The Court, applying the rule that the party with the least ability to protect its financial interest has priority over other prior recorded encumbrances, held that the lender\u2019s deed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>trust had priority. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 181, 785 P.2d at 1027. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that prior cases showed that lenders could protect their financial interests in property from subsequent mechanic\u2019s liens by withholding funds requested for subsequent improvements or by requiring the landowner to obtain lien waivers from the builders. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 180, 785 P.2d at 1026 (citing <em>Home Interiors, Inc. v. Hendrickson, </em>214 Mont. 194, 199, 692 P.2d 1229, 1232 (1984)). Distinguishing prior case law, the Court reasoned that the lender in <em>Schenk </em>could not have protected itself by withholding funds or obtaining lien waivers because it did not know and could not reasonably have known that the owner intended to remodel the bar. <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 180-81, 785 P.2d at 1027. On the other hand, the Court explained, the builder could have protected itself by discovering the prior deed of trust, <em>Schenk, </em>241 Mont. at 181, 785 P.2d at 1027, and then, presumably, refusing to remodel the bar. \u00b620 [2] We are unconvinced by RMB\u2019s argument. Initially, this argument rests on the proposition, which we here reject as unsupported by the language of the statute, that \u00a771-3-542, MCA, allows courts to parse encumbrances and then assign priority among the constituent parts. Moreover, <em>Schenk </em>is materially different from this case. Principally, in <em>Schenk, </em>the deed of trust was taken prior to the attachment of the mechanic\u2019s lien and was not taken to secure advances to finance the remodeling, but rather to purchase the property. 241 Mont. at 178, 180-81, 785 P.2d at 1025,1027 (noting that loan was to purchase bar and that remodeling commenced subsequent to the loan). Thus, though the Court did not articulate it, the situation in <em>Schenk </em>was governed by \u00a7 71-3-542(2), MCA. In contrast, here, RMC\u2019s trust indenture was taken to secure advances to finance the construction of the 12th Planet Complex, and, therefore, \u00a771-3-542(4), MCA, an exception to \u00a771-3-542(2), MCA, controls. Accordingly, this case is directly controlled by statute, and <em>Schenk </em>is inapposite. Furthermore, even if <em>Schenk </em>here, it would not justify giving RMB\u2019s trust indenture priority over the contractors\u2019 construction liens. In <em>Schenk </em>the Court considered whether the lender had the opportunity to protect itself at the time it loaned the funds to the landowner. 241 Mont. at 180-81, 785 P.2d at 1027. Because at the time it made the loan, the lender did not know and could not reasonably have known of the landowner\u2019s intention to remodel the bar, the Court reasoned, the lender did not have an opportunity to protect itself. 241 Mont. at 180-81, 785 P.2d at 1027. The opposite is the case here, where RMB loaned the proceeds to Blackhawk for the express purpose of constructing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>12th Planet Complex. At the time it made the loan, RMB had the opportunity to protect itself by either not making the loan or by conditioning it on Blackhawk\u2019s obtaining lien waivers from the contractors. Consequently, <em>Schenk </em>does not support granting partial priority to RMB.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
