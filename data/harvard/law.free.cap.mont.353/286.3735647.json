(Liberty Cove) appeals from an order of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, affirming the Missoula County Board of County Commissioners\u2019 (County Commissioners) decision to adopt interim zoning banning, for one year, development of gravel pits on Liberty Cove\u2019s property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b62 Liberty Cove argues that Missoula County\u2019s decision to enact interim zoning was arbitrary and capricious, and violated Montana law. Specifically, Liberty Cove challenges the zoning decision by raising the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court erred in concluding there was an emergency to justify interim zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Missoula County gave proper notice before adopting interim zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the interim zoning adopted by Missoula County did not constitute illegal reverse spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">\u00b66 Liberty Cove appeals an interim zoning decision by the Missoula County Commissioners for an area north of Lolo. The Missoula County Board of County Commissioners enacted interim zoning to address public health and safety concerns regarding a proposal to establish a gravel mining, crushing, and asphalt production operation on property owned by Liberty Cove. The concerns arose from the possibility that the mining applicant would receive a mining permit without any substantive environmental review by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and because the mining applicant indicated that they could avoid oversight of traffic impacts by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00b67 On April 28, 2006, Liberty Cove entered into a purchase agreement with JTL Group, Inc. (JTL) (now Knife River) for \u201cconstruction of a lake\u201d on Liberty Cove\u2019s property. JTL contracted for the gravel mining operations. An open-cut mining permit from DEQ was required in order to dig the lake and remove gravel. JTL requested a zoning compliance permit from Missoula County as part of the mining permit application process. The County granted the zoning compliance permit on March 8, 2006, noting that the site location was not zoned. DEQ deemed the mining permit application complete in January 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b68 Missoula County received complaints from Lolo residents requesting the County enact interim zoning to address environmental and traffic concerns at the site. The County held a public meeting on December 19, 2007, to discuss imposing interim zoning to preclude mining operations. At that time, the County Commissioners did not find an emergency to justify interim zoning, because environmental concerns would be subject to DEQ review of the mining permit application, and traffic concerns would be addressed by MDT review of the application for a permit to access Highway 93, then the only access to the gravel pit proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b69 On May 23, 2008, JTL sued DEQ seeking a court order that DEQ issue a permit for the proposed mining operation. Since other district court orders had granted this relief, the County Commissioners were concerned that DEQ could issue a permit without substantive environmental review. The County also learned that JTL might pursue a different access to the gravel pit that would not require a MDT permit and thus would not be subject to any regulatory review regarding public health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b610 The County Commissioners scheduled a public meeting for May 30,2008, to address these issues and the possibility of enacting interim zoning. The County posted notice of the meeting on its website and issued a press release announcing the meeting, which resulted in a prominent front page article in the <em>Missoulian. </em>The County Commissioners received significant public comment prior to making a decision, including comment from JTL and Liberty Cove. The County Commissioners then determined that an emergency existed due to changed circumstances caused by JTL and enacted interim zoning to address the emergency. The interim zoning placed various residential designations on the area where Liberty Cove\u2019s property is located.</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">\u00b611 Liberty Cove challenged the County s interim zoning on June 26, 2008, and the District Court affirmed the County s action on March 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>2009. Liberty Cove now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b612 A local government\u2019s zoning designation constitutes a legislative act, which courts review for abuse of discretion. <em>North 93 Neighbors, Inc. v.

The board of county commissioners may extend the interim resolution for 1 year, but not more than one extension may be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">In 2002, the Montana Attorney General issued an opinion on this statute concluding that \u2018both \u2018emergency* and \u2018urgency\u2019 measures exist if there is some exigent circumstance impacting the public health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>safety and welfare, and zoning is required to address the exigency.\u201d 49 Mont. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 23, \u00a7 IV, http://www.doj.mt.gov/ resources/opinions2002/49-023.pdf (Sept. 26, 2002). \u2018The question of what constitutes an \u2018exigency\u2019 is necessarily fact-bound, and under the law it is left largely to the discretion of the local governing body.\u201d 49 Mont. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 23, \u00a7IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b615 Liberty Cove primarily argues that there was no emergency to justify interim zoning. Liberty Cove claims that the sole basis for the emergency was the fact that DEQ had failed to timely issue a permit. Liberty Cove contends that DEQ already reviewed the mining permit application and deemed it complete, that DEQ would retain regulatory responsibilities after issuing a permit, and that Missoula County found that no emergency existed in December 2007. Liberty Cove maintains that no facts or expert testimony support finding an emergency in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b616 At the May 30, 2008, public meeting, the County Commissioners found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">the application of a permit from the JTL Group, also known as Knife River, constitutes an emergency related to issues of public health, welfare and safety, because the Board of County Commissioners find a deficiency, or failure, of the regulatory process regarding these issues as promulgated by the State of Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the State of Montana Department of Transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">More specifically, the interim zoning resolution included findings that \u201crecent legal decisions in the State of Montana may compel DEQ to issue a permit without the review that is normally carried out by DEQ\u201d and \u2018MDT will not be able to require traffic control measures during the operation of the pit that will adequately protect public health and safety .\u2019\u2019The District Court referenced these findings in concluding that \u201cthe Board validly exercised its discretion in enacting interim zoning as they determined based on the facts before them that an interim measure was needed to resolve an exigent circumstance impacting the public health, safety, and general welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b617  We agree with the District Court that \u201ca reasonable emergency existed to enact the interim zoning.\u201d In December 2007, the County Commissioners found that no emergency existed because they understood that DEQ would conduct additional environmental review and MDT would address traffic concerns related to the proposed gravel mine. However, by May of 2008, the County Commissioners realized that DEQ could issue a mining permit without additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>environmental review and that changes in access to the gravel mine would not require a MDT permit. Since the County Commissioners\u2019 earlier findings were based on facts that were no longer applicable, the Board was justified in finding an emergency related to issues of public health, safety, and welfare due to regulatory deficiencies. The County Commissioners were within their discretion as the local governing body in finding an emergency justifying adoption of interim zoning. \u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Missoula County gave proper notice before adopting interim zoning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b619 Liberty Cove asserts that notice for interim zoning under \u00a776-2-206, MCA (2007), is governed by the procedural requirements outlined in \u00a776-2-205, MCA. Because Missoula County did not give notice of the interim zoning hearing according to the procedural requirements for standard zoning set out in \u00a776-2-205, MCA, Liberty Cove claims that the interim zoning is invalid. Missoula County notes that a plain reading of \u00a7 76-2-206, MCA (2007), imposes no such procedural requirements, and is actually silent as to any required notice or hearing. Missoula County further argues that requiring the County to follow the same procedure to enact interim zoning as required to enact standard zoning under \u00a7 76-2-205, MCA, would render the interim zoning statute superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b620 Liberty Cove cites cases from this Court holding that \u00a776-2-206, MCA, is governed by the notice and hearing provisions of \u00a776-2-205, MCA, thereby voiding temporary interim resolutions enacted in emergency sessions to stop completion of particular buildings. <em>Bryant Dev. Assn. v. Dagel, </em>166 Mont. 252, 258, 531 P.2d 1320, 1324 (1975); <em>State ex rel. Christian, Spring, Sielbach &amp; Assocs. v. Miller, </em>169 Mont. 242, 245, 545 P.2d 660, 662 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court recently clarified that <em>Bryant </em>and <em>Christian </em>held that due process requires that the notice and hearing procedures of standard zoning apply to interim zoning. <em>Fasbender, </em>\u00b6 17. However, in those cases the affected landowners received no notice of the emergency sessions that adopted interim zoning. <em>Fasbender, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16; <em>Bryant, </em>166 Mont. at 254, 258, 531 P.2d at 1322, 1324; <em>Christian, </em>169 Mont. at 244-45, 545 P.2d at 661-62.</p>\n<p id=\"Am2\">\u00b621  Liberty Cove received actual notice and in fact commented at the hearings contemplating interim zoning. The law has long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>recognized that actual attendance and participation may constitute a waiver of alleged deficiencies of notice. <em>See e.g. Knode v. Williamson, </em>84 U.S. 586, 589 (1873). Furthermore, the Montana Constitution\u2019s fundamental right of citizen participation guaranteed by Art. II, \u00a78, has been interpreted by statute as requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard. Sections 2-3-101 through -114, MCA. Liberty Cove received notice and had an opportunity to comment at the public meeting considering interim zoning. This Court\u2019s harmless error doctrine provides that \u201c[t]he court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 61. Thus, since Liberty Cove received notice and had an opportunity to be heard, any error in Missoula County\u2019s notice was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b622 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the interim zoning adopted by Missoula County did not constitute illegal reverse spot zoning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b623 Liberty Cove argues that the interim zoning of its property constitutes illegal \u201creverse\u201d spot zoning. Liberty Cove alleges its land was improperly singled out to receive detrimental treatment. Liberty Cove notes that the interim zoning restricts the use of its property more than other properties in the area. Liberty Cove suggests that the zoning compliance permit and a previous denial of a residential subdivision on the property is further evidence of spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b624 This Court has addressed spot zoning issues in multiple cases. <em>Lake Co. First v. Poison City Council, </em>2009 MT 322, \u00b6\u00b6 49-52, 352 Mont. 489, 218 P.3d 816; <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65-70; <em>Citizen Advocates For A Livable Missoula, Inc. v. City Council of City of Missoula, </em>2006 MT 47, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, 331 Mont. 269, 130 P.3d 1259; <em>Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Inc. v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Gallatin Co., </em>2001 MT 99, \u00b6\u00b6 19-37, 305 Mont. 232, 25 P.3d <em>168; Boland v. City of Great Falls, </em>275 Mont. 128, 132-35, 910 P.2d 890, 893-95 (1996); <em>Little v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Flathead Co., </em>193 Mont. 334, 345-48, 631 P.2d 1282, 1289-90 (1981); <em>Mont. Wildlife Fedn. v. Sager, </em>190 Mont. 247, 263-64, 620 P.2d 1189, 1198-99 (1980); <em>State ex rel. Gutkoski v. Langhor, </em>160 Mont. 351, 353-54, 502 P.2d 1144, 1145-46 (1972). Our review of this well-developed precedent yields two important conclusions: this Court has never considered or adopted a \u201creverse\u201d spot zoning analysis, and this Court has never applied its spot zoning analysis to interim zoning. We decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b625  This Court\u2019s three-part spot zoning test adopted in <em>Little </em>requires consideration of factors that may not apply to interim zoning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In particular, the third part of the spot zoning test considers whether \u201cthe requested change is more in the nature of special legislation.\u201d <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346, 631 P.2d at 1289. In its discussion of this factor, the Court noted that \u201cthe inquiry should involve whether the requested use \u2018is in accord with a comprehensive plan.\u2019\u201d <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 347, 631 P.2d at 1290. The Court\u2019s review of other jurisdictions\u2019 spot zoning analysis reinforced this point: \u201czoning has been held invalid as spot zoning when it is not in accordance with a comprehensive plan. We cannot ignore this test when our zoning statutes place great weight on the comprehensive plan as a guide in zoning.\u201d <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 347, 631 P.2d at 1290 (internal citations omitted). However, a local government may adopt interim zoning without a comprehensive plan (now designated a growth policy) to address an emergency of public health, safety, or welfare, while developing a growth policy. Section 76-2-206(1), MCA (2007); 49 Mont. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 23, \u00a7 IV. Indeed, interim zoning allows a local government to enact temporary zoning to avoid suffering serious detriment while pursuing the necessary planning efforts to adopt a growth policy as a condition precedent to enacting standard zoning. <em>Allen v. Flathead Co., </em>184 Mont. 58, 63, 601 P.2d 399, 402 (1979) (\u00a776-2-206, MCA, \u201cprovides a method by which Flathead County may begin developing a master plan [now growth policy] that will comply with the terms of the statute without suffering any serious detriment\u201d in light of the Court invalidating the challenged zoning regulations). Since interim zoning is effective for only one year (with authority to extend it for another year) and may be implemented without a growth policy in place, our spot zoning test is not applicable to interim zoning. Spot zoning challenges to interim zoning measures would serve only to distract local governments from the important planning efforts required to implement standard zoning and would be of limited utility since interim zoning will terminate within a year or two. Therefore, we hold that spot zoning challenges are not applicable to interim zoning measures adopted pursuant to \u00a776-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> The Legislature recently amended \u00a776-2-206, MCA (2009), to provide express notice requirements for adopting interim zoning.
