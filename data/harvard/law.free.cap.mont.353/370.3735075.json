We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b62 Marion Williams was entitled to receive a pension from the City of Dillon\u2019s Police Retirement Fund, based upon her late husband\u2019s service as the Dillon Chief of Police. She began receiving the pension benefits in 1973, and after 1980 her monthly benefit remained $480 until 2001. Under Montana law Mrs. Williams was entitled to receive a pension payment not less than one-half of the salary paid each fiscal year to a newly confirmed Dillon police officer. Dillon filed annual reports with the Montana State Auditor reflecting the amounts paid to beneficiaries from its Police Retirement Fund and the amount paid to a newly confirmed police officer. The State then sent a yearly payment to Dillon in the amount of the difference in the amount of pension it paid and one-half the salary of a newly confirmed Dillon police officer. Mrs. Williams was the only beneficiary of the Dillon Police Retirement Fund who was entitled to receive the State payment of the difference between the pension and the salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b63 Despite the fact that Dillon filed the annual reports and received a payment from the State each year between 1982 and 2001, it never paid these amounts to Mrs. Williams. Dillon discovered the error in 2001 and adjusted Mrs. Williams\u2019 pension benefit amount prospectively but refused to pay her the unpaid amounts going back to 1982. Mrs. Williams sued Dillon to recover the pension benefits she had not been paid, plus interest. The principal amount of the unpaid pension benefits was just over $98,000, and by the time the case concluded the interest was over $107,000</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b64 MMIA is a self-insurance plan created by numerous Montana cities and towns under the Interlocal Cooperation Act, \u00a7 7-11-101 through -108, MCA. MMIA is governed by a Board of Directors elected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>by the member cities and towns. All expenses of the MMIA, including claims defense and payment, come from premium payments made by the member cities and towns. The coverage provided by MMIA is determined by coverage memoranda adopted by the Board. MMIA is not subject to the provisions of the Montana Insurance Code, \u00a733-1-102(9)(a), MCA. MMIA provided self-insurance coverage to Dillon.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b65 In December, 2001, Dillon tendered defense of the Williams claim to MMIA. The tender letter from the City\u2019s attorney explained that while Dillon had received the money from the State each year since the 1970s, the City had not paid that money to Mrs. Williams. The letter stated: \u2018To further compound the situation, our fund has been inadequately funded, and the City has used the money from the state to pay other liabilities.\u201dMMIA declined to provide coverage or defense of the Williams claim based upon an exclusion in its coverage memoranda. The relevant language excluded coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">Any liability of the Covered Party arising in whole or in part out of the covered party obtaining remuneration or financial gain to which the covered party was not legally entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">This is referred to as the \u201cfinancial gain\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b66 MMIA applied this coverage exclusion on the ground that the City\u2019s liability to Williams arose from the City\u2019s having kept her money to which it was not legally entitled. Dillon defended itself in the Williams action, which concluded in 2005 with summary judgment in Williams\u2019 favor. The District Court in that action held that the City had a fiduciary obligation to Mrs. Williams, and that the City had converted to its own use her money and the use of that money over time. The District Court entered judgment for Mrs. Williams against the City for just over $205,000, representing the years of unpaid pension benefits plus interest and costs but not attorney fees. Dillon paid the judgment and sued MMIA to recover the judgment, interest on the judgment and defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b67 The City and MMIA each moved for summary judgment. On April 29, 2008, the District Court entered an order construing the MMIA coverage memoranda to conclude that MMIA had no liability to the City as to the principal amount of the Williams claim; that MMIA had a duty to defend the City based upon Williams\u2019 claim for interest; and that the amount of damages remained to be determined. As to the principal amount of the Williams claim, the District Court held that it was covered by the MMIA policy, but that coverage was excluded under the \u201cfinancial gain exclusion\u201d because the principal amount due to Mrs. Williams never belonged to the City. The District Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that \u2018Itjhere should he no payment due from the insurer when no loss has been incurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">\u00b68 Using much the same analysis of the MMIA coverage memoranda, the District Court further concluded that Mrs. Williams\u2019 claim for interest was also covered under the policy. However, unlike the claim for principal, the District Court held that the financial gain exclusion did not apply because there was \u201cno financial gain resulting from exposure to pay a loss which must be funded from the City\u2019s own resources.\u201d The District Court later in the order explained that there was a potential difference \u201cbetween the interest the City could or should have earned\u201d on the Williams principal and the interest it had to pay her as a result of her lawsuit. \u2018The possibility of this difference and potential loss existed when MMIA declined to defend the City. The facts assert a covered risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b69 The District Court issued a further order in the case on October 6, 2008. This order confirmed the prior conclusion that MMIA had a duty to defend based upon Mrs. Williams\u2019 claim for interest \u201cwhich potentially could result in a covered loss to the City.\u201d The District Court concluded that MMIA had breached its duty to defend and was therefore liable to Dillon for the entire amount of the Williams judgment, including the principal amount, interest, and attorney fees. On October 15, 2008, the District Court entered judgment for the City for $205,611.80 (principal and interest awarded to Williams); $29,915.21 (attorney fees for defending the Williams claim); $76,271.34 (pre-judgment on the prior amounts); and $103,932.78 (attorney fees in the action against MMIA). MMIA appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b610 MMIA raised several issues on appeal, one of which we find dispositive: Whether MMIA had a duty to defend Dillon on the Williams claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b611 This is an appeal from the District Court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment to Dillon. This Court reviews summary judgment rulings de novo, using the same criteria in M. R. Civ. P. 56 used by the district court. <em>Virginia City v. Estate of Olson, </em>2009 MT 3, \u00b6 14, 348 Mont. 279, 201 P.3d 115. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Gibson, </em>2007 MT 153, \u00b6 9, 337 Mont. 509, 163 P.3d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u00b612 While the parties addressed a number of legal issues potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>applicable to this appeal, we conclude that it may be resolved by applying the MMIA\u2019s coverage memoranda. As noted above and as found by the District Court, MMIA\u2019s obligation to Dillon is governed by the language of its coverage memoranda. The District Court held that while the Williams claim was a covered loss, the clause referred to as the \u201cfinancial gain\u201d exclusion precluded coverage. The District Court applied the \u2018financial gain\u201d exclusion only to Williams\u2019 claim for the principal amount of her unpaid pension benefits, but declined to apply it to Williams\u2019 claim for interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b613 This approach construes and applies the \u2018financial gain\u201dexclusion too narrowly, and in contravention of its plain language. The exclusion, as noted above, provides that there is no coverage for \u2018ta]ny liability\u201d of Dillon that arises \u2018in whole or in part\u201d from Dillon\u2019s obtaining money that it is not entitled to. The clear and explicit language of a contract governs its interpretation, \u00a728-3-401, MCA, and the words are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense, \u00a728-3-501, MCA. The unambiguous plain language of an insurance policy coverage exclusion is applied. <em>State v. Allendale Mutual Ins. Co., </em>2007 MT 83, \u00b6 15, 337 Mont. 49, 154 P.3d 1233. We therefore apply the plain language of the MMIA memoranda governing exclusions from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b614 It is plain that Dillon incurred liability to Mrs. Williams when it converted to its own use the money the State sent each year for her benefit. Dillon\u2019s liability for both the principal amount and interest on that amount as provided by law was established as a matter of law in the District Court\u2019s orders in Mrs. Williams\u2019 action against Dillon. Dillon\u2019s liability was also established in the District Court\u2019s April 28, 2008 order in this case, which held that Dillon had converted Mrs. Williams\u2019 pension payments <em>and </em>her right to the use of that money over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b615  Mrs. Williams\u2019 claim against Dillon for the principal and the interest on the principal both arose solely from Dillon\u2019s having obtained the State money that rightfully belonged to her. The Williams principal claim and interest claim are inextricably related and both arise from and constitute conversion. An entity that converts the money of another also converts the interest-fehe right of the other to use the money. In the arena of credit transactions, the statutory definition of interest is \u2018the compensation allowed by law or fixed by the parties for the use or forbearance or detention of money.\u201d Section 31-1-104, MCA. Most cases dealing with the recoverability of interest involve claims for interest allegedly due as compensation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>detention of money. In other words, the interest sought is money which the injured party hypothetically could have earned, through investment or otherwise, if the injury-causing party had timely paid compensation to them. <em>Martel Construction v. Department of Highways, </em>249 Mont. 507, 512-13, 817 P.2d 677, 680 (1991). The use of the interest Williams \u2018hypothetically could have earned\u201d is a gain to Dillon and was excluded from coverage under the terms of the coverage memoranda. Therefore, MMIA had no duty to provide coverage to Dillon on the Williams claim and could not be held liable to Dillon for the liabilities or any other losses it incurred because of its conversion of the Williams pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\u00b616  The issue in this case was not whether Dillon actually experienced a \u201cfinancial gain\u201d from interest on Williams\u2019 money. The issue was not the source of funds Dillon may have used to pay the Williams judgment. <em>See </em>\u00a72-9-316, MCA, providing local governments with several options for raising funds to pay judgments. The issue, under the language governing coverage, was whether the Williams claim arose in whole or in part from Dillon\u2019s unlawful retention of Williams\u2019 money. It did, and therefore Dillon had no coverage for Williams\u2019 claims for return of principal and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b617 The District Court is reversed and the judgment against MMIA is vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ATy\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b618 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision. I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\u00b619 Contrary to the Court\u2019s characterization of the issue in \u00b6 16 of the Opinion, the actual ruling of the District Court in its April 29, 2008 summary judgment order was that since there was no unequivocal demonstration that Dillon had earned as much interest as it had to pay to Williams, the claim for interest was a potential loss and MMIA had a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b620 The trial court was correct. Because MMIA and Dillon both sought summary judgment, neither asserted that Dillon had, in fact, earned interest on Williams\u2019 pension benefits (and, if so, in what amount). Accordingly, in his April 29, 2009 summary judgment order, the trial judge held that if the difference between the interest Dillon could or should have earned during the time it wrongfully retained Williams\u2019 benefits was less than the interest paid to Williams, \u201cthen there is a loss.\u201d The District Court held that the possibility that Dillon had not earned as much interest as it had to pay Williams was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>trigger MMIA\u2019s duty to defend-in the absence of an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against Dillon did not fall within the coverage memorandum. In my view, that is really all this case is about-MMIA\u2019s refusal to defend Dillon and the consequences of that refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b621 At bottom, MMIA\u2019s contract with Dillon is, undisputedly, an indemnity agreement. As defined by \u00a728-11-301, MCA, an indemnity contract is one \u201cby which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties or of some other person.\u201d Under \u00a728-11-316, MCA, Tt]he person indemnifying [here MMIA] is bound, on request of the person indemnified [Dillon], to defend actions or proceedings brought against [Dillon] in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity ....\u2019\u2019Moreover, this statute also provides that \u201c[i]f, after request [for indemnification], [MMIA] neglects to defend [Dillon], a recovery against [Dillon] suffered by [Dillon] in good faith is conclusive in favor of [Dillon] against [MMIA].\u201d So long as there was a \u201cpotential loss\u201d to Dillon, as the District Court ruled, then MMIA\u2019s statutory duty to defend existed. When MMIA twice summarily refused to defend, it did so at its peril. Section 28-11-316, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b622 The Court\u2019s decision that Dillon had no coverage for this potential loss, contradicts MMIA\u2019s concessions at the summary judgment proceeding in August 2008. At that hearing, MMIA asserted that there should be a hearing to determine the actual amount of\u2018lost interest to the City\u201d-thus conceding the \u201cpotential loss\u201d found by the trial judge. More importantly, MMIA conceded that this potential loss was covered and that \u201c[i]f it exists, it should be paid.\u201d The Court\u2019s decision here^hat there was no coverage for any loss suffered by Dillon as a result of the Williams\u2019 judgment-flies in the face of MMIA\u2019s own statements in the District Court that portions of the Williams\u2019 judgment were, in fact, covered under its agreement with Dillon.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b623 MMIA\u2019s duty to defend-and, again that is all this case is about-arose, as a matter of law, because when Dillon tendered defense of the Williams\u2019 case, there had been no unequivocal demonstration that that part of William\u2019s claim for interest on the past-due pension benefits was excluded from coverage. Even MMIA admitted that. It argued for a hearing to determine Dillon\u2019s loss, after maintaining that it should not have to pay the entire Williams\u2019 judgment against Dillon since the potential loss on interest might be <em>de minimis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b624 MMIA acknowledged in the trial court that our rule in <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>381, controlled-i.e., \u201c[u]nless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against an insured does not fall within the insurance policy\u2019s coverage, an insurer has a duty to defend,\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22, and the insurer is liable for the amount of the total judgment against the insured in the underlying case, <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 20. Because MMIA twice summarily rejected Dillon\u2019s tender of defense when there was a potential covered loss, MMIA must now bear the consequences of its conduct under <em>Staples. </em>MMIA should be held liable to Dillon for the entire Williams\u2019 judgment. <em>Staples </em>demands that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b625 As this case was argued in the court below, the District Court\u2019s decision, Opinion, \u00b6 7, was correct and should be affirmed. I respectfully dissent from our contrary decision here.</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
