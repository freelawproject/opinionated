He filed the instant action in the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County, to collect a commission on the sale of N. Peter Schenk\u2019s 10,000-acre ranch, known as the Whiskey Trail Ranch. The problem is that Schenk\u2019s alleged promise to pay this commission was not made in writing, and Schenk thus asserted the statute of frauds (\u00a7 28-2-903, MCA) as a defense to Andersen\u2019s claim. The District Court agreed with Schenk and entered judgment in his favor. Andersen now appeals. We affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b62 This case was resolved in the District Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. In this connection, it is important to note that at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make findings of fact, weigh the evidence, choose one disputed fact over another, or assess the credibility of witnesses. Rather, the court examines the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact relating to the legal issues raised and, if there is not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the undisputed facts. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 28, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. This Court employs the same approach in reviewing de novo a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b63 The record presented by the parties in support of their respective motions for summary judgment reflects the following. In 2002, Schenk\u2019s wife Jane initiated divorce proceedings in Illinois state court. One of the marital assets was the Whiskey Trail Ranch, which is located within the exterior boundaries of the Flathead Indian Reservation. Schenk preferred not to sell the ranch, which was titled in his name, and instead hoped to obtain an offer or valuation that he could then use for purposes of buying out Jane\u2019s marital interest. He determined that he would not sell the ranch unless he received an offer of at least $10 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b64 Schenk decided to contact the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes about the possible sale of the ranch. He had previously promised former Tribal Council Chairman Mickey Pablo that if he was ever considering selling the ranch, he would give the Tribes the first opportunity to purchase it. Pablo had since passed away, and Schenk had no other contacts with the Tribes, but he believed that Andersen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>did. Thus, Schenk contacted Andersen about introducing him to the current Tribal Council chairman so that Schenk could ascertain whether the Tribes were still interested in purchasing the ranch and, if so, what price they would offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b65 Andersen has been a licensed real estate broker since the mid-1980s, though his experience in the real estate business dates back to the early 1960s. Andersen agreed to make the introduction, but there was no discussion between him and Schenk about compensation or a commission, and they did not enter into a listing agreement for the sale of the ranch. Andersen facilitated a few meetings between Schenk and several tribal members; however, the Tribes and Schenk ultimately dealt with each other directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b66 Schenk\u2019s negotiations with the Tribes were unsuccessful, which he claims was due in large part to Jane\u2019s separate negotiations with the Tribes and her efforts in the Illinois divorce proceedings to force Schenk to sell the ranch for less than $10 million. The offers made by the Tribes to Schenk and Jane during this period were in the $4 to $5 million range, and Schenk concluded that the negotiations were going nowhere. He thus decided in the summer of 2005 to start marketing the property nationally. He retained a different real estate agent for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b67 Around this same time, Andersen called Schenk regarding an acquaintance, Michael Maddy, who might be interested in purchasing the ranch. Although Andersen had heard that Schenk was still negotiating with the Tribes, he inquired whether Schenk would be willing to sell to someone else. Schenk indicated that he would be, and he gave Andersen permission to show Maddy the ranch. According to Schenk, Andersen also inquired during this call whether Schenk would pay him a commission, and Schenk replied: Tf you can get me $10 million, I will pay you a commission.\u201dNo written contract to this effect was ever executed, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b68 Andersen and Maddy viewed the ranch from a helicopter flyover. Thereafter, in mid-August 2005, Schenk, Maddy, and Andersen had several meetings to discuss the sale. According to Andersen, Schenk told him at the conclusion of one of these meetings that he would not pay Andersen a commission if the Tribes bought the property, but If you put this deal together, you will get your commission and it will be a darn good one.\u201d Presumably, Schenk was referring to the deal with Maddy. Again, no written contract was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b69 On September 13, 2005, the Tribes made an offer of $5.7 million to Jane, who then filed a motion in the Illinois court requesting that Schenk be ordered to accept this offer. Meanwhile, on September 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Maddy wrote up and handed Andersen an offer of $6.2 million. This offer, however, was not transmitted to Schenk. Rather, Andersen drove it 70 miles south to Missoula, where he presented it to Jane and her counsel, who in turn rejected the offer. Andersen reported back to Maddy, who then faxed an offer of $6.5 million directly to Schenk. The following day (September 21), the Illinois court ordered Schenk to accept Maddy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> s offer; and while Schenk questioned the enforceability of such an order, he nevertheless complied so as to avoid being held in contempt. He signed and faxed the papers directly to Maddy.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b610 Maddy had difficulty financing the purchase, which Schenk evidently had been anticipating. Schenk figured that while Maddy was attempting to line up the financing, Schenk would search for a buyer willing to pay more than $6.5 million; thus, when the sale to Maddy fell through, Schenk could sell the ranch at or closer to his original asking price of $10 million. To that end, Schenk twice agreed to extend the closing. Notably, unbeknownst to Schenk, Andersen was assisting Maddy during this period in trying to either secure the necessary financing or sell the ranch to the Tribes. Ultimately, however, Maddy (through another broker) met an investor who was willing to finance the purchase in exchange for an equity position. Closing took place at the end of February 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b611 Andersen commenced the present action on June 13,2006, raising six claims, all of which related to Schenk\u2019s alleged promise to pay Andersen a commission on the sale of the ranch to Maddy: breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, actual fraud or negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment. (He subsequently dropped the promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment claims.) Andersen sought compensatory damages of not less than $325,000, as well as punitive damages. Schenk filed an answer denying Andersen\u2019s allegations and raising several affirmative defenses, including statute of frauds, unclean hands, condition precedent, and the economic loss doctrine. Schenk denied that Andersen was his broker and that the parties had an agreement for the payment of a commission. However, as an alternative pleading, if Andersen were found to be Schenk\u2019s agent, Schenk asserted two counterclaims: breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud. He also made a counterclaim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b6 12 The parties eventually filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Andersen sought partial summary judgment on his breach of contract claim, Schenk\u2019s statute of frauds, economic loss, and condition precedent defenses, and Schenk\u2019s counterclaims, while Schenk sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>summary judgment as to all of Andersen\u2019s claims plus his unclean hands and economic loss defenses. Both sides filed numerous (and well-researched) briefs in support and opposition to these motions. The District Court held a hearing in November 2007 and, on February 6, 2008, entered an order granting Schenk\u2019s motion. The court reasoned that under the statute of frauds, an agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to sell real estate for compensation or a commission must be in writing, and since no such writing existed here, all of Andersen\u2019s claims failed. The court entered final judgment on February 15, 2008, dismissing Andersen\u2019s claims and Schenk\u2019s counterclaims with prejudice. Andersen now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b613 There are two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">1. Is Schenk entitled to summary judgment on Andersen\u2019s contract claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">2. Is Schenk entitled to summary judgment on Andersen\u2019s tort claims?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b614 As noted above, we review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Arnold v. Yellowstone Mountain Club, LLC, </em>2004 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 295, 100 P.3d 137. Summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1. Is Schenk entitled to summary judgment on Andersen\u2019s contract claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b616 It is well-settled that \u201can agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate for compensation or a commission\u201d is Invalid unless the agreement or some note or memorandum of the agreement is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or the party\u2019s agent.\u201d Section 28-2-903(l)(e), MCA. Indeed, this has been the law of this state for over 100 years. <em>See </em>\u00a72185, Civil Code of Montana (1895). In <em>Gantt v. Harper, </em>82 Mont. 393, 401-02, 267 P. 296, 297 (1928), this Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">[o]ur statute of frauds requires a note or memorandum in writing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>subscribed by the party to be charged, or his agent, as a condition precedent to recovery of a broker\u2019s commission upon an agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate. (Sec. 7519, Rev. Codes 1921.) This statute has frequently been considered and applied by this court and its provisions are held to be mandatory ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Likewise, in <em>Hart v. Billings Public Stockyards, </em>157 Mont. 345, 355, 486 P.2d 120, 125 (1971), this Court stated that \u2018Ta]ny action to collect a broker\u2019s commission for the sale of real estate must be founded on a written instrument.\u201d This stringent requirement of a written instrument derives from the plain language of the statute itself, which as noted states that an agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate for compensation or a commission is \u2018invalid\u201d unless the agreement or some note or memorandum thereof is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or the party\u2019s agent. Section 28-2-903(l)(e), MCA. Accordingly, this Court has repeatedly rejected claims for a broker\u2019s commission founded on alleged agreements that were not in writing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See e.g. King v. Benson, </em>22 Mont. 256, 56 P. 280 (1899); <em>Newman v. Dunleavy, </em>51 Mont. 149, 149 P. 970 (1915); <em>Dick v. King, </em>73 Mont. 456, 236 P. 1093 (1925); <em>Skinner v.

Hodson, </em>254 Mont. 262, 836 P.2d 1234 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b617 Andersen concedes that he and Schenk did not execute a listing agreement-i.e., \u201ca written agreement between a seller and broker for the sale of real estate, with the terms and conditions set out in the agreement,\u201d \u00a737-51-102(14), MCA. He contends, however, that (1) the statute of frauds was nevertheless satisfied or (2) the statute of frauds is inapplicable. Andersen\u2019s arguments under both of these theories are premised on certain statements Schenk made in his discovery responses and deposition testimony. In particular, Andersen points to Schenk\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 7, where Schenk describes the telephone conversation with Andersen in the summer of 2005 and states: \u201cIn this conversation, Plaintiff asked Defendant if he would pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>him a commission. Defendant responded to Plaintiff that, if Mr. Maddy purchased the [ranch] for $10 million, he would pay him a commission.\u201d Andersen also points to Schenk\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 26, where Schenk states: \u201cAs outlined in the Answer to Interrogatory No. 7, Defendant did make a statement to Plaintiff at the time Plaintiff informed him of Mr. Maddy that, if the sale closed at his asking price of $10 million, he would pay Plaintiff a commission.\u201d In addition, Andersen points to two passages from Schenk\u2019s deposition. In one, Andersen\u2019s counsel asked, \u2018So you did agree to pay Kermit a commission, at least under certain circumstances?\u201d to which Schenk replied, \u2018Had a sale occurred over $10 million, I agreed to pay him a commission.\u201d In the other, Schenk likewise stated: \u201cI had an agreement that I spoke of before: \u2018If you can get me $10 million, I will pay you a commission.\u2019 No further agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b618 Under his first theory, Andersen contends that the foregoing discovery responses and deposition testimony constitute a \u201cnote or memorandum\u201d that satisfies the statute of frauds. <em>See </em>\u00a728-2-903(1), MCA (an agreement to pay a commission is invalid \u201cunless the agreement <em>or some note or memorandum of the agreement </em>is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or the party\u2019s agent\u201d (emphasis added)). Alternatively, under his second theory, Andersen cites <em>Hillstrom v. Gosnay, </em>188 Mont. 388, 395-96, 614 P.2d 466, 470 <em>(1980),Ryckman v. Wildwood, Inc., </em>197 Mont. 154, 162, 641 P.2d 467, 471 (1982), <em>Hayes v. Hartelius, </em>215 Mont. 391, 396, 697 P.2d 1349, 1353 (1985), and <em>Morton v. Lanier, 2002 </em>MT 214, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 311 Mont. 301, 55 P.3d 380, for the proposition that the statute of frauds is simply not applicable where the defendant admits the existence of the alleged contract; and based on Schenk\u2019s discovery responses and deposition testimony, Andersen contends that the statute of frauds is inapplicable because Schenk admitted that he agreed to pay Andersen a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b619 Schenk, in response, challenges these arguments on several different grounds. First, he points out that Andersen has cited no Montana authority holding that discovery responses and deposition testimony can constitute a \u201cnote or memorandum\u201dunder \u00a728-2-903(1), MCA. Indeed, Andersen cites <em>Bower v. Jones, </em>978 F.2d 1004, 1008-09 (7th Cir. 1992) (applying Illinois law), and <em>Rogers v. Savings First Mortgage, LLC, </em>362 F. Supp. 2d 624, 641-42 (D. Md. 2005) (applying Maryland law), but no Montana cases. Schenk argues that allowing discovery responses and deposition testimony to satisfy the statute\u2019s writing requirement would be inadvisable (e.g., because a litigant might be forced to choose between discovery sanctions and waiving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>statute of frauds defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b620 Second, Schenk challenges the sufficiency of his admissions. He cites <em>Conagra, Inc. v. Nierenberg, </em>2000 MT 213, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 301 Mont. 55, 7 P.3d 369, where we stated (with respect to contracts for the sale of goods) that in order to remove an oral contract from the statute of frauds, an admission must be deliberate, clear, and unequivocal and must be a statement of fact, not a legal conclusion or opinion. We also indicated that an admission is ineffective if it was later modified or explained so as to show that the litigant was mistaken. <em>Conagra, </em>\u00b6 45. Here, Schenk argues that he did not deliberately, clearly, and unequivocally admit the existence of a legally enforceable oral contract. He points out that later in his deposition, he testified that Andersen \u201cnever accepted in any way that offer that I made to pay a commission over and above $10 million. However, I thought, from my standpoint, if he accepted, it\u2019s a binding contract on my behalf.\u201dBased on this \u201cclarification,\u201d Schenk contends that he only admitted to having made an <em>offer, </em>which Andersen did not accept, and therefore no contract arose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a728-2-102, -301, MCA; <em>Daniels v. Thomas, Dean &amp; Hoskins, Inc., </em>246 Mont. 125, 133, 804 P.2d 359, 363 (1990) (a contract requires consent, which consists of an offer and an acceptance of that offer).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b621. Third, Schenk argues that even if he did admit the existence of an enforceable contract to pay Andersen an unspecified commission, his stated condition for payment (a sale at $10 million) was never met. We conclude that this argument is a sufficient basis for resolving Andersen\u2019s contract claims. This Court has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">[t]he broker\u2019s ability to recover commissions is premised on the broker\u2019s ability to accomplish what he undertook to do in his contract of employment. The broker is not entitled to compensation for unsuccessful efforts under his contract of employment, irrespective of how great his efforts were or how meritorious his services. It is generally necessary to refer to the specific terms of the particular employment contract in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>determine whether or not the broker\u2019s duties have been performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><em>Diehl &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Houtchens, </em>173 Mont. 372, 377, 567 P.2d 930, 934 (1977) (citations omitted). Here, assuming for the sake of argument that Schenk\u2019s discovery responses and deposition testimony constitute a \u201cnote or memorandum\u201d under the statute of frauds, <em>see e.g. Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 133 cmt. d, \u00a7 136 cmt. b (1981) (stating that a written pleading, stipulation, or deposition may serve as a memorandum if otherwise sufficient as to contents and signature), the question then becomes whether Andersen accomplished the terms of the admitted contract. Schenk agreed to pay him a commission i/the ranch sold to Maddy for $10 million. There is no dispute that Maddy purchased the ranch for $6.5 million. Consequently, Schenk argues, and we agree, that his obligation under this contract to pay Andersen a commission never arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b622 Andersen, however, cites <em>Shober v. Blackford, </em>46 Mont. 194, 127 P. 329 (1912), <em>Apple v. Henry, </em>66 Mont. 244, 213 P. 444 (1923), <em>Barrett v. Ballard, </em>191 Mont. 39, 622 P.2d 180 (1980), and <em>Lane v. Smith, </em>255 Mont. 218, 841 P.2d 1143 (1992), for the proposition that a broker is still entitled to a commission where the property sells for less than the original asking price. In <em>Lane, </em>we observed that \u201c\u2018 \u201c[w]here an agent contracts to furnish a purchaser for land at a stipulated price and such agent does furnish a purchaser whom the owner accepts, and in the negotiations of the contract the owner agrees upon and accepts a different price from that at which the agent was instructed to sell, still such agent would be entitled to his compensation.\u2019\u201d \u201d <em>Lane, </em>255 Mont. at 224, 841 P.2d at 1147 (quoting <em>Barrett, </em>191 Mont. at 47-48, 622 P.2d at 185, in turn quoting <em>Shober, </em>46 Mont. at 206, 127 P. at 332). Likewise, in <em>Apple, </em>we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">[i]f the broker finds and introduces to his principal a person who is ready, able and willing to purchase or exchange upon terms acceptable to the principal, the broker has earned his commission. It is altogether immaterial that the final contract between defendant and [the buyer] was made without the presence, or even the knowledge, of plaintiff, if it resulted from the means and efforts employed by him, or that it provided different terms from those submitted to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>Apple, </em>66 Mont. at 249, 213 P. at 445-46 (citations omitted). Andersen emphasizes our statement in <em>Barrett, </em>191 Mont. at 47, 622 P.2d at 185, that \u201cthe ultimate sale terms need not be what the broker\u2019s contract states, but only that the seller and the buyer were brought together by the broker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00b623 We do not agree that these cases are controlling here. For starters, the seller in each case hired the broker to procure a buyer for the property and executed a listing agreement to that effect. In contrast, Schenk did not sign a listing agreement, and he did not agree to pay Andersen a commission for simply procuring a buyer for the ranch. Rather, according to the contract which we have assumed existed here, Schenk agreed to pay Andersen a commission <em>if the ranch sold to Maddy for $10 million. </em>Andersen\u2019s insistence that this condition is immaterial is totally without merit. While relying heavily on <em>Shober </em>and its progeny, Andersen overlooks the following passage in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">[WJhere the agent is employed at a stipulated commission to procure a purchaser upon terms named, the seller reserving the right to consummate the sale, the agent has fully discharged his undertaking when he has procured a purchaser; and if, then, the seller avails himself of the services so rendered and negotiates a sale, though upon terms and conditions different from those named to the agent, the agent may recover the commission agreed upon in the contract, whether it be a fixed sum, or a commission at a percentage of the selling price, or at an agreed rate per acre. <em>The agent may, of course, agree that he shall not receive any compensation unless the sale is made within a specified time, or at the price and upon the conditions named by the seller. He will then be held to his agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><em>Shober, </em>46 Mont. at 208-09, 127 P. at 333 (emphasis added, citations omitted); <em>see also e.g. Property Brokers, Inc. v. Loyning, </em>201 Mont. 309, 654 P.2d 521 (1982) (broker not entitled to commission because condition in listing agreement not met); <em>Watson v. Fultz, </em>239 Mont. 364, 782 P.2d 361 (1989) (same); <em>cf. Diehl, </em>173 Mont. at 379, 567 P.2d at 935 (explaining distinction between a contract requiring the broker merely to find a purchaser and a contract requiring the broker to sell, make, or effect a sale). Here, the contract that Andersen has established with Schenk\u2019s discovery responses and deposition testimony expressly conditions the payment of a commission on Maddy\u2019s purchasing the ranch for $10 million. Andersen cannot hold Schenk to an unconditional promise that Schenk has not admitted he made. Rather, Andersen\u2019s claim depends on what Schenk has admitted, and that includes the $10 million condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b624 We acknowledged the view in <em>Shober, </em>and Schenk concedes its validity, that a seller should not be allowed to take advantage of his introduction to a purchaser by a broker, and reap the benefits of the sale made in consequence, and then escape all liability of paying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>broker her commission because the property sold for an amount less than the price stated in the listing agreement, where the reduction was made of the seller\u2019s own accord. <em>See Shober, </em>46 Mont. at 206, 127 P. at 332. This principle, however, is not implicated here. For one thing, there is no listing agreement-despite the significant amount of money involved, and despite the fact that Andersen was required to get any agreement for the payment of a commission in writing (a fact of which he was aware, given his 20-plus years of experience as a licensed real estate broker). Moreover, there is no evidence in the record indicating that Schenk sold the ranch to Maddy for $6.5 million (65% of his asking price) in order to avoid paying Andersen a commission. Lastly, and critically, the admitted contract between Andersen and Schenk expressly conditioned the payment of a commission on the sale of the ranch at a particular price-a condition which was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b625  There are no genuine issues as to any material fact relating to Andersen\u2019s contract claims; and based on the law discussed above, Schenk is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those claims. We accordingly affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b626 <em>Issue 2. Is Schenk entitled to summary judgment on Andersen\u2019s tort claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b627 In his motion, Schenk sought summary judgment on all of Andersen\u2019s claims (the contract claims and the tort claims). The District Court granted Schenk\u2019s motion on the ground that \u2018ftjhere is no writing, signed by Schenk, supporting the commission agreement alleged by Andersen.\u201d Andersen then filed a Motion for Status Conference, explaining that he was unsure whether the court intended to dispose of his tort claims. He sought clarification of what the court had decided and whether any claims remained pending. Thereafter, the court entered its final judgment, dismissing \u201call\u201d of Andersen\u2019s claims with prejudice. The court did not provide any additional reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b628  There are a number of problems with the District Court\u2019s analysis. First, to the extent the court thought that Andersen\u2019s contract claims necessarily barred his tort claims, the court was incorrect, as we have recognized that under certain circumstances potential liability in tort may coexist with a liability in contract. <em>See Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 49, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. Second, it is true that Andersen cannot end-run the statute of frauds by seeking a broker\u2019s commission under a non-contract theory. <em>See Gantt, 82 </em>Mont. at 401-02, 267 P. at 297 (a written instrument is a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to the recovery of a broker\u2019s commission); <em>Hart, </em>157 Mont. at 355, 486 P.2d at 125 (\u201cAny action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>collect a broker\u2019s commission for the sale of real estate must be founded on a written instrument.\u201d); <em>Meech, </em>165 Mont. at 53, 525 P.2d at 548 (TA] broker may not collect a realtor\u2019s commission absent a valid written agreement.\u2019!); <em>cf. Featherman, </em>122 Mont. at 260-62, 200 P.2d at 245-46 (allowing recovery of a commission under theories of quantum meruit or completed performance would nullify the statute of frauds); <em>accord Reilly, </em>146 Mont. at 152, 405 P.2d at 444. However, it is not clear whether Andersen is attempting to do so here, and it is likewise unclear from the court\u2019s reasoning whether this was part of its rationale. Third, Andersen complains that the court\u2019s order does not comply with M. R. Civ. P. 52(a), which states that an order granting a motion under Rule 56 \u201cshall specify the grounds therefor with sufficient particularity as to apprise the parties and the appellate court of the rationale underlying the ruling.\u201d For the reasons just discussed, we agree that the court\u2019s order falls short of this requirement vis-\u00e1-vis Andersen\u2019s tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b629 Accordingly, it is necessary to vacate the District Court\u2019s February 15, 2008 Final Judgment and remand this case to that court for entry of an order, which complies with Rule 52(a), on Schenk\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Andersen\u2019s tort claims and Schenk\u2019s defenses to those claims. <em>See e.g. Ravalli County Bank v. Gasvoda, </em>253 Mont. 399, 402, 833 P.2d 1042, 1044 (1992) (\u2018The District Court did not adhere to Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P., when it failed to specify the grounds for the summary judgment ruling with sufficient particularity. Therefore, we remand this case to the District Court with instructions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.\u2019!).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b630 We affirm the District Court\u2019s February 6, 2008 Amended Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment insofar as this order pertains to Andersen\u2019s contract claims. We remand for the entry of an order on Andersen\u2019s tort claims in compliance with M. R. Civ. P. 52(a) and the entry of a new final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b631 Affirmed in part and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\"> Notably, in this regard, the Board of Realty Regulation considers \u2018failing to document in writing and obtain signatures by the parties to all agreements\u201d to be \u201cunprofessional conduct.\u201d Admin.

During his deposition, Andersen was asked: \u2018Peter yesterday testified that he did at one point in time say that \u2018If you sell the ranch at $10 million, if you bring me a buyer at $10 million, I will pay you a commission.\u2019 Do you ever recall that conversation?\u201d Andersen replied: \u2018Not at all.\u201d Andersen did recall a different conversation that occurred a month later, in which Schenk allegedly told him that \u2018if you put this deal [with Maddy] together, you will get your commission and it will be a darn good one.\u201d However, Schenk has not admitted making this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
