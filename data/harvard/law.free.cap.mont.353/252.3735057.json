We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b63 Whether Appellants\u2019 properties were correctly required to complete subdivision review for their condominium projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to Flathead County.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b65 Whether recording certain condominium documents bars Flathead County\u2019s actions under theories of estoppel or waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b66 Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Etzlers\u2019 motion to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u00b67 This is a case about condominium exemptions from subdivision review. The District Court consolidated two cases challenging the County\u2019s refusal to allow the filing of transfer deeds for condominiums until the projects completed subdivision review. The particular facts presented by Appellants are similar, but addressed separately here.</p>\n<p id=\"AM8\">\u00b68 On October 19,2006, Etzlers recorded a declaration and bylaws for a residential condominium project containing 31 buildings and 124 condominium units on real property near Lakeside. The Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office accepted the documents for recording. Etzlers previously obtained subdivision approval on the same real property for a five-lot subdivision (plus one remainder lot) for single-family dwellings. The original subdivision approval did not contemplate construction of condominiums. The real property comprising the proposed Osprey Ridge condominium project is located in the County\u2019s Scenic Corridor Zoning District.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">\u00b69 On August 1,2006, Blomgrens recorded a declaration of residential condominiums and related documents with the Flathead County Clerk and Recorder for a residential condominium project containing four buildings and 105 condominium units. The Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office accepted the documents for recording. The real property comprising the proposed Misty Cliff I condominium project is not within any zoning district and the project has not been constructed. The parcel for the condominium project was created prior to enactment of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act of 1973 (Subdivision Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">\u00b610 On July 25, 2006, Thorntons recorded a declaration of residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>condominiums and related documents with the Flathead County Clerk and Recorder for a residential condominium project containing 17 buildings and 385 condominium units. The Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office accepted the documents for recording. The real property comprising the proposed Misty Cliff II condominium project is not within any zoning district and the project has not been constructed. The parcel for the condominium project was created prior to enactment of the Subdivision Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b611 When the County learned that Appellants recorded the documents purporting to create condominium projects without subdivision review, the County informed the Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office not to accept deeds for the condominium developments and posted a reminder notice in order to prevent construction of the projects and transfers of any condominium units until Appellants obtained subdivision approval in accordance with the Subdivision Act. Appellants sued. The District Court granted summary judgment to the County on January 14, 2009. Appellants appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b612 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation is correct. <em>Bitterrooters for Planning v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Ravalli Co., </em>2008 MT 249, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 529, 189 P.3d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b613 This Court reviews summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court based on M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615. Thus, the moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 12. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201cOnce the moving party has met its burden, the party opposing summary judgment must present substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, raising a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13. The determination that the moving party is or is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law is a legal conclusion, which we review for correctness. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b614 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend pleadings to determine if the district court abused its discretion. <em>Peuse v. Malkuch, </em>275 Mont. 221, 226, 911 P.2d 1153, 1156 (1996). Pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 15(a), a party may amend its pleading by leave of court and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. An opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to amend a pleading is not appropriate, however, when the party opposing the amendment would incur substantial prejudice as a result of the amendment. <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b615 <em>Whether Appellants\u2019properties were correctly required to complete subdivision review for their condominium projects.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b616  This issue turns on the interpretation of a statutory exemption from subdivision review for certain condominiums. The Subdivision Act defines condominiums as subdivisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\u2018Subdivision\u201d means a division of land or land so divided that it creates one or more parcels containing less than 160 acres that cannot be described as a one-quarter aliquot part of a United States government section, exclusive of public roadways, in order that the title to or possession of the parcels may be sold, rented, leased, or otherwise conveyed and includes any resubdivision <em>and further includes a condominium </em>or area, regardless of its size, that provides or will provide multiple space for recreational camping vehicles or mobile homes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Section 76-3-103(15), MCA (emphasis added). However, the Subdivision Act also exempts certain condominiums from subdivision review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Exemption for certain condominiums. Condominiums constructed on land divided in compliance with this chapter are exempt from the provisions of this chapter if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">(1) the approval of the original division of land expressly contemplated the construction of the condominiums and any applicable park dedication requirements in 76-3-621 are complied with; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">(2) the condominium proposal is in conformance with applicable local zoning regulations where local zoning regulations are in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Section 76-3-203, MCA (2005). Thus, a condominium project is exempt from subdivision review if it meets two prerequisites. First, the condominium project must be constructed on land divided in compliance with this chapter.\u201d Second, the condominium project must be either: (1) expressly contemplated at the time of the original approval (i.e. subdivision approval); or (2) in conformance with applicable local zoning regulations where local zoning regulations are in effect. Section 76-3-203, MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Etzlers</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u00b617 The Osprey Ridge condominium project fulfills the first prerequisite of \u00a7 76-3-203, MCA (2005), because Etzlers obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>approval in 2005 to subdivide the property into five single-family dwellings in accordance with the Subdivision Act. Etzlers rely on their interpretation of \u00a7 76-3-203(2), MCA (2005), as providing them an exemption from subdivision review.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b618 Etzlers argue that the Osprey Ridge condominium project is exempt from additional subdivision review because the property is located within the Scenic Corridor Zoning District. Flathead County Zoning Regulations (Zoning Regulations) define the Scenic Corridor as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxB\">An overlay or standing district intended to protect the scenic vistas and provide greater traffic safety along the highway corridors by restricting the number, size and location of outdoor advertising signs and billboards. This district can function as a standing district or can be applied to zoned areas. If zoned, this district will only regulate off-premise advertising signs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">No other land use restrictions apply in this district other than those relating to signs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Section 3.32.010. The Zoning Regulations only regulate signs and cellular towers within the Scenic Corridor Zoning District. Etzlers interpret the provision that Tn]o other land use restrictions apply in this district other than those relating to signs\u201d as inferring that condominiums are permitted in the Scenic Corridor, since the Scenic Corridor only regulates signs and cellular towers. Etzlers claim that the Osprey Ridge condominium project is exempt from subdivision review, because, pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-203(2), MCA (2005), the project is \u2018in conformance with applicable local zoning regulations where local zoning regulations are in effect.\u201d In other words, Etzlers argue that the Osprey Ridge condominium project complies with the only land-use restrictions for the Scenic Corridor Zoning District, therefore the project conforms with applicable local zoning regulations and qualifies for an exemption from subdivision review.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b619 Etzlers misconstrue the Scenic Corridor Zoning District\u2019s application to \u00a776-3-203(2), MCA (2005). This Court has held that the exemption provisions of the Subdivision Act are to be narrowly interpreted. <em>Shults v. Liberty Cove, Inc., </em>2006 MT 247, \u00b6 17, 334 Mont. 70, 146 P.3d 710. The Scenic Corridor Zoning District only applies to signs and cellular towers. The Scenic Corridor Zoning Regulations do not address appropriate land uses or densities, and do not contemplate or regulate development of condominiums. Etzlers strain logic by interpreting the Scenic Corridor\u2019s provision that \u201c[n]o other land use restrictions apply in this district other than those relating to signs\u201d to infer that condominiums are permitted in the Scenic Corridor. This provision merely limits application of the Scenic Corridor Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>District to signage. Etzlers\u2019 attempt to read into this provision any-inferred permission for condominium development misconstrues the plain language of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b620  Furthermore, the legislative history of \u00a7 76-3-203(2), MCA (2005), clarifies that the Legislature never intended for an absence of zoning regulating condominiums to create an exemption from subdivision review. As the District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">The legislative history of Section 76-3-203, M.C.A., makes the intent of the exemption provisions clear. The amendment was intended to address situations involving lands already subject to zoning regulations. Where a local government has completed the public, legislative process to determine appropriate land uses for an area, the subsequent construction of condominiums in conformance with those zoning regulations should not require subdivision review. However, where zoning has not been enacted, condominium projects should undergo subdivision review because the local government has not yet had an opportunity to determine whether the property is suitable for any particular land use or for the condominium project such as in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>See </em>Mont. Sen. Comm, on Loc. Govt., <em>HB 589, </em>57th Leg., Reg. Sess. 7-8 (Mar. 27, 2001). Clearly the exemption provided in \u00a776-3-203(2), MCA (2005), contemplates application to local zoning regulations that address condominium development. The Scenic Corridor Zoning District does not address condominium development, and is therefore not applicable to the exemption in \u00a7 76-3- 203(2), MCA (2005). Thus, the District Court correctly concluded that the Etzlers\u2019 condominium project fails to meet the prerequisites for an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a776-3-203, MCA (2005), and Etzlers were correctly required to complete subdivision review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Thorntons/BIomgrens</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b621 Thorntons and Blomgrens argue that their real properties have never been subject to the Subdivision Act because their parcels were created prior to enactment of the Subdivision Act in 1973. They contend that the Subdivision Act does not affect their pre-1973 \u201ctract land,\u201d therefore they receive a \u201cwholesale blanket exemption\u201dfrom subdivision review and are free to construct condominium developments without government intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b622 Thorntons and Blomgrens base this argument on a tortured interpretation of \u00a776-3-103(15), MCA, which defines a subdivision to include \u201ca condominium <em>or </em>area, regardless of its size, that provides or will provide multiple space for recreational camping vehicles or mobile homes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thorntons and Blomgrens suggest that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201cor\u201d in this statutory language equates condominiums to areas for recreational camping vehicles or mobile homes, and then argue that this language does not comport with the common definition of condominium as used in the Flathead County Zoning Regulations: \u201c[o]wnership in common with others of a parcel of land and certain parts of a building together with individual ownership in fee of a particular unit or apartment in such building.\u201d Section 7.04.150. We decline to accept this strawman interpretation of the definition of subdivision, and instead give \u201cor\u201d its common disjunctive meaning, understanding that the Subdivision Act defines subdivisions to include a \u201ccondominium,\u201d as well as an \u201carea, regardless of its size, that provides or will provide multiple space for recreational camping vehicles or mobile homes.\u201d Section 76-3-103(15), MCA. The inclusion of condominiums as subdivisions subject to the Subdivision Act was implicit in our discussion in <em>Shults, </em>which addressed whether a condominium project similar to those here met the requirements for an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a7 76-3-203, MCA (2005). <em>Shults, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7,13-23. We conclude that no \u201cwholesale blanket exemption\u201d from subdivision review exists for pre-1973 \u201ctract land,\u2019\u2019thus Thorntons and Blomgrens must complete subdivision review for their condominium projects unless they fulfill the requirements for an exemption under \u00a776-3-203, MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b623 Thorntons and Blomgrens do not meet the prerequisites for an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a7 76-3-203, MCA (2005). Thorntons and Blomgrens acknowledge that their properties were created prior to enactment of the Subdivision Act. Thus, since their proposed condominium projects will not be built on \u2018land divided in compliance\u201d with the Act, their projects fail to meet the first prerequisite for an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a776-3-203, MCA (2005). This conclusion is sufficient to determine that their condominium projects are not exempt from subdivision review under \u00a7 76-3-203, MCA (2005). However, since they argue that Flathead County has established county-wide zoning, and assert that their parcels are located in the County\u2019s \u201cunzoned\u201ddistrict not subject to any regulations preventing construction of condominiums, we address this issue as well. \u00b624 In 1993, Flathead County adopted zoning regulations pursuant to Title 76, Chapter 2, Part 2, MCA. The Zoning Regulations specifically provide that \u201c[tjhese regulations may be applied throughout the County, regardless of planning jurisdictions, wherever a County zoning district is created.\u201d Section 1.04.040. Thus, zoning is only applied to those zoning districts created by the County. The Zoning Regulations establish specific use districts Tf]or the purpose of applying these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>regulations to the zoned areas of Flathead County....\u2019\u2019Section 3.01.020. Once again, zoning is applied exclusively to zoned areas of the County. These zoning provisions clarify that Flathead County has not adopted county-wide zoning, but rather has adopted zoning regulations for specific zoning districts. Furthermore, the Zoning Regulations do not include an \u201cunzoned\u201d district in the list of zoning districts, which includes typical zoning uses such as agricultural, residential, business, commercial, industrial, and others. Section 3.01.020. The District Court correctly noted that \u2018the County has presented uncontradicted evidence and argument that Flathead County has <em>not </em>established County-wide zoning and only those parcels that are within one of the County\u2019s established zoning districts are subject to zoning regulations. There is no zoning district designated as \u2018unzoned\u2019.\u2019\u2019Because there are no local zoning regulations in effect for the area where the Misty Cliff I and II condominium projects are proposed, Thorntons and Blomgrens do not meet the second prerequisite for an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a776-3-203(2), MCA (2005). The District Court correctly concluded that Thorntons\u2019 and Blomgrens\u2019 condominium projects fail to meet the prerequisites for an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a776-3-203, MCA (2005), and they were correctly required to complete subdivision review for their condominium projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b625 Appellants devote much attention to their perceived deprivation of property rights. To clarify our holding in this respect, Appellants are not deprived of their potential to develop condominiums on their property, they are merely denied an exemption from subdivision review under \u00a7 76-3-203, MCA (2005). Appellants may still pursue their condominium projects by completing subdivision review as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to Flathead County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b627 Etzlers attempt to raise various issues of disputed facts to challenge the District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. Etzlers claim that an affidavit of County Planning Director Jeff Harris (Harris) fails to state that it is based on personal knowledge. Etzlers thus attempt to elevate their affidavits as the only proper consideration, even suggesting that their interpretations of the law become the undisputed facts for purposes of summary judgment. Etzlers further attempt to create disputes of material fact under \u00a7 76-3-203(1), MCA (2005), regarding whether condominiums were expressly contemplated when the real property was subdivided in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b628 Etzlers\u2019 arguments are unpersuasive. The factual disputes that Etzlers describe are not material to the dispositive issue regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>application of \u00a776-3-203, MCA (2005). This Court has repeatedly held that \u201cthe party opposing summary judgment must present substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, raising a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13. Etzlers arguments amount to nothing more than denial, speculation, and conclusory statements pertaining to immaterial facts. For example, Etzlers\u2019 affidavit includes a vague statement that \u201cwhen we submitted our prior application for Osprey Ridge Minor Subdivision and when we received our preliminary plat approval, the concept of multi-family use such as townhomes or condominiums was in fact contemplated,\u201dyet the affidavit fails to support this statement with any documentation that counters the submitted matters of record. Similarly, Etzlers attempt to contradict Harris\u2019 statements that the Scenic Corridor District is merely for sign regulation by mischaracterizing the District as \u201cclearly identified as a separate \u2018free standing\u2019 zoning district.\u201d The plain language of the regulation defines the Scenic Corridor District as an \u201coverlay or standing district,\u201d and adds that \u201c[t]his district can function as a standing district or can be applied to zoned areas. If zoned, this district will only regulate off-premise advertising signs.\u201d Section 3.32.010. This provision clarifies that a zoned area may still be designated a Scenic Corridor District, although such designation functions as an overlay district to regulate signage, while other uses continue to be regulated by whatever zoning was already in place for the area. The provision can be interpreted by a plain reading of the regulation and no suggested dispute of material fact is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b629 More importantly, Etzlers\u2019 affidavits are not relevant to the material facts at issue. All applicable statutes, including the entire text of the Zoning Regulations with sections providing for the Scenic Corridor District, were presented to the District Court, which reached its own conclusions regarding their effect on the condominium projects without citation to the affidavits. Removing all affidavits from consideration does not change the fact that all undisputed material facts necessary for resolution of this case were before the District Court. \u00b630 Thorntons and Blomgrens raise the issue of whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the County, but fail to develop any clear argument to address the issue. This Court\u2019s Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that \u201c[t]he argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record relied on....\u201dM. R. App. P. 12(l)(f). The closest that Thorntons and Blomgrens come to developing their argument is to blame the County for incomplete discovery that contributed to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>absence of a cross-motion for summary judgment. However, as noted above, the District Court had all undisputed material facts necessary for resolution of the case before it when it granted summary judgment to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b631  We conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b632 <em>Whether recording certain condominium documents bars Flathead County\u2019s actions under theories of estoppel or waiver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b633 Etzlers challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montana law is clear that the recording of a document does not establish the document\u2019s validity. Etzlers maintain that they relied upon the approval and recordation by the County. However, Etzlers fail to cite any authority for their contention that the County reviewed and approved their declaration prior to recordation. In fact, the only approval the Etzlers obtained was from the Montana Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue lacks discretion to deny approval of a condominium declaration if the name of the project is unique and the landowner has paid all taxes and assessments due. Section 70-23-304, MCA. However, the Department has no authority to determine whether a condominium project is exempt from subdivision review. Only the local governing body has authority to determine whether a division of land is exempt from subdivision review.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b634  Montana law provides that the act of recording a document, such as a deed or a condominium declaration, does not establish the document\u2019s validity simply because the clerk and recorder\u2019s office accepted and recorded it. For example, this Court held that void one-party deeds could not legitimately transfer property simply because they were accepted and filed with the clerk and recorder\u2019s office. <em>Elk Park Ranch, Inc. v. Park Co., </em>282 Mont. 154, 164, 935 P.2d 1131, 1136-37 (1997). \u2018The Landowners cannot seriously argue that the void one-party deeds somehow serve to accomplish a legitimate property transfer simply because the void deeds were accepted and filed with the clerk and recorder\u2019s office. The recording of a deed does not establish the deed\u2019s validity.\u201d <em>Elk Park Ranch, </em>282 Mont. at 164, 935 P.2d at 1136-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b635  Equitable estoppel does not apply here. \u2018Equitable estoppel, by its terms, requires the misrepresentation of a material fact.\u201d <em>Elk Park Ranch, </em>282 Mont. at 166, 935 P.2d at 1138. Etzlers do not allege the County made any express representations that the condominium projects were entitled to an exemption from subdivision review. The County\u2019s only representation to Etzlers was that the condominium projects would require subdivision review. The mere recording of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>condominium declarations is not a representation of any kind. Thus, equitable estoppel does not apply here, since Etzlers have not demonstrated that the County made any misrepresentation of a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b636 Etzlers\u2019 waiver argument is similarly unpersuasive. Etzlers fail to point to any authority that would permit the County to waive a requirement of state law or its own local regulations. The County correctly interpreted \u00a7 76-3-203, MCA (2005), and found that the Etzlers\u2019 condominium development must complete subdivision review and approval in accordance with the Subdivision Act and County Subdivision Regulations. The County cannot waive these requirements; they are mandatory minimum provisions of state law that the County cannot ignore. <em>Burnt Fork Citizens Coalition v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Ravalli Co., </em>287 Mont. 43, 49, 951 P.2d 1020, 1024 (1997) (\u2018the Act establishes minimum requirements that local governing bodies must follow\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b637 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Etzlers\u2019 motion to amend their complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b638 After the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment was fully briefed, but before the time for oral argument, Etzlers filed a motion to amend their complaint to add a claim for equal protection violations. Etzlers argued that other condominium projects have been approved that did not meet any statutory exemptions, therefore the County impermissibly applied restrictions to Etzlers. The District Court denied Etzlers\u2019 motion to amend, citing <em>Peuse v. Malkuch </em>for the proposition that the court should not allow amended pleadings or a change in legal theories after a dispositive motion for summary judgment has been fully briefed. On appeal, Etzlers maintain that \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201dfound during the course of litigation has always been recognized as a reasonable basis for a motion to amend, citing <em>Hobble-Diamond Cattle Co. v. Triangle Irr. Co., </em>249 Mont. 322, 815 P.2d 1153 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b639 Etzlers fail to adequately present any \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d to support their claim. Etzlers mentioned the alleged discrimination in their brief opposing the County\u2019s summary judgment motion. The supporting evidence for this claim is limited to an affidavit with a list of condominium projects allegedly approved through recordation without subdivision or other approval from the County. As the County notes, this list fails to provide dates, legal descriptions, or condominium declarations for these projects sufficient to determine what statutes or local regulations may have applied. The list merely includes condominium projects created in unzoned areas or within the Scenic Corridor District. Such projects could have been eligible for statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>exemptions from subdivision review, but without further evidence presented to the court, the names of condominium projects alone do not establish any fact proving that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Etzlers\u2019 motion to amend. In response to discovery requests, the County directed Appellants to the Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office to access any public documents that could potentially support their contentions. Etzlers cannot now claim \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d based on information that remains publicly available, yet was never adequately presented to any court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b640 We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Etzlers\u2019 motion to amend their complaint. Etzlers sought to add an equal protection claim to their complaint. This Court has concluded that \u201c[l]itigants should be allowed to change legal theories after a motion for summary judgment has been filed only in extraordinary cases.\u201d <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 228, 911 P.2d at 1157. This is not such an extraordinary case. The \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d here was never fully developed and was available to Etzlers when they filed their complaint. Allowing Etzlers to add a legal theory after the County filed its motion for summary judgment would unduly prejudice the County. \u00b641 For the reasons stated herein, the decisions of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
