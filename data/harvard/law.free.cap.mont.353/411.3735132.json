We remand to the District Court to hold an evidentiary hearing to assess Beach\u2019s alleged newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b62 Beach\u2019s appeal requires us to resolve the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly ruled that Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly ruled that Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court properly denied Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">\u00b66 A jury convicted Beach of deliberate homicide on April 13, 1984. The court sentenced Beach on May 11, 1984, to 100 years in the Montana State Prison without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">\u00b67 Beach appealed his conviction on multiple grounds. This Court upheld his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Beach, </em>217 Mont. 132, 705 P.2d 94 (1985). The Court also denied Beach\u2019s petition for rehearing. \u00b68 Beach filed a petition for post-conviction relief to this Court on October 30, 1995. The Court held that Beach\u2019s petition was procedurally barred either by res judicata and/or by the statutory five-year limitations period for filing a post-conviction relief petition. <em>Beach v. Day, </em>275 Mont. 370, 375, 913 P.2d 622, 625 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">\u00b69 The Federal District Court for the District of Montana denied Beach\u2019s petition for habeas corpus on March 31, 1998. <em>Beach v. Mahoney, </em>CV 92-92-BLG-JDS (D. Mont. Mar. 31, 1998). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Beach v. McCormick, </em>191 F.3d 459 (table), 1999 WL 685944 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">\u00b610 Beach filed a petition in January 2005 for DNA testing of physical evidence that investigators had collected during the homicide investigation. Much of the evidence, including a pubic hair found on the victim\u2019s sweater, could not be located for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00b611 Beach filed an application for executive clemency to the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole (MBPP) in 2005. MBPP denied Beach\u2019s application on November 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b612 Beach submitted an application for clemency, pardon, or commutation to Governor Brian Schweitzer. Governor Schweitzer referred his application to the MBPP for consideration. MBPP conducted a three-day public hearing on Beach\u2019s application. MBPP denied Beach\u2019s application on August 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b613 Beach filed a petition for post-conviction relief on January 18, 2008, based in part on alleged newly discovered evidence. The State filed a motion to dismiss. The District Court denied Beach\u2019s petition on March 28, 2008, without conducting a hearing. The court\u2019s cursory order stated that Beach\u2019s petition was procedurally and time barred. The court further concluded that the cumulative evidence proffered by Beach failed to demonstrate actual innocence in support of the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception to the time requirements. Beach appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Heath v. State, </em>2009 MT 7, \u00b6 13, 348 Mont. 361, 202 P.3d 118. We review discretionary rulings in post-conviction relief proceedings, including rulings related to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court properly ruled that Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was procedurally barred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u00b616 The District Court failed to include in its order an analysis of why it deemed Beach\u2019s petition to be procedurally barred. Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, provides the necessary elements of a properly filed petition for post-conviction relief. A defendant must \u201cidentify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. Mere conclusory allegations are insufficient to support the petition. <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 31, 307 Mont. 349, 42 P.3d 753. A defendant\u2019s affidavit, unsupported by evidence, also is insufficient to support a petition. <em>Williams v. State, </em>2002 MT 189, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 108, 53 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>864.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b617 Beach provided a nine page summary of the alleged newly discovered evidence and twenty-nine exhibits that illustrate this new evidence. Beach also provided a twenty-seven page memorandum in support of his petition. The State argues that regardless of whether Beach has satisfied \u00a746-21-104, MCA, he has failed to overcome the procedural bar on successive petitions set forth in \u00a746-21-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AFA\">\u00b618 A second or subsequent petition must demonstrate good cause why the petition has asserted claims that were not raised in the original petition. Section 46-21-105, MCA; <em>State v. Root, </em>2003 MT 28, \u00b6 16, 314 Mont. 186, 64 P.3d 1035. Beach\u2019s 1995 petition failed to allege newly discovered evidence. This Court deemed that petition procedurally barred by res judicata and/or by the statutory five-year limitations period for filing such a petition. <em>Beach, </em>275 Mont. at 375, 913 P.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b619  Beach\u2019s current petition, by contrast, alleges newly discovered evidence that he claims became available recently only through the efforts of his defense team. Beach contends that he could not have raised the newly discovered evidence in his first petition. Nothing in the District Court\u2019s order indicates that the court implicitly found a lack of diligence on Beach\u2019s part in locating this newly discovered evidence. In light of this omission, we will grant Beach the benefit of the doubt as to whether he acted with sufficient alacrity in locating this newly discovered evidence to meet the requirements of \u00a746-21-105, MCA. Accordingly, we determine that Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief is not procedurally barred by either \u00a746-21-104, MCA, or \u00a746-21-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court properly ruled that Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was time barred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b621 The District Court without analysis simply stated in its order that Beach\u2019s petition was time-barred. Section 46-21-102, MCA, governs the timeliness of petitions for post-conviction relief. The 1997 Montana legislature amended \u00a746-21-102, MCA, to allow \u201ca petition for relief [to] be filed at any time within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final.\u201d The jurisdictional time limit is not absolute. The legislature included a statutory exception to the mandatory time limit for Ta] claim that alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence.\u201d Section 46-21-102(2), MCA; <em>Sanchez v. State, </em>2004 MT 9, \u00b6 10, 319 Mont. 226, 86 P.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b622 We have determined, however, that the 1997 amendments apply only to those convictions that became final 12 months before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>effective date of April 24, 1997. <em>Hawkins v. Mahoney, </em>1999 MT 82, \u00b6 10, 294 Mont. 124, 979 P.2d 697; <em>State v. Charlo, </em>2000 MT 192, \u00b6 11, 300 Mont. 435, 4 P.3d 1201; <em>State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, \u00b6 44, 309 Mont. 63, 50 P.3d 121. We must evaluate the timeliness of Beach\u2019s petition pursuant to the pre-1997 amendments. <em>Hawkins, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b623 The pre-1997 amendments allowed a petition for relief to be filed at any time within five years of the date of conviction. Section 46-21-102, MCA (1995). The pre-1997 amendments contained no statutory exception. We recognized a limited exception to the five-year statute of limitations when strict enforcement would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6 33, 294 Mont. 252, 980 P.2d 622; <em>State v. Pope, </em>2003 MT 330, \u00b6\u00b6 58-68, 318 Mont. 383, 80 P.3d 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b624 Beach\u2019s conviction became final in 1984. Beach filed his latest petition on January 18, 2008. Beach has filed his petition well beyond the five-year statutory limitation. In fact, this Court determined that Beach had filed his first petition for post-conviction relief in 1995 well after the statutory five-year limitations period had expired. <em>Beach, </em>275 Mont. at 375, 913 P.2d at 625. Beach may escape the five-year statute of limitations only if he can satisfy the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 33. Beach must rely upon the fact that his allegedly newly discovered evidence satisfies the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b625 Beach\u2019s 1995 petition, of course, failed to allege newly discovered evidence. <em>Beach, </em>275 Mont. at 375, 913 P.2d at 625. The State challenges whether Beach\u2019s newly discovered evidence provides anything \u2018hew\u201d and that otherwise was not available to Beach at the time that he filed his first petition in 1995. The District Court held that the alleged newly discovered evidence proffered by Beach lacked a demonstration of actual innocence to support the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception. The court failed to discuss, however, the legal standard that it had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b626 The court\u2019s only reasoning as to why it denied Beach\u2019s petition relied on the prosecutor\u2019s actions in thoroughly reviewing the evidence and re-interviewing witnesses. The court relied upon the prosecutor\u2019s moral and ethical obligation to determine whether Beach was \u201ctruly innocent.\u201d Our system of justice depends on an independent judiciary undertaking an independent evaluation of the arguments and claims presented by the parties before a court. The judiciary cannot abdicate its responsibility to undertake an independent evaluation based upon the court\u2019s deference to the State\u2019s perceived adherence to moral or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ethical obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b627 We only can presume that the court agreed with the State\u2019s argument that Beach had failed to establish his \u201cactual innocence\u201d under the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception. The State argued that Beach had failed to establish a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d under the analysis suggested in <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S. Ct. 851, 867 (1995). We touched upon the miscarriage of justice standard in <em>Redcrow </em>and <em>Pope.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b628 In <em>Redcrow, </em>we agreed with the district court that Redcrow had not timely filed her petition for postconviction relief as required by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 29. We further agreed that a \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d triggered the limited exception to the five-year statute of limitations. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 31. This Court noted that it never had defined clearly the scope of the \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d exception and looked for guidance from <em>Schlup. Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b629 The Court in <em>Schlup </em>excused a procedural default when the petitioner showed that \u201ca constitutional violation has pro bably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327, 115 S. Ct. at 867. <em>Schlup </em>defines \u201cactually innocent\u201d as not merely a showing that a reasonable doubt exists in light of the new evidence, but rather that \u2018ho reasonable juror would have found the defendant guilty.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868. The Court in <em>Schlup </em>emphasized that it was \u2018hot the district court's independent judgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists that the standard addresses.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868. The Court instead explained that the standard requires the district court \u2018to make a probabilistic determination about what reasonable, properly instructed jurors would do.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b630 The Court focused on the word \u201creasonable\u201d in its formulation of the standard. The Court presumed that a \u201creasonable juror would consider fairly all of the evidence presented\u201d and that such a reasonable juror \u201cwould conscientiously obey the instructions of the trial court requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868. Thus, under the <em>Schlup </em>standard, a party seeking to meet the threshold requirement must persuade the district court that, \u201cin light of the new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b631 The Court in <em>Redcrow </em>recognized that the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception concerns actual, or substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>innocence, rather than legal, or procedural innocence. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 33. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized this distinction in <em>Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 112 S. Ct. 2514 (1992). The Court distinguished between \u201cactual innocence\u201d-the defendant\u2019s claim that he was innocent of the crime charged-and \u2018legal innocence\u201d claims involving allegations of procedural error or abuse. <em>Sawyer, </em>505 U.S. at 339, 112 S. Ct. at 2519. The Court recognized that an interplay between \u201cactual\u201d and \u2018legal\u201d innocence claims could result in a petition for post-conviction relief falling within the \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d exception to the general rule of <em>res judicata. Sawyer, </em>505 U.S. at 339, 112 S. Ct. at 2518. The Court held that a showing of \u201cactual innocence\u201d required the petitioner to show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner guilty. <em>Sawyer, </em>505 U.S. at 344, 112 S. Ct. at 2521.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b632 This Court in <em>Redcrow </em>ultimately settled on the principle that a \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice arises only when a jury could find, in light of new evidence, that the defendant is actually innocent of the crime.\u201d <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 37. The Court rejected Redcrow\u2019s claim of actual innocence, however, in light of the fact that she had confessed to law enforcement that she had stabbed the victim and she had admitted to another jail inmate that she had killed the victim. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 37. None of her claims of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel implicated the confession or the admission. Redcrow, \u00b6 37. Redcrow failed to convince the Court that she could meet the standard of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b633 The Court in <em>Pope </em>actually recognized a miscarriage of justice exception. Pope had submitted completed DNA evidence for the purpose of passing through the <em>Schlup </em>\u201cactual innocence\u201d gateway. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 56. Pope also alleged constitutional violations associated with his trial. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 38. The trial court determined that Pope had not proven sufficient facts to overcome the five-year statute of limitations. As a result, the trial court concluded that the five-year limitation contained in \u00a746-21-102, MCA, precluded it from considering Pope\u2019s alleged constitutional violations in his petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b634 This Court reversed. The fact that Pope had not presented the DNA evidence to the jury because it had not been available at the time of trial allowed Pope to pass through the <em>Schlup </em>actual innocence gateway. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 56. Once having passed through the actual innocence gateway, the Court allowed Pope to pursue relief for his alleged constitutional violations through a petition for post-conviction relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>that he had filed beyond the five-year limitation specified in \u00a746-21-102, MCA. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 68. The State did not contest the fact that errors at Pope\u2019s trial rendered his conviction constitutionally infirm.Pope, \u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">\u00b635 This concession obviated the need to evaluate whether Pope\u2019s newly discovered evidence demonstrated his substantive actual innocence. The Court determined that the procedural errors at Pope\u2019s trial combined with his newly claimed evidence to establish a clear miscarriage of justice. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 69. This Court did not analyze Pope\u2019s substantive innocence claims in light of the State\u2019s admission to the procedural errors at his trial. The Court vacated Pope\u2019s conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b636 Beach\u2019s current petition relies on the fact that his newly discovered evidence establishes his actual innocence. Similar to the petitioner in <em>Pope, </em>Beach argues that this newly discovered evidence allows him to pass through the <em>Schlup </em>gateway. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 69. Unlike the petitioner in <em>Pope, </em>however, Beach relies on this same newly discovered evidence to prove his actual innocence. This distinction raises the issue of how the District Court should evaluate Beach\u2019s alleged newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b637 The Court had occasion in <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, \u00b6 34, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099, to expand upon how a trial court should evaluate claims of newly discovered evidence in a case brought on direct appeal. The Court reasoned that the trial court must consider what impact, looking prospectively at a new trial with a new jury, that this new evidence may have on that new jury. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 36. This framework guides a court in analyzing claims of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b638  To prevail on a motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence, the defendant must satisfy the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">(1) the evidence must have been discovered since the defendant\u2019s trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">(2) the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant\u2019s part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">(3) the evidence must be material to the issues at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">(4) the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">(5) the evidence must indicate that a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-12\"><em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">\u00b639 The fifth element presents the most likely crux of any district court\u2019s evaluation of new trial motions based on newly discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>evidence. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 36. The \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard leaves it to the trial court to determine the weight and credibility of the new evidence. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 36. The \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard also leaves it to the trial court to consider what impact, looking prospectively at a new trial with a new jury, this new evidence may have on that new jury. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b640 In <em>Crosby v. State, </em>2006 MT 155, 332 Mont. 460, 139 P.3d 832, we adopted this five-pronged test to evaluate claims of newly discovered evidence presented in a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>State v. Abe, </em>2001 MT 260, \u00b6 10, 307 Mont. 233, 37 P.3d 77. A key witness for the State recanted her testimony after the trial in <em>Crosby. Crosby, </em>\u00b6 6. The trial court erroneously concluded that a new trial would be granted only \u201cwhen the trial judge is satisfied the recantation is true.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 21. We determined that the court erred when it improperly placed itself in the role of fact-finder. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b641 The District Court\u2019s reliance in this case on the prosecutor\u2019s moral and ethical obligation improperly placed the <em>prosecutor </em>in the role of fact-finder. The court failed to analyze the truthfulness of the testimony. As noted in <em>Crosby, </em>once a petitioner who alleges newly discovered evidence has satisfied the five <em>Clark </em>factors, the trial court must leave determination of whether actually to believe the newly discovered evidence to the fact-finder on retrial. <em>Crosby, </em>\u00b6 21. The trial court must analyze in the first instance, however, whether a reasonable probability exists that the newly discovered evidence would change the outcome at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b642 The Court in <em>Crosby </em>considered the petitioner\u2019s untimely petition under the newly discovered evidence exception in \u00a746-21-102(2), MCA. We must consider Beach\u2019s petition under the miscarriage of justice exception to the 1997 amendments. The State argues in its brief, however, that this Court has imposed an \u201cactual innocence\u201d standard on both the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d exception contained in the 1997 amendments to \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, and the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception discussed in <em>Redcrow </em>and related cases. We agree with the State that both standards implicate \u201cactual innocence,\u201d as opposed to legal innocence.\u201d This conclusion nevertheless fails to resolve the question of how the court should evaluate the alleged newly discovered evidence in making its determination of whether the petitioner has demonstrated \u201cactual innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b643 As the U.S. Supreme Court indicated in <em>Sawyer </em>and <em>Schlup, </em>the \u201cactual innocence\u201d inquiry may involve the interplay of substantive <em>and </em>procedural innocence claims. <em>Sawyer, </em>505 U.S. at 336, 112 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>at 2517; <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 316, 115 S. Ct. at 861. This Court recognized this nexus in <em>Pope. </em>Pope\u2019s substantive innocence claim - the DNA evidence -served as the vehicle that allowed Pope to navigate the \u201cactual innocence\u201d gateway. This successful navigation, in turn, allowed Pope to bring his procedural innocence claims -the alleged constitutional violations. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 44. The State did not contest Pope\u2019s allegations of procedural error. As a result, the Court did not address the standards to be applied to substantive, as opposed to procedural, innocence claims. Beach brings both substantive and procedural claims in his petition for post-conviction relief. We must delineate the standard that applies to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b644  A petitioner predicates a substantive \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim on the assertion that he did not commit the crime of which he has been convicted. <em>Pope, </em>\u00b6 53. A purely substantive claim warrants the application of an \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d standard of review. <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 316,115 S. Ct. at 861 (quoting <em>Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, <em>426, </em>113 S. Ct. 853, 874 (1993)). Beach\u2019s petition contains both substantive and procedural innocence claims. The higher standard of review would apply to Beach\u2019s substantive claims if he successfully has navigated the \u201cprocedural gateway.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 316, 115 S. Ct. at 861. The analysis for Beach\u2019s substantive claims \u201cmust incorporate the understanding that proof beyond a reasonable doubt marks the legal boundary between guilt and innocence.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 328, 115 S. Ct. at 867-68. We conclude that Beach must show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a procedural error, no reasonable juror would have found him guilty of the offense in order for him to prevail on his substantive innocence claim. <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b645 Beach\u2019s procedural claims warrant the application of a different standard of proof. <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 324, 115 S. Ct. at 865. The standard of proof should reflect the \u201crelative importance attached to the ultimate decision.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 325, 115 S. Ct. at 866 (citation omitted). A substantive innocence claim, if successful, results in the petitioner\u2019s release. By contrast, a successful procedural claim results in a new trial, and justifies a different standard of proof. <em>Schlup, </em>315 U.S. at 327,115 S. Ct. at 867. The \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard outlined in <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34, strikes a rough equivalence with the notion that \u201ca constitutional violation at trial has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is \u2018actually innocent.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Pope, </em>\u00b6 46. This \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard also comports with the <em>Schlup </em>standard that requires the petitioner to \u201cestablish, by a \u2018fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>probability/ that the \u2018trier of the facts would have entertained a reasonable doubt of his guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 322, 115 S. Ct. at 864 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b646 We recognize that <em>Clark </em>and <em>Redcrow </em>espouse forward looking tests that require a court to evaluate what a jury would do in a new trial. By contrast, <em>Schlup </em>seemingly contemplates a backward looking test that requires a court to assess how a reasonable jury \u201cwould have voted\u201d if it had possessed the benefit of the newly discovered evidence. We nevertheless deem it appropriate under the facts of this case to have the District Court follow a modified version of the <em>Clark </em>test that incorporates the <em>Redcrow </em>and <em>Schlup </em>standards to reflect the fact that Beach must establish a miscarriage of justice in order to escape the procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b647  The District Court first must evaluate whether the alleged new evidence presented by Beach constitutes actual \u201cnew\u201d evidence as envisioned by the standards set forth in <em>Clark. </em>This initial evaluation first entails a review of whether the evidence has been discovered since the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34. The court then must determine whether the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant\u2019s part. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34. The alleged newly discovered evidence presented by the petitioner must be material to the issues at trial and it must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b648 Only once the petitioner has cleared these hurdles should the District Court address the final question. The \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard from <em>Clark </em>leaves it to the trial court to consider what impact, looking prospectively at a new trial with a new jury, the new evidence may have on that new jury. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 36. We must modify this analysis to conform to the miscarriage of justice standard. As discussed in <em>Redcrow, </em>the court must evaluate whether a jury \u201ccould find, in light of the newly discovered evidence,\u201d that Beach actually is innocent of his crime. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 37. The <em>Schlup </em>Court phrased the test as \u2018ho juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868. We determine that the standards explicated in <em>Redcrow </em>and <em>Schlup </em>adhere most closely to the notion of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b649 <em>Whether the District Court properly denied Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b650  Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, sets forth the procedural requirements for a petition for post-conviction relief. The State concedes that Beach has satisfied these requirements. A district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>has discretion whether to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13,16. The District Court nonetheless abused its discretion by denying Beach\u2019s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing in response to the State\u2019s concession and the factors discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b651  We remain unable to glean from the District Court\u2019s skeletal order its legal conclusions and the facts on which it based those legal conclusions that led it to deny Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. The District Court\u2019s order similarly leaves the Court unable to determine whether it applied the correct legal standard in evaluating Beach\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. As a result, we remand Beach\u2019s petition to the District Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the newly discovered evidence alleged in Beach\u2019s petition. The court must evaluate whether Beach\u2019s alleged new evidence constitutes actual new evidence. The court shall apply a modified version of the five-prong <em>Clark </em>test and the <em>Schlup </em>\u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard to Beach\u2019s alleged newly discovered evidence to determine in the first instance whether Beach\u2019s petition establishes that a \u2018jury could find, in light of the newly discovered evidence,\u201d that Beach actually is innocent of his crime. <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 37. The court must assess whether a jury, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Beach guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 329, 115 S. Ct. at 868. The District Court shall provide a written order of its decision in accordance with the legal standards set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
