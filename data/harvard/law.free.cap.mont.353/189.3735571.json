(Wolf) appeals the order entered by the District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, granting the motion by Aaron Banks and Glen Croft (Banks and Croft) to change the venue for the parties\u2019 arbitration. Banks and Croft respond that Wolfs appeal is without merit and request an award of attorney fees incurred on appeal. We consider:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err by granting the motion for change of arbitration venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u00b63 On April 1,2008, Wolf and Banks and Croft entered into an \u201cAsset Purchase, Management Agreement\u201d (Contract) by which Banks and Croft would manage, and incrementally acquire ownership of, Wolf s automobile dealership in Bozeman. Shortly thereafter, the relationship between the parties began to deteriorate, and on October 14, 2008, Wolf filed a complaint against Banks and Croft alleging contract and tort violations and seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief. Wolf requested issuance of a temporary restraining order restraining Banks and Croft from entering the dealership or possessing dealership property. Banks and Croft filed a Motion to Dismiss/Summary Judgment asking the court to enforce a settlement that had allegedly been reached between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\u00b64 On November 5,2008, Wolf initiated an arbitration proceeding in Colorado through the American Arbitration Association pursuant to a provision in the Contract which stated that Ta]ny controversy or claim arising out of this \u2018management agreement\u2019 will be decided by arbitration before three (3) arbitrators, in the State of Colorado.\u201d Wolf followed by moving, on December 1, 2008, to dismiss the action it had filed in the District Court and to compel arbitration. On December 11, 2008, Banks and Croft filed a response opposing the motion to compel arbitration. Then, on January 27,2009, Banks and Croft filed a Motion to Change Arbitration Venue, arguing the arbitration could only be properly conducted in Montana. The District Court granted Wolfs motion to compel arbitration, but also granted Banks and Croft\u2019s motion to change the arbitration venue, ordering that the arbitration be conducted in Bozeman, Montana. The District Court declined to rule on the motion of Banks and Croft for dismissal or summary judgment. Wolf appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">\u00b65 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding arbitration is whether they are legally correct. <em>Iwen v. U.S. W. Direct, a Div. of U.S. W. Mktg. Resource Group, </em>1999 MT 63, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 512, 516, 977 P.2d 989, 993 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court err by granting the motion for change of arbitration venue?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b67 Section 27-5-323, MCA (2007), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">No agreement concerning venue involving a resident of this state is valid unless the agreement requires that arbitration occur within the State of Montana. This requirement may only be waived upon the advice of counsel as evidenced by counsel\u2019s signature thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The parties concur that this provision controls the arbitration controversy at issue. Further, it is uncontested that Banks and Croft are \u201cresident[s] of this state\u201d for this purpose. The dispute here centers on the applicability of the last sentence of this provision-whether Banks and Croft waived their statutory right to have the arbitration conducted in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b68 Wolf maintains that the District Court erred in granting Banks and Croft\u2019s Motion to Change Arbitration Venue because the motion was untimely filed, and the venue issue was thus waived. Wolf asserts that because Croft and Banks did not request a change of venue within their initial response, filed December 11, 2008, to Wolfs arbitration motion, and first raised the issue over 45 days later, they waived their right to request a change in venue. In support of this position, Wolf cites M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(ii), which provides \u201cthe defendant must at the time of defendant\u2019s first appearance request by motion that the trial be had in the proper county.\u201d Wolf argues that we should directly apply M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(ii) to the request for change of arbitration venue filed herein or that the rule \u201cshould be extended as a matter of public policy reflecting the policy of the Rules that objections to venue should be raised as soon as possible or be waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u00b69 Banks and Croft argue that application of M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(ii) to this case by analogy is inappropriate. They assert that the rule does not apply by its plain terms, which address the moving of a lawsuit filed in the trial court from one county to another. They argue that \u00a7 27-5-323, MCA, requires arbitration proceedings involving a resident to be conducted in Montana and expressly limits the instances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>which that requirement may be waived-enly \u201cupon the advice of counsel as evidenced by counsel\u2019s signature thereto\u201d on the agreement. They maintain that there is no statutory requirement that a request to change arbitration venue be made in the first responsive pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">\u00b610 We agree with Banks and Croft that application of M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(ii), here is inappropriate. M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(ii) is a procedural rule governing the timing of a request for a change of venue from one county to another within civil proceedings filed in the district courts. Section 27-5-323, MCA, is an expression of the public policy of the state that arbitration involving residents must be conducted within the State of Montana, unless that right is waived in the manner provided under the statute. This statutory public policy would be contradicted by application of M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(ii) or an equivalent rule which would require waiver of the venue right upon failure to request a change within a party s initial pleading concerning the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"ANS\">\u00b611  In <em>Keystone, Inc. v. Triad Sys. Corp., </em>1998 MT 326, 292 Mont. 229, 971 P.2d 1240, we invalidated a contract provision designating California as the arbitration venue for a Montana resident. <em>Keystone, </em>\u00b6 22. We noted that there was \u2018ho indication from the face of the contract at issue that the right to have disputes arbitrated in Montana was waived based on the advice of counsel,\u201d <em>Keystone, </em>\u00b6 21, and explained that a provision \u201cwhich requires that a Montana resident arbitrate disputes related to a contract to be performed in Montana at a location outside Montana is void because it violates Montana law.\u201d <em>Keystone, </em>\u00b6 22. Similarly here, as the District Court noted, \u2018the Contract does not indicate that Defendants, on advice of counsel, waived their right to have this dispute arbitrated in Montana.\u201d We thus reach the same result here as we did in <em>Keystone, </em>and conclude there was not a waiver of the statutory right of Banks and Croft to arbitrate the dispute in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b612 Banks and Croft request that they be awarded attorney fees incurred in this appeal on the ground that Wolfs appeal is without merit. They argue that Wolfs argument offers a \u201cclearly inapplicable analogy\u201d and an absence of legal authority in an effort to delay and create a \u201cwar of attrition.\u201d Wolf counters that its appeal is meritorious and that, although the issue it raised was apparently one of first impression, the arguments were made in good faith and the appeal was not \u201centirely unfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b613  M. R. App. P. 19(5), provides that this Court may \u201caward sanctions to the prevailing party in an appeal ... determined to be frivolous, vexations, filed for the purposes of harassment or delay, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>taken without substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d In determining whether an appeal is frivolous and unreasonable for this purpose, we generally assess whether the arguments were made in good faith. <em>Sorenson v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>279 Mont. 527, 531, 927 P.2d 1030, 1033 (1996). Here, while we have rejected the arguments advanced by Wolf, his contentions were arguable and we cannot conclude they were made in the absence of good faith. We thus hold that an award of attorney fees under M. R. App. P. 19(5), is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
