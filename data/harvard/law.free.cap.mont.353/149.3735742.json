LLC (Blacktail) appeals from the order of the District Court for the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, granting summary judgment in favor of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following dispositive issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court erred in holding that DNRC had probable cause to institute an administrative proceeding to revoke Blacktail\u2019s water use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\u00b64 In June 2008 Blacktail sued DNRC for malicious prosecution. The antecedent to this suit was DNRC\u2019s instituting an administrative proceeding to revoke Blacktail\u2019s water use permit No. 76LJ-27326. DNRC had issued the permit to one of Blacktail\u2019s predecessors in interest in 1979 for the construction of a fish pond. The predecessor in interest completed the pond in 1982 and maintained it until 1998, when he sold the property. The permit contained five conditions, the fourth of which provided: \u2018Subject to diversion from the stream and back to the stream by pipeline with measuring devices on each pipeline, with records kept and submitted to the department once each year. Equal amounts of water to be returned to the stream as are being diverted.\u201d Blacktail purchased the water right in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">\u00b65 In response to a complaint by downstream users, DNRC began investigating seepage and evaporation problems with the pond in 2003. This prompted Blacktail to employ a hydrology consulting firm, RLK Hydro Inc. (RLK), to evaluate the pond. RLK found that the pond received 150 gallons per minute (gpm) inflow, but had no outflow returning to the stream. Consequently, Blacktail attempted to patch leaks in the pond\u2019s clay liner with Bentonite and polymer. The patching reduced water loss, but did not eliminate seepage of approximately 30 gpm. Subsequently, in February 2006 DNRC issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>an order to show cause and a notice of revocation for failure to comply with the conditions of the water use permit. After the show cause hearing, the hearing examiner did not issue a decision within the 90 day period required by \u00a7 2-4-623(l)(a), MCA, and Blacktail filed a motion for dismissal with prejudice. DNRC did not oppose dismissal, but argued that it should be without prejudice because Blacktail was still not in compliance with the conditions of its water use permit. In November 2006, over Blacktail\u2019s objection, the hearing officer dismissed the revocation action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">\u00b66 In June 2008 Blacktail turned the tables and filed the present suit for malicious prosecution. DNRC did not file an answer, but immediately moved for summary judgment on the basis of prosecutorial and quasi-judicial immunity. Blacktail opposed this motion, arguing that prosecutorial and quasi-judicial immunity did not apply and that, if applied, these doctrines of immunity would violate Article II, section 18 of the Constitution of the State of Montana, which abolishes sovereign immunity. The District Court granted DNRC\u2019s motion under two rationales: first, that Blacktail did not raise any genuine issues of material fact as to one of the elements of its malicious prosecution claim; and second, that DNRC\u2019s actions were quasi-judicial and thus immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo to determine if it complied with Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. <em>Natl. Cas. Co. v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., </em>2001 MT 28, \u00b6 13, 304 Mont. 163, 19 P.3d 223. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and indulging all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor, a court correctly grants summary judgment when the evidence presents no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Peyatt v. Moore, </em>2004 MT 341, \u00b6 13, 324 Mont. 249, 102 P.3d 535. Summary judgment is proper when a non-moving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an essential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial. <em>See Bickler v. Racquet Club Heights Assocs., </em>258 Mont. 19, 23, 850 P.2d 967, 970 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred in holding that DNRC had probable cause to institute an administrative proceeding to revoke Blacktail\u2019s water use permit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b69 The parties direct the bulk of their briefing to the issue of immunity. Nevertheless, we find the issue of whether Blacktail can establish the necessary elements of malicious prosecution to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b610 To prevail on a claim of malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">(1) a judicial proceeding was commenced and prosecuted against the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">(2) the defendant was responsible for instigating, prosecuting or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">continuing such proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">(3) there was a lack of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s acts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">(4) the defendant was actuated by malice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">(5) the judicial proceeding terminated favorably for plaintiff; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">(6) the plaintiff suffered damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-13\"><em>Plouffe v. Mont. Dept. of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2002 MT 64, \u00b6 16, 309 Mont. 184, 45 P.3d 10. Here, we need only address the third of these elements, probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">\u00b611 We have defined probable cause as \u201creasonable grounds for suspicion, supported by circumstances reasonably strong in themselves to warrant a reasonably prudent and cautious [person] to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Reece v. Pierce Flooring, </em>194 Mont. 91, 97, 634 P.2d 640, 643 (1981)). The finding of probable cause is based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 19. While typically a jury question, the determination of probable cause becomes a question of law for a court to decide when there is no conflict of evidence and the evidence \u201cadmits only one conclusion.\u201d <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">\u00b612  Here, DNRC brought its revocation action against Blacktail pursuant to \u00a785-2-314, MCA. This section provides in relevant part that \u2018if the [water use] permit... is otherwise not being followed, the department may, after notice, require the permittee ... to show cause why the permit. . . should not be modified or revoked.\u201d Section 85-2-314, MCA. Blacktail\u2019s water use permit required \u2018[e]qual amounts of water to be returned to the stream as are being diverted.\u201d The uncontradicted evidence before the District Court indicated that 150 gpm was being diverted into the fish pond. Initially, no water was being returned to the stream due to evaporation and seepage, and after Blacktail\u2019s repairs, 30 gpm was still being lost due to seepage and, thus, not returning to the stream. This evidence is uncontradicted and admits only one conclusion: that the amount of water returning to the stream did not equal the amount of water being diverted into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>fish pond. As a matter of law, this constituted probable cause for DNRC to seek to revoke Blacktail\u2019s water use permit under \u00a785-2-314, MCA, for not following the conditions of the permit. Thus, Blacktail could not prove an essential element of its malicious prosecution claim. Summary judgment for DNRC was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">\u00b613 In opposition to this conclusion, Blacktail argues that there is a genuine dispute as to whether it violated its permit because any seepage from the fish pond returned to the \u201csource.\u201d This argument, however, falters on the language of Blacktail\u2019s water use permit. The permit requires the return flow to be \u2018to the stream by pipeline with measuring devices.\u201d Thus, contrary to Blacktail\u2019s suggestion, it would not be enough for the water lost to seepage to return eventually to the stream through some natural, subterranean hydrologic connection. Consequently, we find no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b614 Blacktail next argues that the District Court erroneously failed to draw all inferences in Blacktail\u2019s favor, given its status as the non-moving party. First, we note that the District Court was not required to draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party, but only those that are reasonable. <em>Peyatt, </em>\u00b6 13. More importantly and contrary to Rule 12(9), M. R. App. P., Blacktail does not direct the Court to any facts in the record from which reasonable inferences could be drawn that would defeat summary judgment. In the absence of any genuine issues as to material facts, there is no basis for reversing the summary judgment. <em>Schwabe v. Custer\u2019s Inn Assocs., </em>2000 MT 325, \u00b6 48, 303 Mont. 15, 15 P.3d 903, <em>overruled on other grounds, Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6 27, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b615  For the foregoing reasons we affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. Because Blacktail\u2019s inability to raise genuine issues of material fact that DNRC lacked probable cause is an independent and sufficient basis for entry of summary judgment, we need not address the arguments surrounding prosecutorial and quasi-judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
