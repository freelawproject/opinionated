(Child Start) in September 2006 by filing a Complaint and Motion to Compel Arbitration. The District Court granted the Federation\u2019s motion. Child Start then filed a motion under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) for relief from the District Court\u2019s order. The court denied this motion, and Child Start now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Child Start\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">The Grievance</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b63 This case involves an employer and the union representing its employees. Child Start operates a Head Start early-childhood-development program at Whittier School in Missoula, Montana. The Federation, a local union affiliated with MEA-MFT and its national affiliates, is the certified collective-bargaining representative for nonsupervisory employees of Child Start.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b64 Child Start and the Federation are parties to a collective-bargaining agreement (the Agreement). The stated term of the Agreement is January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006, though Article One, Section 2 of the Agreement provides that the contract shall remain in full force until a new agreement is negotiated. Of relevance to the present case, Article Two, Section 7 sets forth a \u2018Grievance Procedure,\u201d the stated intent of which is to resolve employee complaints \u201cat the earliest possible step.\u201d A \u201cgrievance\u201d is defined as \u201ca complaint by an employee that there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the provisions of this agreement.\u201d An \u201cemployee\u201d is defined as \u201c(1) an individual employee or (2) a group of employees having the same grievance.\u201d Furthermore, \u2018Ta]ny employee, or group of employees, has the right to Union representation at any stage of the grievance procedure.\u201d Until the grievance is resolved, the employee proceeds through the following six steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">Step 1: The employee discusses the grievance with the immediate supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">Step 2: The employee submits the grievance to the immediate supervisor on a mutually approved form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">Step 3: The employee submits the written grievance to Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Start\u2019s director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\">Step 4: The employee may appeal to Child Start\u2019s Policy Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">Step 5: The employee may proceed to mediation before three mediators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Step 6: The employee may proceed to binding arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b65 In early 2006, Child Start faced rising costs without a corresponding increase in federal funding. Thus, Child Start decided that for budgetary reasons it would reduce by one week the number of weeks the program would operate during the school year. As a result, all employees\u2019 annual wages would be cut by 40 hours at their respective hourly rates, regardless of program priority, job position, or seniority rank.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b66 On May 30, 2006, Karen Giuliani filed a grievance (using a Head Start Grievance Form) concerning Child Start\u2019s decision. At the time, Giuliani was an employee of Child Start and a member of the bargaining unit represented by the Federation. She also was president of the Federation. She named the Federation as the aggrieved party but indicated that the grievance was on behalf of \u2018Several Affected\u201d employees. Giuliani asserted that Child Start\u2019s decision to reduce the work year of bargaining-unit employees \u201cdoes not comply with the requirements of our Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding a reduction in force.\u201d She stated that the provisions of the Agreement on which the grievance was based \u2018include but are not necessarily limited to\u201dArticle Two, Section 2 (the Job Security provision), which states, in relevant part, that in the event of \u201cprovable financial exigency necessitating a reduction in force,\u201d a management/union committee shall meet to examine personnel areas in which savings may be made. Furthermore, layoffs are to be made \u201con the basis of program priority,\u201d and reductions in force are to be made \u201con the basis of seniority.\u201d Giuliani requested that the reduction in the work year for bargaining-unit employees be rescinded and that Child Start conduct any necessary reduction in force in compliance with Article Two, Section 2. She also sought \u201cany additional relief necessary to rectify this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u00b67 Giuliani\u2019s grievance proceeded through the Grievance Procedure outlined above. At each step, however, Child Start repeatedly refused even to recognize the grievance, let alone attempt to resolve it \u201cat the earliest possible step.\u201d On June 6, 2006, Scot Anderson (Child Start\u2019s director) sent a letter to Giuliani asserting that the grievance was not a valid grievance because, in his view, it had not been filed by an individual employee, no group of employees had been identified, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the Federation as a whole did not qualify \u2018because not all members have the same complaint.\u201d Anderson opined that the Federation had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d in representing all bargaining-unit employees because their \u2018individual interests differ according to whether they would or would not be laid off.\u201d Anderson concluded that Tn]o further action will be taken regarding the grievance.\u201d The Federation then gave notice of its intent to appeal to Child Start\u2019s Policy Council; however, Anderson wrote a second letter reiterating his position that the grievance was not valid and asserting that \u201c[s]ince there is no grievance, there will be no appeal.\u201dThe Federation then gave notice of its intent to proceed to mediation; however, Sally Woodruff (president of Child Start\u2019s Board of Directors) issued a letter giving the same responses Anderson had previously given: the grievance was not valid, the Federation could not represent all of its members in this matter due to a supposed \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d and Child Start would not take any further action regarding the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b68 Having reached Step 6, the Federation gave notice of its intent to proceed to arbitration. To that end, the Federation sent a letter to the Department of Labor and Industry\u2019s Board of Personnel Appeals (BOPA) requesting a list of qualified arbitrators. Anderson, however, responded with a letter to BOPA stating that the grievance was invalid and that Child Start intended \u201cto take no further action regarding this grievance.\u201d Indeed, he asserted that Child Start did not agree to arbitration or to participate in requesting the list of arbitrators and that Child Start \u201cwill not participate in the arbitration process, since we are not obligated to do so by the Master Contract.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Child Start implemented the one-week reduction. The 2006-2007 school year, which had been scheduled to start on August 14, 2006, instead started on August 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Federation\u2019s Motion to Compel Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">\u00b69 On September 6, 2006, the Federation filed its Complaint and Motion to Compel Arbitration under \u00a727-5-115, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ari\">(1) On the application of a party showing an agreement [to submit a controversy to arbitration] and the opposing party\u2019s refusal to arbitrate, the district court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration; but if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of that issue raised and shall order arbitration if it finds for the applying party or deny the application if it finds for the opposing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>(5) An order for arbitration may not be refused on the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or good faith or because no fault or grounds for the claim sought to be arbitrated have been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASd4\">The Federation contended that under this statute, the only issue before the District Court was \u201cwhether there is an agreement to arbitrate-not the merits of the claim or the nature of the defense to a claim.\u201dHere, the Federation argued, there is an agreement to arbitrate unresolved grievances like the one filed by Giuliani, and Child Start\u2019s objections as to the validity of the grievance are matters to be decided by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b610 Child Start responded with a motion to dismiss in which it raised a number of different points. As to the question of arbitrability, Child Start argued that the Agreement did not require the parties to arbitrate <em>all </em>disputes; rather, it required them to arbitrate only \u201cproperly filed\u201dgrievances. Child Start maintained that the grievance here was not properly filed for the reasons stated in Anderson\u2019s and Woodruffs letters. In addition, Child Start argued that there was no \u201cgrievance\u201d at all because the Federation had not identified a \u201cspecific\u201d violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the Agreement. Lastly, Child Start discussed the merits of the grievance. According to Child Start, \u2018there is nothing in the [Agreement] which prohibits [Child Start] from shortening the length of the school year for budgetary purposes.\u201dTo the contrary, Child Start asserted that Article One, Section 10 (the Management Rights provision) \u2018legally authorized\u201d it to decide, in its \u201csole and exclusive discretion,\u201d to cut the length of the school year by one week rather than reduce the workforce. Moreover, Child Start argued that there had been no violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of Article Two, Section 2 (the Job Security provision) because there had been no layoffs and no reductions in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b611 In November 2006, while their respective motions were pending in the District Court, the parties settled a separate grievance concerning a pay increase. In conjunction with that settlement, the parties agreed that while the Federation \u201cwill continue to pursue resolution of its Reduction-In-Force (RIF) grievance,\u201d the Federation \u201cwill not seek a remedy requiring a back pay or other financial award for the one week reduction in the 2006-07 work schedule.\u201d They also agreed that \u201cneither party makes any admissions with respect to its position on the validity and/or merits of the so-called RIF grievance by entering into this agreement\u201d and that \u2018this agreement sets no precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b612 The District Court issued its Opinion and Order on August 2, 2007, denying Child Start\u2019s motion to dismiss and granting the Federation\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. The court first observed that the parties did not dispute two points: the Agreement contains a valid and enforceable arbitration clause, and the arbitration clause applies to unresolved \u201cgrievances.\u201d The court also noted that the Federation had complied methodically with the procedural steps for pursuing a grievance, as set out in Article Two, Section 7. Thus, the court focused on the question of whether the complaint filed by Giuliani constituted a \u201cgrievance\u201d under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b613 In this regard, the court flatly rejected Child Start\u2019s contention that the grievance had not been filed by a proper party, observing that Article Two, Section 7 \u201cexpressly gives the Federation clear contractual authority to bring the grievance on behalf of an identifiable \u2018employee, or group of employees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019The court reasoned that an identifiable group of employees had been implicated and affected by Child Start\u2019s decision to cut the annual wages of all bargaining-unit employees by 40 hours at their respective hourly rates, regardless of program priority, job position, or seniority rank. Likewise, the court rejected Child Start\u2019s claim that the Federation\u2019s pursuit of the grievance compromised its duty to represent all of its members, noting that this was a contractual issue between the Federation and its members. Lastly, the court observed that Child Start\u2019s argument regarding the merits of the grievance \u201cclearly reveals a contractual dispute under the terms of the Agreement\u201d-mamely, whether Child Start has \u201csole authority\u201d under Article One, Section 10 to reduce the annual salaries of all employees, or whether Child Start has a duty under Article Two, Section 2 to meet with a union committee to examine personnel areas in which savings may be made when there is a provable financial need to make budgetary cuts affecting bargaining-unit employees. The court reasoned that an arbitrator, not the court, must resolve the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations of the Agreement\u2019s provisions. For the foregoing reasons, the District Court concluded that the Federation\u2019s grievance is subject to the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause, and the court accordingly ordered the parties to submit the grievance to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Child Start\u2019s Rule 60(b) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b614 Child Start did not appeal the District Court\u2019s August 2, 2007 Opinion and Order. Rather, on August 31, Child Start filed a Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment or Order. Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>subsections (4), (5), and (6) of M. R. Civ. P. 60(b), Child Start asked the court to vacate its Opinion and Order \u201cdue to events which transpired prior to this Court\u2019s order.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, Child Start pointed out that the one-week reduction in the school year had occurred in August 2006 and that the Federation had agreed in November 2006 not to seek any financial award for the reduction in the work schedule. Child Start contended that rescission and monetary damages, therefore, were not available and that the Federation had not requested any other specific relief. Child Start thus reasoned that the matter is moot, as there is nothing to arbitrate and no relief to be granted; that mootness results in a loss of jurisdiction; and that the District Court\u2019s decision, therefore, is \u201cvoid for lack of jurisdiction,\u201d entitling Child Start to relief under subsection (4). Alternatively, relying on the \u201cequity\u201d clause of subsection (5), Child Start argued that arbitration here would be \u2018heedless and wasteful\u201d and would \u201cdamage all parties through the depletion of scarce financial resources.\u201d Similarly, invoking subsection (6), Child Start suggested that relief was appropriate because \u2018intervening circumstances\u201d had rendered arbitration on the Federation\u2019s grievance \u201cmoot and pointless.\u201d Child Start concluded that in the interests of \u201cequity, common sense and judicial/administrative economy,\u201d the court should vacate its August 2, 2007 Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">\u00b615 In response, the Federation contended that Child Start had misidentified the actual controversy underlying the District Court\u2019s decision. That controversy, the Federation argued, as defined by \u00a7 27-5-115, MCA, was whether there is an agreement between the parties to arbitrate unresolved grievances and whether the Federation\u2019s complaint constitutes a \u201cgrievance\u201dunder the Agreement. The Federation noted that the court had answered both questions in the affirmative and, thus, had granted the \u201crelief\u2019 requested by the Federation (i.e., it ordered arbitration); and for this reason, the Federation disputed Child Start\u2019s assertion that the District Court lacked the ability to grant relief. The Federation further argued that the question of whether its grievance has become moot is a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>matter for the arbitrator, not the court, to decide. Nevertheless, the Federation pointed out that even with the passage of time, disputes still remained as to whether Child Start misinterpreted or misapplied the Agreement when it reduced the work year in lieu of implementing the seniority and layoff procedures and whether Child Start has sole authority to reduce unilaterally the work year and the annual salary of all employees or whether it has a duty to work first with the Federation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b616 The District Court rendered its decision on October 29, 2007, denying Child Start\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. The court agreed with the Federation that the issues at hand are not moot. For one thing, the court observed, the contractual relationship between Child Start and the Federation \u201ccontinues and is dependent on disputed interpretations of critical and material contract language.\u201d Furthermore, the court reasoned, Child Start \u2018forced\u201d these court proceedings to occur \u2018by thwarting the grievance and arbitration provisions\u201d of the Agreement and is likely to do so again \u201cgiven the arbitrary and capricious manner\u201d in which it dealt with the present grievance. As for Child Start\u2019s claim that it was entitled to equitable relief under Rule 60(b), the court quite clearly was not persuaded in light of Child Start\u2019s conduct throughout the grievance process. For starters, the court found that Child Start\u2019s stated reasons for repeatedly refusing to recognize the Federation\u2019s grievance \u2018bordered on the frivolous.\u201d For example, the court noted that Child Start had no legal right to refuse the grievance on the ground that the Federation might have a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d in pursuing it, as this was an issue solely between the Federation and its membership. Moreover, the court found that Child Start\u2019s \u201carrogant decision\u201dto summarily refuse to honor the grievance process was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and that Child Start\u2019s \u201cunreasonabl[e]\u201dconduct had forced the Federation to file the present court action after expending significant time and effort to follow the steps for resolving grievances. Lastly, as to Child Start\u2019s claim that arbitration would be a financial burden, the court pointed out that had Child Start</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">not arbitrarily and capriciously refused to perform its contractual duties under the bargaining agreement, the added expense of going to arbitration following this court proceeding would not have transpired, and therefore, [Child Start] is solely responsible for the added expense and cannot use it as an excuse for not arbitrating the procedural and substantive issues which are within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator under the bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>agreement and statutory law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">The District Court concluded that Child Start\u2019s \u201ccontinuing indefensible resistance\u201d to arbitration must fail. Child Start now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b617 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) depends on the nature of the final judgment, order, or proceeding from which relief is sought and the specific basis of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451. As a general rule, we review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion; however, different standards apply where the movant sought relief from a default judgment or where the movant sought relief under subsections (2) or (4) of Rule 60(b). <em>See Essex, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b618 Here, Child Start invoked subsections (4), (5), and (6) in the District Court, and the Federation asserts that Child Start has \u201cnever clearly articulated\u201d which subsection it is attempting to invoke. In its reply brief, Child Start acknowledges that it has cited subsections (4), (5), and (6) \u2018in the alternative\u201d but indicates that it is invoking only subsection (4). Accordingly, as Child Start contends, our standard of review is de novo. <em>See Essex, </em>\u00b6 16 (TWJhere the movant sought relief under subsection (4) of Rule 60(b) on the ground that the judgment is void, the standard of review is de novo, since the determination that a judgment is or is not void is a conclusion of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u00b619 Under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4), a party is entitled to relief from a final judgment, order, or proceeding if the judgment is void. As it did in the District Court, Child Start maintains that the court\u2019s August 2, 2007 Opinion and Order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration is void. Child Start again points out that in August 2006 it implemented the one-week reduction in the work year with no attendant layoffs or reductions in force. Child Start also points out that the Federation agreed in November 2006 not to seek a remedy requiring back pay or other financial award for the one-week reduction. Child Start contends that these events effectively mooted the controversy between the parties and \u201cthwarted\u201d any relief that could have been granted in response to the Federation\u2019s grievance. Child Start thus reasons that the present action has been moot since November 2006, if not earlier; that there is no justiciable controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>between the parties; and that the District Court consequently lacked jurisdiction when it issued its decision on August 2, 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">\u00b620 The Federation responds that Child Start\u2019s mootness argument fails because it is incorrectly based on whether the issue to be presented to <em>the arbitrator </em>is moot, rather than on whether the issue before <em>the District Court </em>was moot. The Federation points out that the dispute underlying the District Court\u2019s August 2, 2007 Opinion and Order had nothing to do with the merits of its grievance. Rather, as defined by \u00a727-5-115, MCA, the specific dispute was whether the parties had an agreement to arbitrate the grievance. In this connection, the Federation suggests that Child Start is improperly attempting to narrow the range of grievances that are arbitrable under the Agreement. The Federation notes that a \u201cgrievance,\u201d as defined by the Agreement, includes a complaint that there has been a \u201cmisinterpretation or misapplication\u201d of the Agreement\u2019s provisions, and the Federation observes that its grievance is just that: a complaint that Child Start misinterpreted or misapplied the Agreement by reducing the work year in lieu of implementing the seniority and layoff procedures. The Federation points out that although the one-week reduction has already occurred, and although it is not pursuing a financial award, there is nothing in the Agreement limiting arbitration of grievances to situations where the parties can be restored to their original positions or where monetary damages are available. To the contrary, the Federation contends that the grievance and arbitration process is \u201c\u2018a vehicle by which meaning and content are given to the collective-bargaining agreement\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior and Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 581, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 1352 (1960)), and the Federation explains that an arbitrator\u2019s decision on the Federation\u2019s grievance will resolve the parties\u2019 \u2018festering disputes\u201d over the meaning of the Agreements particular, whether Child Start has sole authority to unilaterally reduce the work year or has a duty to work with the Federation under the Agreement\u2019s layoff and reduction-in-force procedures, and whether the president of the Federation may sign a grievance on behalf of the Federation\u2019s members.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b621 Before considering these arguments, we first note the Federation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>suggestion that \u201cmootness is [not] properly raised within the context of a Rule 60(b)(4) motion.\u201d A judgment or order may be challenged as \u201cvoid\u201d under Rule 60(b)(4) on the ground that the rendering court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See e.g. Nikolaisen v. Advance Transformer Co., </em>2007 MT 352, 340 Mont. 332, 174 P.3d 940; <em>see also O\u2019Rourke Bros. Inc. v. Nesbitt Burns, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 948, 951 (7th Cir. 2000) (\u201cA judgment is void only if the court which rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d)- It follows from this and from the justiciability and mootness principles discussed below that a judgment or order may be challenged as void (as Child Start does here) on the ground that the controversy between the parties was moot at the time the court rendered the judgment or order. <em>See e.g. Schreiber Foods, Inc. v. Beatrice Cheese, Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1198, 1202-03 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Justiciability and Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b622 The judicial power of the courts of Montana is limited .to justiciable controversies. <em>See Dukes v. City of Missoula, </em>2005 MT 196, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 155, 119 P.3d 61; <em>Powder River County v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 101, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357; <em>cf. Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 94-95, 88 S. Ct. 1942, 1949-50 (1968) (noting the same limitation on the judicial power of the federal courts). This limitation derives in part from constitutional requirements and in part from policy or \u201cprudential\u201d considerations. <em>See e.g. Montana Power Co. v.

Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 13, \u00a73529, 612 (3d ed., West 2008). In the present case, we are concerned with the question of mootness. As we have previously observed, mootness is \u201cthe doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 31 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, if the issue presented at the outset of the action has ceased to exist or is no longer live,\u201d or if the court is unable due to an intervening event or change in circumstances to grant effective relief or to restore the parties to their original position, then the issue before the court is moot. <em>See Powder River, </em>\u00b6 101; <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 188, 974 P.2d 1150; <em>Serena Vista, LLC v.

And because the constitutional requirement of a \u201ccase or controversy\u2019contemplates real controversies and not abstract differences of opinion or moot questions, <em>Seubert, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>cf. </em>Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 13B, \u00a73533.1, 725-27, courts lack jurisdiction to decide moot issues insofar as an actual \u201ccase or controversy\u201d no longer exists, <em>see Dennis v.

This Court has not previously addressed this issue directly, but we note that some federal and state courts have. In fact, the parties rely on several cases from other jurisdictions in support of their respective positions. We will consider these authorities for their persuasive value in resolving the mootness issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\u00b625 At the outset, it is necessary to clarify the focus of our analysis in light of two related points raised by the parties. First, in both the District Court and this Court, Child Start has repeatedly confused the justiciability requirement\u2019s applicability to <em>courts, </em>as opposed to <em>arbitrators. </em>For example, relying on our statements in \u00b6 14 of <em>Serena Vista </em>that Tw]e do not render advisory opinions, and we limit our rulings to those matters in which we can grant effective relief,\u201d Child Start contends that all an arbitrator could do regarding the Federation\u2019s allegedly moot grievance is render an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d answering \u201cabstract questions,\u201d which Child Start contends is \u201cnot appropriate\u201d under <em>Serena Vista. </em>It is essential to keep in mind, however, that arbitration is a matter of contract, <em>Solle v. Western States Ins. Agency, </em>2000 MT 96, \u00b6 22, 299 Mont. 237, 999 P.2d 328, and the arbitrator\u2019s authority derives from and is limited by <em>the parties\u2019 agreement, </em>not the case-or-controversy provision of the Constitution, <em>see Miller v. County of Glacier, </em>257 Mont. 422, 427-28, 851 P.2d 401, 404 (1993); <em>Terra West Townhomes, LLC v. Stu Henkel Realty, </em>2000 MT 43, \u00b6 27, 298 Mont. 344, 996 P.2d 866; <em>Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 728, 744, 101 S. Ct. 1437, 1446 (1981). As one court has pointed out, Ttjhere would be nothing improper or illegal (and certainly not unconstitutional) about an arbitration panel resolving a dispute that would have to be dismissed from federal court because it did not constitute a case or controversy.\u201d <em>Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1106 (11th Cir. 2004); <em>cf. </em>Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 13B, \u00a73533.1,728 (noting that an administrative agency is not bound by constitutional limits and may be empowered to maintain proceedings that would be moot in a court). Likewise, there is no basis under Montana law for Child Start\u2019s proposition that an arbitrator may not resolve a dispute which does not constitute a \u201ccase or controversy\u201dunder Article VII, Section 4(1). Along these same lines, we note that an arbitrator has broad power to fashion remedies on issues the parties have empowered the arbitrator to resolve, and in some instances the arbitrator may be authorized to grant relief that could not be granted by a court of law or equity. <em>See </em>\u00a727-5-312(2), MCA; <em>Nelson v. Livingston Rebuild Center, Inc., </em>1999 MT 116, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 294 Mont. 408, 981 P.2d 1185; <em>Courier-Citizen Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>v. Boston Electrotypers Union No. </em>11, 702 F.2d 273, 281 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline Co., </em>254 F.3d 925, 937 (10th Cir. 2001); <em>see also e.g. Wallace v. Hayes, </em>2005 MT 253, \u00b6 40, 329 Mont. 23, 124 P.3d 110; <em>United Steelworkers of America v. USX Corp., </em>966 F.2d 1394, 1402 (11th Cir. 1992). For these reasons, Child Start\u2019s application of justiciability doctrines as limits on the arbitrator\u2019s authority is misplaced. In evaluating Child Start\u2019s motion under Rule 60(b)(4), our focus is on whether there was a \u201clive\u201d case or controversy <em>in the District Court, </em>not whether there would be one in front of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b626 This leads into the second point. The Federation has consistently maintained that the question of whether its grievance is moot is for the arbitrator to decide. The Federation cites some cases, and we have found others, which support this proposition. <em>See e.g. W. Dow Hamm III Corp. v. Millennium Income Fund, LLC, </em>237 S.W.3d 745, 757 (Tex. App. 1st Dist. 2007) (TWJhether matters sought to be arbitrated are in fact moot is a question of procedural arbitrability that is reserved for the arbitrator, absent the parties\u2019 agreement to the contrary.\u2019); <em>Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Intl. Union v. Conoco, Inc., </em>64 Fed. Appx. 178, 185 (10th Cir. 2003) (unpublished<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) (\u2018Given the tightly circumscribed role that the courts are assigned in determining arbitrability, and considering that arbitrators have broad equitable powers to fashion remedies, it is not for us to decide that a remedy will not be available for a particular grievance.\u2019); <em>Galveston Maritime Assn. v. South Atlantic &amp; Gulf Coast Dist., </em>234 F. Supp. 250, 251-52 (S.D. Tex. 1964); <em>Western Automatic Mach. Screw Co. v. Intl. Union, </em>335 F.2d 103, 105-06 (6th Cir. 1964). The Supreme Court has stated that a gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause raises a \u201cquestion of arbitrability\u201d for a court to decide. <em>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 592 (2002). Likewise, a disagreement about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy is for the court. <em>Howsam, </em>537 U.S. at 84, 123 S. Ct. at 592. But \u201cprocedural questions\u201d which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition-such as time limits, waiver, notice, laches, estoppel, and whether the steps of a grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>procedure were completed-are presumptively <em>not </em>for the court, but for an arbitrator, to decide. <em>Howsam, </em>537 U.S. at 84-85, 123 S. Ct. at 592; <em>see also Klay, </em>376 F.3d at 1109 (\u2018^Generally speaking, courts are empowered to resolve disputes that solely involve whether a particular claim should be resolved in court or arbitration. Arbitrators, on the other hand, are empowered, absent an agreement to the contrary, to resolve disputes over whether a particular claim may be successfully litigated anywhere at all (due to concerns such as statute of limitations, laches, justiciability, etc.), or has any substantive merit whatsoever.\u201d (citation omitted)). Likewise, this Court has indicated that although the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is, as a general rule, to be decided by the court, <em>see Higgins Dev. Partners, LLC v. Skanska U.S.A. Bldg., Inc., </em>2009 MT 287, \u00b6 20, 352 Mont. 243, 216 P.3d 199, procedural questions such as \u2018the arbitrability of an indisputably arbitrable issue\u201d are for the arbitrator to decide, <em>see Intl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Montana Power Co., </em>280 Mont. 55, 60-61, 929 P.2d 839, 842-43 (1996). <em>Cf. </em>\u00a727-5-115(5), MCA (\u201cAn order for arbitration may not be refused on the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or good faith or because no fault or grounds for the claim sought to be arbitrated have been shown.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b627 In light of these authorities, and since the Agreement does not provide otherwise, we agree with the Federation that the question of whether its grievance is moot is for the arbitrator, not the District Court, to decide. Necessarily, then, we also agree with the Federation that the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the present case does not turn on whether the Federation\u2019s grievance is moot. This does not mean, however, that mootness doctrine does not apply to motions to compel arbitration of labor disputes. It only means, as previously indicated, that the focus of the mootness question is <em>not </em>on whether the issues raised in the grievance are themselves \u2018live.\u201d The \u201ccase or controversy\u201d presented to the District Court in this case was the narrow question of whether the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause applied to the Federation\u2019s grievance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-5-115(1), MCA. It follows, therefore, that the specific question we must answer in resolving Child Start\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion is whether this \u201ccase or controversy\u201d was \u2018live\u201d at the time the District Court rendered its August 2, 2007 decision. <em>Cf. Klay, </em>376 F.3d at 1110 n. 19 (\u2018Of course, if a party makes a motion to compel arbitration under 9 U.S.C. \u00a74, a district court must determine if there exists a case or controversy in order for it to exercise its jurisdiction over that motion to compel.... [T]he absence of a case or controversy requires a court to abstain from mandating arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>....\u20190. We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b628 It would be one thing if the Federation had decided to withdraw its grievance during the pendency of the District Court proceedings. At that point, the issue presented at the outset of this action-whether the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause applied to the Federation\u2019s grievance-would have become a purely academic point. The parties would have lost their legally cognizable interest in the outcome, and the court would have been unable to grant effective relief. Indeed, the court would have been left in the position of issuing an advisory opinion on whether the arbitration clause applied to a nonexistent grievance. In short, the case would have become moot, and the District Court would have been bound to dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Indep. Union of Flight Attendants v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>966 F.2d 457, 459 (9th Cir. 1992) (a party\u2019s decision to withdraw a claim renders it moot); <em>Dennis v. Brown, </em>2005 MT 85, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 422, 110 P.3d 17 (courts have no jurisdiction to answer moot questions); <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, 293 Mont. 188, 974 P.2d 1150 (a case that has become moot must be dismissed); <em>accord Great Western Sugar Co. v. Nelson, </em>442 U.S. 92, 99 S. Ct. 2149 (1979) (per curiam). The same result would have obtained had Child Start withdrawn its objections to arbitration and proceeded to arbitrate the Federation\u2019s grievance. At that point, there would have been no case or controversy before the District Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQG\">\u00b629 But no such events transpired here. The Federation has continually pursued its complaint related to Child Start\u2019s decision to reduce the work year by one week. The Federation reached the last step of the Grievance Procedure-arbitration-but Child Start refused to participate in arbitration. So, the Federation commenced the present action solely to compel Child Start to submit to the arbitration. Child Start responded that the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause does not apply to the Federation\u2019s complaint. Child Start maintained this position throughout this litigation. The District Court was in a position to grant effective relief by either granting the Federation\u2019s motion to compel arbitration or granting Child Start\u2019s motion to dismiss. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>constitutes a \u201clive\u201d case or controversy, which still existed on August 2, 2007, when the District Court issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">\u00b630 Most of Child Start\u2019s arguments to the contrary are directed to the question of whether the issues raised in the Federation\u2019s grievance are moot-a question, as noted, for the arbitrator to decide. But Child Start does raise two points requiring some discussion. First, Child Start contends that the Federation\u2019s grievance does not qualify for arbitration because the Federation is not seeking any specific relief. Child Start points out that the Federation originally sought rescission of the one-week reduction in the work year, which is no longer possible since Child Start implemented the reduction in August 2006, and that the Federation agreed in November 2006 not to seek a financial award. We note, however, that Child Start expressly conceded in the November 2006 settlement that the Federation \u201cwill continue to pursue resolution of\u2019its grievance-an implicit acknowledgement that the Federation was seeking some other form of relief. In this regard, the Federation points out that under Article Two, Section 7, a complaint regarding an interpretation or application of a provision of the Agreement may be pursued to arbitration; and here, the basis of the Federation\u2019s grievance is that Child Start misinterpreted or misapplied provisions of the Agreement, including Article Two, Section 2 (the Job Security provision). In its grievance, the Federation requested Child Start\u2019s compliance with Article Two, Section 2 plus \u201cany additional relief necessary to rectify this matter.\u201dThe Federation explains that in light of its ongoing contractual relationship with Child Start, it seeks resolution of the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations of the Agreement; and citing <em>Stead Motors of Walnut Creek v. Automotive Machinists Lodge No. 1173, </em>886 F.2d 1200, 1205 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc), the Federation contends that the arbitrator is \u2018the parties\u2019 officially designated \u2018reader\u2019 of the contract... their joint <em>alter ego </em>for the purpose of striking whatever supplementary bargain is necessary\u201d (ellipsis in original, some internal quotation marks omitted). We agree that an arbitrator may serve to resolve disputes over the interpretation or application of a collective-bargaining agreement, <em>see Intl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>280 Mont. at 58, 929 P.2d at 841; <em>see also United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior and Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 578, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 1351 (1960) (noting that \u201carbitration of labor disputes under collective bargaining agreements is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process itself), and here, Article Two, Section 7, clearly authorizes the arbitrator to resolve such disputes arising out of the Agreement. We also agree that an arbitrator is not constrained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>by Article VII, Section 4(1)\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement and may grant relief that might not be available in a court of law or equity. <em>See </em>\u00b6 25, <em>supra. </em>Thus, it follows from all this that a simple interpretation of the Agreement (which Child Start characterizes as an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d by the arbitrator) is in fact a form of \u201crelief\u2019 available under the Agreement and requested by the Federation here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANC\">\u00b631 Second, Child Start contends that the Federation cannot pursue arbitration of a grievance that is based on an expired contract. Yet, while the Agreement\u2019s stated term is January 1, 2003, through December 31,2006, Article One, Section 2 provides that the Agreement shall remain in full force until a new agreement is negotiated, and there is no evidence in the record that a new agreement has been negotiated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, it should be noted that the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement does not necessarily extinguish a grievance or a party s obligation to arbitrate it. <em>See Providence Journal Co. v. Providence Newspaper Guild, </em>308 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing <em>Litton Fin. Printing Div. v. NLRB, </em>501 U.S. 190, 204, 111 S. Ct. 2215, 2224 (1991), and <em>Nolde Bros., Inc. v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers Union, </em>430 U.S. 243, 255, 97 S. Ct. 1067, 1074 (1977)); <em>see also e.g. Solle v. Western States Ins. Agency, </em>2000 MT 96, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29, 299 Mont. 237, 999 P.2d 328. For example, the obligation to arbitrate survives expiration where (as here) the dispute arose during the life of the contract but arbitration proceedings had not begun before expiration. <em>See Intl. Union v. Telex Computer Prods., Inc., </em>816 F.2d 519, 522 (10th Cir. 1987) <em>(citing Nolde Bros., </em>430 U.S. at 251, 97 S. Ct. at 1071-72). And although the Federation is seeking an interpretation of a purportedly expired contract, the fact is that Child Start and the Federation still have a collective-bargaining relationship which, as the District Court noted, \u2018is dependent on disputed interpretations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>critical and material contract language.\u201d <em>Cf. Intl. Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. BF Goodrich Aerospace Aerostructures Group, </em>387 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that courts long have been aggressive in determining that a collective-bargaining dispute remains live where the disputed issue continues to shape the parties\u2019 periodic bargaining or day-to-day interaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b632  We conclude that a \u2018live\u201d case or controversy existed throughout the proceedings in the District Court. This case was not moot when the court issued its August 2,2007 Opinion and Order, and that order is not void under Rule 60(b)(4). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Child Start\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-4\"> M.

Nelson sued to compel arbitration, the district court granted the motion, and Great Western Sugar appealed. But before the appeal could be decided on the merits, the arbitration proceedings were completed. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the court case had become entirely moot and that dismissal was required. <em>See Great Western Sugar, </em>442 U.S. at 93-94, 99 S. Ct. at 2150.

Likewise, Child Start\u2019s reliance on <em>Portland Web Pressmen\u2019s Union v. Oregonian Publg. </em>Co., 286 F.2d 4 (9th Cir. 1960), is unpersuasive, as the parties\u2019 controversy in that case was specifically covered by the Labor Management Relations Act, not the collective-bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\"> Indeed, Child Start indicates, without explanation, that it does not know \u2018if any new contract even exists\u201d as of the date of its reply brief in this appeal (April 24,2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\"> The Federation has requested that we award sanctions against Child Start for this appeal pursuant to M. R. App. P. 19(5). However, we do not agree that Child Start\u2019s appeal meets the requirements of this rule. The Federation\u2019s request is, therefore, denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b243-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"A-i\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b634 I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis and framing of the issue as whether there was a \u2018live\u201d case or controversy in the District Court. The Court concludes that since the grievance sought \u201cany additional relief necessary,\u201d it was appropriate for the arbitrator to resolve the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations of the Agreement, even though the specific concerns giving rise to this dispute were fait accompli. Given that the grievance sought any \u201cadditional relief necessary to rectify <em>this </em>matter,\u201d(i.e., the particular layoff at issue), allowing the matter to proceed to arbitration as an abstract interpretation of contract hangs on a very thin thread. However, in the interest of liberally interpreting pleadings, I give the grievance the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b635 Obviously, if the grievance had specifically sought declaratory relief rather than being so focused on the one-week reduction, the Court would not have to divine the pleader\u2019s true intent under the catch-all prayer for \u201cany additional relief necessary.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
