We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating D.M.\u2019s parental rights, based in part on its reliance on D.M.\u2019s stipulation, where J.M. had not been determined to be an Indian child for purposes ofICWA until after the adjudication of J.M. as a youth in need of care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">\u00b64 D.M. has a decade long history with the Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department), including multiple instances of drug abuse and involvement with law enforcement. The courts have terminated D.M.\u2019s parental rights to five other children after she failed to follow previous treatment plans with respect to two children and voluntarily relinquished her rights to three others following the initiation of termination proceedings by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">1. The Adjudication of J.M. as a \u2018Youth in Need of Care\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\u00b65 The Department removed J.M. from D.M.\u2019s care at birth under emergency circumstances and placed her at Benefis Hospital in Great Falls due to medical conditions. The Department attempted to contact the Blackfeet Social Services to seek culturally-appropriate placement options for J.M. on her release based on the Department\u2019s belief that J.M. might be an Indian child for purposes of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">\u00b66 The Department petitioned for adjudication of J.M. as a youth in need of care and temporary legal custody on February 7, 2008, in response to alleged neglect and ongoing drug abuse by D.M. The Department also cited the failure of prior efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitation programs to D.M. The Department notified the Blackfeet Tribe of the proceeding and the possibility that J.M. might be an Indian child. The Department based its belief that J.M. might be a member of the Blackfeet Tribe on D.M.\u2019s identification of three possible putative fathers, including V.D., to whom D.M. was married at the time of J.M.\u2019s conception. D.M. and V.D. divorced before the Department initiated these proceedings. Montana law presumes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>J.M. to be the natural child of V.D., however, because she was born within 300 days of the termination of D.M.\u2019s marriage to V.D. Section 40-6-105(a), MCA. D.M.\u2019s marriage to V.D. does not determine definitively J.M.\u2019s status for purposes of ICWA. We nevertheless note D.M.\u2019s marital status as it prompted the Department to notify the Blackfeet Tribe of J.M. as a possible Indian child. The Department had not completed DNA testing of V.D. or the other surviving putative father at the time of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b67 The Department appeared at the adjudicatory hearing on May 13, 2008, with a social worker and an ICWA expert who were prepared to testify on the need for temporary legal custody of J.M. D.M. instead stipulated through counsel to the adjudication of J.M. as a youth in need of care and temporary legal custody. D.M. stipulated to granting temporary legal custody of J.M. to the Department for a period of up to six months to allow D.M. to complete her court approved treatment plan. Counsel for D.M. also recognized the potential application of ICWA and waived testimony of the Department\u2019s ICWA expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b68 The court adjudicated J.M. as a youth in need of care on May 15, 2008, and granted the Department temporary legal custody. The court observed that the Blackfeet Tribe had not indicated whether J.M. was an Indian child for purposes of ICWA and noted D.M.\u2019s stipulation pursuant to \u00a741-3-434(l)-(2), MCA. The court concluded that \u2018based on these facts and the stipulation of the Mother, a legal basis exists for continued court and [Department intervention.\u201dThe court cited D.M.\u2019s continuing substance abuse, the prior terminations of her parental rights, and her stipulations in the instant case as clear and convincing evidence in support of its adjudication and temporary custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">2. The Termination of D.M.\u2019s Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\u00b69 The Department petitioned for termination of D.M.\u2019s parental rights in November 2008, based on D.M.\u2019s lack of progress with her court ordered treatment plan. The Department submitted a Permanency Plan Report in January 2009, reflecting the fact that J.M.\u2019s paternity had been established, and that J.M. was an Indian child for purposes of ICWA. The Department stated that a Blackfeet Tribal Services representative would be invited to the Foster Care Review Committee meeting scheduled for February 19, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b610 The termination hearing commenced on December 16, 2008, and concluded February 10,2009. The Department presented evidence that D.M. had failed to complete treatment and the fact of D.M. having been convicted of a DUI in July of 2008. An ICWA expert from the Blackfeet Tribe testified that J.M. would be in danger of serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>emotional or physical harm if she were returned to D.M.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b611 The Blackfeet Tribe filed a notice of intention to intervene to monitor the proceeding on February 16, 2009. The court issued an order granting the Blackfeet Tribe\u2019s motion to intervene on February 24, 2009. The court filed its order terminating D.M.\u2019s parental rights on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re F.M., </em>2002 MT 180, \u00b6 21, 311 Mont. 35, 53, P.3d 368. A trial court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re the Matter of A.G., </em>2005 MT 81, \u00b6 12, 326 Mont. 403, 109 P.3d 756. Where ICWA applies, we will uphold a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights if a reasonable fact finder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. <em>In the Matter of T.W.F., </em>2009 MT 207, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 233, 210 P.3d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating D.M.\u2019s parental rights, based in part on its reliance on D.M.\u2019s stipulation, where J.M. had not been determined to be an Indian child for purposes of ICWA until after the adjudication of J.M. as a youth in need of care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEA\">\u00b614 D.M. argues that the District Court violated 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 when it accepted D.M.\u2019s stipulation of J.M. as a youth in need of care without first explaining the consequences and then obtaining her written consent. Section 1913 provides that a parent\u2019s consent to the foster care placement of a child or termination of parental rights is invalid unless executed in writing and with procedural safeguards designed to ensure that the parent understands the consequences of her consent. 25 U.S.C. \u00a71913(a). D.M. argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to follow the requirements of \u00a7 1913(a) invalidated the court\u2019s adjudication of D.M. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b615 Whether \u00a7 1913(a) applies to D.M. turns on the issue of whether the proceedings were \u201cvoluntary.\u201dD.M. argues that \u00a71913\u2019s failure to distinguish between \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u2018Involuntary\u201d proceedings supports her claim that \u00a71913(a) applies to all voluntary \u201cacts of foster care placement or termination of parental rights ... regardless of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>type of underlying procedure at issue.\u201d Thus, D.M. argues that her consent to adjudication and temporary placement triggered \u00a7 1913 notwithstanding the adversarial nature of the Department\u2019s petition. \u00b616 D.M. argues against our adoption of the reasoning in a recent decision of the Washington Court of Appeals that held that \u00a7 1913(a) did not apply to an involuntary custody proceeding. <em>In re Welfare of M.G., </em>201 P.3d 354 (Wash. App. 2009). The mother claimed that \u00a7 1913(a) applied to a dependency order to which she had agreed during the course of an involuntary custody proceeding. The state had initiated the proceeding due to the mother\u2019s drug addiction and inability to care for her child. <em>M. G., </em>201 P.3d at 358. The court declined to apply \u00a7 1913 in situations where the state had sought an involuntary placement of the child and the parent had been represented by counsel. <em>M.G., </em>201 P.3d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b617 D.M. correctly observes that \u00a71913 does not distinguish on its face between voluntary and involuntary proceedings. Section 1913 by its terms, however, implicates voluntarily initiated termination or foster care proceedings. It is intended \u201cto encourage parents to make appropriate placement of their children when they are not confident of their own ability to parent\u201d and are without counsel. <em>M.G., </em>201 P.3d at 358. The lack of counsel highlights the informal nature of the proceedings covered by \u00a71913. D.M. did not approach the Department voluntarily to give up custody as contemplated by \u00a7 1913. D.M. appeared at the hearing with her appointed counsel in light of the adversarial nature of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b618 Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs titled its guidelines to \u00a7 1913 \u2018Voluntary Proceedings\u201d and clearly distinguished the \u00a7 1913 consent provisions from the procedure and rules applicable to \u2018Involuntary Proceedings\u201dto which \u00a71912 applies. <em>See </em>44 Fed. Reg. 67, 593 (1979) (BIA Guideline E). If \u00a7 1913(a) were applied here, the court\u2019s temporary placement of J.M. with the Department would be deemed voluntary and revocable by D.M. This scenario makes no sense in light of D.M.\u2019s extensive history of drug abuse, and her failure to complete the most recent in a series of court approved treatment plans. These circumstances prompted the Department to initiate the adjudication. Allowing D.M. to characterize her stipulation as a voluntary act triggering \u00a71913 would ignore this history.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b619 We faced an analogous situation in <em>In re P.S., </em>2006 MT 4, 330 Mont. 239, 127 P.3d 451. The Department had initiated, termination proceedings. The father, in an effort to forestall the involuntary termination and its attendant consequence s for future children, sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>to relinquish voluntarily his parental rights. <em>P.S., </em>\u00b6 8. An involuntary termination leads to a presumption in favor of termination of parental rights to future children. <em>P.S., </em>\u00b6 8; \u00a741-3-423(2)(e), MCA. This Court rejected the father\u2019s efforts on the grounds that the termination statute, \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(a), MCA, provides a court with discretion whether to take into account a parent\u2019s attempt to relinquish voluntarily when deciding whether to order involuntary termination. <em>P.S., </em>\u00b6 14. D.M. here, too, may not tip the statutory balance in her favor by seeking to relinquish voluntarily her parental rights when faced with the prospect of involuntary termination. Section 1913(a) has no application to the involuntary termination proceedings initiated by the Department against D.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b620 We turn now to the primary issue of whether the District Court abused its discretion by relying, in part, on D.M.\u2019s stipulation in the adjudication of J.M. as a youth in need of care and its subsequent termination of D.M.\u2019s parental rights. Any involuntary proceeding triggers ICWA\u2019s procedural safeguards \u201cwhere the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). The court must verify the child\u2019s status with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the child\u2019s tribe when it \u2018has reason to believe that a child involved in a child custody proceeding is an Indian.\u201d Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings B.l. (a) 44 Fed. Reg. 67, 586 (1979). In accordance with these guidelines, ICWA applies when a court has reason to know that a child may be an Indian child. <em>In re </em>2003 MT 352, \u00b6 10, 318 Mont. 528, 81 P.3d 504. We have held previously that \u2018tribes have ultimate authority to decide who qualifies as an \u2018Indian <em>child.\u2019\u201dA.G., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b621 Where, as here, the Department had reason to believe that it might be dealing with an Indian child, and in fact notified the tribe to that effect, we have held that a district court abused its discretion when it failed to resolve definitively the threshold question of whether the children at issue were \u2018Indian children\u201d within the meaning of ICWA. <em>A.G., </em>\u00b6 15. We determined that the district court should have delayed final adjudication pending a determination of the children\u2019s status once it had initiated proceedings to discover the Indian status of the children. <em>A.G., </em>\u00b6 16. The court instead unilaterally determined that the children were not \u201cIndian children\u201d despite responses from the Tribes indicating that further research was needed. <em>A.G., </em>\u00b6 5. The court also heard evidence from the mother and the children\u2019s grandmother concerning the children\u2019s eligibility for tribal enrollment, including a letter from the tribe indicating that it would intervene on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the mother\u2019s behalf. <em>A.G., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b622 These facts distinguish this case from <em>A. G. </em>First, D.M. stipulated to the youth in need of care adjudication and to the treatment plan. A parent\u2019s valid stipulation under \u00a7 41-3-434, MCA, can satisfy the required findings for the adjudication of a youth in need of care even absent an evidentiary hearing. <em>In re M.W., </em>2001 MT 78, 305 Mont. 80, 23 P.3d 206; <em>In re M.B., </em>2004 MT 304, 323 Mont. 468, 100 P.3d 1006. The District Court adjudicated J.M. as a youth in need of care based on both D.M.\u2019s stipulation and the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b623 Second, the Department notified the Blackfeet Tribe in this case of the proceedings at an early stage. The Court in <em>A. </em>G., by contrast, terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights before the Tribe had made a final determination of the child\u2019s status. The record indicates that the Department attempted to work with Blackfeet Social Services to find a culturally-appropriate placement for J.M. in anticipation of her release from the hospital. These actions reflect the Department\u2019s belief that J.M. qualified as an Indian child for purposes of ICWA. The District Court\u2019s order adjudicating J.M. as a youth in need of care reflects that D.M. stipulated that ICWA applied and that D.M. \u201cwaived the testimony of the ICWA expert who was in court.\u201d The record further reflects that the Department had invited a tribal representative to the permanency plan hearing. A qualified ICWA expert testified at the termination hearing that \u201ccontinued custody of the Youth by the Mother would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d Finally, the Blackfeet Tribe gave notice of its intention to exercise its right of intervention under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c) to \u201cmonitor the custody proceeding.\u201d The Blackfeet Tribe tellingly has not interceded on D.M.\u2019s behalf or objected to the termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b624  The District Court complied with ICWA in finding by clear and convincing evidence that J.M. was a youth in need of care. The court found beyond a reasonable doubt-also as required by ICWA-that J.M.\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional best interests would be served by termination of the parent-child legal relationship. The fact that the court accepted D.M.\u2019s stipulation to the adjudication of J.M. as a youth in need of care before it had definitively established J.M.\u2019s Indian status does not invalidate the proceedings. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it terminated D.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b94-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ao6\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b626 I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion and for much of what is said therein. I do not agree, however, with the discussion that at the time the Blackfeet Tribe was first notified, the paternity of J.M. was yet to be decided. V.D. was one of J.M.\u2019s putative fathers. As D.M. points out, however, she was married to V.D. at the time of J.M.\u2019s conception. The District Court even referred to V.D. as the birth father. As noted in the Opinion, \u00a740-6-105(l)(a), MCA, provides that a person is presumed to be the natural father of a child if the person and the child\u2019s natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is born during the marriage or within 300 days after the marriage is terminated. <em>See In re Marriage of K.E.V., </em>267 Mont. 323, 329, 883 P.2d 1246, 1250 (1994). Applying this statute, as the trial court was required to do, V.D. should have been presumed to be the natural father of J.M. And, since V.D. was an Indian, J.M. was, likewise, an Indian child for ICWA purposes at the time the Department of Health and Human Services became involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b627 Additionally, and without going into the detail that appellate counsel did, I agree that the law was not entirely followed in this case. I have joined the Court\u2019s Opinion, but perhaps, for the wrong reason. Quite simply, given D.M.\u2019s dismal track record and the unlikelihood that she will ever be able to parent J.M., I simply cannot find a good reason to send this case back to the District Court for further proceedings. I do not believe that would be in J.M.\u2019s best interest when the likely outcome would be exactly the same. Moreover, given J.M.\u2019s Indian status, her tribe had substantial input and involvement throughout this case. Therefore, the spirit, if not the letter, of ICWA was followed. Though my decision is, admittedly, result-oriented, that is not to say that I disagree with appellate counsel\u2019s arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b628 Finally, with regard to appellate counsel, in my view, she wrote excellent, thoroughly researched briefs on appeal, and she zealously and professionally represented her client. For that, unfortunately, she was sharply criticized by the State in its appellate brief. Over several pages, the State took her to task for her</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">very unfair decision to renege on the stipulation and waiver of OSPD counsel [Office of State Public Defender] below ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">Furthermore, it is patently unfair for the OSPD (Appellate Defender) to attack as plain error a stipulation an OSPD lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>made below. It is unfair to Judge Neill and it [is] also unfair to J.M. and her foster parents.... The Appellate Defender\u2019s decision to renege on its stipulation also does not promote Indian cultural or tribal interests....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">[Trial counsel\u2019s] stipulation, which was made before Indian child status was ascertained, should be honored by the Appellate Defender. At the very least, the district court... cannot be accused of plain error....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">State\u2019s counsel also accused the OSPD of pursuing a trial strategy of not making objections so that the error can then be raised under a plain error argument on appeal-fehus causing delay in child abuse cases, discouraging the OSPD from training its lawyers to raise timely objections, and being unfair to the trial judge. I could not disagree more with the State\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b629 In the first place, appellate counsel has no moral, legal or ethical obligation to roll over and play dead for the convenience of the District Court or the State when she finds in the record legitimate appellate issues-regardless that her client\u2019s OSPD trial attorney might have been part of the problem. Indeed, Montana Rule of Professional Conduct (M.R.P.C.) 1.1 demands that an attorney provide competent representation to a client4hat is, representation which encompasses legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation. Appellate counsel provided her client with competent representation on appeal in this case within that definition. Moreover, appellate counsel advocated for her client within the parameters of M.R.P.C. 3.1,3.3 and 3.4.1 can find no basis for the State\u2019s criticism here. Secondly, it is the litigants in our system of justice that are entitled to due process and to fundamental fairness, not the trial judge. Indeed, the trial judge is supposed to make sure that each litigant is accorded procedural and substantive due process and that the law is followed. And, finally, instead of railing on the OSPD, the Attorney General\u2019s training people might take the occasional opportunity to remind prosecutors of what this Court said in <em>State ex rel. Fletcher v. Dist. Court, </em>260 Mont. 410, 415, 859 P.2d 992, 995 (1993). Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">[t]he prosecutor\u2019s role is a unique one within the criminal justice system. Though the [county] attorney must diligently discharge the duty of prosecuting individuals accused of criminal conduct, the prosecutor may not seek victory at the expense of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Thus, the prosecution is obligated to respect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial in compliance with due process of law. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>prosecutor may not bring criminal charges against an individual unless supported by probable cause, and, once charges are instituted, must reveal to the court any information which negates the existence of probable cause. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\">[T]he role of the prosecutor ... [is not] simply a specialized version of the duty of any attorney not to overstep the bounds of permissible advocacy .... In all his activities, his duties are conditioned by the fact that he is the representative not of any ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.... Thus, the prosecutor must execute the duties of his representative office diligently and fairly, avoiding even the appearance of impropriety that might reflect poorly on the state. [Internal quotations and citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">While I do not excuse mistakes and sloppy work by the OSPD, I also do not excuse the prosecutor taking advantage of that where the fundamental constitutional rights of parents and the best interests of abused and neglected children are involved. Given the prosecutor\u2019s unique obligations as described above and, presumably, greater expertise, trial courts might be dissuaded from heading down the wrong path if the county attorney gave the judge a heads-up warning. \u00b630 I appreciate the sort of well-written, well-researched, and well-argued briefs that appellate counsel filed in this case. That she did not prevail is more a function of a losing cause; not for her lack of diligence or admirable effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b631 Quote-worthy, too, is appellate counsel\u2019s response in her reply brief to the State\u2019s criticism. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">Finally, the Department\u2019s insinuation that \u201cOSPD\u201d intentionally fails to train trial counsel as part of an agency-wide strategy to gain a tactical advantage on appeal is preposterous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellate counsel for the mother has an obligation to zealously represent the mother and to raise on her behalf nonfrivolous appellate issues, including claims of plain error by the trial court and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Appellate counsel does not have the same obligation to ensure the system is \u2018fair\u201d to the district court judge, the child, or the child\u2019s foster parents. Moreover, the idea that it is somehow \u201cunfair\u201d to expect district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>court judges to follow the law is absurd. People make mistakes, even district court judges. It is appellate counsel\u2019s job to ensure those mistakes are presented to this Court for review, and it is this Court\u2019s job to review them, if circumstances warrant.
