We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues presented on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court and Director Opper err by substituting their judgment for that of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s as to the weight of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err by referencing a warning letter that was not part of the administrative record?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">\u00b65 Christie was hired as a staff attorney for the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in the spring of 2002. He was employed as a staff attorney from May 2002 until August 2007. John North, Chief Legal Counsel for DEQ, was Christie\u2019s supervisor. Because Christie was paid by the hour as a staff attorney, accurate time records were required. North discussed with Christie the importance of keeping accurate time records on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">\u00b66 During Christie\u2019s employment, Christie occasionally struggled with time entry and failed to work forty-hour workweeks. North issued a warning letter in 2004. As a result, Christie was subject to additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>time-reporting requirements. Christie was required to keep a daily log that showed when he arrived at work, when he went on break, when he left for lunch, when he returned from lunch, and when he left for work at the end of the day. Christie submitted this log to North at the end of each pay period.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">\u00b67 On March 26, 2007, North became concerned that Christie was not submitting accurate time records. On that day, another DEQ attorney needed help with a project and North decided that Christie should assist the attorney. However, when North looked for Christie, Christie could not be found in his office and his computer was turned off. North looked for Christie all day but could not find him. North obtained Christie\u2019s home address from DEQ, drove to Christie\u2019s apartment complex, and observed Christie\u2019s car parked at the complex. Computer records indicated that Christie logged off his computer at 10:14 a.m. and did not log back in that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b68 As a result of Christie\u2019s unexplained absence on March 26, North began keeping track of Christie\u2019s time. North enlisted other DEQ attorneys and staff members to help him with his investigation. North monitored Christie\u2019s actual work hours between March 26 and May 14, 2007, and compared those hours with the time Christie reported having worked. North noted a number of discrepancies between the time Christie was observed at work and the time Christie reported having worked. North did not inform Christie that he was conducting an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b69 North and Jim Madden, DEQ Deputy Chief Legal Counsel, met with Christie on May 16, 2007, to discuss Christie\u2019s absences during the seven weeks that North had monitored Christie\u2019s time. By monitoring Christie\u2019s computer usage, the time Christie was observed at work, and the time during which Christie\u2019s vehicle was observed at his apartment and not at work, DEQ determined that during the seven weeks he was monitored, Christie claimed to have worked approximately twenty-three hours that he did not actually work. During the meeting, North discussed with Christie the seriousness of falsification of time records, and Christie indicated that he understood the serious nature of the situation. North also asked Christie to account for his whereabouts two days earlier between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Christie had been signed out to Public Water Supply. Christie explained that he had met with Gino Pizzini during that time. North checked with Pizzini, who stated that he had not met with Christie and that he had in fact been looking for Christie that day but could not find him.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b610 North and Madden met with Christie again on June 1, 2007. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>this meeting, after being informed that North had checked with Pizzini, Christie changed his accounting of his whereabouts on May 14. Christie claimed instead to have been home sick and acknowledged that he had not met with Pizzini. North gave Christie a memo detailing the discrepancies between Christie\u2019s time records and observations of Christie\u2019s absences from work. North asked that Christie provide a response by June 5, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b611 Christie provided his response on June 4, 2007, and suggested that some of his absences from work might have been due to Christie\u2019s working in other buildings, conducting research at the law library, or walking to and from work. North reviewed Christie\u2019s responses and did not find them credible. Significantly, Christie had previously stated that he drove to work, and North and Madden had observed Christie\u2019s car at his apartment on numerous occasions that he claimed to have been working at DEQ. North subsequently made a recommendation of termination to Richard Opper, Director of DEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b612 Director Opper scheduled a pretermination meeting after receiving North\u2019s recommendation and notified Christie so that he could provide a response to North\u2019s recommendation for termination. In response, Christie stated that he had already addressed North\u2019s findings in the response he provided on June 4, 2007, and that he had nothing more to add. On August 13, 2007, DEQ notified Christie of his discharge from employment. In his termination letter to Christie, Director Opper stated: \u2018You were told by your supervisor that false reporting of time is not to occur because it violates the public trust. It is a manifestation of dishonesty and it is a theft of state resources.\u201d \u00b613 Christie subsequently grieved his termination. Pursuant to the grievance procedures, a hearing was conducted before Hearing Examiner John Melcher. During the grievance hearing, Christie argued that DEQ had violated its personnel policies by taking into consideration the warning letter issued to him in February 2004 by North regarding keeping accurate time records. According to the terms of the letter, it should have been removed from his personnel file in August 2005, but DEQ failed to remove it. Christie also maintained that DEQ had violated its internal policies by failing to account for the lack of negative job evaluations since February 2004. For these reasons, Christie argued he was entitled to be reinstated as a staff attorney for DEQ. For its part, DEQ introduced testimony from North and Madden concerning Christie\u2019s absences from work during times Christie claimed to have been working.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b614 The Hearing Examiner issued his recommendation in November 2007. Although DEQ terminated Christie because it determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Christie had filed false time records, the Hearing Examiner stated that the issue presented was \u201cwhether the time exaggerations, without more, justify Christie\u2019s immediate discharge.\u201dThe Hearing Examiner observed that \u2018Christie\u2019s log in times showed late arrival or early departure, or Christie\u2019s use of the internet coincided with late arrival or early departure, inconsistent with time records submitted by Christie.\u201d He also found that \u201cwith respect to this proceeding, it is the finding of the Hearing Examiner that Christie exaggerated his hours on at least some, if not most, of the occasions.\u201d Despite these findings, the Hearing Examiner failed to make a finding concerning whether Christie had intentionally falsified his records.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">\u00b615 Instead, the Hearing Examiner referred to the State Discipline Handling Guide and determined that just cause did not exist for DEQ to terminate Christie because DEQ had failed to prove that Christie\u2019s work record with DEQ was deficient. The Hearing Examiner stated that \u2018Christie should be given an opportunity to correct his deficient performance\u201d and that DEQ did not have good cause to terminate Christie. Ultimately, the Hearing Examiner recommended that Christie be reinstated as a DEQ staff attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b616 Director Opper reviewed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s recommendation, allowed Christie and DEQ to file exceptions, and scheduled oral argument. Christie did not appear at oral argument. He did, however, file exceptions after argument. Christie objected to the oral argument on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b617 After reviewing the recommendation and the administrative record, Director Opper concluded that the Hearing Examiner had erred when he found that Christie had exaggerated his hours on some, if not most, occasions, but nonetheless found that there was no need to ascertain whether Christie\u2019s actions were intentional. Director Opper found that the State Discipline Handling Guide provides that theft of state or employee property, including falsification of records, are offenses that \u201care so serious that they warrant discharge on the first occurrence,\u201d without requiring a review of the employee\u2019s work record. \u00b618 Director Opper also concluded that \u2018tflindings as to whether Christie intentionally falsified his time records were necessary to address the reasons expressed by the Department for the discharge.\u201d Noting that the Hearing Examiner had failed to make findings with respect to an essential issue, Director Opper reviewed the record and concluded that \u2018Christie intentionally falsified his time records, in order to receive pay for time not worked.\u201d Director Opper also observed that because Christie was warned about filing false time records in February 2004, he could not claim that his problems represented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201cfirst occurrence\u201d suitable for progressive discipline. Accordingly, Director Opper concluded that DEQ had just cause to terminate Christie.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b619 Christie filed a petition for review of Director Opper\u2019s order pursuant to \u00a72-4-702, MCA (2007). Christie maintained that Director Opper had substituted his judgment \u201cas to the weight of the evidence on the question of good cause to discharge Mr. Christie and failed to properly apply the progressive discipline policy.\u201d Specifically, Christie argued that Director Opper had improperly substituted his judgment as to the weight of the evidence in determining that Christie had intentionally falsified his time records, and that Director Opper had failed to apply the State\u2019s progressive discipline policy by ignoring Christie\u2019s prior work record.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b620 In response, DEQ maintained that Director Opper had not substituted his judgment for that of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s on the issue of whether Christie had intentionally falsified his time records. Because the Hearing Examiner had failed to make a finding with respect to whether Christie had acted intentionally, in order to address the express basis for DEQ\u2019s discharge of Christie, Director Opper was required to make such a finding. DEQ argued that Director Opper had reviewed the entire record and made specific findings that led to his conclusion that \u2018Christie intentionally falsified his time records, in order to receive pay for time not worked.\u201d With respect to Christie\u2019s second contention, DEQ noted that certain serious infractions warrant discharge on the first occurrence. The State Discipline Handling Guide provides that theft of state property and falsification of records constitute such serious infractions; thus, DEQ argued, the progressive discipline policy was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b621 Upon review, the District Court affirmed Director Opper\u2019s decision and stated that it viewed Christie\u2019s behavior as a breach of public trust, a violation of his position as a member of the DEQ legal team, a violation of the rules of ethics for state employees, and a violation of \u00a72-2-121(2)(a), MCA (2007), which states that a public officer may not use public time or funds for the officer or employee\u2019s private business purposes. The court noted that \u2018it is clear that Christie exaggerated his hours worked and spent substantial portions of his workweek at home,\u201d and that Christie\u2019s \u201cbehavior evidences a pattern of deception that no employer, public or private, is required to endure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b622 The court also stated that Christie had never provided any reasonable explanation for the hours he claimed to have worked but was not available to his employer. No witnesses ever testified on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Christie\u2019s behalf. Instead, \u2018Christie attempted to cover his tracks on one of the many days he cut hours by falsely claiming he was meeting with Pizzini.\u201d According to the court, the Hearing Examiner\u2019s determination that DEQ lacked just cause to terminate Christie without reviewing his service record was clearly erroneous \u2018in light of the substantial evidence in the record and the State\u2019s Discipline Handling Guide which specifically provides that \u2018theft of state or employee property\u201d and \u2018falsification of records\u2019 are infractions which \u2018are so serious that they warrant discharge on the first occurrence.\u2019 \u201d \u00b623 With respect to Christie\u2019s claim that he was entitled to progressive discipline based on his work record, the court noted that there was substantial evidence upon which Director Opper could determine as a matter of law that Christie\u2019s dishonesty required immediate termination. \u201cWhile twenty-three hours over seven weeks may have seemed insignificant to the hearing examiner, this Court agrees with Director Opper that when taken over the course of a year, the amount is substantial-about one month\u2019s time which is more vacation time than Christie was allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">\u00b624 The District Court observed that the Hearing Examiner had failed \u201cto appropriately weigh the level of disciplinary action which was necessary under the circumstances,\u201d and that he had ignored the State\u2019s Discipline Handling Guide, which recognizes that falsification of time records justifies immediate termination so long as the employee had prior knowledge of the rules or policies prohibiting the offense. \u2018Christie\u2019s abilities as an attorney for DEQ, no matter how good, cannot overcome the direct proof of falsification, theft, and dishonesty presented in this case, absent a showing of some sort of disability or a reasonable explanation from Christie.\u201d The court concluded that DEQ was not required to consider Christie\u2019s work record prior to terminating him for a serious infraction because state management has the authority to determine whether progressive discipline is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the District Court affirmed Director Opper\u2019s December 11, 2007 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order, and Notice of Opportunity for Judicial Review, and denied Christie\u2019s petition for judicial review. Christie appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b625 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on judicial review of an agency decision to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous and whether the conclusions of law are correct. <em>See e.g. O\u2019Neill v. Department of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>49 P.3d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b626 <em>Did the District Court and Director Opper err by substituting their judgment for that of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s as to the weight of the </em>evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b627 On appeal, Christie reiterates the arguments he presented to the District Court. Namely, Christie maintains that Director Opper improperly substituted his judgment as to the weight of the evidence. Christie argues that DEQ \u201coffered no evidence that Mr. Christie intentionally falsified his time records,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he best that can be said about the totality of evidence on the issue of intent was that it was conflicting and equivocal.\u201d He contends that under \u00a72-4-621(3), MCA (2007), because.Director Opper did not actually hear or observe witnesses, he could not weigh inconsistent evidence and arrive at a finding contrary to that of the Hearing Examiner. In addition, Christie maintains that the Hearing Examiner \u2018found that Mr. Christie\u2019s time keeping records were not dishonest,\u201d and thus, DEQ was required to consider Christie\u2019s work record and use a form of progressive discipline instead of termination. For these reasons, Christie contends that Director Opper and DEQ rendered a decision that was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b628 We disagree. Although DEQ terminated Christie for submitting false records, as discussed above, the Hearing Examiner failed to make a finding on the issue of whether Christie had intentionally falsified his time records. Yet, even Christie admits that whether he intentionally falsified records was an issue central to DEQ\u2019s reasoning to terminate Christie\u2019s employment. Christie\u2019s opening brief on appeal states that \u201cresolution of the appropriateness of the termination rose and fell on the question of honesty.\u201d Because the Hearing Examiner failed to address the basis for Christie\u2019s discharge, that task fell to Director Opper.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b629  The District Court observed that substantial evidence existed in the record \u201cupon which Director Opper could determine as a matter of law that Christie\u2019s dishonesty required immediate termination.\u201d We agree. The Hearing Examiner found that Christie had exaggerated his work hours on some, if not most, occasions. Christie failed to provide any reasonable explanation for the twenty-three hours he claimed to have worked that DEQ determined he did not work during the seven-week monitoring period. When asked to account for his whereabouts during work hours only two days before, Christie falsely claimed he had been meeting with Pizzini. When it became apparent that North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>had spoken to Pizzini and learned that Pizzini had not met with Christie all day, Christie changed his story and then claimed he had gone home to nap. Substantial evidence exists in the record that Christie persistently and intentionally falsified his time records and claimed to have worked hours that he did not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b630 Under Admin. R. M. 2.21.6507 (2007), \u2018failure to satisfactorily perform job duties\u201d constitutes just cause for termination. Just cause also includes \u201cactual violation of an established agency standard,\u201d \u2018failure to meet applicable professional standards,\u201d and \u201cunprofessional or inappropriate behavior.\u201d DEQ terminated Christie for falsification of records and determined that his actions were a \u201cmanifestation of dishonesty\u201d and a \u2018theft of state resources.\u201d Intentional falsification of time records falls within the ambit of \u2018just cause\u201d as defined in Admin. R. M. 2.21.6507.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b631  Christie\u2019s assertions that DEQ was required to consider his service record prior to termination are without merit. As set forth in the State Discipline Handling Guide, certain serious infractions do not require consideration of an employee\u2019s overall service record prior to termination. The Guide permits discharge upon the first occurrence for serious infractions such as falsification of records and theft of state property. DEQ was therefore not required to consult Christie\u2019s service record prior to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b632 Even though the Hearing Examiner concluded that Christie had \u201cexaggerated\u201d his work hours on numerous occasions, he stated that Christie\u2019s behavior was \u2018hot so severe a breach of the public trust that discharge should be automatic.\u201d This conclusion of law-improperly characterized as a finding of fact-is in direct conflict with the State Discipline Handling Guide, which provides for termination upon first occurrence of falsification of records or theft of state property. Because this conclusion of law was incorrect, Director Opper and the District Court did not err in contravening it.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b633 Even if DEQ was required to consider Christie\u2019s record, Christie would not necessarily be entitled to a lesser form of discipline under a progressive discipline policy. Agency managers are given discretion to determine whether progressive discipline is appropriate. <em>See </em>Admin. R. M. 2.21.6509(2) (2007) (\u2018Management may determine the appropriateness of using progressive discipline on a case-by-case basis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b634  The Hearing Examiner failed to make findings regarding whether Christie had intentionally falsified his work records. Because such falsification formed the basis for DEQ\u2019s termination of Christie, Director Opper was required to make a finding concerning Christie\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>intent. In so doing, Director Opper did not substitute his judgment for that of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s. The District Court concluded upon review that substantial evidence existed \u201cupon which Director Opper could determine as a matter of law that Christie\u2019s dishonesty required immediate termination.\u201dNeither Director Opper nor the District Court erred by substituting their judgment for that of the Hearing Examiner. DEQ was not required to review Christie\u2019s service record prior to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b635 <em>Did the District Court err by referencing a warning letter that was not part of the administrative record ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b636 Christie argues that the District Court erred by making the 2004 warning letter the \u201ccrux\u201d of its order affirming Director Opper\u2019s decision. In particular, Christie points to several passages of the District Court\u2019s order. He objects to the court\u2019s statement that Tb]ecause Christie had been disciplined in the past for the same offense, he was uniquely on notice that further time-skimming would lead to his termination from employment, and DEQ had no duty to determine whether Christie was a valuable employee before terminating that employment.\u201d Christie contends that because the letter was not part of the administrative record and should have been removed from his personnel file in 2005, the District Court\u2019s \u201creliance on that evidence is clearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b637  Substantial evidence exists in the record to support Director Opper\u2019s finding that Christie had intentionally falsified his time records. Christie\u2019s actions constituted just cause for termination by DEQ without regard to the 2004 warning letter. Given our analysis above, we conclude that even if the District Court\u2019s references to the warning letter were in error, any such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b638 The District Court and Director Opper did not err by substituting their judgment for the Hearing Examiner\u2019s as to the weight of the evidence. Moreover, DEQ was not required to consider Christie\u2019s work record prior to termination. Lastly, even if the District Court erred by referring to the 2004 warning letter, any such error was harmless. \u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, WARNER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
