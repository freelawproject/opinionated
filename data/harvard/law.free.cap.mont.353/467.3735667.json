The Fourth Judicial District Court awarded Kulstad a parental interest in the children over Maniaci\u2019s objections. Maniaci appealed this ruling and we affirmed. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595 <em>(Kulstad I). </em>While <em>Kulstad I </em>was on appeal, the District Court, in response to a motion by the guardian ad litem (GAL), entered a Temporary Protective Order (TPO) regarding certain treatment records of the children. Maniaci petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control, seeking to reverse the TPO. We granted the petition in part and remanded the matter to the District Court, ordering that Maniaci be allowed to respond to the GAL\u2019s request for a TPO. Upon remand, Maniaci moved for substitution of Judge Ed McLean who had presided over the case since its origin in 2007. Judge McLean denied Maniaci\u2019s motion. Maniaci appeals this denial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Maniaci\u2019s Motion for Substitution of Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b63 In <em>Kulstad I, </em>we set forth the relevant factual background of this case. For purposes of this Opinion, we present the few additional necessary facts. In January 2009, while the main appeal in <em>Kulstad I </em>was pending (Notice of Appeal was filed October 2, 2008), the children\u2019s GAL filed a report with the District Court, requesting a protective order. The GAL asked that the therapy notes and work product relating to the children\u2019s therapy be protected and that these documents not be provided to the parties. The GAL believed that such protection would provide the children with \u201ca safe place in which to express and explore issues.\u201dOn January 30, the District Court granted the motion and entered a TPO. Maniaci had not yet responded to the GAL\u2019s motion at the time the court granted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u00b64 On March 5, 2009, Maniaci petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control. She claimed that (1) the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the TPO after the appeal had been filed; (2) the court violated her rights to due process by ordering the sequestration of the children\u2019s medical records; and (3) the TPO itself violated her fundamental rights as a parent. She asked that we retroactively vacate the TPO and instruct the District Court to refrain from entering any further orders while the appeal was pending. On April 15, 2009, we issued an order granting Maniaci\u2019s petition in part and remanding the matter to the District Court with instructions that Maniaci be given the opportunity to respond to the GAL\u2019s motion for a protective order before the court further ruled on the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b65 Immediately upon remand, on April 20, Maniaci moved for substitution of the judge in the case. Judge Ed McLean had presided over the case since Kulstad moved to dissolve the relationship in January 2007. On April 27, the District Court denied Maniaci\u2019s motion. On April 29, Maniaci appealed the District Court\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute is a conclusion of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Williams v. Schwager, </em>2002 MT 107, \u00b6 36, 309 Mont. 455, 47 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Maniaci\u2019s Motion for Substitution of Judge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b68 Whether a party is entitled to substitution of a judge is determined by statute. Section 3-l-804(l)(g), MCA (2007), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfB\">When a new trial is ordered by the district court, each adverse party shall thereupon be entitled to one motion for substitution of judge in the manner provided herein. When on appeal the judgment or order appealed from is reversed or modified and the cause is remanded to the district court for a new trial, or when a summary judgment or judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded, each adverse party shall thereupon be entitled to one motion for substitution of judge in the manner provided herein. Such motion must be filed, with the required filing fee in civil cases, within twenty (20) days after a new trial has been ordered by the district court or after the remittitur from the Supreme Court has been filed with the district court. No other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>right of further substitution shall arise in cases remanded by the supreme court. In criminal cases, no further right of substitution shall arise when the cause is remanded for resentencing. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b69  As determined by Judge McLean, this statute does not provide authorization for substitution of a judge in this case. Upon issuing our ruling on Maniaci\u2019s writ for supervisory control, we remanded the case to the District Court with the limited instruction that the court allow Maniaci to respond to the GAL\u2019s motion for a protective order before the District Court ruled on the motion. We did not remand the case for a \u201cnew trial\u201d nor was Maniaci\u2019s petition for a writ an \u201cappeal\u201d of a judgment or order that was reversed or modified. Moreover, it was not a summary judgment or judgment of dismissal that was reversed and remanded. As for the timing for filing a motion for substitution of judge, again there was no new trial scheduled to trigger the 20-day filing requirement nor was there a remittitur issued by this Court at the conclusion of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b610 It is well-established that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself. We will not \u2018insert what has been omitted ... or omit what has been inserted\u201d nor will we resort to other means of interpretation. <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, </em>2002 MT 8, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 111, 39 P.3d 697; \u00a71-2-101, MCA. Section 3-l-804(l)(g), MCA (2007), simply does not apply here and the District Court did not err in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b611 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Maniaci\u2019s Motion for Substitution of Judge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
