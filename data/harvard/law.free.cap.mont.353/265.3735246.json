Because of the injuries, Satterlee began to receive PTD benefits. When Satterlee became eligible for Social Security Retirement Insurance (SSRI), pursuant to \u00a739-71-710, MCA, the PTD benefits terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b66 Satterlee first challenged the constitutionality of \u00a739-71-710, as it applied to PTD benefits, in 2005 in the WCC. In its 2005 \u2018Order Denying Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\u201d the WCC held the statute to be constitutional as applied to PTD benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Satterlee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>appealed and this Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice because the order fell short of a final judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and identified two remaining unresolved issues to be decided by the WCC: 1) Whether \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, violates Satterlee\u2019s right to due process; and 2) Whether \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, unconstitutionally or impermissibly discriminates against Satterlee based on age.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b67 In January 2006, Satterlee moved for reconsideration of the WCC\u2019s 2005 order denying Satterlee\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The WCC granted Satterlee\u2019s motion for reconsideration and granted Satterlee leave to file a motion and brief requesting additional discovery, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(f). However, in its order granting Satterlee leave, the WCC noted that its previous analysis of the constitutionality of \u00a739-71-710, MCA, as it related to PTD benefits, \u201cwas not grounded on the specific economic analyses proffered by [Lumberman\u2019s].\u201d However, the WCC noted that it did factor into its analysis that \u201cproviding PTD benefits to injured workers beyond the time they were eligible for retirement benefits had a general negative economic impact on the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d After entertaining arguments regarding whether additional discovery pertaining to specific economic impacts of a ruling on the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, in its 2006 order, the WCC denied Satterlee\u2019s motion to allow discovery and granted Lumberman\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment. The WCC explained that its previous constitutional analysis \u201cwas not grounded on the specific economic analyses proffered by [Satterlee]\u201d and it was not persuaded that additional discovery regarding economic costs would preclude summary judgment in favor of Lumberman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b68 Montana State Fund then moved the WCC for partial summary judgment on the two remaining issues identified by this Court. In 2008, the WCC granted Montana State Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Satterlee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b69 In reviewing the WCC\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, this Court uses the same standard used in ruling upon a motion for summary judgment; we determine whether there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Otteson v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2005 MT 198, \u00b6 8, 328 Mont. 174, 119 P.3d 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\u00b610 The issues before us involve questions of constitutional law. The standard for reviewing conclusions of law is whether they are correct. <em>Henry v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, \u00b6 10, 294 Mont. 448, 982 P.2d 456.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">The constitutionality of a legislative enactment is prima facie presumed, and every intendment in its favor will be presumed, unless its unconstitutionality appears beyond a reasonable doubt. The question of constitutionality is not whether it is possible to condemn, but whether it is possible to uphold the legislative action which will not be declared invalid unless it conflicts with the constitution, in the judgment of the court, beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><em>Powell v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 11. If any doubt exists, it must be resolved in favor of the statute. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b611 The issue before the Court is the constitutionality of \u00a739-71-710, MCA. Satterlee claims the statute is unconstitutional because it denies PTD benefits to Satterlee and other similarly situated individuals on the basis of their age. Satterlee argues that, based on our holding in <em>Reesor v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2004 MT 370, 325 Mont. 1, 103 P.3d 1019, \u201cthe Court should find that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, violates the Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process Clauses of the Montana Constitution and illegally discriminates based on age.\u201d Appellee insurance companies urge this Court to uphold the WCC\u2019s decision finding \u00a739-71-710, MCA, to be constitutional, as it is applied to PTD benefit recipients who become eligible for SSRI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b612 The declaration of policy supporting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">[a]n objective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system is to provide, without regard to fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to assist a worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>a work-related injury or disease. \u00a739-71-105(1), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Section 39-71-710, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">[TJermination of benefits upon retirement. (1) If a claimant is receiving disability or rehabilitation compensation benefits and the claimant receives social security retirement benefits or is eligible to receive or is receiving full social security retirement benefits or retirement benefits from a system that is alternative to social security retirement, the claimant is considered to be retired. When the claimant is retired, the liability of the insurer is ended for payment of permanent partial disability benefits other than the impairment award ... and medical benefits. (2) If a claimant who is eligible under subsection (1) to receive retirement benefits and while gainfully employed suffers a work-related injury, the insurer retains liability for temporary total disability benefits, any impairment award, and medical benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT9\">\u00b613 Workers become eligible for SSRI when they reach full retirement age and have enough social security earnings to be fully insured. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7404.310 (2009). Full retirement age has traditionally been 65 years. However, this age is gradually being increased based on an individual\u2019s date of birth. Under the current regulatory scheme, the full retirement age for individuals born after January 1, 1960 is 67 years. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.409(a) (2009). Therefore, for the purposes of applying \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, an individual will reach the age of \u201cretirement\u201d between the ages of 65 and 67 depending on his or her date of birth. With this understanding of the interplay between SSRI and PTD benefits we now turn to the issues at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b614 1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in determining that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, does not violate Satterlee\u2019s right to equal protection?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b615 Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution provides that Tt]he dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.\u201d \u2018The basic rule of equal protection is that persons similarly situated with respect to a legitimate governmental purpose of the law must receive like treatment.\u201d <em>Rausch v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 140, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 272, 114 P.3d 192 <em>(Rausch II) </em>(citing <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 22). In addressing an equal protection challenge, this Court follows a three-step process. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 27. First, we must identify the classes involved and determine whether they are similarly situated. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 27. The WCC adopted the <em>Reesor </em>court\u2019s classification, which identified the two classes in <em>Reesor </em>as \u201c(1) PPD eligible claimants who receive or are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>eligible to receive social security retirement benefits; and (2) PPD claimants who do not receive and are not eligible to receive social security retirement benefits.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 10. The parties do not dispute this approach to classification. Thus, we agree with the WCC\u2019s determination that, for the purposes of an equal protection analysis, the two classes represented here are defined as: (1) PTD eligible claimants who receive or are eligible to receive social security retirement benefits; and (2) PTD claimants who do not receive and are not eligible to receive social security retirement benefits. Having identified the classes we must now determine whether they are similarly situated. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b616 The WCC determined that the two classes were similarly situated because \u2018both classes have suffered work-related injuries, are unable to return to their time-of-injury jobs, have permanent physical impairment ratings, and must rely on section 39-71-702, MCA, as their exclusive remedy under Montana law.\u201d Satterlee agrees with the WCC\u2019s determination and asserts that \u2018Tf]or equal protection purposes, the <em>Reesor </em>classes and the Satterlee classes are identical. The single discriminating factor between the classes in both cases is age.\u201d While several of the Appellee insurers agree with the WCC\u2019s determination that the classes are similarly situated, Montana State Fund argues that age is not the only differentiating factor because \u2018Tmjany claimants over age 65 do and will continue to receive PTD benefits.\u201d While it may be that some individuals will continue to receive PTD benefits after reaching age 65, it does not follow that both classes are not similarly situated. Those individuals who are able to maintain their PTD benefits do so only because they do not have enough social security earnings to be considered insured for the purposes of qualifying for SSRI. Here, just as in <em>Reesor, </em>both classes have suffered work-related injuries, are unable to return to their time-of-injury jobs, have permanent physical impairment ratings, and must rely on \u00a739-71-702, MCA, as their exclusive remedy under Montana Law. Although \u00a739-71-710, MCA, does not specify a particular age, it is still triggered by operation of SSRI regulations that do. In short, it applies only to claimants who are \u201cretired,\u201d which is defined as a claimant who \u201creceives social security retirement benefits or is eligible to receive or is receiving full social security retirement benefits or retirement benefits from a system that is an alternative to social security retirement ....\u201d Section 39-71-710, MCA. Under this framework, the claimant\u2019s age, as defined by the eligibility requirements of receiving SSRI benefits, is the only identifiable differentiating factor between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the two classes. As such, we agree with the WCC\u2019s determination that the classes are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b617 The next step in addressing an equal protection challenge is to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to the challenged legislation. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 29. In doing so, we must determine whether a suspect classification is involved or whether the nature of the individual interest involves a fundamental right, either of which would trigger a strict scrutiny analysis. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 29. We have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">[t]he right to receive Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits is not a fundamental right which would trigger a strict scrutiny analysis of equal protection. Nor does this statute infringe upon the rights of a suspect class. When a right determined to be less than fundamental is infringed upon by a classification, the test applied by this Court is the rational relationship test. That is, does a legitimate governmental objective bear some identifiable rational relationship to a discriminatory classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\"><em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln Co., </em>259 Mont. 147, 151, 855 P.2d 506, 509 (1993) <em>(Stratemeyer I) </em>(citing <em>Cottrill v. Cottrill Sodding Serv., </em>229 Mont. 40, 42-43, 744 P.2d 895, 897 (1987)). As described above, rational basis review is the traditional level of scrutiny applied to equal protection analyses of workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Satterlee, however, urges us to apply a middle-tier analysis \u201cgiven the rare combination of age discrimination and the total loss of workers\u2019 compensation benefits found in the present statute.\u201d We apply middle-tier scrutiny when the legislation at issue infringes upon a right that \u2018has its origin in the Montana Constitution, but is not found in the Declaration of Rights ....\u201d <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 18. The statute at issue here does not infringe upon the rights of a suspect class or involve fundamental rights. <em>See Henry, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 21. While we are sympathetic to any worker who suffers a loss of income, it would be inappropriate for us to disregard the well established principle that rational basis review applies to workers\u2019 compensation claims. We do not agree with Satterlee\u2019s contention that the facts presented justify a heightened level of scrutiny. Thus, rational basis is the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b618 The final step in our equal protection analysis is to apply the appropriate level of scrutiny to evaluating the constitutional challenge. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 32. The rational basis test requires that (1) the statute\u2019s objective was legitimate, and (2) that the statute\u2019s objective bears a rational relationship to the classification used by the legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Stated another way, the statute must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">\u00b619 Satterlee argues that we should follow the holding we arrived at in <em>Reesor </em>and determine that there is no rational basis to justify discrimination between the two classes. More specifically, Satterlee contends that \u201cPPD and PTD benefits are legally indistinguishable\u201d as they relate to \u00a739-71- 710, MCA, and \u2018Ta]s with PPD benefits, PTD benefits should not automatically terminate at a specific age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b620 Lumberman\u2019s and Montana State Fund argue that <em>Reesor </em>is inapposite. They assert that because <em>Reesor </em>dealt with PPD benefits and not PTD benefits we should distinguish the instant case and adopt the WCC\u2019s analysis. Relying on our thorough differentiation of PPD and PTD benefits <em>inRausch II, </em>Lumberman\u2019s and Montana State Fund argue that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, satisfies the rational basis test \u2018because different rationales underlie PPD benefits and PTD benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b621 In the WCC\u2019s order denying Satterlee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Court stated that \u201cwhen determining whether a rational basis exists for the specific portion of [\u00a7] 39-71-710, MCA, at issue in this case, the Court believes the analysis must differ from the analysis in <em>Reesor </em>because the <em>rationale </em>for PPD benefits and PTD benefits is different.\u201dBecause the statutory objective of \u00a739-71-710, MCA, is vital to our method of constitutional analysis, we now examine the purposes of the statute in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b622 PPD and PTD designations, and the benefits associated with each, vary in several relevant ways. First, the definition of each classification is markedly different. The WCA defines PPD as \u201ca physical condition in which a worker, after reaching maximum medical healing: (a) has a permanent impairment established by objective medical findings; (b) is able to return to work in some capacity but the permanent impairment impairs the worker\u2019s ability to work; and (c) has an actual wage loss as a result of the injury.\u201d Section 39-71-116(24), MCA. PTD on the other hand, is defined as \u201ca physical condition resulting from injury as defined in this chapter, after a worker reaches maximum medical healing, in which a worker does not have a reasonable prospect of physically performing regular employment.\u201d Section 39-71-116(25), MCA. Under this scheme, a claimant defined as PPD is in a very different situation from a claimant defined as PTD. While a PPD claimant will presumably be able to return to work and earn an income, a PTD claimant will not. This distinction is important because it underlies the second relevant difference between PPD and PTD benefits-namely, the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b623 As we pointed out in <em>Rausch 11, </em>the purposes of PPD and PTD differ greatly. Specifically, PPD benefits serve to restore the claimant to a pre-accident wage level for a limited amount of time while PTD benefits are meant to assist the claimant for his or her work life. <em>Rausch II, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">[T]he PPD claimant, who is able to return to work, is entitled to wage supplement benefits, which serve to restore the claimant to a pre-accident wage level if the claimant has suffered a decrease in wages upon return to work. Additionally, the PPD claimant is entitled to an impairment award, which compensates the claimant for the permanent loss of physical function. This benefit is smaller than the total disability benefit, and is paid over a shorter period of time, but is designed to compensate a claimant who is able to return to work and re-commence earning a wage. The payment of an award to a claimant who returns to work is consistent with the Act\u2019s stated purpose of returning injured workers to the work force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Rauch II, </em>\u00b6 23. As this Court pointed out, PTD benefits are not meant to supplement a claimant\u2019s wages rather they are intended to assist the worker who will never be able to return to work. <em>Rausch II, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqv\">[T]he statutory framework of the Act reveals the distinctly different purposes served by PPD and PTD benefits. PPD benefits compensate the worker for sustaining a partial disability by a smaller impairment award, and supplements the wages earned by the claimant upon return to work. PTD benefits do not contemplate a return to work, but, rather, provides a continuous, higher benefit which is paid over the work life of the totally disabled claimant. With these distinctions in mind, it would be inappropriate for this Court to make comparisons between these dissimilarly situated classes and then to order that either class is entitled to a benefit designed for a different class here, that PTD claimants are entitled to an impairment award. We conclude, therefore, that PPD and PTD claimants are not similarly situated</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>Rauch II, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u00b624 We agree with the WCC that the distinctions between PPD and PTD benefits are significant and thus require a different approach. As such, in the instant case we decline to follow <em>Reesor </em>to the extent that it dealt with PPD not PTD benefits. The two benefit classes are simply too different and serve such divergent purposes that equating the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>would be inappropriate. Thus, we will analyze the statute\u2019s constitutionality by examining the governmental interests that are relevant to PTD benefits only.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\">\u00b625 Lumberman\u2019s and Montana State Fund argue that the WCA in general and \u00a739-71-710, MCA, in particular, are rationally related to several legitimate interests. To make this argument they rely first on the public policy statement associated with the WCA that Tw]age-loss benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to assist a worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost ....\u201d Section 39-71-105(1), MCA. In short, Lumberman\u2019s and Montana State Fund assert that the government has a legitimate interest in assisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer and in providing wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. In addition, Lumberman\u2019s also argues that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, bears a rational relationship to protecting the financial viability of the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b626 Satterlee on the other hand, disputes any correlation between a legitimate government interest and \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. Relying on <em>Reesor, </em>Satterlee contends that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, arbitrarily terminates their PTD benefits and that there is therefore no rational relationship between the government\u2019s interests and the statute. Satterlee also argues that the WCC improperly relied on cost containment in reaching its decision and that such reliance violates the Equal Protection Clause. We will examine each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b627 We begin with Satterlee\u2019s argument that\u00f1eesor requires a finding that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, is arbitrary and therefore unconstitutional. As we have explained here, as well as in <em>Rausch II, </em>PPD benefits and PTD benefits serve very different purposes and employ very different entitlement schemes. Therefore, we do not equate <em>Reesor </em>with the case at bar. Of most relevance to our discussion here is the difference between the timeframes over which PPD and PTD benefits are meant to serve. PPD benefits are temporary and are meant to terminate after a limited number of weeks. PTD benefits however, are meant to assist the worker over the course of his or her work life. <em>Rausch II, </em>\u00b6 25. This difference is particularly important because it demonstrates the rationality of terminating PTD benefits at \u201cretirement.\u201d Simply put, when an individual is considered retired, they have, by definition, ended their work life. In order to achieve the stated purpose of PTD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>benefits, which the legislature explained to be the provision of wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost, it is sufficiently rational that such benefits would terminate when actual wages would normally terminate-upon retirement. The fact that retirement is statutorily defined at a given age for purposes of terminating PTD entitlements does not make the statute <em>per se </em>irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b628  As the WCC pointed out, fin the absence of \u00a7 39-71-710\u2019s limitations, [PTD benefits] would become a lifetime benefit.\u201d <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. </em>et al., 2005 MTWCC 55. Indeed, without the statute, PTD benefits would run on until the claimant\u2019s death. Conversely, PPD benefits do terminate after a statutorily defined number of weeks. As such, \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, was irrational as it applied to PPD benefits because it disparately impacted similarly situated classes without serving any legitimate government interest. The termination of PTD based on SSRI eligibility on the other hand, is a sufficiently rational means of ensuring that PTD benefits do not become a lifetime benefit. As Lumberman\u2019s and Montana State Fund explained during oral arguments, nearly two-thirds of people who reach the age of 66 are no longer working, while seventy-five percent are no longer employed at age 70. With the statutory intent of \u00a739-71-710, MCA, in mind, it is rational for the workers\u2019 compensation system to terminate PTD benefits at a time when, statistically, most people\u2019s work-lives have ended. While this may not always seem fair, it is not unconstitutional. By acting to terminate benefits as it does, \u00a739-71-710, MCA, rationally advances the governmental purpose of providing wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b629  We now turn to the second part of Satterlee\u2019s equal protection argument in which they assert that the WCC erred in its reliance on cost containment. We readily concede that cost alone is insufficient to justify the disparate treatment of similar classes. However, our jurisprudence does not go so far as to say cost to the workers\u2019 compensation fund may never be considered. <em>Heisler v. Hines Motor Co., </em>282 Mont. 270, 283, 937 P.2d 45, 52 (1997). It is well established that the control of workers\u2019 compensation costs is a legitimate government interest that may constitutionally be pursued by the legislature. <em>Stratemeyer I, </em>259 Mont. at 155, 855 P.2d at 511; <em>Heisler, </em>282 Mont. at 284, 937 P.2d at 52. As long as cost containment is not the sole reason for disparate treatment and it is achieved by a rational means the legislature may attempt to improve the viability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation system without offending the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Stratemeyer </em>I, 259 Mont. at 155, 855 P.2d at 511; <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 30. The WCC\u2019s discussion of cost in this case was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">\u00b630 While the parties dispute the precise economic impact striking down \u00a739-71-710, MCA would have on the workers\u2019 compensation system no party contends that it would not be measureable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While this alone cannot justify disparate treatment, the WCC appropriately relied on additional factors in reaching its conclusion. Namely, the WCC pointed to the government\u2019s interest in assisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer as well as to the interest in providing benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. Because the WCC\u2019s cost containment analysis is rational and more importantly, because it was coupled with a finding that additional legitimate interests are served by the statute we conclude that the WCC did not err when it relied in part on cost containment in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b631 Thus, with regard to Satterlee\u2019s equal protection claim, we conclude that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, satisfies the Montana Constitution. As we have discussed, the statute is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in assisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer so that the wage-loss benefit bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. We now turn to Satterlee\u2019s claim that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, violates their right to substantive due process. In doing so we will address Satterlee\u2019s argument that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, terminates benefits based on age as well as the assertion that affirming the WCC will result in an absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b632 2. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in determining that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, does not violate Satterlee\u2019s substantive due process right?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b633 \u2018Substantive due process analysis requires a test of the reasonableness of a statute in relation to the State\u2019s power to enact legislation.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing <em>Newville v. State, Dept. of Family Serv., </em>267 Mont. 237, 250, 883 P.2d 793, 801 (1994)). \u2018Since the State cannot use its power to take unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious action against an individual, a statute enacted by the legislature must be reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>satisfy guarantees of substantive due process.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 29 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b634 In both the briefs and at oral argument Satterlee questioned the reasonableness of the statute\u2019s application with respect to PTD claimants over the age of 65 who are eligible to receive SSRI. In doing so, Satterlee asserts that there is an inconsistency in allowing claimants who have worked less, and therefore do not qualify for SSRI, to continue to collect PTD benefits while terminating those claimants who have worked more, and are therefore eligible SSRI. While we are mindful of this issue we do not think it rises to the level of an absurdity so that we would be required to hold \u00a739-71-710, MCA, unconstitutional. We have long held that Tt]he power of the legislature to fix amounts, time and manner of payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits is not doubted.\u201d <em>Ingraham v. Champion Intl., </em>243 Mont. 42, 48, 793 P.2d 769, 772 (1990). This principle coupled with the constitutional role of this Court to presume the statute to be constitutional and look to any possible legitimate purpose requires us conclude that it is within the legislature\u2019s perogative to determine that PTD benefits should terminate upon a claimant receiving or becoming eligible to receive SSRI. <em>Stratemeyer I, </em>259 Mont, at 152, 855 P.2d at 510. Although the issue raised by Satterlee is legitimate, it not irrational that the legislature may have decided to allow the most vulnerable claimants, those who do not qualify for SSRI, to continue to receive PTD benefits even after they reached the age at which they would otherwise be terminated. That the legislature did not enunciate this specific purpose does not mean that it should not be considered. As we have stated it]he purpose of the legislation does not have to appear on the face of the legislation or in the legislative history, but may be any possible purpose of which the court can conceive.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer </em>I, 259 Mont. at 152, 855 P.2d at 510-11. Our role is not to second guess the prudence of a legislative decision. As such we cannot strike down \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, as a violation of substantive due process simply because we may not agree with the legislature\u2019s policy decisions. That we have identified at least one \u201cpossible legitimate purpose\u201d is enough in this instance for us to conclude that affirming the WCC will not result in an absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b635 Satterlee also argues that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, terminates PTD benefits based on age and that our holding in <em>Reesor </em>prohibits such discrimination. As we have already explained, we find the reasoning in <em>Reesor </em>to be inapplicable to the case at bar. PPD and PTD benefits and their corresponding purposes are too different to equate them with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>one another. As we noted earlier, the legislature\u2019s decision to terminate PTD benefits when a claimant receives or become eligible to receive SSRI is based on the rational grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">\u00b636 Finally, Satterlee urges that \u2018[b]y terminating [Satterlee\u2019s] PTD benefits because of [age], \u00a739-71-710, MCA violates [their] substantive due process rights because there is no <em>quid pro quo </em>for the PTD benefits ... lost after age 65.\u201dSatterlee cites <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln Co., </em>276 Mont. 67, 75, 915 P.2d 175, 179 (1996) <em>{Stratemeyer IT) </em>in support of the proposition that an employee\u2019s rights to file an action in tort \u201cshould not be deemed taken away except where something of value has been put in their place.\u201d Conversely, Lumberman\u2019s and Montana State Fund argue that the <em>quid pro quo </em>principle of a bargained for exchange is satisfied because claimants over the age of 65 may still \u201creceive no-fault medical benefits and temporary total disability benefits as long as they are due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b637 As this Court has held on several occasions, the enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was essentially a compromise between industry and labor so that labor received guaranteed no-fault recovery, and industry was relieved of the possibility of large and potentially uncapped recoveries in the tort system. <em>Stratemeyer II, </em>276 Mont. at 74, 915 P.2d at 179 (citing <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Co. v. Indus. Accident Bd., </em>52 Mont. 522, 179 P.499 (1916)). As with all legislative compromises, the WCA is not infallible and the legislative decisions made in adopting the WCA are subject to honest debate. Nevertheless, once a statute has been duly approved by the legislative branch, this Court\u2019s role is not one of second guessing the prudence of the conclusions reached. <em>Stratemeyer I, </em>259 Mont. at 147, 855 P.2d at 506. It is from this starting point that we address Satterlee\u2019s <em>quid pro quo </em>argument. \u00b638 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines <em>quid pro quo </em>as \u2018Ia]n action or thing that is exchanged for another action or thing of more or less equal value.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1282 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). While the legislature has rationally concluded that PTD benefits should terminate once a claimant has received or becomes eligible to receive SSRI, the statute still provides for those claimants who are over 65 when they suffer a work place injury by allowing them to receive temporary total disability benefits, an impairment award and no-fault medical benefits. Section 39-71-710, MCA. That this remedy satisfies the <em>quid pro quo </em>by providing the claimant who is over 65 with a benefit of\u2018inore or less equal value\u201d to their forgone rights in tort is subject to honest debate. However, such a debate involves issues and decisions about public policy that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>clearly of the sort much better suited to the halls of the legislature. Furthermore, such a claimant is not before us in the case at bar. Here, all three Appellants suffered work place injuries prior to becoming eligible for SSRI and, in fact, received PTD benefits for multiple years. Suffice it to say that while the claimant who suffers a work related injury after becoming eligible for SSRI may not be able to qualify for PTD benefits, he or she is still eligible for benefits of sufficient significance to satisfy the <em>quid pro quo </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b639  Furthermore, Satterlee\u2019s claims that substantive due process has been violated by the lack of a <em>quid pro quo </em>mistakenly ignores the fundamental compromise that was reached by legislature\u2019s enactment of the WCA. Namely, in exchange for no fault recovery, employers gained the predictability of consistent workers compensation payments that would be capped in a way that personal injury tort claims were not. As such, it is sufficiently rational that the legislature enacted \u00a739-71-710, MCA. Without such a limitation on the duration of PTD benefits, the cap and predictability of payments that employers bargained for in the WCA would be lost thus denying the employers, the benefit of the <em>quid pro quo. </em>Although we may empathize with Satterlee\u2019s economic loss, we have long held that \u201ca worker\u2019s right to compensation benefits is not fundamental.\u201d <em>Ingraham, </em>243 Mont. at 48, 793 P.2d at 773 (citing <em>Cottrill, </em>229 Mont. at 44-43, 744 P.2d at 897 (1987)). Thus, with respect to Satterlee\u2019s <em>quid pro quo </em>assertions, we hold that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, does not violate their substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b640  We conclude that \u00a739-71-710, MCA, is constitutional under the Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Montana Constitution. For this and for the reasons discussed above, we hold that the WCC properly granted Montana State Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\"> <em>Satterlee v.

It is well established that the workers\u2019 compensation fund\u2019s financial viability is a legitimate government interest. <em>Stratemeyer I, </em>259 Mont. at 155, 855 P.2d at 511 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b304-8\">JUSTICE MORRIS</author>\n<p id=\"AtD\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u00b642 I reluctantly dissent. The Utah Supreme Court recently struck down a similar offset provision on equal protection grounds. <em>Merrill v. Utah Labor Comm\u2019n, </em>(Utah 2009). The Utah offset kicked in once an injured worker had received 312 weeks of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 1. Montana\u2019s offset law contains no similar delayed trigger. It applies as soon as the injured worker becomes eligible for SSRI benefits. Section 39-71-710, MCA. The Utah offset reduced by fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>percent the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefit that the injured worker may receive. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 1. Montana\u2019s offset eliminates entirely any PTD benefits for the injured worker. Section 39-71-710, MCA. The Utah court determined nevertheless that this offset provision could not withstand rational basis scrutiny in that it unfairly singled out workers\u2019 compensation benefits of injured workers over the age of 65 who qualified for social security benefits. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 1.1 agree with the analysis of the Utah Supreme Court in <em>Merrill </em>and would strike down the offset provision of \u00a739-71-710, MCA, for similar reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">\u00b643 This Court recently struck down without hesitation under rational basis review a maximum hiring age for new firefighters in \u00a77-33-4107, MCA, on the ground that the cut-off age of 34 was \u201cwholly arbitrary.\u201d <em>Jaksha v. Butte-Silver Bow County, </em>2009 MT 263, \u00b6 24, 352 Mont. 46, 214 P.3d 1248. The Court rejected out of hand the county s argument that the maximum hiring age prolonged the productive life of a firefighter and enabled him to work more safely and efficiently as his physical capabilities declined with age. <em>Jaksha, </em>\u00b6 21. The Court concluded that as long as the applicant had mastered the written and physical tests and successfully had completed the interview process the maximum hiring age bore no rational relationship to the statute\u2019s objective of protecting the safety of other firefighters and the public. <em>Jaksha, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b644 The same \"rational scrutiny with bite\u201d approach used in <em>Jaksha </em>surely would invalidate the legislature\u2019s similar effort to use SSRI eligibility as a proxy for retirement. <em>See </em>G. Gunther, <em>Cases and Materials on Constitutional Law, </em>12th Ed. at 462 (Foundation Press 1992). The Court instead employs a toothless analysis that permits the legislature to advance the perfectly legitimate task of protecting the economic viability of the workers\u2019 compensation system through the illegitimate means of penalizing injured workers who have qualified for SSRI. The Court applies its toothless approach through its depiction of workers\u2019 compensation and SSRI solely as wage loss replacement systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b645 The Court reaches this result without regard for whether the amount of SSRI for which an injured worker might be eligible even remotely approaches the benefits that the workers\u2019 compensation system provided. I could accept some coordination of benefits to offset the receipt of SSRI, similar to what Montana law does with respect to social security disability benefits. Sections 39-71-701(5), and 39-71-702(4), MCA. Section 39-71-701(5), MCA, reduces, but does not eliminate, workers\u2019 compensation benefits for temporary total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>disability by an amount roughly equal to one-half of the federal benefits. Section 39-71-702(4), MCA, imposes the same reduction on permanent total disability benefits. The offset contained in \u00a739-71-710, MCA, however, eliminates completely an injured worker\u2019s entitlement to any benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b646 The court in <em>Merrill </em>recognized that SSRI serves an entirely different purpose from the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 26. The court noted that \u201c[n]either social security retirement benefits nor workers\u2019 compensation are solely wage replacement measures.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 29. A mere five years ago this Court declared without equivocation that \u201csocial security retirement benefits are not wage loss benefits.\u201d <em>Reesor v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2004 MT 370, \u00b6 24, 325 Mont. 1, 103 P.3d 1019. The Court nevertheless determines today that SSRI eligibility constitutes a reasonable proxy for retirement and analyzes the offset in \u00a739-71-710, MCA, under the premise that SSRI benefits replace the wage loss benefits provided under the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b647 The court in <em>Merrill </em>cited at least four distinctions between the workers\u2019 compensation system and SSRI. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33. First, the programs compute benefits \u201con entirely different bases and compensate for entirely different eventualities.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 30, quoting <em>West Virginia v. Richardson, </em>482 S.E.2d 162, 168 (W.Va. 1996). This Court in <em>Reesor </em>also previously defined workers\u2019 compensation and SSRI as \u201ctwo distinct programs\u201d and rejected the notion that they could \u201coffset one another due to the fact that both programs are based on completely different concepts.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b648 The <em>Merrill </em>court explained that Utah had adopted workers\u2019 compensation as a tort liability reform measure. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 24. Workers\u2019 compensation benefits represent a substitute for access to the courts for redress for torts \u201cand are not a welfare benefit for wage loss.\u201d <em>Golden v. Westark Community College, </em>969 S.W.2d 154, 158 (Ark. 1998). Employers pay premiums for insurance from which injured workers receive benefits fin exchange for the employee\u2019s forbearance from suing the employer in tort.\u201d <em>Golden, </em>969 S.W.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b649 Injured workers in Montana receive compensation for damages incurred by a work related injury in the form of lost wages, medical services, nursing services, hospital services, and medicines. Section 39-71-704, MCA. Montana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system provides no means for a worker to \u201copt out\u201d of the system unless the employer fails to pay to the workers\u2019 compensation fund, in which case the injured worker may bring a civil action. Section 39-71-515, MCA. Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>compensation provides the sole remedy for injured workers. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 22; \u00a739-71-411, MCA. It cannot be described fairly as a \u201cwage loss\u201d system.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">\u00b650 Second, the <em>Merrill </em>court determined that unlike workers\u2019 compensation, SSRI benefits are not paid in connection with any injury or disability. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 31. The federal government pays SSRI benefits only after a person has contributed to the fund. <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 31. The Arkansas Supreme Court likewise noted that \u201c[sjocial security retirement benefits are provided to persons over age sixty-five regardless of injury .... These benefits are not disability benefits, but are old-age entitlements serving the same function as pension payments.\u2019\u201d <em>Golden, </em>969 S.W.2d at 158 (quoting <em>Industrial Claim Appeals Office v. Romero, </em>912 P.2d 62, 67-68 (Colo. 1996)); <em>see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Keel, </em>817 So. 2d 1, 10 (La. 2002). Social security retirement benefits allow participants to receive income after age 65 only if they have contributed adequately to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b651 As this Court explained ini\u00fceesor, social security benefits \u201cprovide the recipient with supplemental income <em>after </em>he contributes to the program throughout his working life.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis in original). The West Virginia Supreme Court likewise recognized that SSRI benefits represent \u201cadditional compensation paid by insurance as a result of having worked some period of time at some average taxable salary, except as the payments reflect a return of the recipient's wage contributions to the <em>system.\u201dRichardson, </em>482 S.E.2d at 166. SSRI benefits do not compensate for a workplace injury or replace elements of damage \u201cthat might be recovered in a common law action for such an injury.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>482 S.E.2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b652 Third, the <em>Merrill </em>court cited Congress\u2019s repudiation of the notion that SSRI constitutes a wage replacement program through its enactment of the Senior Citizen\u2019s Freedom to Work Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 (2000). <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 32. Not surprisingly, this Court in <em>Reesor </em>reached the same conclusion. It too noted Congress\u2019s decision to eliminate the earnings limit for workers over age 65 and thereby eliminate the reduction in social security benefits due to wages regardless of the amount of wages earned by persons 65 and older. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 24. The court in <em>Golden </em>explained that SSRI benefits have evolved into a benefit more associated with advanced years than a replacement for wage loss in light of the fact that a worker over age 65 can supplement his social security retirement benefits by income from gainful employment. <em>Golden, </em>969 S.W.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u00b653 The offset contained in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, prevents an injured worker in Montana from supplementing his SSRI benefits. The injury prevents the worker from continuing to earn a wage and the offset deprives the injured worker of the wage replacement benefit to which he otherwise would be entitled. This Court noted the irrationality of allowing a forty-year-old injured worker to receive permanent partial disability benefits while a similarly situated sixty-five-year-old worker with an identical injury would receive only an impairment award \u201cdue to the fact that he ha[d] reached social security retirement age.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 23. The complete offset in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, for PTD benefits heightens the irrationality. A worker injured after he has reached eligibility for SSRI receives no wage replacement benefits at all. The worker cannot sue in tort to recover for these losses, however, as workers\u2019 compensation provides the sole remedy. Section 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b654 Fourth, the <em>Merrill </em>court determined that the public policy in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7623(a)(l) (2 006) (ADEA), further supports the notion that social security retirement benefits represent something different from wage loss benefits \u201cand are not duplicative of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 33. The ADEA, among other matters, prohibits an employer from discriminating against any employee \u201cwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 33. This provision makes it improper for an employer \u201cto compel its older employees to substitute retirement benefits for disability benefits.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 33. Section 39-71-710, MCA, of course, forces an older employee to substitute entirely SSRI benefits for PTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b655 This forced substitution raises the specter of whether the workers\u2019 compensation scheme provides an adequate substitute remedy \u2018for that which might be available in the tort system for such an injury.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>482 S.E.2d at 168. The offset provision of Section 39-71-710, MCA, singles out injured workers who have contributed to the economy by working the required number of years to qualify for SSRI benefits and punishes these injured workers by eliminating their workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Though the economic viability of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme represents a worthy and legitimate state interest, I fail to see how \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation benefits paid for loss of the ability to earn the same wages and a retirement benefit under social security are duplicative in any respect.\u201d <em>Golden, </em>969 S.W.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u00b656 The workers\u2019 compensation system in Montana constitutes a grand bargain in which injured workers forego the possibility of larger awards potentially available through the tort system (the quid) in exchange for a no fault system that provides more certainty of an award (the quo). <em>Sitzman v. Shumaker, </em>221 Mont. 304, 307-08, 718 P.2d 657, 659 (1986). The offset provision of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, eviscerates the quid without returning the quo. The Court concedes that this point \u2018is subject to honest debate.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. I would resolve this honest debate in favor of the injured workers who have foregone their right to seek damages through the tort system and now receive nothing in the form of workers\u2019 compensation benefits upon their eligibility for SSRI.</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-3\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
