(Grizzly), obtained a default judgment in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, against The Armored Group, LLC (TAG), on February 3,2009. TAG filed a motion on February 9, 2009, to set aside the default judgment. The motion automatically was deemed denied pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(c), after the District Court had not ruled on the motion for more than sixty days after entry of the judgment. TAG appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AUi\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion when it refused to set aside the default judgment against TAG pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b64 Grizzly provides security and armored car services in Kalispell, Montana. TAG sells armored vehicles from its home in Phoenix, Arizona. Armored Solutions, Inc., (ASI), though not a party in this appeal, was a named defendant in the complaint, and is a manufacturer of armored vehicles based in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b65 Grizzly purchased a used 1999 Ford F-450 armored truck in September 2007 from TAG for $22,500. TAG sold this vehicle to Grizzly \u201cAs Is.\u201d Grizzly purchased a 2008 Dodge armored truck from TAG in December 2007 for $76,850. ASI manufactured the Dodge truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u00b66 Grizzly claims to have experienced many problems with the purchased trucks, including a failed transmission in the Ford, and a faulty paint job and cracks in the bullet proof windows of the Dodge. A dispute arose between Grizzly and TAG regarding who would pay for repairs to the trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">\u00b67 Grizzly filed suit against TAG and ASI on December 30, 2008, in which it alleged breach of warranty, breach of duty of good faith, strict liability, fraud, and constructive fraud. Grizzly retained a process server. The process server personally served Jared C. Simmons, TAG\u2019s agent for service of process, who also happened to be TAG\u2019s legal counsel, on January 7, 2009. Simmons claims that his secretary mistakenly stamped the complaint with the wrong receipt date. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>error allegedly caused TAG to fail to file an answer within twenty days. TAG assumed that its answer was due on February 5, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b68 Both parties admit that Simmons left a phone message for Grizzly\u2019s counsel to alert Grizzly that Simmons represented TAG. TAG argues that Simmons called Grizzly twice. Grizzly asserts that its records indicate only one phone message left with a paralegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b69 Grizzly moved for entry of default on January 29,2009. The Clerk of Court entered the default the same day. TAG retained local counsel on January 30, 2009. The District Court set a hearing for February 3, 2009, on Grizzly\u2019s motion for entry of a default judgment. Grizzly did not provide TAG with notice of the hearing. In fact, Grizzly\u2019s counsel crossed Simmon\u2019s name and address off the certificate of mailing. Grizzly\u2019s counsel made no mention at the hearing that Simmons had contacted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b610 The District Court entered a default judgment in the amount of $130,239.43 at the conclusion of the hearing. Twenty-seven days elapsed between service of the complaint and the court\u2019s entry of the default judgment. The amount of the default judgment far exceeded the cost of repairs and even exceeded the sale price of the two vehicles. Grizzly argues that this judgment amount accounts for Grizzly\u2019s loss of use of both vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b611 TAG filed a motion on February 9,2009, to set aside the judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b), after learning of the entry of default judgment. The District Court scheduled a hearing on the motion for April 17, 2009. Grizzly filed a motion on April 16, 2009, to vacate the hearing pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(c). This provision required the District Court to rule on TAG\u2019s motion within sixty days of entry of judgment. The sixty days had expired on April 4, 2009. The District Court granted Grizzly\u2019s motion. TAG appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u00b612 We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 17, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451. The moving party need only show a \u201cslight abuse\u201d to warrant reversal. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 17. This standard supports our policy that \u201cevery litigated case should be tried on the merits and thus judgments by default are not favored.\u201d <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion when it refused to set aside the default judgment against TAG pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b614 This Court applies a four-part conjunctive test when deciding whether to set aside a default judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). We evaluate whether the defaulting party 1) has proceeded with diligence, 2) has shown excusable neglect, 3) has a meritorious defense to the claim, and 4) would be injured if the judgment is permitted to stand. <em>Montana Professional Sports, LLC v. National Indoor Football League, LLC, </em>2008 MT 98, \u00b6 35, 342 Mont. 292, 180 P.3d 1142, citing <em>Blume v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>242 Mont. 465, 467, 791 P.2d 784, 786 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b615 This Court reversed a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside default judgment in <em>Blume </em>on the grounds that the defendant had proceeded with diligence. The Court reasoned that the defendant had hired local counsel to represent it within days of discovering the default judgment. The defendant also had filed a motion to set aside the default judgment within a week of discovery. <em>Blume, </em>242 Mont. at 469, 791 P.2d at 786-87. The Court concluded that Metropolitan had proceeded with \u201cthe utmost diligence.\u201d <em>Blume, </em>242 Mont. at 469, 791 P.2d at 786. We see similar circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b616 TAG hired local counsel on January 30, 2009, the day after the Clerk of Court had entered the default, and four days before the District Court had entered the default judgment. TAG filed its motion to set aside the default judgment on the morning of February 9, 2009, less than a week after the District Court entered the default judgment. Grizzly concedes that TAG exhibited diligence in attempting to have the default judgment set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b617 We next evaluate whether TAG\u2019S neglect was excusable, and sufficient to set aside the default judgment. We examine whether the reasons given for the neglect \u201care such that reasonable minds might differ in their conclusions concerning excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Myers v. All West Transport, </em>235 Mont. 233, 236, 766 P.2d 864, 866 (1988), citing <em>U.S. Rubber Co. v. Community Gas &amp; Oil Co., </em>139 Mont. 36, 39, 359 P.2d 375, 376 (1961). We resolve any doubt regarding whether the neglect was excusable in favor of trial on the merits. <em>Myers, </em>235 Mont. at 236, 766 P.2d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">\u00b618 This Court set aside a default judgment in <em>Worstell v. DeVine, </em>135 Mont. 1, 335 P.2d 305 (1959), when counsel mistakenly assumed the date of service of a complaint to be the day his client brought it to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>office. <em>Worstell, </em>135 Mont. at 2-3, 335 P.2d at 306. The clerk of court had entered a default on the twenty-first day after service of process. The defendant promptly moved to set aside the default by filing a motion three days after the court entered the default judgment. This Court found excusable neglect as evidenced by the speed by which the plaintiff s counsel had moved for default on the twenty-first day after service of process, and defense counsel\u2019s lack of complete knowledge that the answer was past due. <em>Worstell, </em>135 Mont. 5, 335 P.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay_\">\u00b619 Grizzly moved for default on the twenty-second day after service of process. Grizzly had an idea that TAG had legal counsel based upon Simmons\u2019 phone message. Grizzly made no attempt to return Simmons\u2019 phone call. Grizzly\u2019s counsel removed Simmons\u2019 name from the certificate of service regarding the notice for entry of default judgment to ensure that TAG would not be aware of the hearing. TAG moved to set aside the default judgment on February 9, 2009. Reasonable minds could differ whether the reasons offered by TAG for its neglect in failing to respond prove sufficient. This difference of opinion tips the balance in favor of trial on the merits. <em>Myers, </em>235 Mont. at 236, 766 P.2d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b620 The Dissent contends that this case \u2018is on all fours factually\u201d with this Court\u2019s decision <em>in Matthews v. Don K. Chevrolet, </em>2005 MT 164, 327 Mont. 456, 115 P.3d 201. \u00b6 30. We disagree. Five former employees of Don K\u2019s had alleged wrongful termination claims against Don K. Matthews\u2019s counsel represented all five employees. Matthews\u2019s counsel sought to consolidate the claims of all of the former employees into one action against Don K. Don K\u2019s counsel opposed Matthews\u2019s request to consolidate the claims. The district court required each former employee to file separate actions. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6 4. Don K\u2019s counsel had advised Matthews\u2019s counsel before Matthews filed his claim that he would be representing Don K in all the individual actions. Don K\u2019s counsel further advised Matthews that he would accept service on behalf of Don K in all of the individual actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b621 Matthews\u2019 s counsel forwarded the summons and complaint, along with an acknowledgement of service, to Don K\u2019s counsel on September 11, 2003. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6 5. This contact did not constitute the first salvo in the litigation as evidenced by the extensive contacts between Matthews\u2019s counsel and Don K\u2019s counsel prior to Matthews filing suit. Don K\u2019s counsel eventually signed and returned the acknowledgment of service on October 14, 2003. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>6.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b622 Don K failed to make an appearance and Matthews obtained a default from the clerk of court on November 7, 2003. Matthews\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>counsel then sent a letter to Don K\u2019s counsel on December 4, 2003, advising him that he had caused a default to be entered against Don K. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>7. Matthews\u2019s counsel further advised Don K that the court had set a hearing for entry of default judgment and damages for December 11, 2003. No one appeared at the hearing on behalf of Don K despite the notice provided by Matthews\u2019 s counsel. The district court entered a judgment against Don K at the conclusion of the hearing. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b623 The district court issued a writ of execution on December 18,2003, that required the sheriff to satisfy the judgment against the property of Don K. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>8. Don K finally appeared on January 7, 2004, when it filed an ex parte motion to stay the writ of execution and to set aside the default and the default judgment. The district court failed to rule on the motion within sixty days and thus was deemed denied pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(c). <em>Matthews, \u00b6 8. </em>This Court affirmed. \u00b624 The Court noted that Matthews\u2019s counsel had provided notice to Don K\u2019s counsel that a default had been entered. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>15. The Court further noted that Matthews\u2019s counsel also had advised Don K\u2019s counsel of the scheduled hearing on Matthews\u2019 s motion for entry of the default judgment. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>15. Don K failed to heed the warnings. The Court determined that Don K\u2019s lack of attention to the complaint after receiving these warnings constituted \u201ca serious disregard of the judicial process,\u201d and could not be considered excusable neglect. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b625 Grizzly provided no similar notice here. In fact, Grizzly\u2019s counsel scratched Simmons\u2019s name off the certificate of service for the notice of the hearing on the entry of default. Grizzly\u2019s counsel opted not to return Simmons\u2019 s telephone call regarding the complaint against TAG. Twenty-seven days elapsed from Grizzly\u2019s service of the complaint and the entry of the default judgment. Matthews\u2019s counsel waited fifty-seven days to seek entry of default. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>6. Matthews\u2019s counsel took the additional step of notifying Don K\u2019s counsel of the hearing on the motion for entry of default judgment. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>7. Don K\u2019s counsel also had extensive contact with Matthews\u2019s counsel regarding the case before Matthews filed suit. We cannot deem TAG\u2019S failure to enter a timely appearance to be on par with the \u201cserious disregard of the judicial process\u201d evidenced by Don K\u2019s counsel that pushed Don K\u2019s inaction beyond the realm of excusable neglect. <em>Matthews, \u00b6 </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b626 We turn to the issue of whether TAG has a meritorious defense sufficient to set aside a default judgment. TAG must present \u201ca prima facie defense.\u201d <em>Blume, </em>242 Mont. at 470, 791 P.2d at 787. TAG asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that the District Court cannot assert personal jurisdiction because TAG lacks sufficient minimum contacts with Montana to warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction. TAG further argues that ASI manufactured the Dodge truck. TAG sold the Ford truck to Grizzly expressly \u201cAs Is.\u201d TAG finally contends that Grizzly failed to mitigate damages and that Grizzly failed to set forth sufficient facts alleging fraud. We need not discuss the merits of TAG\u2019s defenses. <em>Blume, </em>242 Mont. at 470, 791 P.2d at 787. We instead consider whether TAG presents a prima facie defense. TAG\u2019s proposed answer to Grizzly\u2019s claims presents a prima facie defense in light of the issues raised by TAG.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b627  Finally, we evaluate whether TAG would be injured were we to let the default judgment of $130,239.43 stand. This Court held in <em>Blume </em>that allowing a default judgment in the amount of $185,000 to stand, even against a large corporation such as Metropolitan Life Insurance, would affect the corporation adversely. <em>Blume, </em>242 Mont. at 469, 791 P.2d at 787. TAG is a much smaller company than Metropolitan Life Insurance and TAG stands to lose $130,239.43. The default judgment exceeded the cost of repairs of the trucks and it exceeded the sale price of the trucks. It is reasonable to assume that a default judgment of this size would injure TAG in light of the injuries alleged and the value of the trucks in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b628  The District Court slightly abused its discretion by failing to set aside the default judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), in light of these factors. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 17. We reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of TAG\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment. We vacate the default judgment and remand to the District Court to allow TAG to file an answer within twenty days of the date of this opinion. We reiterate the policy that disputes should be resolved on the merits. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b429-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AqX5\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b629 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">\u00b630 This case is on all fours factually with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matthews v. Don K Chevrolet, </em>2005 MT 164, 327 Mont. 456, 115 P.3d 201. In that case, this Court denied setting aside the default judgment when defendant\u2019s counsel attempted to blame his secretary for failing to calendar the time to respond; for misfiling the complaint and summons in another file; and on the basis that his office was in confusion because he was moving offices. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6 13. We rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>these reasons as constituting excusable neglect on the part of defense counsel. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. And, we determined that, on these facts, the trial court did not slightly abuse its discretion in denying Don K Chevrolet\u2019s motion to set aside the entry of default and the default judgment against it. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b631 In the case at bar, counsel for The Armored Group, LLC (TAG) offers excuses which are not substantively different than those proffered in <em>Matthews. </em>Here, counsel claims that at the time he was served with the summons, he was a solo practitioner in the process of merging with another practice to form a new partnership. Counsel states that his office was \u201cin flux.\u201d He also claims that office personnel were preparing and stamping an outgoing mailing announcing the official January 16, 2009 date establishing the new law firm, and that the date stamp was dialed forward to January 16,2009. TAG\u2019s counsel maintains that the office personnel \u2018inadvertently stamped the incorrect receipt date on the Complaint\u201d with the result that TAG\u2019s answer date for the summons was miscalendared. As a result, TAG did not timely answer Grizzly\u2019s summons and complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b632 While the Court seeks to distinguish <em>Matthews </em>from the case at bar factually, the bottom line is that, having been properly served, TAG\u2019s counsel miscalendared his client\u2019s appearance date; neglected to retain Montana counsel until 23 days after his client was served; did nothing aside from leaving one ambiguous message on Grizzly\u2019s counsel\u2019s cell phone; and then sought to blame his office staff for his own carelessness. We have not, heretofore, lowered the bar to accommodate neglectful attorneys such as TAG\u2019s counsel. Rather, we have held that counsel has an independent duty to monitor the litigation and to make sure his client\u2019s answer is timely <em>filed, Profess. Sports v. Nat. Indoor Foot. League, </em>2008 MT 98, \u00b6\u00b6 42-45, 342 Mont. 292, 180 P.3d 1142; that failure to appear due to forgetfulness and the press of other business does not establish excusable neglect, <em>Morris v. Frank Transp. Co., </em>184 Mont. 74, 76, 601 P.2d 698, 699 (1979); and that the neglect of an attorney is attributable to the client, <em>Lords v. Newman, </em>212 Mont. 359, 367-68, 688 P.2d 290, 295 (1984). Today, we ignore these well-established rules, and we create one that rewards this sort of neglect. I would just follow our existing case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b633 I cannot conclude that there is any substantive difference between the facts in <em>Matthews, </em>the cases cited above, and those here. We should follow our precedent and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b634 I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
