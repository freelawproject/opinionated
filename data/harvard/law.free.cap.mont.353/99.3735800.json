The District Court deferred imposition of sentence on each count for one year and ordered that the deferred sentences run consecutively. Essig appeals from conditions imposed on the deferred sentences and from the District Court\u2019s order that the deferred sentences run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"ATH\">\u00b62 We restate the issues raised by Essig as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Did the District Court err in its imposition of restitution for counseling costs of the victims\u2019 children?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in imposing a condition on Essig\u2019s deferred sentences that she is prohibited from owning, possessing, or being in control of any firearms?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\u00b65 Issue 3: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in imposing as a condition of her deferred sentences a prohibition on Essig using or possessing alcoholic beverages or entering establishments where alcohol is the chief item of sale?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">\u00b66 Issue 4: Is the imposition of five deferred misdemeanor sentences which run consecutively an illegal sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">\u00b67 Essig also objects to imposition of restitution for expenses related to acquiring a handgun. The State concedes that these expenses were improperly imposed. Thus, we do not discuss this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b68 In October 2007, Joann Essig was charged with five counts of criminal mischief, one count of misdemeanor stalking, and four counts of felony stalking. In April 2008, pursuant to a plea bargain, Essig pled guilty to four counts of criminal mischief in violation of \u00a745-6-101, MCA, and one count of stalking in violation of \u00a745-5-220(l)(a), MCA, all misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b69 Essig admitted to vandalizing the property of Dwain and Thora Prellwitz by pouring salt on their flower beds and lawn and to stalking the Prellwitzes. Essig pled nolo contendr\u00e9 to two counts of criminal mischief in violation of \u00a745-6-101, MCA. The information containing these latter charges alleged that she killed grass in the Prellwitzs\u2019 yard in the shape of a pentagram and that she painted a pentagram on U.S. Bureau of Land Management premises with Thora Prellwitz\u2019s name in it, using a red substance thought to be animal blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b610 In June 2008, the District Court imposed five consecutive one year deferred sentences. The effect of the judgment is that Essig will be on probation for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b611 Essig\u2019s deferred sentences are, <em>inter alia, </em>conditioned on payment of $5,582.03 in restitution; a prohibition on Essig owning, possessing, or being in control of any firearms; and a prohibition on Essig using or possessing alcoholic beverages or entering establishments where alcohol is the chief item of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s determination of the amount of restitution due as a finding of fact. Findings of fact regarding the amount of restitution ordered as part of a criminal sentence are reviewed to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b613 Sections 46-18-201(4)(o) and 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA, provide that any reasonable restriction considered necessary for rehabilitation or the protection of the victim or society may be imposed as a condition of a suspended or deferred sentence. We review conditions imposed on a probationary sentence under \u00a7\u00a746-18-20l(4)(o) or -202(l)(f), MCA, to determine if they are reasonable. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 13, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164. In <em>Ashby, </em>the Court held that for a condition to be reasonable it must have a nexus to the offender or the offense. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u00b614 In addition to the more general sentencing authority to impose probation conditions granted in \u00a7\u00a746-18-20l(4)(o) and -202(l)(f), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the legislature has specifically authorized the imposition of certain conditions on a probationary sentence when a district court concludes that such condition is necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society. Section 46-18-202(1), MCA. We review for abuse of discretion a sentencing judge\u2019s conclusion that a condition of a probationary sentence, which is specifically authorized by statute, is necessary. An abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>2009 MT 211, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 282, 210 P.3d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1: Did the District Court err in its imposition of restitution for counseling costs of the victims\u2019 children ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b616 Essig contends the District Court erred by ordering her to pay restitution for the counseling expenses of the Prellwitzs\u2019 minor children. Essig asserts the Prellwitz children are not victims as defined by statute. Essig also asserts that the restitution amounts claimed are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b617 Section 45-5-220(3), MCA, provides that a district court sentencing a person convicted of stalking may require the payment of all medical, counseling, and other costs incurred by or on behalf of the victim as a result of the offense. When pecuniary loss is sustained by a victim, \u00a746-18-201(5), MCA, allows a sentencing court to require payment of full restitution. \u2018Victim\u201d within the meaning of this statute includes \u201cany person or entity whom the offender has voluntarily agreed to reimburse as part of a voluntary plea bargain.\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(vi), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b618 In her plea agreement, Essig agreed to pay restitution \u2018for damages or losses and all medical counseling and other costs, caused to the [Prellwitz] family and property.\u201d The District Court had statutory authority to order Essig to pay the counseling expenses of the Prellwitzs\u2019 minor children. Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(vi), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u00b619 Essig also contends that restitution imposed by the District Court for travel expenses to counseling incurred by the Prellwitz children, blood testing for one of the children, and the cost of six memory cards for a digital camera are not within the meaning of \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as described in \u00a746-18-243(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\u00b620 Section 46-18-243(1), MCA, defines pecuniary loss as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">(a) all special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities, including without limitation out-of-pocket losses, such as medical expenses ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">(d) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b621  We conclude that, under the evidence presented to the District Court, these expenses could be recovered in a civil action by the Prellwitzes against Essig and thus, in this case, they are legally imposed as restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b622  Essig argues the amounts imposed for these expenses were not reasonable. The State requested $11,431 in restitution. After hearing testimony from both sides, including Essig\u2019s testimony that many of the expenses were unjustified, the District Court imposed restitution of $5,582.03. The District Court was in the best position to review the evidence and weigh the facts surrounding the claimed expenses. There is evidence in the record concerning the cost of the memory cards, travel, and blood tests. The District Court weighed this evidence and concluded that it supported the inclusion of these items in the restitution amount. The District Court\u2019s determination of the amount of restitution due was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b623 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in imposing a condition on Essig\u2019s deferred sentences that she is prohibited from owning, possessing, or being in control of any firearms?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b624 Essig objected in the District Court to a restriction on her possession and use of firearms. She appeals from the District Court\u2019s imposition of such a restriction as a condition of her deferred sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\u00b625 Section 46-18-202(l)(b), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">(1) The sentencing judge may also impose any of the following restrictions or conditions on the sentence provided for in 46-18-201 that the judge considers necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">(b) prohibition of the offender\u2019s owning or carrying a dangerous weapon[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">\u00b626 The condition on Essig\u2019s suspended sentence at issue here was imposed under the legislative authority of \u00a746-18-202(l)(b), MCA. Thus, the <em>Ashby </em>requirement of a nexus to the offender or to the offense does not apply. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 14-15. Rather, the imposition of this condition is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>McLaughlin, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">\u00b627  The record in this case reflects that several years earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Essig was convicted of a concealed weapons violation. Essig testified that she did not know why she committed the offense of stalking, which is classified as an offense against the person in the nature of an assault. <em>See </em>Title 45, Ch. 5, MCA. Nor did Essig give any reason for her acts of vandalism using a pentagram symbol and what appeared to be blood. Considering the threatening nature of the offenses and that Essig did not explain her acts, the District Court reasoned her access to firearms must be restricted to assure public safety. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that restricting Essig<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> s ownership, possession, and control of firearms was necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b628 <em>Issue 3: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in imposing as a condition of her deferred sentences a prohibition on Essig using or possessing alcoholic beverages or entering establishments where alcohol is the chief item of sale?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b629 Essig contends the condition of her deferred sentences prohibiting her from consuming or possessing alcohol or entering establishments in which alcohol is the chief item of sale is unreasonable. Essig did not object to this condition at sentencing and now asks this Court to invoke plain error review to assess its legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b630 Failure to object to an improper condition at or before sentencing results in a waiver of the right to object to that condition for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Park, </em>2008 MT 429, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 347 Mont. 462, 198 P.3d 321; <em>State v. Baker, </em>2008 MT 396, \u00b6 11, 347 Mont. 159, 197 P.3d 1001; <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966. We have treated probation conditions such as the alcohol restriction involved here as objectionable rather than illegal. <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6 12. As Essig did not object in the District Court to the condition of her deferred sentences prohibiting her from using alcohol or entering establishments in which alcohol is the chief item of sale, we will not now consider Essig\u2019s argument that there is an insufficient nexus between the prohibition on alcohol and her offenses or her self.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b631 Essig also asks us to invoke plain error to review the condition of her deferred sentences prohibiting her use of alcohol. This Court may in its discretion review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made, where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Taylor, </em>2009 MT 161, \u00b6 11, 350 Mont. 447, 208 P.3d 422 (citing <em>State v. Davis, </em>2003 MT 341, \u00b6 19, 318 Mont. 459, 81 P.3d 484). We will not undertake a full analysis whenever a party asserts that an issue not properly preserved for appeal constitutes plain error. Such a scenario would nullify the rule requiring an argument to be preserved for appeal, and allow a party to bring virtually any argument before this Court. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 28, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224). We decline to undertake plain error review of the restriction on the use of alcohol in Essig\u2019s deferred sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b632 <em>Issue 4: Is the imposition of five deferred misdemeanor sentences which run consecutively an illegal </em>sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b633 Essig argues the District Court erred by imposing five consecutive one-year deferred sentences because \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(a)(ii), MCA, provides that a sentencing judge may defer imposition of sentence for no more than two years upon conviction of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b634 Essig pled guilty to five separate misdemeanor offenses. Sentence was deferred for a period of one year on each of these offenses. A deferred sentence constitutes a conviction and a final judgment. <em>State v. Tomaskie, </em>2007 MT 103, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 130, 157 P.3d 691. Separate sentences for two or more offenses run consecutively unless the court otherwise orders. Section 46-18-401(4), MCA. The District Court did not err in specifically ordering that the five separate deferred sentences run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b635 With the exception of the imposition of restitution for expenses related to acquiring a handgun, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed. This case is remanded to the District Court with instruction to vacate the portion of the judgment requiring Essig to make restitution for expenses related to acquiring a handgun.</p>\n<judges id=\"b129-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> The Court\u2019s failure to address the State\u2019s arguments in this regard is perplexing, if not frustrating. In the past, this Court has refused to resolve apparent conflicts in our caselaw on the ground that the State failed to raise and brief the issue adequately. <em>See e.g. State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6 15 &amp; n. 3, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946. Yet here, the State properly raises the conflicting standards of review, briefs the issue, and asks us to resolve the conflict, but the Court ignores the State\u2019s arguments altogether. If this Court\u2019s policy is not to address issues that the parties fail to develop with argument and citation to authority, see M. R. App. P. 12(l)f.; <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 15, then it is unfair and incongruous to ignore such issues when they have been properly raised and briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b129-10\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AFf\">\u00b636 For the reasons explained below, I concur in the Court\u2019s ultimate resolution of Issues 1, 2, and 3 but dissent as to Issue 4. I also write separately to address the State\u2019s arguments regarding our standards of review and conflicting caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\u00b637 I agree that the District Court\u2019s determination of the amount of restitution was not clearly erroneous. Opinion, \u00b6 22. But there is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>to be said about our review of this issue. Specifically, the State points out that we have reviewed the measure of restitution as a question of law in some cases, <em>see e.g. State v. Good, </em>2004 MT 296, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 378, 100 P.3d 644; <em>State v. Mikesell, </em>2004 MT 146, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 462, 91 P.3d 1273, and as a factual matter in other cases, <em>see e.g. State v. Workman, </em>2005 MT 22, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 1, 107 P.3d 462; <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426. The State argues that we should review a district court\u2019s determinations regarding the amount of restitution under the latter approach, and I tend to agree. Of course, whether the district court correctly interpreted the requirements of the restitution statutes is always a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>See State v. Dunning, </em>2008 MT 427, \u00b6 22, 347 Mont. 443, 198 P.3d 828 (\u201cA trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation presents a question of law that we review to determine whether it is correct.\u201d). But any factual findings underlying the restitution award should be reviewed to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b638 The Court apparently agrees, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12,22, but does not acknowledge the cases which stand for a different standard of review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my view, those cases (e.g., <em>Good </em>and <em>Mikesell) </em>should be expressly overruled on this narrow point so as to eliminate any further confusion and inconsistency in our caselaw. The State has properly raised and briefed the conflict, and we should respond accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b639 The State points out that in light of this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164, and <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2008 MT 359, 346 Mont. 366, 195 P.3d 826, It is unclear whether this Court reviews expressly authorized conditions for legality only or for legality and abuse of discretion.\u201d The State also notes that we have articulated two different meanings of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d in relation to sentencing challenges. Under <em>Ashby </em>and <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966, a court abuses its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>if it imposes a condition which lacks a nexus to either the offense or the offender. <em>See Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10,13. But under <em>Nelson, </em>a court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>See Nelson, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b640 The State\u2019s lack of certainty in this regard is not surprising.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-50 (Nelson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Having detailed my disagreement with the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Stiles, </em>I will not repeat those arguments here. I simply note that in the present case, the Court observes that the firearm restriction was imposed under the legislative authority of \u00a746-18-202(l)(b), MCA, and then reviews the restriction for abuse of discretion. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. In so doing, the Court signals that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to such a condition in a future case will preclude our review of that condition on appeal. <em>See Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b641 With respect to the State\u2019s second point, however, the Court applies <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>\u201carbitrariness\u201d definition of \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d as opposed to <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>\u201cnexus\u201d definition, and thus asks whether the District Court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason when it imposed the firearm restriction. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14,26.1 could agree with this approach if it weren\u2019t for the fact that in <em>Stiles, </em>the Court decided that <em>the nexus analysis </em>is what we use to determine whether a district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentencing condition. <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6 13. Given that holding, the Court\u2019s approach here is only bound to create more confusion regarding this Court\u2019s review of sentencing conditions. Indeed, the Attorney General\u2019s office has pointed out that our law in this area is muddled precisely because we have been employing two different definitions of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d when reviewing conditions of sentence. Yet, rather than resolve the inconsistency in accordance with <em>Stiles </em>by applying the nexus test, the Court instead perpetuates and, worse, aggravates the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b642 To begin with, the Court asserts that if the condition was \u201cspecifically authorized by statute,\u201dthen the nexus test does not apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 26. But this proposition resolves nothing, as <em>all </em>conditions of sentence must be \u201cspecifically authorized by statute.\u201d <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, 133 P.3d 206 (\u201cA district court\u2019s authority in sentencing a criminal defendant is defined and constrained by statute, and the court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d). Next, the Court asserts that <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>nexus test does not apply in the present case; rather, \u201cthe imposition of this condition is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 26. But this proposition is self-contradictory, as we have held that sentencing conditions are reviewed for abuse of discretion <em>using the nexus test. Stiles, </em>\u00b6 13. The Court cites <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>2009 MT 211, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 282, 210 P.3d 694, in support of its approach. However, <em>McLaughlin </em>is not even a sentencing case; rather, it involves the admissibility of evidence and jury instructions. <em>See McLaughlin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Lastly, the Court concludes that the District Court did not abuse its discretion because restricting Essig\u2019s ownership, possession, and control of firearms was \u201cnecessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d As we explained in <em>Ashby, </em>however, we use the nexus test to determine whether a condition is \u201cnecessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 14-15; <em>accord Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b643 The Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>2009 MT 341, 353 Mont. 111, 220 P.3d 25, makes matters even worse-and in this regard, I agree with Justice Cotter\u2019s dissent in that case. The Court again asserts that the nexus requirement does not apply to conditions which are \u201cauthorized by statute and rule.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>\u00b6 6. It follows from this that the nexus requirement applies only to conditions that are <em>not </em>authorized by statute and rule. Yet, no such conditions could ever exist. <em>Hicks, </em>\u00b6 41. Thus, the Court appears to render the'nexus requirement a nullity. The Court then goes on to hold that a standard condition adopted by the Department of Corrections (DOC) and imposed by the district court will be reviewed for arbitrariness. <em>Hernandez, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b644 Consequently, if one were to attempt to summarize our review of sentences under <em>Ashby, Stiles, Hernandez, McLaughlin, </em>and the present case, it would be this: All conditions that are authorized by statute or rule, are reviewed under <em>McLaughlin\u2019s </em>arbitrariness standard, and conversely all conditions that are not authorized by statute or rule are reviewed under <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>nexus test. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 26; <em>Hernandez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Furthermore, should the need ever arise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>determine whether a condition is \u201c\u201cnecessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society,\u201d we may employ either of two methods: We may review the condition under McLaughlin\u2019s arbitrariness standard, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14,26-27, orwemay review it for compliance with <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>nexus requirement, <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. It appears that the choice is ours to make on an ad hoc basis. Or, perhaps now we have three layers of analysis: first, legality; second arbitrariness; third, nexus. If the Attorney General was unclear before, he will certainly be baffled now.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b645 This state of affairs is untenable. Prior to rendering our decision in <em>Ashby, </em>we spent months deliberating how we would review conditions of sentence. We settled on the nexus requirement for all conditions. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9,15. The Court subsequently clarified in <em>Stiles </em>that the approach articulated in <em>Ashby </em>\u201ceffectively places the nexus analysis under the second inquiry-whether the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6 13. The Court\u2019s decisions here and in <em>Hernandez, </em>however, render the future application of the nexus test uncertain. The Court has set us back at square one and, moreover, has created a situation in which sentencing courts and DOC have unfettered discretion to impose whatever conditions they want and this Court may pick and choose whatever standard it wants to employ in reviewing those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b646 Section 46-18-202(1), MCA, requires all of the conditions listed in subsections (l)(a) through (l)(f)-including the firearm restriction authorized by subsection (l)(b)-feo be \u201cnecessary\u201dfor rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society. The Court held in <em>Stiles </em>that the abuse of discretion prong of our two-pronged standard of review (1. legality + 2. abuse of discretion) requires application of the nexus test to conditions imposed under subsection (l)(f). <em>See Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. I see no reason, and the Court offers none, for adopting a different meaning of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d for conditions imposed under subsection (l)(b). The nexus requirement is intended to apply to all conditions a court imposes upon a sentence. It is easily understood, and we have ample caselaw interpreting and applying the requirement. For sake of clarity, we should use that test and not manufacture different definitions of \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d for purposes of reviewing different sentencing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b647 Turning now to the merits of Issue 2, Essig has shown herself to be impulsive, vengeful, and a loose cannon. She is very familiar with firearms and was convicted of a concealed-weapons offense sever\u00e1l years ago. And I agree with the Court that the instant offenses were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of a \u201cthreatening nature.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 27. Thus, I would hold that there is a nexus between the firearm restriction on one hand, and Essig herself and the circumstances of her offenses on the other. The record fully supports the District Court\u2019s determination that restricting Essig\u2019s possession and use of firearms is \u201cnecessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b648 Essig attempts to invoke <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979), and this Court\u2019s inherent power of plain error review, <em>see State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 23, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683, in order to obtain review of the alcohol condition to which she did not object in the District Court. Yet, Essig fails to make a \u201cplausible\u201d allegation that under existing law, this condition is illegal for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes. <em>See State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 18, 335 Mont. 344,151 P.3d 892. Likewise, with respect to plain error review, Essig fails to make the required \u201cthreshold showing\u201d that our failing to review the alcohol condition \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>See West, </em>\u00b6 23. For these reasons, I agree with the Court\u2019s decision not to review this condition under either of these exceptions to the timely-objection rule. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b649 Lastly, I maintain the view that sentencing courts do not have the authority to stack deferred impositions of sentence. <em>See Ingersoll v. State, </em>1999 MT 215, \u00b6\u00b6 23-30, 295 Mont. 520, 986 P.2d 403 (Nelson, Trieweiler, &amp; Hunt, JJ., dissenting). Thus, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion under Issue 4 that the District Court did not err in ordering Essig1 s five deferred sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u00b650 For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-9\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the Concurrence and Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> Prior to <em>Stiles, </em>we used the nexus test to review a sentencing condition for legality and the arbitrariness test to review the condition for abuse of discretion. <em>See Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-37 (Nelson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>State v.
