Upon learning of the District Court\u2019s action, Wilder filed a Rule 60(b)(4) motion for relief from the order. The District Court did not rule on the motion and it was denied by operation of law. Wilder appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue: Did the District Court err by failing to provide notice to Wilder, an assertedly \u2018interested person,\u201d and conduct a hearing on the conservator\u2019s request to remove Wilder as a TOD beneficiary on the protected person\u2019s investment account?</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b63 On August 28, 2007, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), Adult Protective Services, received a referral concerning 101-year-old Lucille Anderson (Lucille). The referral alleged undue influence and financial exploitation by Wilder, Lucille\u2019s second cousin and caretaker. An investigation by DPHHS revealed questionable financial transactions, and on September 19, 2007, the District Court approved the commencement of guardianship and conservatorship proceedings, appointing DPHHS as temporary guardian and T. Kai Lee (Lee) as temporary conservator for Lucille. The District Court also appointed attorney Louis Villemez (Villemez) to represent Lucille in the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. On November 7, 2007, the District Court dismissed the guardianship as no longer necessary, but continued the conservatorship, issuing Letters of Conservatorship to Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">\u00b64 The District Court set a hearing for December 5, 2007, to receive an initial accounting of the conservatorship and Lee\u2019s conservatorship report. Neither Wilder nor her attorney was provided notice of the hearing. Villemez and Lee were the only persons present at the hearing. Lee presented her report to the District Court, detailing questionable transfers from Lucille\u2019s accounts to Wilder and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>naming of Wilder as the TOD beneficiary on Lucille\u2019s Edward Jones &amp; Co. investment account. The report stated that, in the spring of 2007, Wilder had transported Lucille to an Edwards Jones office to name Wilder as the beneficiary on Lucille\u2019s account. The broker related to Lee that Lucille appeared to be under some duress, and that Lucille had expressed concern that Wilder would be upset if she did not designate her as beneficiary on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b65 Lee and Villemez advised the District Court that Lucille desired to remove Wilder as the TOD beneficiary of her Edward Jones account, but that Edward Jones had asked for a court order to effectuate the change. Both Lee and Villemez requested the District Court issue an order removing Wilder as the TOD beneficiary of the investment account. The District Court was reluctant, asking \u2018isn\u2019t it very similar to an issue regarding a will, whether she had the competency to make a declaration by naming Laurie Wilder as a beneficiary, and don\u2019t I need to have a hearing on that? ... I mean, I don\u2019t have a problem staying it until we have a hearing.\u201d In response, Lee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">[A]s full Conservator, I have the powers to do exactly what Lucille would have done. I have control over her finances with or without her consent. I don\u2019t need to act in any way, as long as I\u2019m acting in her best interests; and the only reason I\u2019m asking for the court order is because Edward Jones requested it. They will not change the transfer on death beneficiary designation without a court order. I don\u2019t think you need to make any findings regarding her capacity. It\u2019s my understanding, from reading the conservatorship statutes, that I don\u2019t even need to ask for permission to change her accounts. I doubt I could change her Will at this point, but I can change her accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b66 Lee and Villemez persuaded the District Court and, on December 7, 2007, without notice or hearing on that issue, the court entered an order removing Wilder as the TOD beneficiary of Lucille\u2019s investment accounts. Lucille died on March 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b67 On September 2, 2008, Wilder filed a motion under Rule 60(b)(4), M. R. Civ. P., seeking relief from the order, on the ground that the District Court did not provide her notice as an \u2018interested person\u201d or hold a hearing. The motion was not ruled upon within 60 days and was therefore deemed denied. Rule 60(c), M. R. Civ. P. Wilder appeals. Lucille\u2019s Conservatorship remains open, pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b68 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) depends on the nature of the final judgment, order, or proceeding from which relief is sought and the specific basis of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Barnes, </em>251 Mont. 334, 336, 825 P.2d 201, 203 (1992)). We generally review a district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. Essex, \u00b6 16; <em>see Heller v. Gremaux, </em>2002 MT 199, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 178, 53 P.3d 1259; <em>Hall v. Heckerman, </em>2000 MT 300, \u00b6 12, 302 Mont. 345, 15 P.3d 869. However, where the movant seeks relief under Rule 60(b)(4), on the ground that the judgment is void, we review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo, as the determination that a judgment is or is not void is a conclusion of law. <em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Export Group v. Reef Indus., Inc., </em>54 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir. 1995) (\u2018We review de novo ... a district court\u2019s ruling upon a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a judgment as void, because the question of the validity of a judgment is a legal one.\u2019)); <em>see Hicklin v. CSC Logic, Inc., </em>283 Mont. 298, 301, 940 P.2d 447, 449 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err by failing to provide notice to Wilder, an assertedly \u2018Interested person,\u201d and conduct a hearing on the conservator\u2019s request to remove Wilder as a TOD beneficiary on the protected person\u2019s investment account?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b610 Wilder contends that the District Court erred in removing her as the TOD beneficiary of Lucille\u2019s Edward Jones investment account because neither the District Court nor Lucille\u2019s conservator possessed the authority to remove her as a TOD beneficiary, and Wilder was not provided notice as an \u2018interested person.\u201d We begin with the authority of the conservator and the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b611 A conservatorship may be established when a person is \u201cunable to manage his property and affairs effectively for reasons such as mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, [or] advanced age,\u201d or if property \u201cwill be wasted or dissipated unless proper management is provided ....\u201d Section 72-5-409(2)(a) and (b), MCA (2005); <em>In re Estate of Clark, </em>237 Mont. 179, 183, 772 P.2d 299, 301 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b612 Section 72-5-421(5), MCA, provides that, \u201c[a]n order ... determining that a basis for appointment of a conservator or other protective order exists, has no effect on the capacity of the protected person.\u201d Applying the statute, this Court has held that appointment of a conservator to protect an individual\u2019s property does not equate to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>adjudication of incompetency. <em>Stave v. Estate of Rutledge, </em>2005 MT 332, \u00b6 19, 330 Mont. 28, 127 P.3d 365 (TT]he fact that a conservator has been appointed does not mean that a protected person lacks the capacity to make certain decisions, including executing a will.\u201d (citing <em>In re Estate of West, </em>269 Mont. 83, 95, 887 P.2d 222, 229 (1994); <em>In re Estate of Prescott, </em>2000 MT 200, \u00b6 47, 300 Mont. 469, 8 P.3d 88; \u00a772-5-421(5), MCA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b613 Because the appointment of a conservatorship does not declare that a protected person is incompetent, the protected person may, if otherwise able, make testamentary dispositions, including removing or changing beneficiaries to insurance policies, as well as annuity and investment accounts. <em>See In re Estate of Oliver, </em>934 P.2d 144, 148 (Kan. 1997) (conservatee\u2019s changes to payable on death certificates of deposit valid); <em>Campbell v. Black, </em>844 P.2d 759, 762 (Kan. 1993) (\u2018The authority of a conservatee to make testamentary dispositions includes the authority to change POD beneficiaries.\u201d (citing <em>Union Natl. Bank of Wichita v. Mayberry, </em>533 P.2d 1303, 1307 (Kan. 1975))).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b614 During these proceedings, Lucille was not adjudged to be incompetent, and her guardianship proceeding was dismissed. The order appointing a conservator for Lucille did not itself prohibit her from making testamentary dispositions, including changing the TOD beneficiary designation of her Edward Jones account, without a court order, if she was able to do so. It was likewise permissible, as Lee argues, for Lucille to enlist the aid of her attorney in accomplishing this objective. However, when Lucille and her attorney were unable to accomplish the task, they turned for assistance to the Conservator and the District Court, who could act with regard to Lucille\u2019s estate only in the manner authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b615 The conservator is a fiduciary, \u00a772-5-423, MCA, and her duties and powers are enumerated at \u00a772-5-427, MCA, et seq. The statutes authorize a conservator to act without court approval in various ways, including collecting, holding and retaining estate assets, receiving additions to the estate, making ordinary or extraordinary repairs to property, or entering into leases. Section 72-5-427(3)(a)-(y), MCA. The conservator \u201cmust administer the estate as would the court if administering it directly, that is, for the benefit of the protected person.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>237 Mont. at 183, 772 P.2d at 302. However, a conservator\u2019s authority is not unlimited. It is circumscribed by the statutory provisions requiring certain transactions on behalf of the protected person, or conservatee, to be approved by the court. Before the District Court, Conservator Lee contended that she had \u201ccontrol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>over [the conservatee\u2019s] finances with or without her consent [and can] change her accounts.\u201d As explained below, this assessment was overbroad. Lee did not possess the statutory authority to unilaterally change the TOD beneficiary on Lucille\u2019s investment account. Court approval was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b616 District courts are vested with broad management powers over a conservatorship, possessing \u201call the powers over [the person\u2019s] estate and affairs which he could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will.\u201d Section 72-5-421(3), MCA. More specifically, the statute also provides that Tt]hese powers include <em>but are not limited to </em>[the] power to:... (g) exercise [the person\u2019s] rights to elect options and <em>change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity </em>policies.\u201dSection 72-5-421(3)(g), MCA (emphasis added). This provision provides examples of the district court\u2019s powers in a conservatorship, and by the but \u2018hot limited to\u201d language, indicates this list of powers is not exhaustive or limited to those which are expressly enumerated. We see no substantive distinction between changing a beneficiary designation under a conservatee\u2019s insurance policy, as enumerated in the statute, and changing a TOD beneficiary under an investment account, such as at issue here. Given the statute\u2019s contemplation of additional powers of the district court, and the similar function at issue, the District Court possessed the power to remove or change the beneficiary designation under Lucille\u2019s investment account.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b617 As other courts have explained, intervention by the court is required to change a conservatee\u2019s beneficiary designation because the \u201cconservator is not the alter ego of the conservatee and the decision to ... change a beneficiary is a purely personal elective right of the conservatee.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Briley, </em>825 P.2d 1181, 1184 (Kan. 1992) (collecting cases); <em>Mayberry, </em>533 P.2d at 1308 (\u2018the right to change the beneficiary in a life insurance policy owned by the ward remains a personal right of the insured over which the guardian has no power\u201d); <em>Citizens St. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Hiawatha v. Nolte, </em>601 P.2d 1110, 1114 (Kan. 1979) (\u2018It is not [the conservator\u2019s] function, nor that of the probate court supervising the conservatorship, to control disposition of the conservatee\u2019s property after death.\u2019]).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b618 However, to enter such an order, a district court must follow the statutory procedures which govern the exercise of this power. A district court may \u201cchange beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies, only if satisfied, <em>after notice and hearing, </em>that it is in the best interests of the protected person and that [the protected person] either is incapable of consenting or has consented to the proposed exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>power.\u201d Section 72-5-421(4), MCA (emphasis added). The District Court was thus required to hold a hearing and determine whether such a change in the TOD beneficiary was in Lucille\u2019s best interest, and whether Lucille was incapable of consenting or had consented to the proposed exercise of power. Section 72-5-422(4), MCA; <em>see In re Estate of Leone, </em>860 P.2d 973, 977 (Utah 1993) (\u2018Thus, under [the statute], the court may change a protected person\u2019s life insurance beneficiaries after the court holds a hearing to determine the best interests of the protected person.\u201d); <em>Grahl v. Davis, </em>971 S.W.2d 373, 378 (Tenn. 1998) (\u201c[T]he conservator must petition the court, and the court, on behalf of the conservatee, can exercise such an election if it is clearly proven to be in the best interests of the conservatee.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b619 Here, the District Court did not conduct a hearing to determine whether the beneficiary change to Lucille\u2019s investment account was in her best interests, and whether she had consented to the change or was incapable of consenting. It may well be, as Lee argues, that the beneficiary change was what Lucille desired, that she was capable of consenting to the change, and that it was in her best interest. However, no evidence was presented, and the District Court entered no factual findings to that effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b620 Whether this error by the District Court requires reversal depends upon whether Appellant Wilder was prejudiced or harmed by it. This leads to her argument that, as a TOD beneficiary, she was an \u2018interested person\u201d who was entitled to notice of a hearing to consider removing her as beneficiary. Because the statute required the District Court to hold a hearing and provide notice to \u2018Interested persons,\u201d we must determine whether Wilder, as a TOD beneficiary of Lucille\u2019s investment account, was an \u2018Interested person\u201d as defined under \u00a772-1-103(25), MCA, who was entitled to notice of the proceeding under \u00a7\u00a7 72-1-301, 72-5-403(2), or 72-5-404, MCA, the probate and conservatorship notice provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b621 By these statutes, notice must be given to any \u2018interested person\u201d of a hearing regarding the protected person, as well as to any \u2018interested person\u201d who has specifically requested notice. Sections 72-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>1-301,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 72-5-403(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, and 72-5-404<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, MCA. In turn, Interested person\u201d is defined by \u00a772-1-103(25), MCA, to include \u2018heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent, ward, or protected person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b622 We previously interpreted this statutory definition of\u2018interested person\u201d in <em>In re Estate of Miles v. Miles, </em>2000 MT 41, 298 Mont. 312, 994 P.2d 1139. We concluded that \u201cthe correct interpretation of the statute is that heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others, <em>each have to have a property right in </em>or claim against the estate to be considered \u2018interested persons.\u2019\u2019\u2019MiZes, \u00b6 46 (emphasis added). In <em>Miles, </em>the decedent\u2019s children, denominated \u2018Heirs,\u201d were entitled to half of all insurance proceeds by virtue of a provision in the decedent\u2019s will. The decedent also owned an annuity contract which terminated on the decedent\u2019s death and paid out any remaining funds to his estate. Upon the decedent\u2019s death, the Heirs claimed they were likewise entitled to half of the annuity contract, given its similarity to insurance proceeds. After concluding that an annuity contract could not be considered insurance proceeds for this purpose, we further concluded that the Heirs had \u2018ho property right in or claim against the estate, thus they [were] not interested persons\u201d under \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, and accordingly had no standing to challenge the estate\u2019s administration. <em>Miles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-14, 41-46. In so holding, we <em>rejected </em>the Heirs\u2019 assertion that the statutory language-and any others having a property right [] or claim\u201d-meant that the others listed in the statutory definition of\u2018interested person,\u201d such as \u201cdevisees, children, spouses, creditors and beneficiaries,\u201d did not need to have a property right in order to be an \u2018interested person\u201d under the statute. <em>Miles, </em>\u00b6 44-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00b623 <em>Miles </em>thus makes clear that the beneficiary must have <em>\u201ca </em>property right in or claim against\u201d the estate to qualify as an \u2018interested person.\u201d As we have previously explained, an \u201con death\u201d designation in either POD or TOD form does not create a present property right or interest in the designated beneficiary until the account owner is deceased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">A P.O.D. designation provides that the beneficiary receives an interest in the CD <em>only at the death of the depositor. </em>See Official Comments to \u00a7\u00a772-6-211 and 213, MCA, Annotations. The P.O.D. certificate of deposit is akin to an insurance policy -the proceeds cannot be claimed by the beneficiary until death. At any time before the depositor\u2019s death, the depositor can change the beneficiary or withdraw the account and use the funds. However, the P.O.D. beneficiary has no such right. See Official Comments to \u00a7\u00a772-6-211 and 213, MCA, Annotations. Therefore, a P.O.D. designation does <em>not </em>entitle the beneficiary to a <em>present </em>interest in the CDs ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>In re Estate of Lahren, </em>268 Mont. 284, 288, 886 P.2d 412, 414 (1994) (emphasis in original). Section 72-6-306, MCA, provides that Tt]he designation of a TOD beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form <em>has no effect on ownership until the owner\u2019s </em>death.\u201d(Emphasis added.) A beneficiary designation \u201cmay be canceled or changed at any time\u201dby the owner. Section 72-6-306, MCA. The California Supreme Court has explained that \u2018It]he interest of a beneficiary designated by an insured who has the right to change the beneficiary is, like that of a legatee under a will, a mere expectancy of a gift at the time of the insured\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Grimm v. Grimm, </em>157 P.2d 841, 842-43 (Cal. 1945) (citations omitted); <em>see Feely v. Lacey, </em>133 Mont. 283, 297, 322 P.2d 1104, 1111 (1958) (where the owner has the right to change the beneficiary, the beneficiary has a mere expectancy).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b624 The statute at issue here may be contrasted with \u00a772-l-103(3)(a), MCA, wherein the Legislature provided that a <em>trust beneficiary </em>includes those who have \u201cany present or future interest, vested or contingent.\u201d The Legislature thus accorded \u2018interested person\u201d status to beneficiaries of a trust who only possess a future or contingent interest, or those whose rights have not yet vested. <em>See also Mayer v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Son, </em>555 S.E.2d 406, 409 (S.C. 2001) (interpreting the Probate Code to afford \u201ccontingent remaindermen standing to pursue actions involving \u2018alleged misconduct of a fiduciary, in connection with the creation, administration and depletion of trusts,\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)). The Legislature did not accord such status to beneficiaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of a POD or TOD account which is not part of a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b625  Thus, Wilder did not qualify as an \u2018interested person\u201d under \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, for purposes of a conservatorship hearing, because she did not possess a present property right or interest in Lucille\u2019s investment account while Lucille was alive, in accord with <em>Miles. </em>Neither did she have a \u201cclaim\u201d against Lucille\u2019s estate, as she had no present interest to protect. Wilder would have qualified as an \u2018interested person\u201d under \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, as a beneficiary of Lucille\u2019s TOD investment account only if she had possessed a present property right or interest in the account. Because Wilder had no present property right or interest when Lee sought the District Court\u2019s order to change the beneficiary designation on Lucille\u2019s investment account, Wilder was not an \u2018interested person\u201d entitled to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b626  Just as Wilder would have had no standing to be heard or to present objections to her removal as beneficiary if Lucille had changed the investment account on her own, neither did Wilder have standing to object to Lucille\u2019s conservator\u2019s request that the District Court order the beneficiary change while Lucille was alive. <em>Miles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-47 (because the Heirs had no property right in or claim against the estate, the Heirs were not \u2018interested persons\u201d and therefore had \u2018ho standing\u201d). Wilder had no property interest, had no claim, was not an \u2018interested person\u201d under the statute, and was not entitled to notice of the December 5,2007 hearing. Although Wilder makes a very brief due process argument, her authorities fail to support her argument because she has established no property interest mandating constitutional protection. Lucille could have removed Wilder as the account TOD beneficiary at any time, without notice, and so could the conservator, upon the court\u2019s approval after a hearing.
