Because we reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that notice was not required to be given to Chavez, which is dispositive, we will not address the second issue. Thus, we restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by concluding that an occupant of the property was not entitled to notice prior to the issuance of a tax deed?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b64 Terry and her brother, Theodore Dana Tonn (Theodore), each took an undivided one-half interest as tenants in common for property located on Lots 18,19, and 20 in Block 6 of the Leighton and Garlock\u2019s Addition to the City of Miles City, Montana (the Property). Both Terry and Theodore received their interests in the Property by deed of distribution in 1985 from the personal representative of the Estate of Theodore A. Tonn.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b65 After Terry and Theodore received the Property, various transactions occurred, but as pertinent to this appeal, the taxes on the Property went unpaid for several years and Certain paid the delinquent taxes on August 8, 2007, totaling $23,104.73. The Custer County Treasurer then issued and assigned tax sale certificates to Certain. On August 23, 2007, Certain mailed notice of the pending issuance of a tax deed to all interested parties, including Terry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Certain did not send notice to Chavez, a current occupant of the Property throughout this period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A tax deed was issued to Certain on October 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b66 On November 1, 2007, Certain filed an action to quiet title to the Property, naming Terry and other parties as defendants. Later, Certain learned that Chavez also occupied the Property, and on March 28,2008, Certain filed a motion to amend the complaint to add Chavez, which the District Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u00b67 Certain, claiming no notice of a tax deed was required for Chavez, moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted Certain\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>motion, concluding that notice to Chavez was not required, and that this Court\u2019s analysis to the contrary in <em>Gentry Mont. Enters., Inc. v. McDonald, </em>2004 MT 322, 324 Mont. 67, 101 P.3d 767 was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b68 Terry and Chavez appeal the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b69 This Court reviews appeals from district court summary judgment rulings <em>de novo. Erler v. Creative Fin. &amp; Invs., L.L.C., </em>2009 MT 36, \u00b6 16, 349 Mont. 207, 203 P.3d 744 (citing <em>May v. ERA Landmark Real Estate of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 299, \u00b6 17, 302 Mont. 326, 15 P.3d 1179). \u2018We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment to determine whether it was correctly decided pursuant to Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P., which provides that summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Erler, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>May, </em>\u00b6 17). When reviewing a district court\u2019s legal conclusions, we review them for correctness. <em>Erler, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Palmer v. Bahm, </em>2006 MT 29, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 105, 128 P.3d 1031).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err by concluding that an occupant of the property was not entitled to notice prior to the issuance of a tax deed?</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b611 Chavez argues the District Court erred by concluding no notice was required to be given to him as a current occupant of the Property prior to the Custer County Treasurer\u2019s issuance of a tax deed. Chavez bases his argument on our holding in <em>Gentry </em>that a tax deed is void unless the current occupant receives such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b612 The tax deed notice statute at issue, \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA (2005), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">(1) Not more than 60 days prior to and not more than 60 days following the expiration of the redemption period provided in 15-18-111, a notice must be given as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">(a) for each property for which there <em>has been issued to the county </em>a tax lien sale certificate or for which the county is otherwise listed as the purchaser or assignee, the county clerk <em>shall notify all persons considered interested parties in the property and the current occupant </em>of the property, if any, that a tax deed may be issued to the county unless the property tax lien is redeemed prior to the expiration date of the redemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>period; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">(b) for each property for which there has been issued a tax lien sale certificate <em>to a purchaser other than the county </em>or for which an assignment has been made, the purchaser or assignee, as appropriate, <em>shall notify all persons considered interested parties in the property, </em>if any, that a tax deed will be issued to the purchaser or assignee unless the property tax lien is redeemed prior to the expiration date of the redemption period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">(Emphasis added.) Subsection 212(l)(a), which applies when the \u201ccounty\u201d receives the tax deed, requires notice be given to both an \u201cinterested person\u201d and the \u201ccurrent occupant.\u201d Subsection 212(l)(b), which applies when a purchaser \u201cother than the county\u201d receives a tax deed, requires notice be given only to \u2018interested parties\u201d-not a current occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b613 The question is whether notice was required to be given to Chavez. Were the above-quoted subsections the only applicable statutory language, the answer would be simple: no notice is required to be given to a \u201ccurrent occupant\u201d when the purchaser was someone \u201cother than the county,\u201d as provided in subsection 212(l)(b). However, an internal conflict in the statute is created by subsection 212(4), which requires additional analysis. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\"><em>The notice required under subsections (1) </em>[inclusive of 212(l)(a) and 212(l)(b)] ... <em>must be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each interested party and the current occupant, if any, of the property. </em>The address to which the notice must be sent is, for each interested party, the address disclosed by the records in the office of the county clerk and, for the occupant, the street address or other known address of the subject property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Section 15-18-212(4), MCA (emphasis added). In contrast to 212(l)(b), 212(4) provides that notice must be given to both \u201ceach interested party\u201d and \u201ccurrent occupant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00b614 We interpreted this statute in <em>Gentry. </em>Gentry Montana Enterprises, Inc. (Gentry), purchased improvements made on United States Forest Service land. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 6. In 1998, Flathead County assessed taxes against the improvements, but the taxes went delinquent. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 7. When no one purchased the tax lien, Flathead County purchased the property. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 7. Flathead County assigned its interest in the property to McDonald in April of 1998. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 7. In May of 1998, McDonald provided notice of the pending issuance of a tax deed to interested parties, but he did not provide notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Gentry, the current occupant. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 8. In August of 1998, Flathead County issued a tax deed to McDonald. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 9. McDonald sought to quiet title, and, on August 6, 1999, the district court entered a decree granting McDonald fee simple title to the improvements. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 10. Gentry sought to void the decree because McDonald failed to provide notice as required by \u00a715-18-212, MCA. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 10. \u00b615 McDonald proceeded by giving notice pursuant to 212(l)(b). While analyzing 212(l)(b), we read 212(4) in conjunction with 212(l)(b), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\">[Ijnterestingly, [212(l)(b)] does not require notice to be given to current occupants, although that language appears in subsection [212](l)(a). However, regardless of this discrepancy, we note here that [212(4)] states both clearly and explicitly that the notice required under subsection [212](1) - inclusive of subsections (a) and (b) - must be made to each interested party and the current occupant. Further, we have held that \u201c[e]very essential and material step required by the tax deed statues must be strictly followed,\u201d given that an owner risks losing his or her property for a \u201cmere pittance,\u201d should these statutes not be followed strictly. <em>Moran v. Robbin </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 478, 482-83,863 P.2d 395, 397-98. To that end, we conclude that McDonald was mandated by statute to give Gentry notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 25 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b616 Here, the District Court concluded that our analysis in <em>Gentry </em>was incorrect, reasoning that subsection 212(4) prescribes only the form of the required notice, whereas subsections 212(l)(a) and 212(l)(b) designate and control to whom notice must be provided. Although we believe the District Court provided an alternatively viable interpretation of the statute, we stand behind the interpretation we reached in <em>Gentry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b617 Statutes sometimes fall short of providing clear and consistent direction, and Tw]here there are several provisions or particulars, such construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Here, subsection 212(4) undoubtedly prescribes the form of the required notice, but it also provides additional language addressing the persons to whom notice must be provided. The Legislature could have crafted subsection 212(4) to state that \u2018It]he notice required under subsections (1) and (2) must be made by certified mail, return receipt requested\u201d and ended the sentence there. However, it continued, and by adding \u2018to each interested party and the current occupant\u201d at the end of the sentence, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>effectively inserted into subsection 212(l)(b) a requirement that notice be given to an occupant of the property. In <em>Gentry, </em>we harmonized these provisions by giving effect to this additional language in subsection 212(l)(b), which required notice to be given to the occupant. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b618 Since <em>Gentry </em>was decided in 2004, the Legislature has not revised this statute in response to this Court\u2019s interpretation. The Legislature is presumed to know this Court\u2019s interpretations of its statutes. <em>Sampson v. Natl. Farmers Union Prop. and Cas. Co., </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 541, 144 P.3d 797 (citing <em>Baitis v. Dept. of Revenue of St., </em>2004 MT 17, \u00b6 24, 319 Mont. 292, 83 P.3d 1278). If the Legislature had disagreed with this Court\u2019s interpretation, the Legislature could have revised the statute. <em>See St. v. Kirkbride, </em>2008 MT 178, \u00b6 21, 343 Mont. 409, 185 P.3d 340. We presume the Legislature approved of our decision in <em>Gentry </em>because it did not amend the statute in response to our interpretation. <em>Kirkbride, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Sampson, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b619 As we have explained about the cardinal doctrine of <em>stare decisis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">[Principles of law should be positively and definitely settled in order that courts[,] lawyers, and, above all, citizens may have some assurance that important legal principles involving their highest interests shall not be changed from day to day, with the resultant disorders that of necessity must accrue from such changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\"><em>St. ex rel. Sparling v. Hitsman, </em>99 Mont. 521, 525, 44 P.2d 747, 749 (1935). Although <em>stare decisis </em>is not a rigid doctrine that forecloses the reexamination of cases when necessary, \u201cweighty considerations underlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>2008 MT 240, \u00b6 39, 344 Mont. 445, 188 P.3d 1042 (quoting <em>Moragne v. Sts. Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 403, 90 S. Ct. 1772, 1789 (1970)). Faced with viable alternatives, <em>stare decisis </em>provides the \u201cpreferred course.\u201d <em>Kirkbride, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting Payne <em>v. Tenn., </em>501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 2609 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b620 Finally, as we noted in <em>Gentry, </em>Montana follows the policy that \u2018te]very essential and material step\u201d within \u2018the tax deed statutes must be strictly followed.\u201d <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Moran, </em>261 Mont. at 482-83, 863 P.2d at 397-98). If a mistake is made, then the tax deed is void. <em>Gentry, </em>\u00b6 34 (citing <em>Moran, </em>261 Mont. at 483, 863 P.2d at 398); <em>Spain-Morrow Ranch, Inc. v. West, </em>264 Mont. 441, 447, 872 P.2d 330, 334 (1994); <em>Sanders v. Yellowstone Co., </em>276 Mont. 116, 121-22, 915 P.2d 196, 199 (1996) <em>(citing Moran, </em>261 Mont. at 483, 863 P.2d at 400).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00b621 Certain argues that <em>Gentry </em>is distinguishable because Gentry had a right of redemption, while Chavez does not. However, \u00a715-18-111(1), MCA, provides that \u201credemption of a property tax lien acquired at a tax lien sale or otherwise may be made by the owner, the holder of an unrecorded or improperly recorded interest, <em>the occupant of the property, </em>or any interested party ....\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Thus, as an occupant of the property, Chavez had the same right of redemption as Gentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b622  We hold that notice of issuance of a tax deed is required for both an \u2018interested party\u201d and a \u201ccurrent occupant\u201d under subsection 212(4). Failure to provide such notice to Chavez renders the tax deed issued by Custer County void. We reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-11\"> The notice was provided pursuant to the 2005 version of \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA, which was in effect at that time.
