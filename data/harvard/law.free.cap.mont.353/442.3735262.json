Brown (collectively Browns), appeal the judgment and related orders of the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Hill County, in favor of Klabzuba Oil &amp; Gas and Klabzuba Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. (collectively Klabzubas). Klabzubas cross-appeal the court\u2019s decision to reduce sanctions against Browns from $1.4 million to $94,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">\u00b62 This appeal represents the second trip for these parties to this Court. The parties litigated the first suit on very similar issues in 2000 before then District Court Judge John Warner <em>(Browns I). </em>We affirmed the district court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust on Browns. <em>Textana v. Klabzuba, </em>2003 MT 157N, 316 Mont. 532, 77 P.3d 551.

We review the following ten issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court properly refuse to dismiss Klabzubas\u2019 counterclaims regarding the Starcher claims based on statute of limitations grounds?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court properly award a 12.5 percent interest in the Starcher claims to a non-party?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court properly refuse Browns\u2019 evidence of their costs in developing the Starcher claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court properly instruct the jury on punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Browns\u2019 2 percent ORR claims as barred by res judicata?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Browns\u2019 interest claims where Klabzubas withheld, but later paid, production revenues due to Browns?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court properly deny sanctions against Klabzubas based on alleged false statements by their counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court properly award attorney fees against Browns without first holding a hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court properly allow Klabzubas to double-count interest on the judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b613 <em>Should the District Court\u2019s first sanctions order be reinstated and the cause remanded for entry of additional attorney fees to Klabzubas?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u00b614 J. Burns Brown and his son, John O. Brown, worked together in the oil and gas industry in north central Montana. J. Burns Brown and Robert Klabzuba began collaborating in 1974 to lease and develop oil and gas fields. John O. Brown and Robert Klabzuba entered into a written contract for professional services (PSC) in 1976 with a primary term of one year. John O. Brown agreed to perform landman and other services in support of Robert Klabzubas\u2019 business of exploring oil and gas reserves, drilling wells, and producing oil and gas. John O. Brown received a salary and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\u00b615 The PSC required John O. Brown to investigate opportunities in the Havre area and to present the opportunities to Robert Klabzuba. The PSC required John O. Brown to assign to Robert Klabzuba a 75 percent interest in all leases. The PSC further provided that John O. Brown and his father, J. Burns Brown, had the option to participate up to 25 percent by paying a proportionate share of the acquisition costs for the land and development costs of the wells. The PSC also entitled Browns to a 2 percent overriding royalty (ORR) on production revenues on all oil and gas leases obtained by Browns and assigned to Klabzubas. The parties entered into a similar PSC each year through 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">\u00b616 Klabzubas, who were headquartered in Texas, would conduct the geological analysis and identify areas desirable for oil and gas leasing. Klabzubas provided their confidential analysis of the results to Browns, who would then negotiate and obtain leases, check titles, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>make public land recordings. Klabzubas relied on Browns to function as their land office in Montana. Browns owed fiduciary duties to the Klabzubas, including the duty to report and inform on available opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b617 Browns operated most of the wells in which the parties shared an interest through their operating company, J. Burns Operating Company (JBBO). John O. Brown and his wife, Sandra Brown, owned and operated JBBO. John O. Brown and his siblings also owned and operated another oil company, 5B Company (5B). J. Burns Brown created 5B in 1981 for the purpose of participating in various leasing opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b618 Klabzubas came to Havre on November 17, 1997, to inform Browns that they planned to terminate the business relationship. The final PSC expired on January 1,1998. The parties continued to co-own shares in existing leases and gas wells, but the operation of the wells transferred from Browns to Klabzubas in April of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b619 Browns and Klabzubas have engaged in protracted and complicated litigation since the expiration of the final PSC. Browns filed a declaratory judgment action in Hill County regarding Browns\u2019 rights to prospect and explore for oil and gas in north central Montana after the termination of the final PSC. Klabzubas responded with a number of counterclaims in the action that we describe as <em>Browns I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aed\">\u00b620 <em>Browns I </em>went to trial in the fall of 2000. The district court determined that the final PSC had terminated on January 1, 1998. From about 1993 to 1998, Klabzubas had identified 940 sections, over 601,000 acres of land, as desirable for oil and gas leases. The court imposed a constructive trust on 201 of these sections. The court required Browns to \u201caccount for and disgorge\u201d 75 percent of the profits received after January 1, 1998, on these 201 sections. The court required Klabzubas to pay for 75 percent of the costs of developing the wells on the 201 sections. The court further determined that Browns \u201cshall not have a 2 percent overriding royalty in said lease and mineral interests\u201din the constructive trust lands for those leases acquired after the termination of the PSC in 1998. This Court affirmed Judge Warner\u2019s final judgment. <em>Textana, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b621 Klabzubas withheld ORR and production payments for <em>all </em>of the leases held jointly by Browns after the final judgment in <em>Browns I. </em>Browns filed an action in Hill County in December of 2002 to collect the unpaid ORR and production revenues on leases located on sections <em>not </em>covered by Judge Warner\u2019s constructive trust order.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b622 District Judge Marc G. Buyske assumed jurisdiction over this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>second action. The District Court dismissed with prejudice Browns\u2019 claims for unpaid ORR on 546 jointly-owned wells based on <em>res judicata. </em>The court determined that the parties had litigated the ORR issue in <em>Browns I </em>and that the district court in <em>Browns </em>/ had dismissed Browns\u2019 claims to the ORR on all properties jointly owned by Browns and Klabzubas.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b623 Klabzubas periodically sent delinquent production payments to Browns between April of2002 and 2006, so that by the time of the jury trial in May of 2006, Klabzubas no longer owed Browns the principal amounts on the production payments. Klabzubas refused to pay interest to Browns on the delinquent production payments. The District Court determined before trial that Browns were not entitled to accrued interest on the overdue production payments, except for one well -the State-4 well. The parties disputed ownership to the State-4 well. Browns argued that Klabzubas owed $302,284.31 in production revenues on the State-4 well. Klabzubas agreed to deposit the $302,284.31 in the registry of the court while the parties resolved a title dispute to the State-4 well.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b624 Klabzubas asserted a counterclaim in which they alleged that they had learned for the first time of a productive well that Browns had developed on land obtained by Browns in 1983 (Starcher claim). Klabzubas claimed that John O. Brown in 1983 wrongfully had concealed from Robert O. Klabzuba his acquisition of the Starcher claim in violation of the PSC. Klabzubas argued that Browns had a duty to acquire the Starcher lease on behalf of Klabzubas.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b625 Browns moved for summary judgment on the Starcher counterclaim based on the eight-year statute of limitations for breach of a written contract. Browns argued that they had disclosed their interest in the Starcher claims in numerous public documents and through documents submitted to Klabzubas over the years. The District Court denied Browns\u2019 summary judgment motion in May of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b626 The Starcher counterclaim went to trial in May of 2006. John O. Brown testified that he had informed Robert Klabzuba in 1983 about Browns\u2019 acquisition of the Starcher claims. John O. Brown testified that Robert Klabzuba was not interested in participating. Robert O. Klabzuba had died by the time of the trial. Mainly through the testimony of Stephen Frazier (Klabzubas\u2019 vice president), Klabzubas maintained that Robert O. Klabzuba never would have declined an interest in the Starcher claims. Klabzubas further claimed that John O. Brown never had disclosed his interest in the Starcher claims to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Robert Klabzuba or Frazier. Browns argued alternatively that Klabzubas should be obligated to pay their share of the costs in developing and operating the Starcher wells if the court determined that Klabzubas were entitled to a 75 percent share.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b627 The District Court sent the statute of limitations issue to the jury. The court instructed the jury on the issues of equitable tolling and fraudulent concealment. The jury awarded $ 1,483,232.41 to Klabzubas in compensatory damages. These damages equaled 75 percent of the production revenues from the Starcher claims from June of 1983 to the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b628 The District Court instructed the jury on punitive damages and malice and fraud. The court sent a verdict form to the jury that allowed findings of fraud and malice and punitive damages. The jury determined that Browns had acted with both malice and fraud, but awarded no punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. \u00b629 The District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on December 4,2006. The court directed that Browns convey a 75 percent interest on the Starcher claim to Klabzubas. The court further ordered that Browns transfer a 12.5 percent interest in the Starcher claims to 5B, a non-party. The court rejected Browns\u2019 claims for the costs of operating and developing the Starcher wells. The court also denied Browns\u2019 claim for interest on the delinquent production payments. The court finally found that Browns were entitled to the $302,284.31 of production revenue on the State-4 well. The court rejected Browns\u2019 claim for accrued interest on the basis that Browns had failed to seek interest in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b630 In a separate order on that same day, the court, without conducting a hearing, imposed sanctions against Browns \u2018in the form of reasonable attorney fees incurred by [Klabzubas] in this case.\u201d The court cited M. R. Civ. P. 37(d), as authority for the sanctions. Judge Buyske did not rule, however, on what amount of attorney fees Klabzubas should be awarded. Judge Buyske instead set a hearing solely to evaluate the reasonableness of Klabzubas\u2019 fees. Judge Buyske never imposed an actual amount of attorney fees before he relinquished jurisdiction over the case in late December 2006. The court also did not address Browns\u2019 separate motion for sanctions against Klabzubas for alleged false statements to the court by Klabzubas\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u00b631 District Judge David G. Rice assumed jurisdiction over the case on January 3, 2007. Judge Rice conducted a hearing on Klabzubas\u2019 request for attorney fees. Judge Rice limited proof to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>reasonableness of the amount of Klabzubas\u2019 attorney fees request. Klabzubas claimed over $1.4 million as their attorney fees. Judge Rice later reversed himself upon discovering that Judge Buyske\u2019s order had not been final.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b632 Judge Rice determined that no evidence supported a discovery sanction under Rule 37(d). Judge Rice concluded, however, that Browns should be sanctioned pursuant the court\u2019s equitable powers outlined in Foy <em>v. Anderson, </em>176 Mont. 507, 511-12, 580 P.2d 114, 116-17 (1978). Judge Rice trimmed Klabzubas\u2019 request of $1.4 million in fees to an actual award of $94,000 in attorney fees. The court further denied Browns\u2019 motion for sanctions against Klabzubas. The court entered a $2,260,834.78judgment in favor ofKlabzubas. The judgment constituted the jury verdict, pre-judgment interest on the jury verdict, post-judgment interest on the jury verdict, sanctions, and attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b633 Klabzubas again withheld production revenues that they owed to Browns after Judge Buyske\u2019s December 4,2006, order. The production payments accumulated at the rate of more than $163,000 per month. Klabzubas withheld sufficient unpaid production revenues to satisfy the judgment by the time of the May 6, 2008, judgment. Klabzubas filed a Satisfaction of Judgment on August 21, 2008. Browns appeal and Klabzubas cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b634 <em>Did the District Court properly refuse to dismiss </em>Klabzubas\u2019 <em>counterclaims regarding the Starcher claims based on statute of limitations grounds?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b635 The parties dispute the appropriate standard for determining <em>who </em>decides whether to toll the statute of limitations when a dispute exists as to when the party \u201cdiscovered\u201d facts giving rise to a claim. The confusion over the applicable standard in this case hinges on the difference between \u201caccrual\u201d and \u201cdiscovery.\u201d Accrual begins at breach in a breach of contract action. <em>Kitchen Krafters v. Eastside Bank of Montana, </em>242 Mont. 155, 163, 789 P.2d 567, 571 (1990) <em>(abrogated in part on other grounds). </em>Discovery serves to toll the statute of limitations only if fraudulent concealment has hindered a party from discovering a breach. <em>Kitchen Krafters, </em>242 Mont. at 163, 789 P.2d at 571-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\u00b636 The District Court determined that the question must be submitted to the jury in light of the existence of sufficient facts to raise a question of fraudulent concealment. This Court determined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>Kitchen Krafters </em>that the statute of limitations runs from the time of breach in a breach of contract action. The Court reasoned that, unlike a tort claim, a breach of contract constitutes a legal wrong \u2018independent of actual damage.\u201d <em>Kitchen Krafters, </em>242 Mont. at 163, 789 P.2d at 571-72. This Court also noted, however, that the statute of limitations runs from the time of discovery if there has been fraudulent concealment. Nothing <em>inKitchen Krafters </em>limits application of the fraudulent concealment tolling exception to \u00a727-2-102, MCA, \u2018injury to person or property.\u201d This fraudulent concealment rule applies even in a breach of contract claim. <em>Kitchen Krafters, </em>242 Mont. at 163, 789 P.2d at 571-72, citing Williston on Contracts at \u00a72025C. \u00b637 Fraudulent concealment entails the employment of artifice, planned to prevent inquiry or escape investigation, and to mislead or hinder information acquisition. <em>Holman v. Hansen, </em>237 Mont. 198, 202, 773 P.2d 1200, 1203 (1989) <em>(citing E.W. v. D.C.H., </em>231 Mont. 481, 488, 754 P.2d 817, 821 (1988)). The standard changes where a trust relationship exists, such as a fiduciary. Mere silence or failure to reveal information in the presence of a duty to disclose can constitute fraudulent concealment sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. <em>Estate of Watkins v. Hedman, </em>2004 MT 143, \u00b6 25, 321 Mont. 419, 91 P.3d 1264. Further, in <em>Watkins </em>we stated that \u201cthese [fraudulent concealment] are exactly the type of factual questions appropriate for resolution by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b638 <em>Watkins </em>contradicts Browns\u2019 argument that fraudulent concealment requires some affirmative conduct to conceal or mislead. Further, this Court stated in <em>Kerrigan v. O\u2019Meara, </em>71 Mont. 1, 227 P. 819 (1924), that a trust or confidence relationship modifies the general rule that there must be some affirmative acts to prove fraudulent concealment. Mere silence may suffice when a trust or confidence relationship exists between the parties. <em>Kerrigan, </em>71 Mont. at 7, 227 P. at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b639 The District Court determined that Browns owed Klabzubas the highest duties of loyalty and fairness as a fiduciary. Browns served as Klabzubas\u2019 \u201ceyes and ears\u201din Montana. These duties required Browns to inform Klabzubas of all available opportunities. Browns\u2019 silence and failure to disclose their interest in the Starcher claims rises to the level of fraudulent concealment under <em>Watkins </em>and <em>Kerrigan </em>in light of their fiduciary duty. The fact that Browns put on evidence of various public filings and invoices sent to Klabzubas that indicated Browns\u2019 ownership interest in the Starcher claims failed to satisfy these duties. Browns trust relationship with Klabzubas imposed on Browns an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>affirmative duty to disclose. <em>Kerrigan, </em>71 Mont. at 7, 227 P. at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab72\">\u00b640  The record also raises legitimate questions as to whether Browns made affirmative misrepresentations. John O. Brown changed his story through various depositions and during trial regarding when he had acquired his interest in the Starcher claims and when he had disclosed the interests to Klabzubas. John O. Brown testified in his first deposition that he had told Robert Klabzuba that he acquired the Starcher claims in the 1970s, before entering into a PSC with Klabzubas. He testified in his second deposition, however, that he first had told Robert Klabzuba about the Starcher claims in 1981. John O. Brown changed his story again at trial. He testified that he first had notified Robert Klabzuba in May of 1983 of the Starcher claims after receiving a letter from Cole Chandler, his partner in the Starcher claims. Cole Chandler testified, however, that John O. Brown never had informed him of any relationship with Klabzubas. The record reveals sufficient evidence of potential fraudulent concealment to support the District Court\u2019s decision to send the statute of limitations question to the jury. <em>Watkins, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b641 <em>Did the District Court properly award a 12.5 percent interest in the Starcher claims to a non-party ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b642 The District Court imposed a constructive trust over the Starcher claims after the jury found in favor of Klabzubas on the grounds of fraudulent concealment. The District Court granted a 12.5 percent interest in the Starcher claims to 5B, a non-party to the action, as part of its equitable division of the Starcher claims. John O. Brown\u2019s family members control 5B. Browns argue that they lacked notice of the need to defend against this claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b643 Equitable rulings of this type fall within the district court\u2019s discretion and we will sustain these rulings unless the district court abused its discretion. <em>Ruegsegger v. Welborn, </em>237 Mont. 317, 321, 773 P.2d 305, 308 (1989) <em>(abrogated in part on other grounds). </em>The plaintiff <em>in Howard v. Dalio, </em>249 Mont. 316, 318, 815 P.2d 1150, 1151 (1991), alleged that her sister had breached her duty as trustee by cashing out certificates of deposit that had been left by their deceased sister\u2019s estate. The district court imposed a constructive trust against the defendant sister, for the benefit of the plaintiff sister, as well as for the benefit of a third sister, who remained a non-party to the lawsuit. <em>Howard, </em>249 Mont. at 318, 815 P.2d at 1151. The defendant sister alleged that the court lacked jurisdiction to impose a valid judgment in favor of the non-party sister. <em>Howard, </em>249 Mont. at 319, 815 P.2d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00b644 The Court upheld the district court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust that named the non-party sister as one of the beneficiaries. The Court recognized as \u201cpivotal\u201dthe fact that it possessed jurisdiction over the person upon whom the trust had been imposed. The Court rejected the notion that all potential beneficiaries needed to be parties. <em>Howard, </em>249 Mont. at 319-20, 815 P.2d at 1152. The defendant sister could point to no prejudice from the court\u2019s imposition of the constructive trust as the complaint and the pretrial order had put the defendant sister on notice of the plaintiffs efforts to seek a constructive trust for the benefit of both the plaintiff and the non-party sister. <em>Howard, </em>249 Mont. at 320, 815 P.2d at 1152. Browns likewise can point to no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b645 Klabzubas\u2019 second amended counterclaim, filed almost two years before trial, alerted Browns of their intent to seek a constructive trust over the Starcher claim. Klabzubas\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law specifically named 5B as a potential beneficiary of the constructive trust. Frazier testified at trial regarding the percentage interests held by the various entities during the early 1980s when Browns had acquired the Starcher claims. David B. Brown, John O. Brown\u2019s brother, also testified regarding the customary 12.5 percent split between 5B and John O. Brown employed by Browns. The court did not abuse its discretion in awarding 5B an interest in the Starcher claims when Browns had notice of Klazbuzas\u2019 efforts to seek a constructive trust. <em>Howard, </em>249 Mont. at 320, 815 P.2d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b646 <em>Did the District Court properly refuse Browns\u2019 evidence of their costs in developing the Starcher claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b647 Browns contend that Klabzubas\u2019 claim of entitlement to 75 percent of the revenues from the Starcher claims brings with it a corresponding obligation to pay 75 percent of the development costs. The District Court ruled that Browns\u2019 failure to \u201ccome to this Court with clean hands\u201d precluded the court from shielding Browns from the \u201crisk of loss of their fraudulent scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b648 The District Court relied upon <em>Ruegsegger, </em>where the Court denied an offset to a defendant who had not acted in good faith. The plaintiff landowner in <em>Ruegsegger </em>had commenced foreclosure proceedings against the defendant. The parties initially attempted to settle the matter through an agreement that allowed the defendant to stay on the property for a set period. The defendant\u2019s worsening financial condition prevented him from performing the terms of the settlement, but the defendant remained on the property beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>terms of the settlement agreement. <em>Ruegsegger, </em>237 Mont. at 318-19, 773 P.2d at 306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b649 The defendant next filed a frivolous bankruptcy petition in a failed effort to delay foreclosure proceedings. The bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay and the landowner continued his foreclosure action. The defendant filed a counterclaim for restitution to recoup costs that he had incurred in planting, irrigating, fertilizing, and harvesting crops while the defendant had been leasing the property from the plaintiff. The Court denied the offset due to the fact that the defendant had not acted in good faith in filing the frivolous bankruptcy petition. <em>Ruegsegger, </em>237 Mont. at 321-22, 773 P.2d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b650 Klabzubas based their claim on Browns\u2019 alleged breach of contract. The defendant in <em>Ruegsegger </em>proceeded under the equitable claim of unjust enrichment. Klabzubas argue that the District Court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust triggered application of <em>Ruegsegger. </em>Both Klabzubas and the District Court failed to address Browns\u2019 argument that \u00a727-1-303, MCA, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b651  Section 27-1-303, MCA, provides that no person can recover a greater amount in damages than he could have gained by full performance of the contract in a breach of contract action. Klabzubas alleged that Browns had breached their duty under the PSC to disclose their interest in the Starcher claims. Klabzubas\u2019 claim lies in contract and \u00a7 27-1-303, MCA, applies even though the court imposed a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b652 The principal espoused in \u00a727-1-303, MCA, supports the well-established \u2018benefit of the bargain rule.\u201d <em>Castillo v. Franks, </em>213 Mont. 232, 242, 690 P.2d 425, 430 (1984); \u00a727-1-311, MCA. This rule places the injured party in as good a position as if the contract had been performed, less any costs or other loss that the injured party has avoided by not having to perform. <em>Castillo, </em>213 Mont. at 242, 690 P.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b653 The PSC obligated Klabzubas to pay 75 percent of the development costs. The court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust granted to Klabzubas 75 percent of profits-the result contemplated by the PSC. The PSC, in turn, obligated Klabzubas to incur 75 percent of the costs. This outcome provides Klabzubas with the benefit of the bargain, less Browns\u2019 expenses that Klabzubas avoided by not having to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b654 We further note that Judge Warner imposed a similar constructive trust in <em>Browns I. </em>Judge Warner required Klabzubas to pay 75 percent of the costs if they were to benefit from 75 percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Browns\u2019 disgorged profits. Judge Warner required Klabzubas to pay their share of the costs despite Browns\u2019 breach of their fiduciary duties. We reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude Browns\u2019 evidence of their costs in developing the Starcher claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b655 <em>Did the District Court properly instruct the jury on punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b656 The District Court allowed the jury to consider whether to award punitive damages based on Klabzubas\u2019 claim that Browns had acted with actual malice or actual fraud. Although the jury awarded no punitive damages, Browns argue that the court\u2019s decision to provide the punitive damages instruction permitted Klabzubas to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence of illegal bad acts by Browns. We address this issue in light of Browns\u2019 claims that the evidence introduced by Klabzubas prejudiced the jury regarding the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b657 We will not reverse a district court on the basis of its jury instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc. of U.S., </em>276 Mont. 1, 26, 914 P.2d 976, 992 (1996). Section 27-1-220, MCA, generally precludes punitive damages recovery for breach of contract claims. This Court has held, however, that \u00a727-1-221, MCA, permits an award of punitive damages where the claimant \u201cproves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of actual fraud or actual malice outside the contract context.\u201d <em>Weter v. Archbambault, </em>2002 MT 336, \u00b6 40, 313 Mont. 284, 61 P.3d 771.

The court relied upon its undisputed finding that Browns owed Klabzubas the highest duty of loyalty under their fiduciary relationship. Klabzubas presented evidence that Browns had failed to disclose their 1983 Starcher acquisition to Klabzubas. This alleged omission supported Klabzubas\u2019 claim of actual fraud or actual malice based on the special relationship between the parties. <em>Grenfell, </em>\u00b6 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b659 Frazier also testified regarding John Brown\u2019s affirmative misrepresentation in 1991 that he had acquired the Starcher claims in the 1970s. John Brown contradicted Frazier\u2019s testimony on this point. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>This contradiction remained for the jury to resolve. Frazier\u2019s claim of John Brown\u2019s affirmative misrepresentation provides further support, however, for the court\u2019s decision that it was for the jury to decide whether Klabzubas had proven by clear and convincing evidence that Browns had acted with actual fraud or actual malice in withholding information about their interest in the Starcher claims. <em>Weter, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"AvP\">\u00b660 <em>Did the District Court properly determine that res judicata barred Browns\u2019 2 percent ORR claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b661 Klabzubas began to withhold Browns\u2019 ORR payments for all leases jointly held by Browns and Klabzubas after the district court\u2019s judgment in <em>Browns I. </em>Browns filed this second action in large part to recover what they claimed to be the unpaid ORRs.

Alpine Home Center, </em>2001 MT 310, \u00b6 10, 307 Mont. 529, 38 P.3d 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b663 Browns contend that the court in <em>Browns I </em>never resolved the issue of whether the PSCs between 1976 and 1997 entitled Browns to a 2 percent ORR on the numerous wells jointly developed by the parties. Browns further contend that they could not have raised the issue in <em>Browns I </em>as \u2018Klabzubas did not systematically terminate the ORR payments to Browns until after <em>Browns I.\u201d </em>Browns argued that the 2 percent ORR arose in <em>Browns I </em>only \u201ctangentially on two issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUXj\">\u00b664 The district court in <em>Browns I </em>addressed the ORR issue in two contexts. The court first addressed certain leases that Browns had obtained when Browns and Klabzubas began to compete for leases after the final PSC terminated on January 1, 1998. Klabzubas had shared certain proprietary geotechnical information and other trade secrets with Browns during the parties\u2019 relationship. Klabzubas had identified 940 sections between 1993 and 1998 as desirable to lease based on this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b665 The court determined that it would have been unfair to interpret the PSC to preclude the Browns from attempting to acquire leases in any of the 940 sections despite the existence of the fiduciary relationship. To interpret the PSC in this way would \u201ceffectively prohibit Browns from engaging in the exploration business in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>whole area [and] restrain Browns from exercising their lawful profession and business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b666 The court reached a different conclusion, however, with respect to about 200 leases that Klabzubas obtained after the parties had begun to compete. Browns had misappropriated certain trade secret information with respect to these 200 leases, and, in turn, had violated their fiduciary duty to Klabzubas. The court imposed a constructive trust on Browns\u2019 interest in those 200 leases in an effort to provide a remedy for Browns\u2019 breach of their fiduciary duty. The court required Browns \u201cto account for and disgorge 75 percent of the profits\u201d from these 200 leases. The court, Ta]s a corollary,\u201d required Klabzubas to pay for 75 percent of the costs of developing these 200 leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b667 The court nevertheless determined that Browns were not entitled to the 2 percent ORR on any of 200 leases. The court noted that the 2 percent ORR constituted payment to Browns for landman services, and did not bear any relation to the fiduciary relationship between the parties after January 1, 1998. The court thus determined that the \u2018Browns should not have an overriding royalty on production under leases taken after January 1,1998.\u201dThis denial of ORR applied to the 200 leases that Klabzubas had obtained after the PSC terminated. <em>Res judicata </em>bars relitigating these 200 leases. <em>Bayleat Law, </em>284 Mont. at 3, 942 P.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b668 The court in <em>Browns I </em>also addressed a number of leases that contained disputed or unverified amounts of ORRs. Klabzubas and Browns jointly owned approximately 546 leases at the time that the last PSC ended on January 1, 1998. Klabzubas dismissed as \u201cunverified\u201d Browns\u2019 claim to ORRs on approximately 170 of the 546 leases. The following exchange between the court and Klabzubas\u2019 counsel confirms that no dispute existed as to the validity of Browns\u2019 right to the ORR on the remaining leases obtained before January 1, 1998:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">Court: Do I have to make a decision about the amount of a 2 percent overriding royalty on 300 and some odd wells?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">Counsel: No ... I think that quite a few of them are being paid properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The court further attempted to clarify the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">Court: I\u2019ve got 170 wells with a disputed amount of overriding interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">Counsel: Unverified I think is probably more accurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">The court never fully resolved this issue. The court instead ordered the parties to make further efforts to settle these disputed leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u00b669 <em>Browns I </em>resolved only the Browns\u2019 right to ORR payments on the 200 leases obtained after the last PSC ended on January 1,1998. The court subjected these after-acquired leases to a constructive trust and denied Browns\u2019 claim for ORR payments. The court <em>iuBrowns I </em>never resolved, however, the dispute regarding Browns\u2019 claim to ORR on the jointly held leases developed by the parties during the 21-year life of the PSCs. The District Court wrongly concluded that <em>res judicata </em>barred Browns\u2019 claims for withheld ORR payments on the leases that the parties jointly had developed during the 21-year period covered by the PSCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b670 <em>Did the District Court properly dismiss Browns\u2019 interest claims where Klabzubas withheld, but later paid, production revenues due to Browns?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b671 The district court in <em>Browns I </em>imposed a constructive trust on lands \u201cacquired by Browns between January 1, 1998 and January 25, 2001.\u201dBrowns refused to comply with the constructive trust order for a period of seventeen months. The court eventually granted Klabzubas\u2019 motion to enforce the constructive trust order. Klabzubas, in the interim, had withheld from Browns production payments on all jointly held leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b672 Browns filed suit in December 2002 to recover almost $2 minion in overdue production payments. Klabzubas had repaid Browns almost the entire principal amount of the withheld production revenues by the time of trial in May 2006. Browns admit that these production revenues have become a \u201cnon-issue.\u201d Klabzubas refused to pay, however, any accrued interest on these production revenues that they had withheld between 2002 and the time of trial in 2006. The District Court dismissed Browns\u2019 claims for interest on the withheld production revenues based on \u00a727-1-214, MCA. The District Court determined that Browns\u2019 acceptance of the entire principal of unpaid production payments had waived any claims to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b673 Section 27-1-214, MCA, provides that \u201caccepting payment of the whole principal, as such, waives all claims to interest.\u201d Section 27-1-214, MCA. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s application of law. <em>James Talcott Const., Inc. v. P &amp; D Land Enterprises, </em>2006 MT 188, \u00b6 28, 333 Mont. 107, 141 P.3d 1200. The District Court relied on <em>Kawasho Intl. U.S.A. Inc. v. Lakewood Pipe Serv. Inc., </em>152 Cal.App.3d 785, 794 (1983), which addressed the issue of waiver when a party accepts payment of the principal. We note, however, that the court in <em>Kawasho </em>refused to apply the waiver principle. <em>Kawasho, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at 795. We further note that the court in <em>Kawasho </em>recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that the waiver rale cannot be invoked where the conditions of payment preclude the person entitled to payment from asserting his claim to interest at the time of the payment. <em>Kawasho, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b674 Browns\u2019 interest claim arises from a contractual debt under the PSC. Klabzubas\u2019 decision to withhold production payments caused a debt to Browns to accumulate under the PSC. Klabzubas attempted to make good on this overdue contractual obligation by making a series of irregular payments to Browns in the months leading up to the trial. Browns asserted a claim for accrued interest on the withheld production revenues in their second amended complaint. We decline to view Browns\u2019 acceptance of this series of sporadic payments from Klabzubas as having extinguished their claim for accrued interest. <em>Kawasho, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b675  The District Court\u2019s application of \u00a727-1-214, MCA, fails to account for a party\u2019s right to interest under \u00a727-1-211, MCA. Section 27-1-211, MCA, provides that a party entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, also may recover interest on the damages. Section 27-1-211, MCA. Browns sought to recover production payments contemplated by the PSC. The PSC set forth the division of the production payments between Browns and Klabzubas. Klabzubas operated thejointly held wells after the last PSC terminated in 1998. Klabzubas had in their possession information needed to calculate the sum certain due to Browns. <em>Ramsey v.

Lake &amp; Co. v. Montana Horse Products Co., </em>109 Mont. 434, 443, 97 P.2d 590, 594 (1940). Interest began to run upon Klabzubas\u2019 withholding of Browns\u2019 share of the production payments due under the terms of the PSC. Klabzubas cannot extinguish this interest obligation by repaying the principal at some later date through a series of irregular payments. <em>Ramsey, </em>\u00b6 21. We do not interpret \u00a7 27-1-214, MCA, to allow Klabzubas to withhold contractually obligated payments on millions of dollars of production revenues for several years and avoid interest obligations by repaying the full amount of the principal on the eve of trial. The District Court improperly dismissed Browns\u2019 claim for interest on production payments wrongfully withheld by Klabzubas.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u00b677 Browns also sought a declaratory judgment and accounting of revenue for the State-4 well. The parties\u2019 dispute regarding the ownership rights prompted Klabzubas to withhold $302,284.31 in production revenues from the State-4 well. Klabzubas deposited the disputed $302,284.31 in the registry of the court. The District Court later awarded this amount to Browns, along with accrued interest, but only the interest that accrued from the time that Klabzubas had deposited the funds with the court registry. The District Court rejected Browns\u2019 claim to an additional $70,000 in interest on the disputed State-4 well for the time period from November 2002 until the date that Klabzubas had deposited the $302,284.31 with the court registry. \u00b678 The court reasoned that Browns had failed to assert a timely claim for interest after Klabzubas had deposited the amount in the registry of the court. Browns specifically had asserted a claim for interest on the withheld production revenues in their second amended complaint. In a separate count, however, Browns sought a declaratory judgment and accounting on the State-4 well. Browns did not request interest on the disputed $302,284.31. The District Court restricted Browns\u2019 claims to those alleged in their second amended complaint. The court determined that any further amendments would prejudice Klabzubas.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b679 The district court retains discretion to allow amendment of a pleading. <em>Porter v. </em>Galarneau, 275 Mont. 174, 188, 911 P.2d 1143, 1151-52 (1996). Browns sought to amend their complaint to add the claim for accrued interest more than two years after filing the original complaint. The general rule calls for a court to allow amendments. <em>Peuse v. Malkuch, </em>275 Mont. 221, 227, 911 P.2d 1153, 1156 (1996). The court must balance this rule in favor of amendments, however, with considerations of prejudice to the opposing party. <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b680 The District Court conducted a hearing on the proposed amendments. The District Court cited Browns\u2019 repeated failures to meet the court\u2019s pleading deadlines and Browns\u2019 repeated attempts to amend their damages calculations. A district court has the authority to set deadlines for amendments to pleadings. <em>Lindey\u2019s, Inc. v. Professional Consultants, Inc., </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923 (1990). The court recognized that the parties had engaged in protracted discovery and had extended significant resources in preparing this case. The court determined that any further amendments by Browns to their pleadings would prejudice Klabzubas. We cannot determine that the District Court abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>denying Browns\u2019 motion to amend their pleadings to add a claim for accrued interest on the State-4 well at that late stage in the litigation. <em>Peuse, 275 </em>Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b681 <em>Did the District Court properly deny sanctions against Klabzubas based on alleged false statements by their counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b682 Browns argue that Klabzubas\u2019 counsel knowingly made six false statements to the District Court in his March 4, 2005, brief regarding the State-4 well monies deposited in the court registry. Klabzubas asserted that Browns improperly had been withholding revenue payments on this well for years. Browns objected to Klabzubas claim as patently false and demanded that the District Court impose sanctions against Klabzubas pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 11. Judge Buyske never ruled on the Browns\u2019 motion for sanctions. Judge Rice eventually denied Browns\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b683 We afford district courts wide latitude to determine whether the factual circumstances of a particular case warrant imposition of sanctions. We recognize that \u2018the district court has tasted the flavor of the litigation and is in the best position to make these kinds of determinations.\u201d <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Swanson, </em>240 Mont. 435, 446, 784 P.2d 919, 926 (1989). The flavor of this litigation most likely left a sour taste in the mouth of the District Court. The competing allegations, prevarications, and outright falsehoods presented by the parties leaves little confidence in the accuracy of any statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b684 Browns alleged that Klabzubas falsely had accused Browns of keeping oil lease revenues in a personal account, rather than in an escrow account. Klabzubas cited deposition testimony of Sandra Brown, however, in which she admitted to having held these oil lease revenues in a JBBO company account. Browns further alleged that Klabzubas falsely accused Browns of relying on title confusion to withhold oil lease revenue payments. Once again, however, Klabzubas cited both Sandra Brown\u2019s deposition and John O. Brown\u2019s deposition in which each admitted that they had not paid Klabzubas and other owners for a period of years due to unresolved title issues. The record reveals a reasonable factual basis for Klabzubas to have made the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b685  Browns further contend that the District Court failed to hold a hearing on its request for sanctions as due process requires. M. R. Civ. P. 11 requires a court to hold a hearing in order to satisfy due process requirements before the court may impose sanctions. <em>Kinsey-Cartwright v. Brower, </em>2000 MT 198, \u00b6 17, 300 Mont. 450, 5 P.3d 1026. The hearing requirement protects the party against whom sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>are sought. The court imposed no sanctions. Nothing in M. R. Civ. P. 11, or within the ambit of due process, requires a court to conduct a hearing before deciding that a party\u2019s conduct does <em>not </em>warrant the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b686 <em>Did the District Court properly award attorney fees against Browns without first holding a hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b687 Browns allege that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees without first holding a hearing.

Judge Rice failed to protect Browns\u2019 due process right, however, in not considering the appropriateness of imposition of a fee award in the first place. Judge Rice imposed the sanctions against Browns pursuant to <em>Foy. </em>This Court repeatedly has noted the extremely limited scope of the equitable power to impose sanctions under Foy. <em>Goodover v.

Judge Rice did not oversee the pretrial litigation or the trial itself. Judge Rice assumed jurisdiction over the case after Judge Buyske had entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order. Judge Buyske also had entered a separate order that imposed sanctions against Browns. Judge Rice was sitting in a position little different from this Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u00b691 Judge Rice reviewed the record and modified Judge Buyske\u2019s sanctions award.

The District Court on remand can determine the appropriateness of any sanction being imposed against Browns following a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b697 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for limited proceedings consistent with this Opinion. The District Court on remand shall allow Browns to present evidence regarding their costs in developing the Starcher claims. The District Court shall consider Browns\u2019 claim for 2 percent ORR on those leases not covered by Judge Warner\u2019s constructive trust in <em>Browns I. </em>The District Court shall address Browns\u2019 interest claims from Klabzubas\u2019 withholding of production payments, except for the State-4 well. The District Court can reconsider at the conclusion of these proceedings whether to proceed with an imposition of sanctions against Browns. The District Court must conduct a hearing regarding whether sanctions would be appropriate under the limited <em>Foy </em>exception. Finally, the District Court must resolve Klabzubas\u2019 claim to have satisfied the judgment in light of the outcome of these proceedings on remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
