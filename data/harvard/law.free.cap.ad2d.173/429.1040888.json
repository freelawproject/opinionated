Since the plaintiff did not dispute before Supreme Court the immediacy of the death, and seeks recovery only for his decedent\u2019s conscious pain and suffering, and since the record demonstrates there was none, the motion for summary judgment should have been granted <em>(see, Scheu v High-Forest Corp., </em>129 AD2d 366; <em>cf., Wittman v Gilson, </em>120 AD2d 964, <em>affd </em>70 NY2d 970; <em>Anderson v Rowe, </em>73 AD2d 1030).
