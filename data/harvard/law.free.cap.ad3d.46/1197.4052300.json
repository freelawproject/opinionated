These rules applied to all recreational use of New York City lands, lakes and reservoirs owned for water supply purposes, including lands located outside of the metro New York area known as the Watershed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The stated purpose of the new rules was to safeguard an adequate supply of high quality water to respondent City of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\">Petitioner, a community located within the Watershed which relies on tourism as a primary industry, commenced this combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action seeking to annul DEP\u2019s action in adopting these rules. Supreme Court determined that, because the subject rules were promulgated without prior approval by the Department of Health as required by Public Health Law \u00a7 1100 (1), petitioner was entitled to relief pursuant to CPLR article 78. Thus, the court granted the petition, prompting this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Public Health Law \u00a7 1100 (1) authorizes DEP, subject to Department of Health approval, to adopt rules and regulations for the protection of the quality of its water supply <em>(see Ryder v City of New York, </em>32 AD3d 836, 838 [2006], <em>lv dismissed </em>8 NY3d 896 [2007]; <em>City of New York v Mancini-Ciolo, Inc., </em>188 AD2d 633, 634 [1992]). DEP readily concedes that the subject rules were not approved by the Department of Health. However, it argues that such approval was not necessary because it was acting pursuant to Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 24-315, which grants it authority to issue and renew temporary permits for use or occupation of any city property. To this end, DEP disputes that the subject rules are \u201cwatershed protection rules, regulating land use throughout the watershed\u201d but, instead, portrays them as \u201ca management tool\u201d for city-owned property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notably, despite taking a contrary position before Supreme Court, the DEP now concedes that its predecessor recreational rules were in fact submitted to the Department of Health for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>In our view, the attempt to disavow the Watershed protection aspect of the subject rules, and thus the application of Public Health Law \u00a7 1101 (1), is belied by the \u201cstatement of basis and purpose\u201d contained within both the \u201cnotice of public hearing and opportunity to comment\u201d and the \u201cnotice of adoption of rules,\u201d as well as the stated \u201cscope and purpose\u201d of the rules themselves. The notice of public hearing states that \u201c[t]he purpose of the proposed rules is to provide further protection to the New York City drinking water supply\u201d and further notes that one component of the new rules (i.e., access permits) \u201cwill greatly assist [DEP] in its responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the water supply.\u201d The notice of adoption of rules similarly notes that the proposed access permit component of the new rules \u201cwill benefit the integrity of the water supply.\u201d Most significantly, the rules themselves state that they \u201care in furtherance of the City\u2019s goal of safeguarding an adequate supply of high quality drinking water while allowing compatible recreational use and enjoyment.\u201d Because the subject rules have the purpose and effect of protecting the City\u2019s water supply in the Watershed, we find that approval by the Department of Health was required pursuant to Public Health Law \u00a7 1101 (1). DEP\u2019s action in adopting these rules without such approval was therefore in violation of lawful procedure <em>(see </em>CPLR 7803 [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">As a final matter, to the extent that DEP expands the position it originally took before Supreme Court by arguing that Public Health Law \u00a7 1100 (5) exempts its compliance with Public Health Law \u00a7 1100 (1), we have reviewed its arguments in this regard and find them to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Crew III, J.P., Spain, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs. <em>[See </em>2007 NY Slip Op 31708(H).]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">. Respondent City of New York acquired property within the Watershed pursuant to the 1997 New York City Watershed Memorandum of Agreement. The purpose of these land acquisitions was to protect the City\u2019s Watershed and water supply. Under the agreement, DEP agreed to make land within the Watershed open to various recreational uses to preserve the economic viability of the Watershed communities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">. In particular, DEP argued that the new rules were \u201csimply a management tool, efficiently establishing conditions under which [it] allows members of the public to enter city-owned lands in the Watershed, for purposes of promoting safety, preventing liability claims, protecting the land against damage, and avoiding conflicts among different recreational uses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
