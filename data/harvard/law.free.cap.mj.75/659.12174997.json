The convening authority (CA) approved the adjudged sentence and, pursuant to a pretrial agreement, suspended all confinement and reduction below the pay grade E-5 for six months, and further suspended the punitive discharge \u201cuntil the Accused\u2019s administrative separation process is complete and the Accused has received his DD214.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Although not raised by the appellant, we find error in the staff judge advocate\u2019s (SJA) recommendation (SJAR) and in the CA\u2019s action. Further, although the CA\u2019s action states the appellant\u2019s confinement was deferred, there is no evidence of the appellant\u2019s deferment request in the record as is required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remand for a new SJAR and CA\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The offenses to which the appellant pleaded guilty occurred on 16 October 2013 (when he signed an official record falsely stating he was married) and on 15 July 2010 through 13 October 2014 (when he, on divers occasions, stole a total of $16,939.00 from the United States in the form of Basic Allowance for Housing at the with dependents rate). He was sentenced on 15 October 2015, served with the SJAR<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on 24 November 2015, and submitted a clemency request on 14 December 2015. Although his request alleged no legal error, it asked the CA to allow him to remain on active duty in his E-6 paygrade until October 2017 (his end of active service date). The SJAR incorrectly advised the CA that he \u201cmay not take action on the findings or the sentence in this case except only to effectuate the terms of the Pretrial Agreement[.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This erroneous statement of the law was not challenged by the appellant, corrected in an addendum to the SJAR<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, or addressed in the CA\u2019s action. The CA took his initial action on 5 January 2016 and did not grant the requested clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (FY14 NDAA) substantially changed the authority of CAs to take action on sentences under Article 60, UCMJ, Under the changes a CA \u201cmay not disapprove, commute, or suspend in whole or in part an adjudged sentence of confinement for more than six months or a sentence of dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad conduct discharge\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> unless certain exceptions exist. One such exception is a negotiated guilty plea, which grants the CA \u201cthe authority to approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend a sentence in whole or in part pursuant to the terms of the pre-trial agreement[.]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The President signed the FY14 NDAA on 26 December 2013 and the Article 60 changes became effective 180 days later on 24 June 2014. The FY15 NDAA provided clarification for courts-martial involving offenses which straddled that effective date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">With respect to the findings and sentence of a court-martial that includes both a conviction for an offense committed before [24 June 2014] and a conviction for an offense committed on or after that effective date, the convening authority shall have the same authority to take action on such findings and sentence as was in effect on the day before such effective date[.]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">\u201cFailure of counsel for the accused to comment on any matter in the recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>dation ...j in a timely manner shall waive later claim of error with regard to such matter in the absence of plain error.\u201d Rules FOR CouRts-MaRtial 1106(f)(6), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2012 ed.); <em>see also United States v. Kho, </em>54 M.J. 63, 65 (C.A.A.F.2000). Where there is error in post-trial processing and \u201csome colorable showing of possible prejudice\u201d thereby, this court must either provide meaningful relief or remand for new post-trial processing. <em>United States v. Wheelus, </em>49 M.J. 283, 289 (C.A.A.F.1998) (citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>54 M.J. 57, 59 (C.A.A.F.2000). Plain error exists when \u201c(1) there was an error; (2) it was plain or obvious; and (3) the error materially prejudiced a substantial right.\u201d <em>Kho, </em>54 M.J. at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Here the SJAR language, citing the Secretary of the Navy\u2019s implementing instructions for the FY14 NDAA amendments and omitting reference to the FY15 NDAA technical revisions thereto,' incorrectly advised the CA that his potential action was limited to the terms of the pretrial agreement. By the statute\u2019s plain language, these limitations did not apply to the appellant\u2019s offenses, as they, in substantial part, occurred prior to the statute\u2019s effective date. The CA\u2019s broad authority to act on the findings and sentence in this ease was, in fact, unfettered by the FY14 NDAA and was reaffirmed in the FY15 NDAA. <em>See United States v. Nerad, </em>69 M.J. 138, 145 (C.A.A.F.2010) (noting that CAs enjoy unfettered discretion to modify the findings and sentence for any reason\u2014without having to state a reason\u2014so long as there is no increase in severity) and R.C.M. 1107(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The SJA\u2019s advice was an affirmative misstatement of the law that effectively precluded the appellant\u2019s opportunity to receive clemency. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>58 M.J. 100, 102 (C.A.A.F.2003) (describing the CA as an accused\u2019s best hope for clemency). As such, the error was material and substantial. Given the extent to which CAs must rely on their SJAs to correctly explain post-trial processing\u2014particularly in light of the recent changes to Article 60\u2014we find a reasonable probability that the error misled the CA. There is nothing in the matters considered by the CA before taking his action that contradicted or corrected the SJA\u2019s erroneous advice. We therefore conclude the error in the SJA\u2019s advice was plain or obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Notwithstanding the appellant\u2019s failure to raise the issue and articulate possible prejudice, we nevertheless find it exists. The SJA\u2019s erroneous advice that the CA could only act on the findings and sentence within the confines of the appellant\u2019s pretrial agreement barred the CA from modifying or dismissing the findings or otherwise granting relief on the imposed sentence beyond the protections in the pretrial agreement. In particular, the SJA\u2019s advice precluded the CA from considering and potentially granting the appellant\u2019s specific request to remain on active duty until his end of active service and to continue serving as a Petty Officer First Class. There being no indication that the CA ignored his SJA\u2019s incorrect advice, we find the apparent denial of consideration itself to be a sufficient showing of possible prejudice. Accordingly, we must either grant meaningful relief or, as we direct in our decretal paragraph, remand. We next consider the CA\u2019s action, which notes the appellant\u2019s confinement was deferred on 15 October 2015. However, the appellant\u2019s request for deferment does not exist on the record, in his pretrial agreement, in post-trial submissions, or in the SJAR.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The CA \u201cmay, upon written application of the accused ... defer the accused\u2019s sentence to confinement[.]\u201d R.C.M. 1101(c)(2). \u201cThe deferment request and the action on the request must be included in the record of trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1101(e)(2) Discussion; <em>see also </em>R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(D) and (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">\u201cDeferment of a sentence to confinement ... is a postponement of the running of the sentence.\u201d R.C.M. 1101(c)(1), \u201c[A] sentence to confinement begins to run on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>date it is adjudged unless it is deferred!!]\u201d R.C.M. 1101(b), Discussion. Here, in the absence of an approved deferment request, the appellant\u2019s sentence to confinement ran from 15 October 2015 until the CA took his action on 5 January 2016. <em>See United States v. Lamb, </em>22 M.J. 518, 519 (N.M.C.M.R 1986). As such, 82 days of the adjudged confinement elapsed prior to the CA taking his action, even though the appellant never actually served any confinement. As a result, only eight days of confinement remained for the CA to suspend.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Ham, </em>No. 201000627, 2011 CCA LEXIS 776 at 1, unpublished op. (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 24 Mar 2011) (per curiam). The CA\u2019s action thus erroneously purports to suspend confinement (which is subject to potential future vacation) that has already run and therefore was technically served.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The CA\u2019s action is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General for remand to an appropriate CA for new post-trial processing. The record shall then be returned to this court for review under Article 66(c), UCMJ.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">.
