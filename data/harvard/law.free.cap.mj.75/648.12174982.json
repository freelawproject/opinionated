The members sentenced the appellant to be reduced to pay grade E-l, hard labor without confinement for 90 days, and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged,</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The appellant initially raised three assignments of error (AOE): (1) the evidence was factually and legally insufficient to convict on battery; (2) the evidence was factually and legally insufficient to convict on adultery; and (3) the convening authority\u2019s action inaccurately reflects the members\u2019 findings. This court specified the issue of whether it was error to instruct the members on the LIO of battery. Finally, the appellant raised a supplemental AOE, ai'guing that his conviction of adultery violates the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Sitting <em>en banc, </em>the court heard oral argument on the supplemental AOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">We find the LIO of battery was not reasonably raised by the evidence and that the appellant was therefore prejudiced by his conviction of that offense. We will set aside that conviction, dismiss that charge, and reassess the appellant\u2019s sentence. After our corrective action, we find no other error materially prejudicial to the appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">After a night of drinking in October of 2012, Corporal (Cpl) Beal, LCpl Bailey, LCpl D, and the appellant returned to LCpl D\u2019s apartment, where LCpl D went to her room and fell asleep fully clothed. The other Marines continued to drink until Cpl Beal left and LCpl Bailey fell asleep in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">LCpl Bailey testified that she awoke and used the head in LCpl D\u2019s bedroom. Along the way, she noticed \u201ctwo shapes\u201d in LCpl D\u2019s bed. She returned to the living room and went back to sleep. LCpl D testified that she awoke in her bed to discover her pants and underwear down around her ankles and the appellant on top of her with his penis \u201cinside\u201d her vagina.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She yelled at the appellant to get out of her house, moved out from beneath him, and pulled up her clothing. LCpl Bailey testified that the appellant woke her up and asked for a ride home about 30 minutes after she had used the head. They both left LCpl D\u2019s apartment at that time.'</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">No other evidence regarding the assault was offered by either side. Instead, civilian defense counsel\u2019s (CDC) cross-examination and closing argument suggested that LCpl D consented to the intercourse, offered several reasons why LCpl D would fabricate the allegation, and highlighted her post-assault communications with the appellant that indicated she was not unhappy with the appellant. The defense did not challenge whether sexual intercourse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">A. Lesser Included Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">We turn first to the specified issue of whether it was appropriate for the military judge to instruct the members on the LIO of battery of which the appellant was ultimately convicted. In addition to the sexual assault allegation regarding LCpl D, the appellant was charged with abusive sexual contact for touching Sgt F\u2019s breasts and sexual assault for inserting his fingers into Sgt F\u2019s vagina while he knew or reasonably should have known that she was sleeping. At the close of evidence, the parties discussed the proposed instructions. To properly resolve the AOE, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>it is necessary to include that discussion here in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">After the trial counsel (TC) requested the LIO instruction of battery for all three specifications under Charge I, the military judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">Okay. Now, let me address them[.] I will get to you in a second [CDC]. Now, as it relates to Specifieation[s] 2 and 3 of Charge I[,] those are both charged as sexual assaults. It is possible for Specification 2 to have as [an LIO] abusive sexual contact. It is not possible for Specification 3 because the definition of sexual act as it relates to Specification 3 does not encompass the specific intent required by abusive sexual contact. So, therefore, abusive sexual contact with what is Specification 3 would have an element not included in the greater offense; it is not an LIO. So, but as to Specification 2 because of the definition of sexual act as it applies to that offense[,] it could apply. And it could apply just if they believe that it was basically touching instead of a penetration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAYt1\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">All right. And then there was evidence concerning voluntary intoxication in that it could negate specific intent required in Specifications 1 and 2 or the LIO of, under Specification 2, of abusive sexual contact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">When the military judge asked if the CDC had \u201cany issues\u201d with the proposed instructions, the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">CDC: Well, ma\u2019am, I guess we probably should of had this discussion before you spent so much time doing the LIO themselves. It was our opinion that the\u2014 straight up it is either abusive sexual contact or not. And actually would object to the instructing on the LIO of ... battery. Either they believe he was taking advantage of her for sexual purposes or not. MJ: Well, here is the thing though, we are introducing voluntary intoxication. So as it relates to Specification^] 1 and 2, voluntary intoxication is offered[.] [I]f they decide that it does in fact negate the intent element would kind of leave us in that realm of ... battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-14\">CDC: But, again, it\u2019s an unwanted touching. I guess in that sense if you\u2019re talking ... battery that somehow or another is unwanted and that his intentions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-15\">MJ: It doesn\u2019t matter what his intent is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-16\">CDC: ,Okay. I understand why you are saying that from a consent standpoint. But I just\u2014really from a defense perspective we prefer it be an all or nothing and not have to mess with the LIO, but that\u2019s our position on that.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">. Prior to instructing the members, the military judge asked the defense if they had \u201canything else,\u201d to which the CDC responded: \u201cI believe,\u2014we asked about the instructions, ma\u2019am, I believe we were actually on the record yesterday as we were discussing those instructions so my objection to including the [LIOs] is arguable [sic].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The military judge stated: \u201cIt\u2019s already in the record? Okay. Thank you.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The military judge apparently overruled the defense objection to the LIO instructions since the members were instructed that battery was an LIO of all three specifications under Charge I.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">The military judge then properly instructed the members that battery was an LIO of the two specifications involving Sgt F, since both required the Government to prove the appellant committed the acts with the \u201cintent to ... arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d The LIO was thus appropriate since, \u201cthe evidence has raised the issue of voluntary intoxication in relation to the offenses alleged in Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge I[.] ...\u201d and such evidence could \u201ccause you to have a reasonable doubt that the accused had the specific intent [required].\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The military judge also correctly instructed that \u201c[voluntary intoxication is not relevant in considering whether the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>emment has proven the elements of Specification 3[.]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Finally, although neither intent nor voluntary intoxication were relevant, the military judge nonetheless instructed the members that battery was an LIO of the sexual assault specification involving LCpl D:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">In order to find the accused guilty of [Specification 3 of Charge I], you must be convinced by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt: One, that ... the accused committed a sexual act upon [LCpl D] to wit: inserting his penis into her vagina; and[ ] [t]wo, that the accused did so when he knew, or reasonably should have known, that [LCpl D] was asleep. In this Specification, \u201csexual act\u201d means the penetration, however slight, of the vulva or anus or the mouth of another by the penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pARU\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">The court is further advised that the offense of ... battery is [an LIO] of the offense set forth in specification\u2014that should say\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014that should say Specification 3 of Charge I.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When you vote, if you find the accused not guilty of the offense charged, that is abusive sexual contact\u2014sorry\u2014and that should say sexual assault\u2014then you should consider the [LIO] of ... battery\u2014 In order to find the accused guilty of this [LIO], you must be convinced by legal and competent evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt: One that ... the accused did bodily harm to [LCpl D]; [t]wo, that the accused did so by touching her vagina; and[] [tjhree, that the bodily harm was done with unlawful force and violence.... The offense charged, sexual assault, and the [LIO of battery] differ in that the offense charged requires as an element that ... the accused committed a sexual act, as I have defined that term for you, while he knew, or reasonably should have known, that B.F. [sic] was asleep; whereas the [LIO of battery] requires only bodily harm, as I\u2019ve defined that term for you.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1S\">During closing argument, the TC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-f\">[L]et\u2019s talk about [LCpl D]. Specification 3 that the accused committed sexual contact upon [LCpl D] by inserting his penis into her vagina and that once again he did it when she was asleep and he knew, or reasonably should have known, that she was asleep. And, members, you will see the definition of sexual act is different here than it was in the previous specification, Specification 2. I want to explain here, it\u2019s a penis. There\u2019s no specific intent, there is no intent to arouse or gratify, it\u2019s just penetration of the vagina by the penis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">The CDC argued that while sexual activity may have taken place, the evidence more reasonably indicated that LCpl D was awake and consenting. Neither party referenced the LIO for this specification during argument. The member\u2019s acquitted the appellant of Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge I, but convicted him of the LIO of battery for Specification 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">In response to the specified issue, the appellant argues that no rational panel could have acquitted him of the greater offense and convicted him of the LIO, because the only evidence presented at trial as to either offense was LCpl D\u2019s testimony that she awoke to discover the appellant\u2019s penis inside of her vagina. \u201cThe defense theory at trial was that any contact between LCpl [D] and [the appellant] was consensual. The extent of the physical contact was not disputed by the defense. The Government put forward no other theory of nonconsensual touching. The only facts in evidence that could establish the LIO are that (1) [the appellant] penetrated LCpl [D\u2019s] vagina with his penis (2) while LCpl [D] was asleep.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Government counters that the evidence presented at trial could lead a rational panel to conclude that the \u201c[a]ppellant indeed touched LCpl [D\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>vagina, but had not fully penetrated it with his penis.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">A military judge has a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to instruct the members on LIOs reasonably raised by the evidence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bean, </em>62 M.J. 264, 266 (C.A.A.F.2005); <em>see also </em>Rule for Courts-Martial 920(e)(3), Manual for Courts-Martial (mcm), United States (2012 ed.). \u201cEvidence \u2018reasonably raises\u2019 a lesser included offense if it could cause members to \u2018attach credit\u2019 or rely upon it if they so choose.\u201d <em>Bean, </em>62 M.J. at 266 (quoting <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 M.J. 202, 205 (C.A.A.F.2000)). Moreover, consistent with <em>Sansone v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 350, 86 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965), a military judge can only instruct on an LIO where the \u201cgreater offense requires the [members] to find a disputed factual element which is not required for conviction of the lesser-induded offense.\u201d (Citations omitted). <em>See also United States v. Tunstall, </em>72 M.J. 191, 195 (C.A.A.F.2013); <em>United States v. Miergrimado, </em>66 M.J. 34, 36 (C.A.A.F.2008); <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>50 M.J. 480, 482 (C.A.A.F.1999); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>12 M.J. 163, 167 (C.M.A.1981); R.C.M. 920(e) Discussion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">We therefore consider whether the evidence \u201creasonably raised\u201d a disputed factual element that distinguished the greater offense of sexual assault from the lesser offense of battery. This issue presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Miller, </em>67 M.J. 385, 387 (C.A.A.F.2009). The parties imply that the appellant failed to object to the LIO instruction at trial and he therefore forfeits the issue absent plain error. We disagree. The defense counsel clearly objected to the LIO instructions and, while he may have utilized the phrase \u201csexual contact,\u201d seemingly referring only to Specification 1 of Charge I, the objection was in response to the TC\u2019s request for the LIO instruction to all three specifications under Charge I. Moreover, the objection re-suited in a conversation regarding sexual acts as well as contact. Finally, the- defense reiterated their objection to the LIOs when the CDC rose to ensure that his objections were \u201con the record.\u201d While not the model of clarity, we find the CDC\u2019s objections adequate to avoid forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">In <em>United States v. Waldron, </em>this court addressed whether the military judge improperly provided an LIO instruction over defense objection when there was no disputed factual issue between the LIO and the greater offense. 9 M.J. 811, 813-18 (N.C.M.R.1980), <em>aff'd, </em>11 M.J. 36 (C.M.A 1981), In that case, the appellant was charged with murder for shooting another in violation of Article 118, UCMJ. It was uncon-troverted that the appellant shot the victim and that the victim died as a result, The only contested element was the lawfulness of the appellant\u2019s use of force insomuch as the appellant argued that he acted in self-defense. Nonetheless, the military judge instructed the panel, over defense objection, on the LIO of assault in which grievous bodily injury was intentionally inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">We reiterated that \u201c[an LIO] instruction is only proper where the charged greater offense requires the jury to find a disputed factual element which is not required for conviction of the [LIO],\u201d and that \u201cDue Process commands that an accused be tried, and the jury instructed, on the facts as disclosed in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814, Determining there was no \u201creasonable interpretation of the evidence which would rationally support instruction upon [the LIO]\u201d since there was \u201cno reasonable \u2018disputed factual element\u2019 between that required to prove the ... offense of which appellant could rationally be found guilty .., and the lesser offense of which the members were advised,\u201d we set aside the appellant\u2019s assault conviction and dismissed the charge. <em>Id. </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">So too here. The act of penetration, which the Government argues distinguishes the greater and lesser included offenses, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>never in dispute. LCpl D testified only that she woke up once the appellant had penetrated her vagina with his penis. Whether the appellant merely \u201ctouched,\u201d as opposed to \u201cpenetrated,\u201d LCpl D\u2019s vagina was simply not raised. As a result, the only factual issue in dispute was the credibility of LCpl D\u2019s allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Nonetheless, the Government now argues that the members may \u201cchoose to believe or disbelieve some or all of any part of a witness\u2019 testimony\u201d and were free to conclude that \u201cthe [a]ppellant indeed touched LCpl [D\u2019s] vagina, but had not fully penetrated it with his penis.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, this contention disregards LCpl D\u2019s clear and uncontested trial testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">Q: What is the next thing you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">A: Waking up with Hackler on top of me and his penis inside of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">Q: And you say \u2018penis inside of you\u2019 are you talking about inside of your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-9\">Q: Are you sure that is what you are feeling at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-10\">A: Yes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Additionally, even if the members chose to partially disbelieve LCpl D\u2019s uncontested testimony regarding penetration, an issue is not disputed merely because the fact finder is free to disbelieve such testimony. <em>Jackson, </em>12 M.J. at 167. While a victim\u2019s credibility will be an issue in nearly every sexual assault case, credibility alone is not enough to place a matter \u201cin dispute.\u201d Instead, a party must present some evidence which \u201creasonably raises\u201d the LIO. This evidence may come from any source, but it must be sufficient that a factfinder could rationally conclude from it that an LIO was committed. <em>Id. </em>Here, there is <em>no </em>such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">We remain committed to the independent duty of the military judge to \u201cscrutinize the evidence ... with great care ... to ensure that the evidence will rationally support the lesser offenses in view of and as distinguished from the greater offense.\u201d <em>Waldron, </em>9 M.J. at 818. On this record, we hold that the LIO of battery, purportedly distinguished by whether penetration occurred, was not reasonably raised by the evidence, and the appellant was prejudiced by the LIO conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">B. Factual Sufficiency of Adultery Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">We disagree with the appellant\u2019s argument that his adultery conviction is legally and factually insufficient since the Government failed to produce evidence that his adulterous conduct was prejudicial to good order and discipline. To convict the appellant of adultery, the members were instructed that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, <em>inter alia, </em>the conduct of the appellant was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The military judge instructed the members that \u201cconduct prejudicial of good order and discipline\u201d was \u201cconduct which causes a reasonably direct and obvious injury to good order and discipline.... To constitute an offense, the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the [appellant\u2019s] adultery was directly prejudicial to good order and discipline. Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline includes adultery that has an obvious and measurably divisive effect on the discipline, morale, or cohesion of a military unit or organization^]\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">We find sufficient evidence for the trier of fact and for us to conclude that the appellant\u2019s actions were prejudicial of good order and discipline. LCpl D testified that she and the appellant were in the same platoon, the appellant\u2019s misconduct impacted the camaraderie of the platoon and hindered her ability to perform her duties, and she became introverted and withdrawn while at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>C. Equal Protection Challenge to Adultery Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">Next, the appellant challenges his adultery conviction as an \u201cequal protection violation,\u201d arguing that adultery charged under Article 134, UCMJ exposes service members in opposite-sex marriages to a harsher punishment than it does to those in a same-sex marriage. The appellant also asserts third party standing to challenge the statute on grounds that it \u201cden[ies] homosexuals marriage on the same terms and conditions\u201d as heterosexuals.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Government responds that, since \u201csexual intercourse\u201d may be defined so as to include sodomy, the two groups are not treated differently and that the appellant lacks third-party standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Since the appellant raises this challenge for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error, <em>United States v. Goings, </em>72 M.J. 202, 205 (C.A.A.F.2013), requiring the appellant to establish that there was error, that the error was plain and obvious, and that the error materially prejudiced his substantial rights, <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>70 M.J. 296, 304 (C.A.A.F.2011). In conducting our plain error review, we review the constitutionality of this offense <em>de novo. Goings, </em>72 M.J. at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o state shall ... deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. This principle is made applicable to federal government action through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Vance v. Bradley, </em>440 U.S. 93, 95 n.1, 99 S.Ct. 939, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979); <em>Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, </em>426 U.S. 88,100, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976); <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 682, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973); <em>Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); <em>see also United States v.

The constitutional guarantee of equal protection is \u201cgenerally designed to ensure that the Government treats \u2018similar persons in a similar manner.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Gray, </em>51 M.J. 1, 22 (C.A.A.F.1999) (citing R. Rotunda and J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure, 2d \u00a7 18.38 at 488; \u00a7 18:41 at 496 (1992)); <em>see also Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (stating the guarantee of equal protection directs that \u201call persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Once properly raised, courts apply the requisite level of scrutiny to determine whether disparate treatment complies with the protections afforded the appellant by the constitutional principles of equal protection. However, the appellant must first establish that he was treated differently than persons \u201csimilarly circumstanced.\u201d <em>See e.g., Williams v. Morton, </em>343 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Arnold v. City of Columbia, </em>197 F.3d 1217, 1220 (8th Cir.1999) (\u201cTo prove their equal protection claim, appellants were required, as a threshold matter, to demonstrate that they were treated differently from others similarly situated to them.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Lecolst, </em>4 M.J. 800, 801 (N.C.M.R.1978). Here, the appellant has failed to meet this preliminary burden so our analysis begins and ends there.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b903-17\">Assuming without deciding that service members in same-sex and opposite-sex marriages are similarly situated insofar as they are members of legal marriages, we turn to the appellant\u2019s threshold burden of showing that adultery, charged under Article 134, treats him differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">The appellant argues that adultery does not apply to service members with same-sex spouses because the offense requires \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d which he claims is defined such that only members of the opposite sex may perform the act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As a result, the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>claims service members who engage in wrongful, extramarital sexual conduct which would otherwise violate adultery if that conduct were sexual intercourse, are subject only to a lesser maximum punishment of a general disorder for essentially the same offense.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">' This notion, however, fails to consider fully the scope of Article 134, which proscribes all \u201cdisorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces; [and] conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 738 n.4, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (citing 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934). \u201c[Cjonsonant with his authority to act as commander-in-chief and his duty to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\u2019 U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3,\u201d <em>Goings, </em>72 M.J. at 206, the President has listed several \u201cways in which Article 134, UCMJ, might be charged,\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>68 M.J. 465, 472 (C.A.A.F.2010). In doing so, the President does not create a substantive criminal offense, but simply provides \u201cguidance to judge advocates under his command regarding potential violations of the article\u201d by \u201cmerely indicating various circumstances in which the elements of Article 134, UCMJ could be met.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>68 M.J. at 471-72; <em>United States v. Fosler, </em>70 M.J. 225, 231 (C.A.A.F.2011) (\u201c[T]he President does not have the authority to decide questions of substantive criminal law.\u201d). Adultery is but one such circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">However, the Presidents listing one example does not preclude charging similar conduct under Article 134. In fact, any service member may be charged with a sexual act that violates Article 134\u2019s terminal element, provided the alleged conduct is not preempted <em>(see </em>MCM pt. IV, \u00b6600(5)\u215b); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>68 M.J. 378, 386-87 (C.A.A.F.2010)), and the notice requirement is satisfied <em>(United States v. Vaughan, </em>58 M.J. 29, 31 (C.A.A.F.2003)). <em>See, </em>MCM Part IV, \u00b6 60c.(6)(c) (\u201cif conduct by an accused does not fall under any of the listed offenses ... a specification not listed in this Manual may be used to allege the offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Warner, </em>73 M.J. 1, 3 (C.A.A.F.2013) (\u201cIt is settled that a service member may be prosecuted for ... conduct even if the conduct is not specifically listed in the [MCM],\u201d since the \u201cfirst and second clauses of Article 134, UCMJ, permit the criminalization of certain conduct not otherwise prohibited!.]\u201d). Therefore, contrary to the appellant\u2019s position, Article 134 does not limit charging service members in same-sex marriages who engage in extramarital sexual infidelity prejudicial of good order and discipline or of a nature to be service discrediting with a general disorder violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Nor is adultery\u2019s maximum punishment limited to service members in opposite-sex marriages. Article 56, UCMJ, provides: \u201c[t]he punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense.\u201d In R.C.M. 1003(c), the President provides the relevant guidance on those limits, noting that the maximum punishment for each listed offense is \u201cset forth for each offense.\u201d R.C.M. 1003(c)(l)(A)(i). An. adultery conviction carries a maximum punishment of confinement for one year, total forfeitures, and a dishonorable discharge. MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 62(e). For an offense not listed, the maximum punishment is the same as any \u201cclosely related\u201d offense listed elsewhere in Part IV, if one exists. R.C.M. 1003(c)(l)(B)(i). <em>See also United States v. Bivins, </em>49 M.J. 328, 332 (C.A.A.F.1998) (finding the appellant can be prosecuted for a novel offense under Article 134 and subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to the maximum punishment for the most closely related offense listed in Article 134.); <em>United States v. Ettleson, </em>13 M.J. 348, 367 (C.M.A.1982) (observing that even if the court adopted a different interpretation of a term in a listed offense, it would result in a \u201cclosely-related\u201d offense subject to the same maximum punishment.). We compare the elements of the offenses in question to determine if they are \u201cclosely-related,\u201d <em>United States v. Busch, </em>75 M.J. 87 (C.A.A.F.2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Considering the scope of Article 134 and the mechanics of R.C.M. 1003(c)(l)(B)(i), the appellant has not established that the maximum punishment he faced for his adultery conviction would necessarily be different than that faced by any'service member who committed similar extramarital conduct, including marital infidelity involving oral or anal sex, This is especially so if the factors that the President listed as relevant to determining whether adulterous conduct is prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces were used in the process. <em>See </em>MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 62(c)(2). Thus, he has failed to establish error.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">D. Sentence Reassessment</p>\n<p id=\"AkCM\">Having set aside the appellant\u2019s conviction for battery, we must next determine whether we are able to reassess his sentence. Our superior court has repeatedly held that if we \u201ccan determine to [our] satisfaction that, absent any error, the sentence adjudged would have been of at least a certain severity, then a sentence of that severity or less will be free of the prejudicial effects of error; and the demands of Article 59(a) will be met.\u201d <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305, 308 (C.M.A.1986). This analysis is based on a totality of the circumstances with the following as illustrative factors: dramatic changes in the penalty landscape and exposure; the forum; whether the remaining offenses capture the gravamen of the criminal conduct; whether significant or aggravating circumstances remain admissible and relevant, and; whether the remaining offenses are the type-that we as appellate judges have experience -and familiarity with' to reliably determine what sentence would have b\u00e9en imposed at tidal. <em>United States v. Winckelmann, </em>73 M.J. 11, 15-16 (C.A.A.F.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">As aggravation evidence,' the TC offered the appellant\u2019s service record and LCpl D\u2019s impact testimony,'which included the'following: she was sectioned off since raising the allegations and unable to .work within her occupational specialty, including deployment training, resulting in her inability to deploy; she was diagnosed with'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, attended mental health appointments every two weeks, and was prescribed anti-depressants as a result of the appellant\u2019s misconduct; and many of the Marines in her platoon \u201ctook [the appellant\u2019s side] and thus made it hard for her to \u201cmake friends\u201d or do her job.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Conversely, the defense established that LCpl D continued to engage in communication with the appellant after the incident; was pregnant (and so ineligible to deploy) \u201cwithin a couple of months\u201d afterwards; and remained actively engaged in social activities with other Marines.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">This court has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d when reassessing sentences. <em>Id. at </em>12. The maximum punishment for the now-dismissed battery conviction was six months of confinement, while the maximum confinement for adultery is 12 months. While the adultery charge may not capture the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the original allegations, the members opted to award the appellant no confinement at all. Well-familiar with the range of sentences awarded for adultery, we can determine to our satisfaction that, absent the battery conviction, the sentence adjudged would have been of at least a certain severity.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">E. Error in Convening Authority\u2019s Action</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">The results of trial, the staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation, and. the convening authority\u2019s action all fail to reflect that the military judge dismissed the language \u201cand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d from the adultery specification.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We test these plain errors under a harmless-error standard. <em>United States v. Crumpley, </em>49 M.J. 538, 539 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1998). The appellant alleges no prejudice resulting from the errors and we find none. However, the appellant is entitled to accurate court-martial records. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The appellant\u2019s conviction on Specification 3 of Charge I for assault consummated by a \u2022battery is set aside. Charge I and Specification 3 thereunder are dismissed- with prejudice. The remaining finding and only so much of the sentence as provides for reduction to pay grade E-l are affirmed. The supplemental promulgating order shall reflect that the military judge dismissed the language \u201cand of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d from the Specification of Charge II.</p>\n<judges id=\"b906-6\">Chief-Judge BRUBAKER, Senior Judge FISCHER, Judge MARKS, Judge RUGH, Judge PALMER, and Judge CAMPBELL concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-13\">.
