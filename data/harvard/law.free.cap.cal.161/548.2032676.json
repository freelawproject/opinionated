All the necessary steps were taken; summons was published pursuant to\" order of court and the cause was set for trial. Respondent refused to proceed with the hearing of the cause on the ground that the affidavit accompanying the complaint was insufficient to give the superior court jurisdiction of the action. In our examination of the questions arising out of the court\u2019s action in this regard it will be necessary to scrutinize some of the provisions of\u2018the McEnerney Act. (Stats. 1906, Extra Sess., p. 78.) Section 1 of that act provides that in ease of the loss or destruction of public records by flood, fire, or earthquake, an action such as petitioner sought to inaugurate may be maintained by \u201cany person who claims an estate of inheritance\u201d or for life in, and who is by himself or his tenant, or other person, holding -under him, in the actual and peaceable possession of any real property.\u201d Section 2 prescribes the manner of commencing the action, which must be by filing a \u201cverified complaint,\u201d containing, among other things, \u201ca statement of the facts enumerated in section one\u201d of the act, \u201ca particular description of such real property and a specification of the estate, title or interest of the plaintiff therein.\u201d Section 5 provides for filing with the complaint an affidavit of the plaintiff, fully and explicitly \u201csetting forth and showing\u201d certain things, among them being \u201cthe character of his estate, right, title, interest or claim in, and possession of the property, during what period the same has existed and from whom obtained.\u201d Section 15 of said act is as follows: \u201cAn executor, administrator or guardian, or other person holding the possession of property in the right of another, may main-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tain, as plaintiff, and may appear and defend in the action herein provided for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In her verified complaint plaintiff mentioned and described by metes and bounds five parcels of land in the city and county of San Francisco. Respecting three of these parcels she alleged that she was \u201cby herself in the actual and peaceable possession of\u201d them, and \u201cclaimed an estate of inheritance in\u201d them. She alleged similar estate of inheritance in the other lots and averred that she was \u201cby her tenants holding under her in the actual and peaceable possession of\u201d them. Her affidavit contained the following statement: \u201cThat the character of her estate, right, title, interest and claim in, and possession of all those portions of the real property described in the complaint herein and therein designated \u2018Parcel One,' \u2018Parcel Two\u2019 and \u2018Parcel Three,\u2019 is a fee simple absolute.\u201d Respecting the first parcel the affidavit sets forth the fact that it was obtained by grant, bargain, and sale deed to herself and husband of equal undivided shares on April 9, 1900, followed by her husband\u2019s gift deed to her July 29, 1900. Then occurs the statement that \u201csaid estates, rights, titles, interests and claims in and possession of said property . . . has existed since the dates of said two deedsas to parcel two it is averred \u201cthat said estate,\u201d etc., \u201cand possession of said property . . . has existed since the 21st day of April, A. D. 1903.\u201d This is followed by a recital that said interests and possession were obtained by a grant, bargain, and sale deed of that date from a certain named grantor, followed July 7, 1903, by deed of gift from her husband. There is a later allegation that her possession had existed since the dates of the two deeds aforesaid. Of parcel three the affidavit alleges the distribution to plaintiff of a one-fourth interest from her mother\u2019s estate on a specified date and the obtaining of the remaining interests in fee simple by certain deeds, giving the dates thereof, and contains the statement that \u201csaid estates, rights, titles, interests and claims in and possession of said real property designated [Parcel Three\u2019 have existed since the delivery of said deed from Gustave Paturel, the dates of said two deeds from Alexis Paturel and Emile Paturel, and of said decree of distribution.\u201d Of parcels four and five the affidavit contains the statement that plaintiff obtained an undivided one-fourth interest in each from the estate of her mother by a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>decree of distribution, giving the date, and regarding each parcel she alleges that \u201csaid estate, right, title, interest and claim in and possession of said real property . . . has existed since the said date of said decree of distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Eespondent contends that the affidavit in a case of this kind must contain all the facts required by section 5 of the McEnemey Act, and that plaintiff\u2019s affidavit does not comply with the statute in that it does not set forth the character of Mrs. Soher\u2019s possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We do not think section 5 of the act requires the affidavit to show the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the possession of the plaintiff. The requirement is that there shall be an affidavit filed \u201csetting forth and showing\u201d certain things, among which is \u201cthe character of his estate, right, title, interest, or claim in, and possession of the property.\u201d The reasonable construction of this appears to us to be that the word \u201ccharacter\u201d has no reference to the word \u201cpossession,\u201d and that the only requirement as to possession is that the affidavit shall show possession. This we think is sufficiently done by the affidavit before us to answer all objections on the ground of want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">It is asserted that plaintiff did not allege from whom she obtained possession. Her affidavit showed her interest in parcels one, two, and three to be fee simple absolute. Of parcels four and five she showed by her affidavit an undivided one-fourth interest in each of them derived from her mother\u2019s estate, and alleged possession from the date of the decree of distribution of March 20, 1905. Here was certainly no ambiguity. In setting forth her interest in the two first named parcels she described in each instance her deeds with their dates and the places, books, and pages of their recordation, and alleged that her possession had existed since their dates, and with reference to parcel 3 she followed the same plan, except the decree of distribution was included with the deeds in the averment of the date of her possession. At most, her failure to name the one of her grantors who actually placed her in possession and the exact date of such possession is an ambiguity which cannot be reached in this proceeding. At any rate, regarding these three parcels, she stated a title in fee which gave her the right to possession following the deed of latest date, and she averred possession from a time not later than the completion of her title in fee simple absolute. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>was a sufficient compliance with the statute, which is \u201cdesigned for the benefit of the defendants in enabling them, by verifying plaintiff\u2019s claim, to prevent fraud and safeguard their rights.\u201d <em>Potrero Nuevo Land Co. </em>v. <em>All Persons etc., </em>158 Cal. 736, [112 Pac. 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">It follows that the demurrer of respondent to the petition herein should be overruled and a writ of mandate issue as prayed for, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Angellotti, J., Shaw, J., Henshaw, J., Sloss, J., and Lorigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
