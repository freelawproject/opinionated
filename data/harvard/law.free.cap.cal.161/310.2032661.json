While it is true that the information charges a crime punishable by death, neither judgment of death nor any other judgment has yet been rendered. The constitution gives us appellate jurisdiction \u201cin all criminal eases <em>where judgment of death has teen rendered,\u201d </em>and gives to the district courts of appeal jurisdiction \u201cin all criminal cases prosecuted by indictment or information in a court qf record, excepting criminal eases where judgment of death has been rendered.\u201d (Const., art. VI, see. 4.) It is clear that the appeal should have been taken to the district court of appeal for the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>district, instead of to this court, and it must now be transferred to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">It is ordered that the cause be transferred from this court to the district court of appeal for the first district.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Shaw, J., Melvin, J., Sloss, J., and Lorigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
