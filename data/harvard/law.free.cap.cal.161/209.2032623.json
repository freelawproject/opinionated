The defect in the undertaking which it is contended thus completely destroys it is this: The instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>provides that the sureties will pay all costs and damages awarded against \u201cthe defendant,\u201d whereas the plaintiff being the appellant it should have read \u201cplaintiff\u201d or \u201cappellant.\u201d That this palpable error is not sufficient to vitiate the undertaking and render it a nullity is decided in <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>8 Cal. 549, under facts and circumstances well nigh identical with those here presented. It follows, therefore, that the error rendered the undertaking merely defective and not a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Under section 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the ease in the justice\u2019s court was assigned for trial to Justice A. B. Treadwell. Subsequently the sureties justified before Justice Isadore Golden, another justice of the same justice\u2019s court. This was after due notice to the defendant. It is contended that this justification was a nullity, but section 92 of the same code expressly provides that \u201csureties on appeal, or on any bond, or undertaking given in any cause or proceeding in said court, when required to justify, may justify before any one of the justices.\u201d The justification, therefore, was not a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">It is made to appear that a corrected undertaking, by leave of the court first had, was filed in the superior court before which the appeal was pending. This was permissible procedure and cured the error complained of <em>(Coulter </em>v. <em>Stark, </em>7 Cal. 245; <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>86 Cal. 74, [24 Pac. 845]).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Wherefore, the relief prayed for is denied and the writ discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
