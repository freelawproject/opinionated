Gibson <em>v. </em>Henry T. Thomson et al., appealed to the said superior court from the justice\u2019s court of Round Valley Township, county of Mendocino. In his petition Thomson prayed for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>and for mandate to compel the setting of the appealed case for trial in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The action in the justice\u2019s court was in claim and delivery. Trial was had before a jury and a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was rendered on June 25, 1910. On the same day the justice of the peace made an entry in his docket as follows:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cJune 25. Court called and a jury of twelve men sworn to try the ease. After hearing the evidence they brought in a verdict for plaintiff for the return of the horse or $100.00 in lieu thereof, and costs of suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">On June 27th plaintiff served and filed his memorandum of ' costs. On June 30th defendant Thomson\u2019s attorneys prepared his notice of appeal to the superior court and served it upon plaintiff. Thomson\u2019s attorneys also caused an undertaking on appeal in the sum of three hundred dollars to be prepared. About July 18th the notice of appeal was sent to the justice of the peace by the attorneys for Thomson, accompanied by a letter, in which he was requested to make sure that the judgment was entered as of June 25, 1910, and to file the notice of appeal before filing the bond. Similar directions were sent with the form of appeal-bond to the defendant, who caused it to be signed by two sureties. It was then given to the justice for filing. The undertaking, however, was filed July 18, 1910, and the notice of appeal on July 20th, nineteen days after service of said notice on the plaintiff. On the fifteenth day of August, 1910, the justice of the peace entered in his docket a formal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">These proceedings were duly certified to the superior court, and respondent in that cause moved said court to dismiss the appeal upon the grounds that: 1. It was premature, as no judgment had been entered on June 25, 1910, and no appeal had been taken within thirty days after the entry of judgment of August 15, 1910; and that; 2. No undertaking on appeal had been filed with the justice of the peace. The motion was granted upon both grounds, the court basing the ruling as to the second ground upon the circumstance that the undertaking was filed before and not within thirty days after the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the notice of appeal. The superior court also denied appellant Thomson\u2019s motion to set the cause for trial. In the answer to the petition herein, counsel for respondent point out the fact that the undertaking on appeal, although it contains a form of verification signed by both sureties, shows no signature to the jurat by the justice of the peace, or any other person empowered to administer and certify oaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The most important question for consideration is whether or not the entry of the verdict by the justice of the peace on June 25, 1910, was a sufficient compliance with the law\u2019s requirement that the judgment shall be entered. Section 893 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that, \u201cThe judgment of a justice of the peace must be entered substantially in the form required in section 667, and where the defendant is subject to arrest and imprisonment thereon, the fact must be stated in the judgment. No judgment shall have effect for any purpose until so entered.\u201d The last sentence was added to the section in 1907. Respondent contends that by the addition of the final sentence the legislature intended to place appeals from justices\u2019 courts upon the same footing as those taken from judgments of the superior court, and to make the section above quoted analogous to section 664 of the same code. He insists, therefore, that an appeal taken from a judgment in a justice\u2019s court prior to the final entry of such judgment is premature and must be dismissed (citing <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Adkins, </em>117 Cal. 228, [49 Pac. 2]; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Staacke, </em>137 Cal. 307, [70 Pac. 171]; <em>Estate of More, </em>143 Cal. 493, [77 Pac. 407]). In reply-to the contention that the memorandum of the jury\u2019s verdict in the docket is practically an entry of the judgment, he insists that since section 667 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to which reference is made by section 893 of the same code, prescribes the form of a judgment the form has become substance (citing <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>118 Cal. 624, [50 Pac. 761]). Our attention is also called to the fact that the justice is required to enter in his docket separately \u201cthe verdict of the jury and when received\u201d and \u201cthe judgment of the court, specifying the costs included and the time when rendered.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 911, subds. 8 and 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Petitioner calls our attention to <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>41 Cal. 233, and <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal. 407, [9 Pac. 720], as having settled the question here presented. But respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>insists that those decisions are not now in point, because they dealt with the law as it existed before the mandatory provision contained in the last sentence of section 893 of the Code of Civil Procedure had become a part of that section. The former case was one in which there was an attempt to set aside a sale made under an execution issued from a justice\u2019s court on the ground that no formal entry of judgment had been made prior to the issuance of execution. Whether there could be an appeal from a judgment when no judgment had been entered was not considered. The case of <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal. 407, [9 Pac. 720], was considered by the district court of appeal of the third appellate district in the recent case of <em>June </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>16 Cal. App. 126, [116 Pac. 293], The court was considering a case exactly like the one before us in the particular that an attempted appeal from a judgment of a justice\u2019s court had been dismissed for want of jurisdiction where the transcript of the justice\u2019s docket showed only an .entry of the verdict of the jury. The court by Mr. Presiding Justice Chipman said:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u25a0 \u201cSection 974, Code of Civil Procedure, provides that: \u2018any party dissatisfied with a judgment rendered in a civil action in a police or justice\u2019s court, may appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county, at any time within thirty days after the rendition of the judgment.\u2019 And the notice must state whether \u2018the appeal is taken from the whole or a part of the judgment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\u201cSection 891, Code of Civil Procedure, reads: \u2018When a trial by a jury has been had, judgment must be entered by the justice at once, in conformity with the verdict.\u2019 And the judgment \u2018must be entered substantially in the form required in section six hundred and sixty-seven. ... No judgment shall have effect for any purpose until so entered.\u2019 (Sec. 893, Code Civ. Proc.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201cIt seems to us that the appeal was prematurely taken and that the superior court did not acquire jurisdiction thereby. <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal. 407, [9 Pac. 720], is cited by petitioner in support of the claim that the verdict was a judgment within the meaning of the statute. In that case the justice\u2019s docket contained the following entry: \u2018Jury fees paid by defendant and judgment entered for the defendant for costs of suit. Defendant\u2019s costs being $25, for witness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>jury fees, and also the sum of $1.75 for constable fees, total $26.75. Plaintiff\u2019s costs being $17.\u2019 It further appears that the petitioner went to trial in the superior court and, without objection to the regularity of any proceedings, defended the ease on its merits. Said the court: \u2018Having thus taken the chances of obtaining a verdict in his favor, we think his objection now comes too late.\u2019 It was also held that the court had jurisdiction because the justice\u2019s record showed \u2018that a judgment had been entered in conformity with the verdict, and appears to be in all respects regular and sufficient.\u2019 We do not think that the justice must formulate a judgment with that particularity required of judgments required to be entered in the superior court, but that he should make some entry in his docket showing that he has rendered judgment on the verdict we do think is essential to a substantial compliance with the statute. His duty to enter judgment is in a sense ministerial, and its performance could probably be enforced by mandate, but, nevertheless, the statute requires this of him. Until such entry is made there is no judgment from which an appeal may be taken and, if the appeal is taken before the justice enters judgment on the verdict, it confers no jurisdiction on the superior court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">We see no escape from, the conclusion reached in the above case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Our attention has been called to the difference between section 939 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 974 of the same code, the one providing that an appeal from a judgment in a court of record may not be taken until after the <em>entry </em>of judgment, while the time for an appeal from a judgment in a justice\u2019s court begins to run upon its <em>rendition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We think it is apparent from an examination of the section of our code relating to justices\u2019 courts, that a judgment therein-is not \u201crendered\u201d until it is \u201centered,\u201d or can legally be held to be \u201centered.\u201d There is no other way of \u201crendering\u201d a judgment in such a court. (See secs. 891, 892, and 893, Code Civ. Proc.) It is in this sense that the word should be held to be used in section 974 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Doubtless it is the justice\u2019s duty to enter the judgment promptly. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 891.) But until he does so, there is no \u201crendition\u201d of the judgment, in the sense used in section 974. If he refuse, he may be compelled to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Our conclusion upon the point discussed above makes it unnecessary to review the other questions presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">Let the writ be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Angellotti, J., Lorigan, J., Sloss, J., Shaw, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
