The dispositive issue is whether the defendant was entitled to a court-appointed expert\u2019s examination of the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>child victim when, during the child\u2019s testimony, her ability to testify reliably in the presence of the defendant suddenly came into question. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant was entitled to such an examination. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>55 Conn. App. 717, 740 A.2d 458 (1999). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>252 Conn. 944, 747 A.2d 523 (2000). On appeal before this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly: (1) concluded that the trial court had properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance in order to prepare for an unexpected hearing on whether to videotape the testimony of the victim pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) concluded that the trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for an examination of the victim by a court-appointed expert; (3) affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial; (4) affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to redact portions of the pretrial videotape of the interview of the victim; and (5) concluded that the record was inadequate to review the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court had violated the defendant\u2019s rights under Practice Book \u00a7 40-13 (d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution and the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by precluding the defendant from presenting six character witnesses. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court as to the first two issues and, therefore, need not reach the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the relevant facts. \u201cFrom September through November, 1994, the defendant\u2019s daughter-in-law left her four year old daughter, M, and her one and one-half year old son, A, with the defendant and his wife, the children\u2019s grandparents, while she went to work part-time. When the defendant and his wife took care of the children, the children would spend the prior night with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u201cOn or about November 10, 1994, when M\u2019s mother came to the grandparents\u2019 house to take the children home, the defendant\u2019s wife told M\u2019s mother that M had wet her pants while playing. M\u2019s mother decided to wait until she got home to change M. She gave both A and M baths. While drying M, she noticed that M\u2019s vaginal area was red and puffy, and asked what was wrong with her \u2018pee-pee.\u2019 M responded that she did not know, but when asked if someone had touched her there, M responded, \u2018Yes.\u2019 When M\u2019s mother asked who had touched her, M responded that the defendant had touched her.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u201cElaine Yordan, a physician, examined M on November 21, 1994. Yordan found that M\u2019s vaginal area was normal and noted that her finding was not inconsistent with M\u2019s statement. The next day, Diane Edell, program coordinator and interviewer at the child abuse diagnostic center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, interviewed M. That interview was videotaped. M stated that the defendant had touched her \u2018pee-pee\u2019 with his hand while they were lying on a couch.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bron</em>son, supra, 55 Conn. App. 719-20. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a court-appointed expert\u2019s examination of M. The defendant argues that this examination was necessary because M\u2019s breakdown on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>witness stand was a complete surprise to all parties and was in direct conflict with the state expert\u2019s prior assessment of the child\u2019s ability to testify reliably. As a result of that assessment, no hearing pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988) (evidentiary hearing necessary for state to demonstrate compelling need for excluding defendant from room during videotaping of minor victim\u2019s testimony) was held prior to the trial, and M began her testimony in the defendant\u2019s presence. The defendant claims that the denial of his request was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. We agree, and we conclude that because the request for expert examination should have been granted, we necessarily are compelled to conclude that the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance also was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to trial, the state had informed the court and the defendant that videotaping M\u2019s testimony would not be necessary. This was determined pursuant to the state\u2019s representation that M\u2019s treating therapist had assessed that M was emotionally capable of testifying in open court.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On Friday, September 13, 1996, the state called M as its first witness. During direct examination, M was able to testify regarding general subjects, such as her name and birthday, and was able to give information about her school and family. When the prosecutor began to question her about the sexual assault, however, M began to cry, and Linda Heslin, the victim\u2019s advocate, came up to the witness stand, picked up the child and left the courtroom.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>excused the jury, stating: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, it\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>become clear to us that we\u2019re not going to be able to resume the testimony at this point . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">When court reconvened, the state moved for a hearing pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 683, to determine whether the state would be permitted to videotape the remainder of M\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g. Eleven minutes later, the defendant moved for a continuance until the next court session in order to conduct legal research in preparation for this hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and held the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing that same afternoon. At the hearing, defense counsel moved for an expert examination of M. The trial court responded, \u201cI just don\u2019t think expert testimony is required based on what\u2019s been said here. We\u2019ve got laypeople testifying. It\u2019s based on their observations of the child in the court, and I don\u2019t think a further continuance is necessary.\u201d As a result of the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, M\u2019s testimony was videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying: (1) his request for a continuance; and (2) his request for appointment of an expert to examine M. We conclude that, under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, the appointment of an expert to examine M was required. That conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to consider the denial of the continuance separate from the question of the denial of the appointment of an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g, the trial court is afforded the discretion necessary to grant a motion to have a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>victim testify outside of the presence of the defendant. \u201cThe [ability] of a witness [to testify reliably] is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>241 Conn. 823, 836, 699 A.2d 893 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In the exercise of this discretion, the trial court must conduct an assessment of the victim\u2019s reliability as a witness pursuant to the test set forth in <em>Jarzbek. </em>\u201cWe . . . mandate a case-by-case analysis, whereby a trial court must balance the individual defendant\u2019s right of confrontation against the interest of the state in obtaining reliable testimony from the particular minor victim in question. ... [A] trial court must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. In order to satisfy its burden of proving compelling need, the state must show that the minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seriously called into question. Furthermore, the state bears the burden of proving such compelling need by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 704-705.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">To this end, the trial court has the discretion to order an expert\u2019s examination or to grant a party\u2019s request for such an examination. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 836, we held that a trial court has the discretion to order that a child witness be examined by an expert witness before deciding whether to grant the state\u2019s <em>Jarzbek </em>motion. We concluded that the defendant was entitled to have the examination of the child victim by the defense\u2019s own expert. Id. We stated that it was an issue of \u201cfundamental fairness to the defendant [that] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>required that [the expert] be allowed to examine [the alleged victim].\u201d Id. \u201cIf the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony, he is entitled to have the trial court ensure that such a hearing is meaningful because, as we recognized in <em>Jarzbek, </em>the hearing on the motion serves to protect the right of an accused to confront witnesses against him as guaranteed by the confrontation clause of both the federal and state constitutions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Furthermore, we note that the criteria to be assessed in this evaluation must not include the possible trauma the victim might experience by testifying in the presence of the defendant. \u201c[I]n light of the constitutional right of confrontation at stake here, the primary focus of the trial court\u2019s inquiry must be on the <em>reliability </em>of the minor victim\u2019s testimony, not on the <em>injury </em>that the victim may suffer by testifying in the presence of the accused.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 705. Thus, it is not sufficient that the victim cried. The inquiry must be allowed to go further and determine whether there is a loss of the witness\u2019 reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The defendant argues that the state failed to prove that M was incapable of providing reliable testimony while in the defendant\u2019s presence. The defendant claims that because M\u2019s breakdown while on the witness stand was so unexpected in light of her therapist\u2019s evaluation, he was therefore entitled to an objective expert\u2019s opinion of M\u2019s reliability. The state argued that such an examination was not warranted. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s request for an expert\u2019s assessment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The standards that we articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 823, as applied to the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>case, lead us to conclude that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for an expert examination of M; (2) the defendant cannot be required to establish a particular harm in the circumstances of this case; and (3) these conclusions compel the further conclusion that the continuance should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>Marquis, </em>we held that \u201ca trial court has the discretion, under . . . <em>Jarzbek . . </em>. and ... \u00a7 54-86g, to order that a child witness be examined by an expert witness for the defense before deciding whether to grant the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g (a).\u201d Id., 824-25. \u201c[I]n criminal prosecutions involving the alleged sexual abuse of children of tender years, the practice of videotaping the testimony of a minor victim outside the physical presence of the defendant is, in appropriate circumstances, constitutionally permissible. [The] holding that appropriate circumstances may warrant a departure from strict compliance with confrontation requirements does not, however, signal a relaxation of the underlying evidentiary requirement that appropriate circumstances be proven to exist. . . . There is no constitutional justification for automatically depriving all criminal defendants of the right of physical confrontation during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u201c[A] trial court must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. In order to satisfy its burden of proving compelling need, the state must show that the minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seriously called into question. Furthermore, the state bears the burden of proving such compelling need by clear and convine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ing evidence. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 240, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (1967) (application of clear and convincing standard to questions of admissibility involving constitutional requirements going to reliability of evidence); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thevis, </em>[665 F.2d 616, 631 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1008, 102 S. Ct. 2300, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1303 (1982)] (application of clear and convincing standard to determine whether defendant waived right of confrontation by reason of his own misconduct). . . . [I]n light of the constitutional right of confrontation at stake here, the primary focus of the trial court\u2019s inquiry must be on the reliability of the minor victim\u2019s testimony .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 704-705. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>\u201cJarzbek </em>requires an individualized, case-by-case assessment of the need to resort to the videotaping of the complaining minor witness\u2019 testimony outside the physical presence of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 58-59, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. [2103], [104] L. Ed. 2d [664] (1989). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 563-65, 560 A.2d 426 (1989), we compared \u00a7 54-86h to rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides in relevant part that [e]very person is competent to be a witness .... We noted that [t]his rule reflects the philosophy that few persons are inherently incapable of testifying in a useful manner. Comment, The Competency Requirement for the Child Victim of Sexual Abuse: Must We Abandon It?, 40 U. Miami L. Rev. 245, 252 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 563. We also noted, however, that [r]ule 601 has not been construed to remove wholly the traditional control a judge may exercise to ensure that evidence presented to a jury has at least a minimum degree of reliability and relevance. Id., 564. The trial court maintains the authority to admit or exclude the testimony of a child based on the court\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s ability to offer relevant and reliable evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>dence. By requesting permission to videotape [the victim\u2019s] testimony outside the presence of the defendant, the state called into question [the victim\u2019s] ability to testify reliably in a formal courtroom setting and in the presence of the defendant. In such a situation, the trial court has the authority to take those measures it considers necessary to determine that ability. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u201cThe [ability] of a witness [to testify reliably] is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>115 Conn. 672, 675, 163 A. 256 [1932], <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 115, 291 A.2d 750 (1971). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201c[T]he ends of justice will best be served by a system . . . [that] gives both parties the maximum possible amount of information with which to prepare their cases and thereby reduces the possibility of surprise at trial. See, e.g., Brennan, The Criminal Prosecution: Sporting Event or Quest for Truth?, 1963 Wash. U.L.Q. 279; American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial 23-43 (Approved Draft 1970); Goldstein, The State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in Criminal Procedure, 69 Yale L.J. 1149 (1960). <em>Wardius </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 473-74, 93 S. Ct. 2208, 37 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1973). [I]n the absence of a strong showing of state interests to the contrary, discovery must be a two-way street. Id., 475.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 833-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The court held the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing only a very short time after M had been removed from the stand. At that hearing, M\u2019s father testified that she was \u201c[v]ery uncomfortable\u201d testifying in the defendant\u2019s presence, and that he did not know if she was fearful. Heslin testified that M was \u201cmad at [the defendant] and scared to go back [into the courtroom].\u201d This evidence suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>from the fact that it came from persons focused, not on the necessity of ensuring the reliability of M\u2019s testimony, but on M\u2019s needs. Furthermore, it was based on a veiy short period of time in which the inquiry into that reliability could be made. Thus, insofar as the record discloses, there was no inquiry into the possibility that, despite what had occurred while M was on the stand, she might, within a reasonable time period, such as the ensuing weekend, recover sufficiently to resume the stand and testify in the defendant\u2019s presence. In addition, the state had earlier represented to the court that M\u2019s treating therapist had determined that M <em>was </em>capable of testifying in the defendant\u2019s presence. Thus, at the point in the proceedings at which the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing was held, there was on record an expert\u2019s opinion to that effect, and the immediately preceding occurrences were not sufficient, in content and length, conclusively to rebut that opinion. Given all these facts, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for a second expert to be appointed to assess M\u2019s ability to testify reliably in the defendant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">With respect to whether this ruling of the trial court harmed the defendant, we conclude that, in these particular circumstances, harm may be presumed. It would be impossible for the defendant to establish now that, had the motion been granted, the court-appointed expert would have testified that M could have testified in the defendant\u2019s presence. Thus, in this circumstance, where the court abused its discretion in denying the motion, we must presume the requisite prejudice to the defendant to require reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">This conclusion also controls the defendant\u2019s separate claim that the court abused its discretion in denying his antecedent motion for a continuance. In light of our conclusion that the court should have granted the motion to appoint an expert to examine the child, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>follows that a continuance for that purpose, if for no other, was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the fourth degree when: (1) Such person intentionally subjects another person to sexual contact who is (A) under fifteen years of age . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (a) provides: \u201cIn any criminal prosecution of an offense involving assault, sexual assault or abuse of a child twelve years of age or younger, the court may, upon motion of the attorney for any party, order that the testimony of the child be taken in a room other than the courtroom in the presence and under the supervision of the trial judge hearing the matter and be televised by closed circuit equipment in the courtroom or recorded for later showing before the court.
