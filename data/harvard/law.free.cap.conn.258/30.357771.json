The petitioner, Vernon L. Cobham, appeals from the judgment of the habeas court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that the sentence that had been imposed by the trial court in his underlying criminal trial was lawful and in compliance with the plea agreement between the petitioner and the state. We conclude that the petitioner prematurely brought this petition for a writ of habeas corpus, rather than directly appealing the sentence or moving the trial court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>correct the sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the habeas court\u2019s judgment dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. On January 21, 1993, the petitioner, pursuant to his plea agreement with the state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entered written pleas of nolo contendere to the charges of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petitioner also agreed to a sentence pursuant to which he would serve a total effective prison term of fourteen years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-19,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial court, as part of its plea canvass, informed the petitioner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the counts to which he had pleaded were class B felonies, and, thus, each count individually carried maximum penalties of twenty years imprisonment and/or fines of $10,000. The trial court also explained that each count individually carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years incarceration, which could not be suspended.* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court sentenced the petitioner to serve two concurrent terms of fourteen years incarceration. The trial court noted for the record that the petitioner had to serve, for each count, the mandatory minimum of five years incarceration as required under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (b) and 53a-101 (c). The petitioner\u2019s mittimus indicated that he was required to serve two concurrent terms of fourteen years incarceration with a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years. The petitioner did not object to the sentence imposed, move to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere, or file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">More than three years later, the issue of whether the department of correction (department) properly understood the defendant\u2019s sentence was brought to the trial court\u2019s attention. Specifically, Louis Pace, the clerk of the geographical area court, notified the trial court that the department was considering the release of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tioner after he had served five years of his sentence. The trial court held a hearing on October 7, 1996, at which Pace testified that he had brought the matter to the trial court\u2019s attention because he believed that the department\u2019s view of the petitioner\u2019s sentence differed from the sentence that the trial court had imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The trial court subpoenaed Mary Jane Steele, a record specialist in the department, to testify at the hearing with regard to the petitioner\u2019s sentence. Steele testified that she had reviewed the petitioner\u2019s sentence and stated that, based on his fourteen year sentence, the petitioner would be eligible for parole in July, 2002, having then served one half of his sentence, or seven years. The trial court responded that Steele\u2019s estimated parole eligibility date was incorrect because it had sentenced the petitioner to serve consecutively the two five year minimum sentences, thereby requiring him to serve a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The trial court also subpoenaed John Sieminski, a counselor supervisor in the department, to testify with regard to the petitioner\u2019s sentence. Sieminski testified that according to his inteipretation of the mittimus, the trial court had sentenced the petitioner to two concurrent fourteen year terms and that the petitioner had to serve consecutively each of the two mandatory minimum sentences of five years by the court\u2019s direction. Sieminski also testified, however, that he had doubts about the validity of the mittimus because he previously had not seen such a sentence with regard to the mandatory minimum sentences.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In light of the apparent confusion with regard to the petitioner\u2019s sentence, the trial court clarified its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>intention in imposing the sentence: \u201cIt was clearly the intention of the court . . . [that] [o]n each count [the petitioner] be sentenced to fourteen years. The two counts were to run concurrently. On each of the mandatory minima, he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum five year sentence. Those two sentences are to run consecutively. The effective sentence is fourteen years to seive. The mandatory minimum in consecutive terms is ten years to seive. That was the intent [of the trial court], that\u2019s what was said, apparently not clearly enough to satisfy everyone, but it\u2019s being clarified now.\u201d After the trial court clarified the sentence, the petitioner did not object to the clarified sentence, move to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere, or file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The petitioner thereafter filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the judgment mittimus was inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s pronouncement of judgment and the law because it ordered him to serve consecutively the two minimum mandatoiy sentences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The petitioner contended that because he was incarcerated in accordance with an illegal sentence, his confinement was unlawful. He also asserted that he had raised this claim previously before the trial court during the hearing on October 7, 1996, and that the court had refused to correct the sentence. The petitioner requested the habeas court to correct his sentence to require him to serve a total effective sentence of fourteen years, five years of which were mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The respondent, the commissioner of correction, thereafter filed an answer denying the allegations of the petition. Additionally, the respondent asserted that the petitioner\u2019s claim was procedurally defaulted because he had failed to raise his claim before the trial court during sentencing, subsequent to sentencing pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22; see footnote 2 of this opinion; or on direct appeal. The respondent also claimed that the petitioner could not establish cause for the procedural default, nor prejudice that would excuse the procedural default.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the respondent contended, the petitioner\u2019s claim should not be reviewed for the first time during a habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The petitioner filed a reply, claiming that the respondent could not assert a defense of procedural default because the petitioner had raised the issue of his illegal sentence, albeit off the record, to the trial court. The petitioner also claimed that \u00a7 43-22 did not act as a procedural bar to his claim because it contained no time limitations concerning when he must file a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Finally, the petitioner maintained that the respondent could not assert a defense of procedural default because he was not seeking to vacate his plea or to reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">After a hearing, the habeas court, finding that it properly could hear the petition, dismissed the petition, concluding that the trial court, by imposing a nonsuspendable minimum sentence of ten years, properly had sentenced the petitioner and correctly had followed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>plea agreement between the petitioner and the state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus to correct his allegedly illegal sentence. Specifically, the petitioner maintains that the habeas court improperly: (1) dismissed his petition in light of the legally and logically impossible sentence imposed by the trial court, which requires the petitioner to serve two concurrent sentences while simultaneously requiring him to serve consecutively the two mandatory minimum sentences; (2) concluded that the statutory language of the crimes to which he had pleaded nolo contendere required that he serve the mandatory minimum sentences consecutively; (3) concluded that the sentence imposed by the trial court constituted specific performance of the plea agreement between him and the state; and (4) concluded, without supporting evidence, that the trial court had made clear its intent that the mandatory minimum sentences were to be imposed consecutively and that such imposition would not affect the calculation of the petitioner\u2019s eligibility for parole or time of release. We decline to reach the merits of any of the petitioner\u2019s claims, however, due to a procedural default, in that the petitioner prematurely has challenged his sentence before the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">This court has held that the jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant\u2019s sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take any action affecting a defendant\u2019s sentence unless it expressly has been authorized to act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 424-25, 545 A.2d 559 (1988); see also State v. <em>Mollo, </em>63 Conn. App. 487, 490, 776 A.2d 1176, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>cert. denied, 257 Conn. 904, 777 A.2d 194 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuszynski, </em>23 Conn. App. 201, 206, 579 A.2d 1100 (1990). Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, which provides the trial court with such authority, provides that \u201c[t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\u201d \u201cAn \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 is essentially one which either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>15 Conn. App. 416, 443-44, 546 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 441 (1988). We previously have noted that a defendant may challenge his or her criminal sentence on the ground that it is illegal by raising the issue on direct appeal or by filing a motion pursuant to \u00a7 43-22 with the judicial authority, namely, the trial court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>225 Conn. 46, 47 n.2, 621 A.2d 1311 (1993). We have not, however, had the occasion to express an opinion as to \u201cwhether habeas corpus is an appropriate vehicle by which to challenge the legality of a sentence.\u201d Id. We now conclude that before seeking to correct an illegal sentence in the habeas court, a defendant either must raise the issue on direct appeal or file a motion pursuant to \u00a7 43-22 with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">As we noted in <em>Copeland, </em>\u201cit is to a defendant\u2019s advantage to move in the trial court, pursuant to [\u00a7 43-22], to correct a purportedly illegal sentence after the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tence is imposed. This method would ordinarily yield a more prompt consideration of [a] defendant\u2019s challenge to the sentence than would the filing of a petition for habeas corpus, which usually entails considerably more delay than does a motion pursuant to [\u00a7 43-22].\u201d Id., 47-48 n.2. By filing a motion with the trial court, a defendant not only can be heard more expediently, but he also has access to certain remedies with regard to sentencing that the habeas court, the Appellate Court, and this court do not have the authority to order. For example, to correct an illegal sentence, only the trial court can: reconstruct the sentence to conform to its original intent or the plea agreement; eliminate a sentence previously imposed for a vacated conviction; or resentence a defendant if it is determined that the original sentence was illegal. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>29 Conn. App. 773, 780-81, 617 A.2d 933 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raucci, </em>21 Conn. App. 557, 563, 575 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 817, 576 A.2d 546 (1990). We therefore conclude that, in order to challenge an illegal sentence, a defendant either must appeal the sentence directly or file a motion to correct the sentence pursuant to \u00a7 43-22 with the trial court before raising a challenge for the first time in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The petitioner first challenged his sentence through this habeas petition. He did not file an appeal challenging his sentence nor has he filed, pursuant to \u00a7 43-22, a motion to correct the sentence with the trial court. The petitioner could have filed such a motion \u201cat any time,\u201d including the present time. Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. Furthermore, our review of the record reveals that the petitioner <em>never challenged </em>his sentence nor moved to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere during his first sentencing hearing or during the October 7, 1996 hearing held by the trial court. Because the petitioner has failed to follow the proper procedures by which to correct his sentence or to preserve his challenge to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>sentence before having filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus, his petition is procedurally defaulted and, therefore, we will review the petitioner\u2019s claims before us only if he can satisfy the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard of <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>227 Conn. 124, 132, 629 A.2d 413 (1993); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>218 Conn. 403, 409, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The appropriate standard for reviewability of habeas claims that were not properly raised at trial; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 409; or on direct appeal; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 132; because of a procedural default is the cause and prejudice standard. Under this standard, the petitioner must demonstrate good cause for his failure to raise a claim at trial or on direct appeal and actual prejudice resulting from the impropriety claimed in the habeas petition. See id.; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 409; see also <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 617, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Summerville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 397, 428, 641 A.2d 1356 (1994). \u201c[T]he cause and prejudice test is designed to prevent full review of issues in habeas corpus proceedings that counsel did not raise at trial or on appeal for reasons of tactics, inadvertence or ignorance . . . .\u201d <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 83, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988). Therefore, \u201cattorney error short of ineffective assistance of counsel does not adequately excuse compliance with our rules of [trial and] appellate procedure.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The petitioner has failed to satisfy the cause and prejudice standard for the procedural default. He did not allege in his amended petition or maintain before the habeas court that his failure to challenge his sentence before the trial court or on direct appeal had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>caused by some objective factor external to his own defense and that the default was prejudicial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id. Because we conclude that the petitioner has failed to satisfy the cause or prejudice required to overcome the procedural default, we cannot review the petitioner\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the habeas court\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ment dismissing the petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The judgment of the habeas court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\"> The petitioner appealed from (he judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b), and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 provides: \u201cThe judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\"> Under the plea agreement, the state nolled a number of other charges against the petitioner that are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

The petitioner had requested that the habeas court correct his sentence. The respondent, the commissioner of correction, had denied the petitioner\u2019s allegations, stating that the petition was incomplete and/or inaccurate. Thereafter, the petitioner obtained counsel and filed the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus that is the basis of this appeal and is discussed further in the text of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\"> As we discuss more fully later in the text of this opinion, this court will review a habeas claim that was not properly raised at trial or on direct appeal because of a procedural default if the petitioner demonstrates good cause for his failure to raise the claim and actual prejudice resulting from the impropriety claimed in the habeas petition. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>227 Conn. 124, 132, 629 A.2d 413 (1993); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>218 Conn. 403, 409, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> The habeas court also noted that the minimum sentence imposed by the trial court did not limit the department from computing an earlier time of release or parole eligibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\"> We recognize that this court previously has suggested that the language \u201cjudicial authority,\u201d found in \u00a7 43-22, included the appellate courts as well as the trial court that had ordered the sentence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 387, 542 A.2d 306 (1988) (\u201c[b]oth the trial court and this court, on appeal, have the power, at any time, to correct a sentence that is illegal\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>37 Conn.

The petitioner, however, must establish cause and prejudice <em>conjunctively. See Johnson v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 419. Because he can file a motion with the trial court to correct his sentence \u201cat any time\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 43-22; the petitioner is not prejudiced by our conclusion that his claim is procedurally defaulted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\"> In an alternative argument, the petitioner, citing <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 215, 217, 592 A.2d 910 (1991), on appeal after remand, 227 Conn. 124, 629 A.2d 413 (1993), contends that, if we fmd a procedural default, we must remand this case to the habeas court for further proceedings to determine whether there was good cause for the petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the appropriate procedures by which to correct his sentence. In <em>Jackson, </em>this court heard the petitioner on his motion for reargument or reconsideration. Id., 215. Prior to <em>Jackson, </em>this court had affirmed the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of thirty-one habeas corpus petitions, one of which was the petitioner\u2019s, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 403. In his motion, the petitioner in <em>Jackson </em>brought to this court\u2019s attention that, in addition to his other claims, he had presented to the habeas court testimony that would satisfy the requirement of good cause for failure to raise his claim before the trial court. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 215-16. Because the habeas court had made no findings with respect to the testimony the petitioner had presented, we were unable to determine whether there was good cause for the procedural default. Id., 216. Accordingly, we opened the judgment affirming the dismissal of his petition and remanded the case to the habeas court for further proceedings to determine whether there was good cause for the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise the claim that was the basis for his habeas petition before the trial court. Id., 217. The petitioner in the present case is not in an analogous position to the petitioner in <em>Jackson. </em>Here, the petitioner has neither briefed nor argued before this court that he had alleged in his petition or had maintained before the habeas court that he had good cause for failing to malee his claim before the trial court. Moreover, our review of the record of the proceedings before the habeas court reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>that the petitioner did not present any evidence that would satisfy the good cause requirement. We therefore conclude that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Jackson </em>is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
