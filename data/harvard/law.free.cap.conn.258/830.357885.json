Robinson, Sr. In granting the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition, the habeas court concluded that the retroactive application of P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, to the petitioner\u2019s sentence of imprisonment by the board of parole violated the petitioner\u2019s rights under the ex post facto clause and, consequently, that he is eligible for parole upon completion of 50 percent, rather than 85 percent, of his sentence. For the reasons set forth in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 804, we conclude that, contrary to the determination of the habeas court, P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, applies prospectively only. Thus, although we disagree with the conclusion of the habeas court that P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, applies retroactively, we nevertheless agree with the habeas court that the petitioner is eligible for parole upon completion of 50 percent of his sentence. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are set forth in the memorandum of decision of the habeas court. \u201cOn June 14,1996, the petitioner . . . entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charges of [assault in the first degree] ... in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and [criminal] possession of a [pistol or revolver] ... in violation of [General Statutes (Rev. to 1995)] \u00a7 53a-217c,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for crimes committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>in January of 1995. On July 1, 1996, [P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, amended] General Statutes [Rev. to 1995] \u00a7 54-125a (b) by requiring that persons . . . convicted of an offense involving the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person ... be ineligible for parole until they ha[ve] served [85 percent] of their . . . sentences. Prior to July 1, 1996, such . . . person[s] [were] eligible for parole after they had served [50 percent] of their . . . sentences. . . . On August 2, 1996, the petitioner was sentenced ... to ten years imprisonment, suspended after six years, [and] three years probation [on] the assault charge and two years probation [on] the [possession] charge. In September of 1996, the board of parole notified the petitioner by letter that, due to the nature of his [assault charge], [he] would have to serve [85 percent] of his sentence [before becoming eligible for parole pursuant to] . . . General Statutes [Rev. to 1995] \u00a7 54-125a (b) [as amended by P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 l].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>\u201cOn August 21, 1998, the petitioner filed a[n] . . . amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner allege[d] [in his petition] that the application of P.A. 95-255, [\u00a7 1] to him . . . retroactively increase[d] his punishment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore violates the ex post facto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>clause of the United States constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV 97-405187 (February 22, 2000) (26 Conn. L. Rptr. 573, 573-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The commissioner moved to dismiss, claiming, inter alia, that the habeas court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action because the petitioner\u2019s claim did not give rise to a protected liberty interest. The habeas court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the petitioner need not establish a liberty interest to raise a cognizable claim for habeas relief under the ex post facto clause. The court also concluded that the retroactive application of P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, to the petitioner\u2019s sentence violated the ex post facto clause and, consequently, that the petitioner\u2019s parole eligibility was to be determined in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (providing that offender is eligible for parole upon completion of 50 percent of sentence), the statute in effect when the petitioner committed the crime for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The habeas court granted the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, and the commissioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. After briefs were filed, this court, sua sponte, ordered supplemental briefing on the following issue: \u201cIn light of <em>Vincenzo </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>[26 Conn. App. 132, 599 A.2d 31] (1991), did the trial court lack subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>matter jurisdiction because the petitioner had no liberty interest in a claim for release on parole?\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">On appeal, the commissioner contends, inter alia, that: (1) the petitioner has no liberty interest in parole eligibility or release and, therefore, the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition; and (2) the habeas court improperly concluded that the retroactive application of P.A. 95-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>255, \u00a7 1, to the petitioner\u2019s sentence violated the ex post facto clause. Inasmuch as <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 804, is factually and legally indistinguishable from the present case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Johnson </em>controls our resolution of the issues raised by the commissioner. In <em>Johnson, </em>we concluded that: (1) the habeas court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the habeas petition filed by the petitioner, Dwayne Johnson, in which Johnson challenged the board of parole\u2019s retroactive application of P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, to his sentence, merely because Johnson had failed to establish a liberty interest in parole eligibility; id., 817-19; (2) P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, applies prospectively only and, consequently, it was not applicable to Johnson\u2019s sentence for crimes that Johnson committed before the date on which P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, became effective; id., 822, 829; and (3) because P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, did not apply to Johnson\u2019s sentence, the minimum time that Johnson was required to serve before he became eligible for parole was governed not by P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, but, rather, by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-125a (b), which requires that an offender serve 50 percent of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole. See id., 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">For the reasons set forth in <em>Johnson, </em>we conclude that the petitioner in the present case is eligible for parole upon the completion of 50 percent of his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>tence. Because the habeas court came to the same conclusion, albeit for different reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-6\"> Public Acts 1995, No. 95-255, provides: \u201cAn Act Concerning Truth in Sentencing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cSection 1.

For the following reasons, we conclude that we need not decide whether the board should have been made a party to this action. First, even if it is assumed that the board is a necessary or indispensable party, the failure to join the board is not a jurisdictional defect depriving the habeas court or this court of subject matter jurisdiction. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-108 (\u201c[a]n action shall not be defeated by the nonjoinder or misjoinder of parties\u201d); see also <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Gaudio, </em>23 Conn. App. 287, 305, 580 A.2d 1212, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 803, 584 A.2d 471 (1990) (nonjoinder of necessary or indispensable party does not implicate jurisdiction of court). Second, although the board was not a party to the present case, it was a party to the companion case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 804, in which we addressed and decided precisely the same issues that we decide in the present case. Moreover, the board participated fully in the litigation and appeal of the <em>Johnson </em>case; indeed, the board and the commissioner were represented by the same assistant attorney general in <em>Johnson. </em>Finally, in light of our holding in <em>Johnson, </em>there is no doubt that, in the present case, the board is required to apply General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-125a (b), the statute in effect when the petitioner committed the crime for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. It therefore would be a waste of judicial resources to remand the case to the habeas court to cure any defect caused by nonjoinder of the board. Accordingly, we leave for another day the question of whether the board is a necessary or indispensable party to a habeas proceeding in which the board, though not the petitioner\u2019s custodian, has been accused by the petitioner of improper or unlawful conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\"> In the present ease, the petitioner committed the crime for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and entered his plea of nolo contendere prior to the effective date of P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, but was sentenced after that date. In <em>Johnson, </em>the petitioner committed his offenses before the effective date of P.A. 95-255, \u00a7 1, but entered his plea of guilty and was sentenced thereon after that date. Because we look to the date of the offense to determine whether the application of a criminal statute to a particular offense is retroactive; see footnote 7 of this opinion; the factual differences between the present case and <em>Johnson </em>are irrelevant for purposes of our resolution of the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
