The sole issue in this certified appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. One of the issues raised in that appeal was whether the trial court, during the hearing on the plaintiffs motion for reargument, improperly denied the plaintiffs motion for a continuance for the purpose of filing a motion to substitute a representative of the defendant\u2019s estate for the defendant following the defendant\u2019s death. The Appellate Court dismissed the appeal, citing the plaintiffs failure to substitute. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the dismissal was improper. We conclude that the Appellate Court abused its discretion in dismissing the plaintiffs appeal, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On April 20, 1995, the plaintiff, Nancy Burton, an attorney licensed in the state of Connecticut, filed this complaint against a former client, the defendant, Sylvia W. Browd, seeking to recover damages for nonpayment of fees for legal services rendered to the defendant. On July 7, 1999, the trial court, <em>Radcliffe, J., </em>rendered a judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $5727.04. On July 27, 1999, the plaintiff moved for reargument claiming, inter alia, that the award was inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>equate. The defendant\u2019s counsel filed an objection to the motion for reargument the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The trial court heard argument on both the plaintiffs motion and the defendant\u2019s objection on August 9,1999. During the proceedings, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court that the defendant had died.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff orally moved for a continuance for the sole purpose of filing a motion to substitute a representative of the defendant\u2019s estate as the named defendant, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-599 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied the plaintiffs motion for a continuance, proceeded with the hearing, and ultimately denied the plaintiffs motion for reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On August 20, 1999, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment claiming, inter alia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the trial court improperly had denied her motion for a continuance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>cross appeal challenging the judgment for the plaintiff. The Appellate Court, sua sponte, ordered the parties to appear before it to present reasons why the appeal and the cross appeal should not be dismissed for failure of either party to substitute a representative of the defendant\u2019s estate. On October 24, 2000, the day before the scheduled hearing, the plaintiff filed in the Appellate Court a motion for leave to substitute parties, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 62-5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Appellate Court subsequently heard arguments regarding the parties\u2019 failure to substitute, at which time the plaintiff informed the Appellate Court that the trial court had denied her motion for a continuance for the purpose of filing a motion to substitute. The plaintiff also orally informed the panel that she had filed in the Appellate Court a motion to substitute. The Appellate Court summarily dismissed the appeal and the cross appeal, citing the plaintiffs failure to substitute, and subsequently denied the plaintiffs motion for leave to substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The plaintiff then petitioned this court for certification to appeal, raising the issue of the propriety of the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of her appeal. We granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss the plaintiffs appeal?\u201d <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Browd, </em>255 Conn. 923, 763 A.2d 1040 (2000). We conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal was an abuse of discretion, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Appellate Court has judicial discretion to act, srra sponte, on grounds not directly raised by the parties. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 373, 521 A.2d 547 (1987). \u201cJudicial discretion, however, is always a legal discretion, exercised according to the recognized prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ciples of equity.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>159 Conn. 477, 480, 271 A.2d 62 (1970). \u201cSuch discretion . . . imports something more than leeway in decision making and should be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and should not impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 575, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). \u201c[Reversal is required where the abuse is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 480. We conclude that such an injustice was done in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Before discussing the merits of the plaintiffs claim on appeal, we underscore that the focus of our review is not the actions of the trial court but rather the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 433, 493 A.2d 865 (1985). Because the Appellate Court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal on the procedural ground that she had failed to substitute the proper party, we begin with a brief discussion of the law regarding actions against a deceased party.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Although at common law the death of a sole plaintiff or defendant abated an action; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>74 Conn. 729, 730, 52 A. 403 (1902); by virtue of \u00a7 52-599,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Connecticut\u2019s right of survival statute, a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>action can survive if a representative of the decedent\u2019s estate is substituted for the decedent. It is a well established principle, however, that \u201c[djuring the interval . . . between the death and the revival of the action by the appearance of the executor or administrator, the cause has no vitality. The surviving party and the court alike are powerless to proceed with it.\u201d Id., 730-31; see, e.g., <em>Boucher Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>160 Conn. 404, 407, 279 A.2d 540 (1971) (following defendant\u2019s death, plaintiff required to move for substitution in order to avail itself of right to appeal judgment); <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Denihan, </em>110 Conn. 646, 650, 149 A. 250 (1930) (following death of party, decree of court survived in favor of administrator of decedent\u2019s estate); <em>Schoolhouse Corp. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>43 Conn. App. 586, 592, 684 A.2d 1191 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 913, 691 A.2d 1079 (1997) (following denial of motion to substitute, appeal dismissed due to absence of proper parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff was notified of the defendant\u2019s death at the hearing on her motion for reargument. As soon as the plaintiff was made aware of that fact, she orally moved for a continuance for the purpose of filing a motion to substitute the defendant\u2019s estate. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for a continuance, incorrectly instructing the plaintiff that a substitution was not necessary at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In dismissing the plaintiffs appeal, the Appellate Court cited the plaintiffs failure to substitute. The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal was improper because her failure to substitute the defendant\u2019s estate resulted directly from the action by the trial court that was one of the grounds for her appeal to the Appellate Court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The Appellate Court did not consider the merits of the plaintiffs appeal, in particular, her claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a continuance precluded her from filing a motion to substitute. Instead, the Appellate Court summarily dismissed the plaintiffs appeal on the basis of that failure to substitute. In so doing, the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal denied the plaintiff her opportunity to obtain judicial review of the trial court\u2019s actions. We conclude, therefore, that the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal was an abuse of discretion. Moreover, the Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal due to the plaintiffs failure to substitute was unjustified in light of the trial court\u2019s erroneous admonition to the plaintiff that a substitution was not necessary and in light of the plaintiffs pending motion in the Appellate Court to cure any defect by substituting the appropriate fiduciary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We further note that there was no prejudice to the defendant due to unfair delay or surprise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Lancia, </em>46 Conn. App. 150, 157, 698 A.2d 938 (1997). In the trial court, immediately following the announcement by the defendant\u2019s counsel of the defendant\u2019s death, the plaintiff made a motion for continuance for the purpose of filing a motion to substitute. In the Appellate Court, the plaintiff filed a request for leave to substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>tute before briefs had been filed in the matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the statement of the defendant\u2019s counsel at the Appellate Court hearing indicating that he would not object if the defendant\u2019s cross appeal were dismissed as well due to the plaintiffs failure to substitute demonstrates the lack of prejudice. In the absence of any evidence of prejudice, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the Appellate Court to have dismissed the plaintiffs appeal where the dismissal precluded the plaintiff from obtaining judicial review of one of her claims raised on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing the appeal is reversed and the case is remanded to that court <em>for </em>further proceedings according <em>to </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\"> The defendant died on April 16, 1999. The record is silent as to when the defendant\u2019s attorney first became aware of this fact. Neither the parties, nor the trial court, however, had been aware of the defendant\u2019s death when the court rendered its judgment on July 7, 1999. Although the validity of the trial court\u2019s judgment is not directly before us in this appeal, we note that the death of the defendant prior to the entry of judgment did not render the judgment void, but merely voidable. <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Denihan, </em>110 Conn. 646, 648, 149 A. 250 (1930) (judgment entered against deceased defendant, in ignorance of death, not nullity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-599 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a party defendant dies, the plaintiff, within one year after receiving written notification of the defendant\u2019s death, may apply to the court in which the action is pending for an order to substitute the decedent\u2019s executor or administrator in the place of the decedent, and, upon due service and return of the order, the action may proceed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\"> The plaintiff raised eleven issues on appeal to the Appellate Court. The only issue relevant to the appeal before this court is her claim that the trial court improperly had denied her motion for a continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\"> The plaintiff framed the issue, before both this court and the Appellate Court, as a claim that the trial court improperly had denied her request to substitute. This is a mischaracterization, as the plaintiff actually claimed impropriety in the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a continuance, <em>made for the purpose of filing a motion to substitute.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 62-5 provides: \u201cChanges in Parties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">\u201cAny change in the parties to an action pending an appeal shall be made in the court in which the appeal is pending.

If a party defendant dies, the plaintiff, within one year after receiving written notification of the defendant\u2019s death, may apply to the court in which the action is pending for an order to substitute the decedent\u2019s executor or administrator in the place of the decedent, and, upon due service and return of the order, the action may proceed. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> The trial court\u2019s actions are not before us on this appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 433. We note, however, for purposes of reviewing the Appellate Court\u2019s actions, that a substitution of aproper party <em>was </em>necessary. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 74 Conn. 730-31 (\u201c[d]uring the interval . . . between the death and the revival of the action by the appearance of the executor or administrator . . . [t]he surviving party and the court alike are powerless to proceed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> As we noted previously, the plaintiff filed her appeal in the Appellate Court on August 20, 1999, and filed a motion for leave to substitute a representative of the defendant\u2019s estate in that court on August 24, 2000. Thus, more than one year had elapsed between the plaintiffs filing of her appeal in the Appellate Court and her filing of a motion for leave to substitute in that court. Nevertheless, the statute of limitations for substituting parties had not yet expired. See footnotes 2 and 10 of this opinion. Therefore, although we note that the plaintiff should have been more prompt about filing a motion to substitute in the Appellate Court, that does not affect our analysis of the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b595-5\"> The plaintiff filed a request for leave to substitute in the Appellate Court on the day before the hearing on that court\u2019s sua sponte motion. The parties had not yet filed briefs on the merits of the appeal and the cross appeal because the Appellate Court had ordered a stay of briefing on the merits for thirty days following the issuance of notice of the court\u2019s decision on its sua sponte motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\"> The defendant\u2019s counsel argues that the Appellate Court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal because the plaintiff failed to file a motion to substitute within the one year time period required by \u00a7 52-599 (b) and failed to articulate good cause for that failure. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s counsel argues that \u201cactual\u201d notice is sufficient to meet the requirements of \u00a7 52-599 (b), and that, although the plaintiff received actual notice of the defendant\u2019s death on August 9, 1999, at the hearing on the plaintiffs motion for reargument, the plaintiff did not file, in the Appellate Court, a motion for leave to substitute the defendant\u2019s fiduciary until August 24, 2000. The defendant\u2019s counsel contends, therefore, that the Appellate Court properly dismissed the plaintiffs claim for failure to substitute within one year of receiving actual notice of the defendant\u2019s death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We note that in 1987, the legislature amended \u00a7 52-599 (b) to require \u201cwritten\u201d notice, changing the date upon which the statute of limitations begins to toll from the date of the defendant\u2019s death to the date upon which the plaintiff receives \u201cwritten notification\u201d of the defendant\u2019s death. Public Acts 1987, No. 87-237; see <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Lancia, </em>46 Conn. App. 150, 154, 698 A.2d 938 (1997) (detailing statutory history of \u00a7 52-599). Whether actual notice will suffice to trigger the statute is an issue, however, that we need not address. Notwithstanding her knowledge of the fact of the defendant\u2019s death, the plaintiff had not been informed as to the actual date of death, the name of the defendant\u2019s fiduciary, or the court of the fiduciary\u2019s appointment. Therefore, the plaintiffs ability to substitute was hampered severely. In addition, the defendant\u2019s counsel does not claim any prejudice from the failure of the plaintiff to meet the one year statutory time period. Furthermore, the defendant's counsel provides us with no reason to construe the one year requirement as a jurisdictional bar. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 266-70, 777 A.2d 645 (2001). We have stated many times that, \u201c[ijn light of the strong presumption in favor of jurisdiction, we require a strong showing of a legislative intent to create a time limitation that, in the event of noncompliance, acts as a subject matter jurisdictional bar. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>241 Conn. 569, 583, 698 A.2d 268 (1997). Moreover, the fact that a court has the discretion to cite in a representative of the defendant\u2019s estate after the expiration of the one year time period if good cause is shown for the delay further counsels against interpreting the one year time requirement in \u00a7 52-599 (b) as a jurisdictional bar. See <em>Worden </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>170 Conn. 186, 188, 365 A.2d 1205 (1976); <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Honeyman, </em>141 Conn. 397, 400, 107 A.2d 260 (1954). We conclude, therefore, that even if actual notice had been sufficient to trigger the time period set forth in \u00a7 52-599 (b), expiration of the time period was not a jurisdictional bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
