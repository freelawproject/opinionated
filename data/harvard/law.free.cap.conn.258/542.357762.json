More specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted an expert witness to offer his opinion as to the credibility of the victim\u2019s claims of sexual assault by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the defendant and further, to testify regarding the guilt of the defendant. We disagree with the defendant and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The defendant, Lennard J. Toccaline, appeals from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> three counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-21 (2), as amended by No. 95-142, \u00a7 1, of the 1995 Public Acts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, following a court trial, of being a persistent felony offender in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-40 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The defendant had been charged in the first part of a two part information with one count of sexual assault in the first degree, two counts of sexual assault in the fourth degree, and three counts of risk of injury to a child. Because the defendant previously had been convicted of sexual assault in the first degree, he also was charged in the second part with being a persistent dangerous felony offender. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charges of sexual assault in the first degree, one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree, and three counts of risk of injury to a child. The defendant elected to be tried by the court on the persistent dangerous felony offender charge. Following his conviction on that count, the defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of forty years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-five years, and ten years probation. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On the basis of the evidence presented, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim, MC, was bom on May 7, 1984. In 1996, the defendant, who was thirty-five years old, was the boyfriend of the victim\u2019s aunt. The defendant and the victim\u2019s aunt lived together in a house near a lake, where MC sometimes visited. Usually, the defendant went to MC\u2019s house to pick her up and bring her to her aunt\u2019s house. During the visits, MC and the defendant often played video games or went fishing together.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Three acts of sexual contact by the defendant occurred during the period from June, 1996, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>September, 1996, when MC was twelve years old. In the first incident, the defendant kissed MC\u2019s breasts and vaginal area. In the second incident, which occurred in August, 1996, when the defendant and MC were fishing from a boat on the lake, the defendant placed MC\u2019s hand on his penis. He then put his hand over hers and manually stimulated himself until he ejaculated. During the third incident, which occurred in September, 1996, the defendant invited MC to come to his bed. He then got on top of her, pinned her hands above her head, and penetrated her vagina with his penis. MC did not tell her mother or aunt about the events with the defendant because she was afraid of the defendant. In October, 1996, MC and her family moved to another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In February, 1998, while cleaning MC\u2019s bedroom, her mother found a letter written to MC from a man named W, who was a friend of MC\u2019s family. W had begun to baby-sit for MC and her siblings in the summer of 1997.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At that time, W was thirty-two years old and MC was thirteen. In the letter, W told MC that he wanted to hold her and take her pain away.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">MC\u2019s mother was concerned about the contents of the letter and confronted W about his relationship with MC. Her mother also confronted MC about her relationship with W. Although she denied any sexual contact with W, MC told her mother about the incidents that had occurred with the defendant during the summer of 1996. MC also had told W about the defendant\u2019s conduct prior to disclosing this information to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The defendant gave a statement to the police in which he responded to MC\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse. In the statement, the defendant claimed that he and MC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>often \u201chorse played\u201d together. The defendant admitted that he may have had sexual contact with MC during this horseplay, although, he claimed, MC never objected to such contact and that the contact did not constitute intercourse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statement was entered into evidence and read aloud to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On appeal, the sole issue is whether, under <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine, the defendant may prevail on his unpreserved claim regarding the admission of certain expert testimony. Because we do not consider the defendant\u2019s claim to be either constitutional in nature or to constitute plain error, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Elton Grunden, a licensed clinical social worker at a counseling and mental health center in the state to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>which MC\u2019s family had moved, testified on direct examination for the state. He had met with MC in February, 1998, to discuss her allegations of sexual abuse by the defendant. Grunden testified that in that meeting, MC had described instances of sexual contact with the defendant. He also stated his opinion that the victim had suffered sexual abuse perpetrated by the defendant. Finally, Grunden testified that it was his opinion that MC\u2019s testimony was truthful, based, in part, on the consistency of her accusations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>object to any of Grunden\u2019s testimony. Nevertheless, the trial court did issue a constancy of accusation instruction to the jury regarding Grunden\u2019s testimony on direct examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Because, as noted previously, the defendant did not object to Grunden\u2019s testimony at the trial court, to prevail on his claim before this court he must, as he admits, do so under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233, or the plain error doctrine. The state concedes that Grunden\u2019s testimony was improper, but argues that the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims cannot succeed under either <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The defendant is not entitled to prevail under <em>Golding </em>because his claim does not raise a constitutional issue. In essence, the defendant attempts to \u201c \u2018put a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional evidentiary ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 46, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). We previously have stated that \u201cthe admissibility of evidence is a matter of state law and unless there is a resultant denial of fundamental fairness or the denial of a specific constitutional right, no constitutional issue is involved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting expert testimony is not to be disturbed unless it has been abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Conn. App. 51, 70, 644 A.2d 923 (1994). The errors claimed by the defendant in the present case are simply evidentiary in nature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the trial court, upon proper objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>by the defendant, would have been required to exclude this testimony, the presentation of Grunden\u2019s statements to the jury in the absence of such an objection did not implicate a constitutional right or result in a fundamentally unfair trial.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The case presented is thus distinguishable from this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>257 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>797, 778 A.2d 159 (2001).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Grenier, </em>we determined that the defendant was entitled to a new trial because expert opinion testimony had been improperly admitted concerning the victim\u2019s credibility. Id., 801. In <em>Grenier, </em>unlike the present case, the defendant had objected to the improper testimony by the expert, thus preserving the issue for appeal, and our review was not limited to <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine. Id., 802-804. Instead, our focus was on whether the improperly admitted testimony was harmful. Id., 806. We concluded that the error was not harmless, in part, because the state\u2019s case rested entirely on the credibility of the victim. Id., 807.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Finally, the defendant urges this court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, to conclude that the admission of Grunden\u2019s testimony constituted plain error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendant. \u201cPlain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 25, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). Plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. See <em>Berchtold </em>v. Maggi, 191 Conn. 266, 274, 464 A.2d 1 (1983). A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 166, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s admission of Grunden\u2019s testimony was not plain error. We do not agree that the admission of Grunden\u2019s testimony undermined the fairness or integrity of the trial afforded to the defendant. Further, we see nothing in the record that leads us to conclude that the verdict constituted manifest injustice to the defendant or will lead to diminished confidence in our judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

I recall that MO usually had worn either a halter top and shorts, a bathing suit or usually some other summer attire. During our \u2018horsing around\u2019 I recall that I moved her T-shirt up exposing her mid section, put my mouth on her skin and blew onto her skin causing a fart, like noise. ... I may have put my mouth on her in the area of her breasts and if I hit any part of her breast, it was by accident. [MC] had just begun to develop her breastfs] and my mouth never touched her nipples. . . . During the time when [MC] and I were horsing around [on the boat] I may have had an erection and [MC] may have grabbed my erection by accident. When she may have grabbed my erection she didn\u2019t make a big deal about it. I never asked [MC] to grab my erection. After [MC] grabbed my erection, she didn\u2019t make a big deal about it and I never mentioned this incident to anyone. . . . On one occasion, I recall being on my bed in the bedroom. . . . During our \u2018horsing around\u2019 I ended up on top of her on the bed. Sometime during our horsing around she would sometime[s] get the advantage and end up on top of me. When I ended up on top of her I recall having her arms pinned up above her head holding her down. I was on top of her for just a couple of minutes and as I was on top of her she was moving around trying to get away. . . . While she was trying to get away her clothes were moving around. During the time I was on top of her when we were horsing around, it\u2019s possible that I became excited and got an erection. Being in the position that I was in on fop of her she would have felt my erection in the area of her vagina. Due to the fact that we were both moving around she may have misunderstood that for sexual contact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\"> The following is the relevantportion of the colloquy between the assistant state\u2019s attorney and Grunden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201cQ. Now, how do you know the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cA. I met the victim on 2/18/98, when she and her mother arrived at my office as clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. And you\u2014could you please describe her condition at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201cA. I found the victim to be as she appeared to be today. Somewhat reluctant and shy and quiet, unwilling to talk unless prompted at times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. And what, if anything, did you do on that occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">\u201cA. She and her mother and I in my office conducted what we call an intake or a screening interview to malee a primary assessment of what was the issue so that we could get information and refer to another therapist with a specialty that might help that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">\u201cQ. Okay. And did you take a history of the victim at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">\u201cA. Yes. I got a history of the presenting problem and from the victim and her mother at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">\u201cQ. And did the victim describe to you sexual abuse she endured by the defendant in this matter in that history?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">\u201cA. Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. And from your interview of the victim, and based on your professional experience, have you an opinion as to whether or not the victim was a victim of sexual abuse by the defendant in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-17\">\u201cA. Of that, I don\u2019t have much doubt. Yes, I do believe that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-18\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m sorry, your opinion is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-19\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t have much doubt that what the victim said is true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-20\">Later, the following exchange between the assistant state\u2019s attorney and Grunden occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-21\">\u201cQ. Now, however, in your report you do state that the victim confirms several incidents of molestation with the defendant ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-22\">\u201cA. Yes. And that\u2019s the basis of my opinion that I stated for you earlier. That, again, she was very explicit, very direct, very consistent in her report of those issues, and it was all very similar to what evidence she gave in her testimony this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-23\">\u201cQ. So you were here present while she testified today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\"Q. And you\u2019re stating that her testimony today was what in relation to what she said about [the defendant] to you back in February of \u201998?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cA. It was so consistent to be extremely similar in both her presentation and in the facts she presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cQ. And that is the reason you based your opinion that it, in fact, had occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Later, the following exchange between the assistant state\u2019s attorney and Grunden occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cQ. Now, the incidents that occurred between the defendant and the victim in this matter, in your professional opinion, did each of those incidents include some type of what would be qualified as sexual activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201cA. Yes, she was very clear, as she was today, about many of the details that she reported this morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\"> The trial court stated: \u201cLet me take this opportunity to caution the jury. We\u2019ve had testimony from [Grunden] and also the alleged victim\u2019s mother indicating that the victim related to those parties the allegations that she also made against the defendant. That is not direct evidence that the defendant engaged in the activity, but it is introduced to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony. It goes to her credibility, and it\u2019s used for that limited purpose only. Normally . . . out-of-court statements are not admissible in court, but there is this exception in sexual assault cases to allow testimony concerning what the victim said for purposes of corroboration of the victim\u2019s credibility only and not as direct proof that those activities occurred. Obviously, the two other witnesses weren\u2019t there and did not see anything of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The trial court, in its charge to the jury, also gave instructions regarding the role of experts generally and additional instructions regarding constancy of accusation testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b572-5\"> We recognize that an expert witness may not testify regarding the credibility of a particular victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>257 Conn. 797, 806, 778 A.2d 159 (2001); <em>State v.

We also recognize that witness \u201c[t]estimony is objectionable if it embraces an opinion on the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact. <em>Kowalewski </em>v. <em>Mutual Loan Co., </em>159 Conn. 76, 80, 266 A.2d 379 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>141 Conn. 656, 667, 109 A.2d 364 (1954) [appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 349 U.S. 926, 75 S.

Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 7.17.2. Thus, the trial court, upon objection by the defendant, would have been obligated to exclude Grunden\u2019s testimony relating to MC\u2019s credibility and the guilt of the defendant. For the reasons stated in this opinion, however, the defendant\u2019s claim does not raise a constitutional issue or amount to plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> The defendant also argues on appeal that, the assistant state\u2019s attorney '\u2018exploited]\u201d Grunden\u2019s testimony when she referred to it in her closing argument. The assistant state\u2019s attorney stated in her closing argument: \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that MC has been very consistent as to who did this to her. That\u2019s corroborated by others\u2019 testimony that she only said it was [the defendant]. Counselor Grunden also said that he felt that there was definitely something [that] had happened with [the defendant] and did not feel that something had happened, other than kissing, with [W].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On rebuttal argument, the assistant state\u2019s attorney also stated: \u201cMr. Grunden said there was no doubt it occurred. [The defendant\u2019s attorney] felt that that\u2014because of a one hour visit\u2014was malpractice. Well, that\u2019s why I went into Mr. Grunden\u2019s professional experience. I remember he\u2019d been doing that job. He has the background to make opinions like that. And again, it\u2019s his qualifications that has him be able to take the stand and say something like that. Remember, he knew he was under oath. And he said in his opinion it had occurred between MC and [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">If the defendant is alleging a form of prosecutorial misconduct resulting in the deprivation of his constitutional right to a fair trial, we first note that the defendant never objected to these remarks in the state\u2019s closing argument. In addition, to the extent that we regard the defendant\u2019s argument as a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant may not prevail under either <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine, because these brief and isolated comments do not implicate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 769, 670 A.2d 276 (1996) (\u201c <em>\u2018[Golding] </em>review of [a claim of misconduct by the prosecutor in closing argument] is unavailable where the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal apattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial\u2019 \u201d). \u201cFurthermore, in order to warrant review under the plain error doctrine, the allegedly improper conduct must so pervade the defendant's trial as to have impaired the effectiveness or integrity of the judicial process.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> We note that <em>Grenier </em>was released after the filing of briefs in the present case, but prior to oral argument before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> We also recognize that in the present case, unlike <em>Grenier, </em>the jury was presented with significant evidence, aside from the victim\u2019s testimony, that the sexual abuse had in fact occurred. For example, MC\u2019s physician testified that a physical examination revealed that MC had experienced vaginal penetration, which most likely was caused through sexual relations. There also was testimony concerning depression and a change in character MC experienced during and after the summer of 1996. More specifically, MC\u2019s aunt testified that after the incident on the boat, MC returned to the house and appeared withdrawn and quiet, which was out of character for MC. Most importantly, the defendant\u2019s own written statement corroborated much of what MC claimed to have occurred.
