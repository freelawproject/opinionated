J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFt\">The defendant, the planning and zoning commission of the town of Greenwich (zoning commission), appeals from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the appeal by the plaintiffs, Thomas Heithaus and Marguerite Heithaus, from the zoning commission\u2019s denial of their historic overlay zone application, site plan and special permit request. There are three certified issues on appeal in this matter: (1) whether the trial court properly concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>process of deciding an application for an historic overlay zone designation is an administrative, rather than a legislative, function of the zoning commission and, therefore, subject to a less deferential standard of review; (2) whether the trial court concluded that the zoning commission was bound by the findings of the historic district commission, an advisory body to the zoning commission, when it recommended historic overlay designation and, if so, whether that conclusion was proper; and (3) whether the trial court properly concluded that the zoning commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the zoning commission was acting in an administrative capacity when it considered, and subsequently denied, the plaintiffs\u2019 application for historic overlay designation. On the second issue, we conclude that the trial court did not determine that the zoning commission was bound by the findings of the historic district commission, a purely advisory board. Instead, the trial court found nothing in the record to contradict the findings of the historic district commission and, therefore, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the zoning commission\u2019s decision. We conclude that the zoning commission was not bound by the findings of the historic district commission. On the third issue, however, we conclude that the zoning commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 historic overlay application was supported by substantial evidence. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the issues on appeal. The plaintiffs own a house at 7 Nedley Lane in the town of Greenwich. The house, which constitutes the parcel of real estate involved in this appeal, is situated in a single-family residential neighborhood, zoned R-7 by the town.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>5450 square foot house was built in 1902 on a 21,756 square foot lot and was known originally as the \u201cHunt Estate,\u201d unique for its Dutch colonial design. The plaintiffs purchased the house in 1962 and have resided there continuously since that time. Over the years, periodic improvements have been made to the structure, many of which are not consistent with its historic nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In 1997, the plaintiffs filed an application to the zoning commission seeking to resubdivide their property into two lots, one containing 14,156 square feet and the house, and the other a vacant 7600 square foot lot. In a letter dated April, 25, 1997, the zoning commission denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application, concluding that, although \u201cthe proposed resubdivision meets the minimal lot size requirements of the zone, [it] would be incompatible with the character of the neighborhood by eliminating the space around the 1902 house that was provided in the 1958 subdivision and creating an adjacent smaller and more narrow lot than all the others on the street, contrary to the spirit and intent of the Subdivision Regulations . . . .\u201d In its denial letter, the zoning commission suggested that the plaintiffs \u201cconsider requesting Historic Overlay designation with division of the house into two dwelling units .... Parking could be located to the rear of the house, an exterior fire escape stairway would not be required, and the appearance of the house would more closely resemble the original appearance in a landscaped setting.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>plaintiffs appealed to the town planning and zoning board of appeals (board). The board reversed the decision of the zoning commission and granted the resubdivision conditioned upon the proposed removal of a section of the house that violated the five foot sideyard minimum setback requirements for the new 7600 square foot lot. When the plaintiffs could not meet the setback requirement, they applied for a variance, which the zoning commission denied. The plaintiffs also sought at that time to increase the size of the third floor elderly conversion unit in the house from the 700 square feet permitted under \u00a7 6-109.1 (5) (b) of the Greenwich Municipal Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to 1791 square feet, by removing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>internal partition on the third floor. That variance request also was denied. In sum, the resubdivision was granted, but the plaintiffs were required to remove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>part of the main structure that violated the minimum sideyard setback requirements, and they were prohibited from expanding the elderly conversion unit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In May, 1998, the plaintiffs, through their agent, James G. Sandy, again submitted this application to the zoning commission for a redesignation of their property from an R-7 to an R-7-HO, historic overlay zone, pursuant to \u00a7 6-109.1 of the Greenwich Municipal Code land use regulations. The plaintiffs claimed that the structure met the standards of \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a) (1), (2), (3) and (4) because of its unique design, historical significance and distinctive architectural character. In accordance with \u00a7 6-109.1 (5) (b), the plaintiffs also submitted a related site plan and special permit request, which, if historic overlay zone designation had been granted, would have created two units within the existing structure including one large first and second floor unit, and one unit on the third floor in which the plaintiffs would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>reside.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Access to the third floor unit would have been by an elevator to be constructed within the interior of the dwelling as well as by existing stairways.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The historic overlay zone application, the site plan and the special permit request also were submitted to the historic district commission for evaluation and eventual recommendation to the zoning commission. In a letter dated July 29, 1998, the historic district commission recommended to the zoning commission that the plaintiffs\u2019 application be approved, despite the fact that many of the structure\u2019s \u201coriginal architectural details [had] been lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Notwithstanding the evaluation and recommendation of the historic district commission, however, the zoning commission denied the historic overlay zone application on the grounds that the house and property failed to meet the standards set forth in \u00a7.6-109.1 (3) (a). The site plan and special permit requests to convert the house into a two-family residence also were denied. The zoning commission concluded that \u201cthe proposed re-zoning of this property to an Historic Overlay Zone for 2 residences in this large building on this 14,000+ [square foot] lot would not be appropriate or in keeping with the character of the single family neighborhood</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 (b) and 8-9.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Hickey, <em>J., </em>sustained the appeal, concluding that historic overlay zone designation should have been granted because the historic district commission had found that the plaintiffs\u2019 property satisfied the standards in \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a) and had recommended the granting of the application. Therefore, the trial court concluded that the zoning commission had abused its discretion by denying the application and the related site plan and special permit request despite the historic district commission\u2019s recommendations, without evaluating the merits of the site plan and special permit application separate from the request for historic overlay zone designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the trial court determined that the zoning commission had acted in an administrative capacity in considering the plaintiffs\u2019 application for historic overlay zone designation. The trial court reached this conclusion by comparing an historic overlay zone to both a special permit and a floating zone. The trial court concluded that an historic overlay zone was more like a special permit than a floating zone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Acting on the basis of this conclusion, the trial court held that: (1) \u201cthe record [revealed] nothing to contradict the findings of the historic district commission that [the] property met at least one, if not all, of the standards of \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a) and [the plaintiffs] should have been granted an [historic overlay] zone designation\u201d based on the findings of the historic district commission; and (2) \u201cthe [zoning] commission acted illegally, arbitrarily or in abuse of its discretion in denying [the plaintiffs\u2019] application for an [historic overlay] zone designation.\u201d The trial court then concluded that the zoning commission had acted improperly and in abuse of its discretion by denying the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan and special permit applications solely because of the denial of the historic overlay zone application. The trial court determined that, because the zoning commission had not considered the merits of the site plan and special permit request separately from the application for historic overlay zone designation, that issue should be remanded to the zoning commission for proper consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The trial court remanded the matter to the zoning commission for proper consideration of the site plan and special permit application in accordance with \u00a7 6-109.1 (5) of the Greenwich Municipal Code land use regulations. The zoning commission appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In order to determine the proper standard of review, we first must consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the process of acting on a request for an historic overlay zone designation is an administrative function of the zoning commission. \u201cLegislative decisions reached by [a zoning] commission must be upheld by the trial court if they are reasonably supported by the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 122, 151, 653 A.2d 798 (1995). \u201cIn appeals from administrative zoning decisions, by contrast, the decisions will be invalidated even if they were reasonably supported by the record, if they were not supported by \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence in that record.\u201d Id. The trial court compared the historic overlay zone with a special permit, or special exception, the granting of which is an administrative function; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>244 Conn. 619, 627, 711 A.2d 675 (1998); and with a floating zone, the creation of which is a legislative function; <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 16, 266 A.2d 396 (1969); in order to determine which zoning device was more akin to historic overlay designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The zoning commission claims that the trial court improperly concluded that an historic overlay zone is more like a special permit than a floating zone. We disagree. \u201cA special permit allows a property owner to use his property in a manner expressly permitted by the local zoning regulations. . . . The proposed use, however, must satisfy standards set forth in the zoning regulations themselves as well as the conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>and property values.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>A. P. &amp; W. Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>167 Conn. 182, 185, 355 A.2d 91 (1974); see also General Statutes \u00a7 8-2.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An application for a special permit seeks permission to vary the use of a particular piece of property from that for which it is zoned, without offending the uses permitted as of right in the particular zoning district. See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 627; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Barberino Realty &amp; Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 607, 613, 610 A.2d 1205 (1992). When a special permit is issued, the affected property may be allowed an exception to the underlying zoning regulations, but it continues to be governed in the same manner as provided in the overall comprehensive plan. \u201cWhen ruling upon an application for a special permit, a planning and zoning board acts in an administrative capacity. . . . [Its] function . . . [is] to decide within prescribed limits and consistent with the exercise of [its] legal discretion, whether a particular section of the zoning regulations applies to a given situation and the manner in which it does apply.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Unlike the special permit, a floating zone is the product of legislative action. <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>supra, 159 Conn. 16. \u201cA floating zone is a special detailed use district of undetermined location in which the proposed kind, size and form of structures must be preapproved. It is legislatively predeemed compatible with the area in which it eventually locates if specified standards are met and the particular application is not unreasonable. ... It differs from the traditional Euclidean zone in that it has no defined boundaries and is said to float over the entire area where it may eventually be established.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>168 Conn. 20, 22, 357 A.2d 495 (1975), and cases cited therein. A floating zone, unlike a special permit, carves a new zone out of an existing one. See <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>supra, 17; see also <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 22-26 (floating zone application equal to request for zone change).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Zone changes are governed by a two part test: \u201c(1) The zone change must be in accord with a comprehen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>sive plan, General Statutes \u00a7 8-2, <em>Summ </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>150 Conn. 79, 87, 186 A.2d 160 [1962], and (2) it must be reasonably related to the normal police power purposes enumerated in \u00a7 8-2; <em>Summ </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 91; see also \u2018The Connecticut Law of Zoning,\u2019 41 Conn. B.J. 262, 272.\u201d <em>First Hartford Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>165 Conn. 533, 541, 338 A.2d 490 (1973). \u201cA comprehensive plan has been defined as a general plan to control and direct the use and development of property in a municipality or a large part thereof by dividing it into districts according to the present and potential use of the properties.\u201d <em>Summ </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 87. \u201cThe requirement of a comprehensive plan is generally satisfied when the zoning authority acts with the intention of promoting the best interests of the entire community.\u201d <em>First Hartford Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The trial court noted that \u201c[t]he [historic overlay] zone is similar to a floating zone in that its location is undetermined, and the type of property to which such a designation would be granted is pre-approved.\u201d Cf. <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>supra, 159 Conn. 16. The trial court concluded that \u201c[u]nlike a typical floating zone, however, the property in an [historic overlay] zone continues to bear its original zone designation, but adopts an overlay. . . . All of the regulations, responsibilities and controls associated with the underlying zone continue to apply to the property except as amended by \u00a7 6-109.1 (4). [Thus] if a property is granted an [historic overlay] designation, there are few additional regulations, responsibilities or controls placed upon the site unless the owner applies for a special permit that would allow additional uses of the property not normally allowed in the underlying zone but allowed in the overlay zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>We recognize that, in some respects, an historic overlay zone resembles a floating zone. For example, it generally can \u201cfloat around\u201d a town and land on historic properties. When historic overlay designation is granted, however, \u00a7 6-109.1 (4) of the Greenwich Municipal Code provides that \u201c[a] site rezoned by the Commission to [historic overlay] shall continue to bear its original zone designation with the initials HO appended to indicate the Historic Overlay Zone. <em>All zoning regulations and controls applying to the underlying zone shall continue to govern the [historic overlay] site except as amended by this section </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Historic overlay designation does not change the overall zoning in the area in which the historic structure is located. Unlike a floating zone, therefore, an historic overlay zone does not affect the comprehensive plan, nor must it be \u201clegislatively predeemed compatible with the area\u201d in which it lands. See <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 20.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>154 Conn. 156, 222 A.2d 337 (1966), this court considered the nature of a similar zoning device known as an \u201carea designation.\u201d In <em>Powers, </em>the plaintiff appealed after Danbury\u2019s common council had denied his application for a multiple housing area designation in an area zoned a \u201cprofessional office and apartment district.\u201d The plaintiff had purchased the property with the intention of erecting a high-rise apartment building on the site. Section 3.17 of the Danbury zoning regulations provided that any area in an office and apartment district, \u201cupon the recommendation of the City Planning Commission, may be designated by the Common Council, after a public hearing, as a multiple housing project area . . . .\u201d Id., 158. The regulation also provided that those regulations governing the underlying district would continue to apply to any property for which multiple housing designation was granted. Id. The effect of the regulation was that a specific area in the district could be put to a special use, for example a multiple housing project area, as long as it was permitted by the regulation and was \u201cfirst recommended by the planning commission and designated by the council for that use.\u201d Id., 159. We concluded that this area designation process was, in effect, a procedure for the granting of a special permit. Id., 159-60. Although neither the term \u201cspecial exception\u201d nor the term \u201cspecial permit\u201d was used in the relevant section of the Danbury zoning regulations, we held that \u201c[t]he nomenclature [was] immaterial so long as the effect [was] the same.\u201d Id., 159. We concluded, therefore, that \u201c[w]hen the council was considering the application for an area designation, it was acting administratively . . . [and necessarily required] standards to guide [them in acting upon an application for designation as a multiple housing project area.]\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 160. We conclude that an \u201carea designation\u201d is similar to an historic overlay designation. In both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>cases, a specific property receives a special designation allowing special uses, but the underlying zoning district regulations continue to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the zoning commission\u2019s consideration of an historic overlay zone application is an administrative function. See <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>218 Conn. 324, 329-30, 589 A.2d 351 (1991). \u201cIn appeals from administrative zoning decisions, the commission\u2019s conclusions will be invalidated only if they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. . . . [E]vidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cybulski </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>43 Conn. App. 105, 110-11, 682 A.2d 1073, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 949, 686 A.2d 123 (1996). \u201cThe [commission\u2019s] decision must be sustained if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given. . . . The evidence . . . to support any such reason [however] must be substantial . . . .\u201d <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 539-40, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We next consider the zoning commission\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the zoning commission was bound by the findings of the historic district commission and, therefore, should have granted the application in light of its favorable recommendation. Pursuant to \u00a7 6-109.1 (2), the zoning commission must refer all applications to the historic district commission \u201cand any other consultants the [zoning commission] may choose for evaluation and recommendations.\u201d The historic district commission conducts an evaluation in order to determine whether the site satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a), and then makes a recommendation to the zoning commission. The zoning commission argues that the trial court improperly concluded that the zoning commission had no discretion to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 application.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Contrary to the zoning commission\u2019s claim, however, our examination of the record persuades us that the trial court merely concluded that the record revealed nothing to contradict the findings of the historic district commission that the plaintiffs\u2019 property met at least one, if not all, of the standards of \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a) and should have been granted historic overlay designation. Thus, the trial court clearly suggested that if the record had contained evidence to contradict the historic district commission\u2019s findings, the zoning commission would have had the discretion to weigh that evidence against the historic district commission\u2019s findings. In essence, therefore, the trial court did not find that the zoning commission was bound by the historic district commission\u2019s recommendation to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 application, but rather found that there was no evidence supporting the zoning commission\u2019s decision to deny historic overlay designation. Accordingly, we reject the zoning commission\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We next consider the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the zoning commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application for historic overlay designation was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The zoning commission claims that the record contained sufficient evidence to warrant denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application. We agree with the zoning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">As noted previously, \u201c[i]n appeals from administrative zoning decisions . . . the decisions will be invalidated even if they were reasonably supported by the record, if they were not supported by \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence in that record.\u201d <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 151, citing <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 540. \u201cIn an appeal from the decision of a zoning [commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sion], we therefore review the record to determine whether there is factual support for the [commission\u2019s] decision. . . <em>Pleasant View Farms Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>218 Conn. 265, 270, 588 A.2d 1372 (1991). Should substantial evidence exist in the record to support any basis or stated reason for the zoning commission\u2019s decision, the court must sustain that decision. See <em>DeBeradinis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>228 Conn. 187, <em>199, </em>635 A.2d 1220 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Section 6-109.1 of the Greenwich Municipal Code sets forth the purpose, procedure, standards and controls for historic overlay zone designations. The purpose, according to \u00a7 6-109.1 (1), is to encourage \u201cthe protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of buildings and structures . . . and appurtenant vistas having special historical or aesthetic value which represent or reflect elements of the Town\u2019s cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history.\u201d In achieving this purpose, the zoning commission is guided by the standards set forth in \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a), which include a structure\u2019s uniqueness, historical significance, distinct architectural character and overall worthiness of preservation. We conclude that the zoning commission adequately considered all of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a) in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application for historic overlay zone designation, and that the record contains substantial evidence supporting the zoning commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The historic district commission sent a letter to the zoning commission in July, 1998, recommending that the plaintiffs\u2019 request for historic overlay be approved.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The historic district commission determined that \u201cthe building derives its historic importance because of, and not despite, its current surroundings. . . . [Therefore] the fact [that] it stands out from its neighbors warrants preservation. As it is now, the property causes a viewer to compare the present, as represented by the house\u2019s neighbors, with the past. It makes one wonder what changes the area has gone through.\u201d The historic district commission also noted, however, that \u201cmany of the original architectural details [had] been lost.\u201d Most notably, the structure\u2019s wood siding had been replaced by vinyl siding. An important factor in the historic district commission\u2019s recommendation, therefore, was the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement that \u201cany future repairs to the home [would] render it more in keeping with its original condition.\u201d The historic district commission also noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 new site plan and special permit requests seemed to preserve the \u201cgrand home,\u201d rather than turn it into a \u201cbig building\u201d such as a rooming house.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The zoning commission considered the historic district commission\u2019s evaluation and recommendation at a public hearing in August, 1998, and at its meeting held September 10,1998. Neighbors opposed to the plaintiffs\u2019 application for historic overlay designation pointed out at the public hearing that there had been no neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>hood input into the historic district commission\u2019s report. Tom Hartch, representing two of the other neighbors and identifying himself as a past president of the Greenwich Historical Society, was quoted at the public hearing as saying that \u201cto conclude that this altered and vinyl-covered house is historic would so dilute the word historic as to render it almost meaningless.\u201d Other neighborhood representatives expressed shock at the historic district commission\u2019s recommendation letter, considering it vague and very lax in its requirements for historic overlay designation. The historic district commission requested only that the vinyl siding be replaced with wood siding when it became necessary. The historic district commission ignored the fact that a porch on the second floor in the rear of the house had been replaced by a large window. The historic district commission also did not consider how the installation of the proposed elevator would affect the exterior appearance of the house. Furthermore, the historic district commission recommended historic overlay designation relying on promises of future repairs in keeping with the historical character of the house, rather than requiring such repairs prior to the granting of historic overlay designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Transcripts of both the public hearings and the zoning commission meetings were replete with evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 house was in disrepair, that most of the changes or improvements made to the house were not consistent with its historical nature, and that the property was too small for the size of the structure. Photographs showed that the roof was in poor condition and that the landscaping had been neglected. Photographs also illustrated that the modem, modest houses surrounding the plaintiffs\u2019 house were on lots appropriate for their size and structure. Significant architectural changes in the neighborhood had rendered the plaintiffs\u2019 house no longer part of an historic streetscape. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Neighbors argued that the historical nature of the surroundings had been altered by the plaintiffs\u2019 changes to the property and that further expansion and changes would only continue to deplete its historic value. Instead, neighbors contended, and the zoning commission agreed, that the plaintiffs simply sought historic overlay designation in order to gain the \u201cbonus units\u201d necessary to expand the elderly conversion unit, while keeping the smaller adjacent lot for future development. Pursuant to the historic district commission\u2019s recommendation, that could be done with mere future promises of improvements and historic restoration.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">At its September, 1998 meeting, the zoning commission noted that the historic district commission had \u201chalfheartedly endorsed the concept of [the plaintiffs\u2019 property] meriting an historic overlay rezoning,\u201d and had recommended historic overlay designation only because it felt that the plaintiffs\u2019 house showed a \u201chistory of development and growth in Greenwich.\u201d The zoning commission found that conclusion to be only modestly persuasive, because the rest of the street had developed in a \u201cmore modem way.\u201d The zoning commission accepted, however, that the house might merit some consideration for historic overlay zone designation upon restoration of its original constmction and landscape. The zoning commission mainly was concerned by the prior resubdivision of the plaintiffs\u2019 property in 1997, which had left the 5450 square foot house on a lot only 14,000 square feet in size. Furthermore, the house was situated next to a 7600 square foot lot that potentially would be the site of another structure as close as ten feet away. Zoning commission members also discussed the parking and site plan defects that would mar the historical character of the property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>its denial letter, the zoning commission \u201cencouraged [the plaintiffs] to reapply for an [historic overlay] zone, [s]pecial [p]ermit and [s]ite plan for two dwelling units on the full 21,756 [square foot] lot with required parking removed from the circular drive in front and relocated to the rear of the house. . . . [The zoning commission] [a]lso require [d] . . . submission of the standard form of preservation easement with additional language for future removal of the vinyl siding when replacement of siding becomes necessary and provision for Historic District Commission examination of specific changes that will be made to the structure . . . .\u201d Thus, the zoning commission denied the historic overlay zone application without prejudice, until the plaintiffs submitted a new application that merged the previously subdivided lots. In essence, the zoning commission indicated that it would have granted historic overlay zone designation only if there was no danger of development on the 7600 square foot lot, which would have overcrowded not only the historic landscape of the plaintiffs\u2019 property, but also the neighborhood in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Ultimately, all members of the zoning commission agreed that the property should not be granted historic overlay zone designation unless the plaintiffs agreed to merge the two subdivided lots and provide a new site plan showing how the entire property would be designed in accordance with the historical nature of the original lot. When these conditions were met, the zoning commission would reconsider the plaintiffs\u2019 application for historical overlay designation. As a result, the plaintiffs would not be eligible for the bonus units permitted by \u00a7 6-109.1 (5) (b) for the third floor elderly conversion unit until the standards for historic overlay designation were met. We conclude that the zoning commission reasonably could have found that the plaintiffs\u2019 property did not warrant historic overlay designation in its current condition and setting. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>record contains substantial evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposal did not satisfy \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a) because the house required certain repairs in keeping with its historical nature, and the subdivided lots would have to be merged in order for the lot size to accent the large, historic nature of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\"> An R-7 zone allows for single-family homes with a minimum lot size of 7500 square feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\"> In its denial letter, the zoning commission referred to a prior application for resubdivision filed by the plaintiffs in which they had requested subdivision of the property and historic overlay designation.

The plaintiffs claim that the zoning commission improperly relied upon reports from the sewer superintendent, the town\u2019s engineering division, the building department and the historic district commission while considering the plaintiffs\u2019 historic overlay application, site plan and special permit request. Only the historic district commission\u2019s report pertained to the application for historic overlay zone designation; all of the other reports were submitted in relation to the site plan and special permit requests. The trial court concluded that historic overlay had to be approved before any action could be taken on the site plan and special permit requests because it was a hurdle for obtaining the \u201cbonus units\u201d available through \u00a7 6-109.1 (5) (b). The trial court concluded, therefore, that only the historic district commission\u2019s report was \u201c[t]he appropriate report for consideration\u201d regarding the historic overlay zone application because it was the only report that addressed the required criteria established in \u00a7 6-109.1 (3) (a). We agree. Because the zoning commission is not bound by the recommendations of the historic district commission, however, it may weigh the historic district commission\u2019s findings as one piece of evidence in considering an historic overlay application.

Ed. 2d 540 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> The record also contains a September, 1996 letter from the historic district commission to the zoning commission regarding an application for historic overlay zone designation filed by the plaintiffs in 1996. At that time, the historic district commission \u201cconsidered the property historic and worthy of preservation but marginal as an [historic overlay zone] because of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201c1.
