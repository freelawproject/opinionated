App. 353, 364, 764 A.2d 203 (2001). At issue is whether the trial court properly concluded that the allegations concerning the plaintiffs fall from a wheelchair during a physical therapy session conducted on the defendants\u2019 premises asserted a claim of medical malpractice, rather than ordinary negligence, thereby requiring the filing of a certificate of good faith pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-lOOa.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the trial court, in holding that all the plaintiffs claims sounded in medical malpractice rather than in ordinary negligence, usurp the function of a jury by deciding a question of fact in a summary judgment motion?\u201d <em>Trimel </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Memorial Hospital Rehabilitation </em>Center, 255 Conn. 948, 769 A.2d 64 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Having reviewed the record on appeal and having considered the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we conclude that the appeal in this case should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo civil action shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury ... in which it is alleged that such injury . . . resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless the attorney or party filing the action has made a reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. The complaint or initial pleading shall contain a certificate, on a form prescribed by the rules of the superior court, of the attorney or party filing the action that such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
