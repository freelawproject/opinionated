Young, was found guilty of three counts of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-110b and General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-110b, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-214, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count each of breach of the peace in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and criminal mischief in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-117 (a) (1) (A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the trial court rendered judgments<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in accordance with the jury verdicts, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had granted the state\u2019s motion for a missing witness instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to produce an eyewitness to one of the three incidents, in accordance with <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Appellate Court concluded that: (1) this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 722, 738, 737 A.2d 442 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1170, 120 S. Ct. 1195, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1099 (2000), in which we abandoned the <em>Secondino </em>rule in criminal cases, has retrospective applicability and, therefore, the missing witness instruction given by the trial court was improper; and (2) the impropriety constituted harmful error, thereby entitling the defendant to a new trial in connection with the charges stemming from the incident to which the <em>Secondino </em>charge related, namely, one count each of criminal violation of a protective order, breach of the peace, disorderly conduct, reckless endangerment in the second degree and criminal mischief in the third degree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>57 Conn. App. 566, 572-73, 750 A.2d 482 (2000). Thus, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment pertaining to the defendant\u2019s conviction on those charges but affirmed the two other judgments pertaining to the defendant\u2019s two other convictions for criminal violation of a protective order.* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See id., 580-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The state sought certification to appeal from that portion of the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, claiming that the Appellate Court improperly had concluded that our decision in <em>Malave </em>should be applied retroactively. We granted the state\u2019s petition limited to the issue of whether <em>Malave </em>has retrospective applicability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>253 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>922, 754 A.2d 799 (2000). We do not decide this certified issue, however, because, even if we assume, as the state contends, that our decision in <em>Malave </em>should not be applied retroactively, we nevertheless conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion for a <em>Secondino </em>charge<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, consequently, the charge should not have been given. We further conclude, however, that, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, the trial court\u2019s <em>Secondino </em>charge was harmless. We, therefore, reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">As we have indicated, the defendant was charged in connection with three separate incidents.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The first and third incidents, which occurred on August 4, 1995, and November 30, 1995, respectively, resulted in the defendant\u2019s arrest for one count of criminal violation of a protective order per incident. The second incident, which occurred on November 25,1995,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> resulted in the defendant\u2019s arrest for one count each of, inter alia, criminal violation of a protective order, breach of the peace, disorderly conduct, reckless endangerment in the first degree<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and criminal mischief in the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>degree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although only the convictions stemming from the November 25, 1995 incident are the subject of this appeal, we also set forth the facts that the jury reasonably could have found in regard to the other two incidents because those facts are relevant to the issue of whether the improper <em>Secondino </em>charge was harmful. See part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u201cOn August 18, 1994, the court issued a protective order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim, Brandis Breedlove. The order remained in effect until January 11, 1996. The defendant was involved in three separate incidents ....</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u201cThe first incident occurred on August 4, 1995. The defendant knocked on Breedlove\u2019s door at approximately 1 a.m. Breedlove refused to let him into her home. The defendant then went to Breedlove\u2019s car and started pulling out wires from the engine. Breedlove told the defendant that she was going to call the police and the defendant left. Breedlove then called the police and reported the incident. Shortly thereafter, the defendant called Breedlove and inquired about the whereabouts of the police. Breedlove told him that the police had been called and were on their way.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u201cState Trooper Jack Richard Sauve arrived at the scene and began taking Breedlove\u2019s statement. The telephone rang and Breedlove answered. She told Sauve that the defendant was on the telephone and handed the telephone to him. Sauve said, \u2018Michael, this is Trooper Sauve. Where are you?\u2019 The defendant replied, \u2018I\u2019m around. Why do you want to know?\u2019 At no point did the caller deny being the defendant. Initially, Breedlove did not sign the statement prepared by Sauve. Three weeks later she contacted Sauve and signed the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ment, alleging that the defendant had continued to harass her.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cThe second incident occurred on November 25, 1995. Breedlove and Robert Cormier were at a bar in Stafford [known as Munn\u2019s Pub]. As they were leaving, the defendant and a friend, Lanny Martin, arrived at the parking lot in the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant got out of the car, walked to Breedlove, spit on her, pushed her to the ground and then started fighting with Cormier. The fight was broken' up by patrons of the bar. Breedlove and Cormier got into Breedlove\u2019s car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cAs they were driving home, Breedlove noticed that the defendant was following her. The defendant rammed his car into her car from behind five or six times at a speed of approximately forty-five miles per hour. Breedlove stopped her car and got out. The defendant and Martin got out of the defendant\u2019s car, and the defendant [approached] Cormier. Breedlove intervened and the defendant hit her with a closed fist. He then picked up Breedlove by her hair and dragged her down the road. While this was taking place, Martin held Cormier back by brandishing a broken beer bottle. Breedlove managed to get back into her car, at which point the defendant kicked in the driver\u2019s side window. Breedlove received cuts on her forehead, nose and lower lip. She also had bruises on her cheek and mouth from being hit, and was left with a bald spot where her hair was pulled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u201cThe third incident occurred on November 30, 1995. The defendant telephoned Breedlove at home approximately fifteen times and drove by her home later that night. The defendant was charged in a separate information stemming from each incident.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 568-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>After the court rendered judgments in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdicts, the defendant appealed from those judgments to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion for a missing witness instruction with respect to the defendant\u2019s failure to call Martin as a witness to testify about the November 25, 1995 incident.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Appellate Court did not address the mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>its of the defendant\u2019s <em>Secondino </em>claim but, rather, concluded that this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. Malave, supra, 250 Conn. 738, in which we abandoned the missing witness rule in criminal cases, applied retroactively to the present case,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, further, that the instruction was harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 572-73. The Appellate Court, therefore, reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction arising from the November 25, 1995 incident. Id., 580. Although we do not decide the issue of whether <em>Malave </em>should be applied retroactively, we agree with the defendant that, under the circumstances presented, the state was not entitled to a <em>Secondino </em>instruction. We conclude, however, that the giving of that instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We first address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the state\u2019s motion for a missing witness instruction. The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following additional facts that are necessary to our resolution of this issue. \u201cThe defendant and Martin were charged as codefendants as a result of the events that occurred on November 25, 1995. They were tried separately and, at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, Martin\u2019s case was pending. At the defendant\u2019s trial, State Trooper Colleen Anuszewski testified that she had seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Martin the day before and that he could be located in Hartford. On cross-examination, the defendant testified that Martin was a friend and the defendant knew where he could be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u201cAt the close of all of the evidence but prior to summation, the state filed a request for a <em>Secondino . </em>. . instruction to be given to the jury. The defendant objected and made an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury. Defense counsel offered the testimony of Phillip N. Armentano, an attorney for Martin in his pending criminal trial. Armentano testified that if Martin were to take the witness stand, he would advise him to invoke his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The court concluded that the privilege was personal to Martin and overruled the [defendant\u2019s] objection. The court found that Martin was available and that he was a witness whom the defendant naturally would be expected to call to testify. The court refused to speculate as to whether Martin would invoke his fifth amendment privilege and granted the state\u2019s request for the <em>Secondino </em>instruction.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id., 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u201cPrior to the issuance of our opinion in <em>[State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 722], we had permitted missing witness instructions in certain circumstances. We</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>recently summarized our <em>pre-Malave </em>missing witness jurisprudence as follows: The failure to produce a witness for trial who is available and whom a party would naturally be expected to call warrants an adverse inference instruction against the party who would be expected to call that witness. . . . [T]he two requirements for a <em>Secondino </em>adverse inference instruction against a party are that the witness: (1) is available; and (2) could reasonably be expected, by his [or her] relationship to the party or the issues, to have peculiar or superior information material to the case that, if favorable, the party would produce. . . . The party seeking the adverse inference instruction bears the burden of proving both prongs of the test, and the trial court must make a preliminary determination that there is evidence in the record to support these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u201cWhether a party has established the requirements for a <em>Secondino </em>instruction is a factual determination that is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . We will not disturb that discretion unless the failure to give such an instruction amounts to a clear abuse of that discretion. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 813-14, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>257 Conn. 761, 767-68, 778 A.2d 933 (2001). Under <em>Secondino, </em>therefore, it was the state\u2019s burden to establish, first, that the missing witness, Martin, was available to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The defendant contends that Martin was unavailable to testify because, if called, Martin almost certainly would have invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant bases his contention on the following facts: (1) Martin, himself, had pending charges arising from the November 25, 1995 incident at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial; (2) Martin\u2019s attorney, Armentano, testified that he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>advised Martin to exercise his constitutional privilege against sell-incrimination if Martin had been called to testify; and (3) Martin had a compelling reason to accept his attorney\u2019s advice in light of the pending charges. The state claims that, because the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is a personal one, only the witness, himself, can invoke it, and, consequently, the court reasonably refused to assume that Martin, who physically was available, would have declined to testify by exercising his privilege against self-incrimination. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">There can be no doubt that a witness who, like Martin, has pending criminal charges, generally will be well advised to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination to avoid subjecting himself to examination under oath in advance of his own trial. This is especially true when, as in the present case, the charges pending against the witness stem from the very same incident that would be the subject of the witness\u2019 testimony if he were to agree to testify. It, therefore, would have been highly unusual if Martin\u2019s attorney did <em>not </em>indicate that he intended to advise Martin to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination if the defendant called Martin as a witness. Under the circumstances, there is scant reason to think that Martin would have agreed to testify in this case notwithstanding his attorney\u2019s advice to the contrary.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The state relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecarelli, </em>32 Conn. App. 811, 631 A.2d 862 (1993), in support of its contention that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the state had satisfied its burden of showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>that Martin was available to testify for the defendant. In Cecarelli, the Appellate Court held that the trial court erred when it failed to conduct a hearing to determine whether a witness would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination instead of relying on the testimony of the witness\u2019 attorney that his client would invoke that privilege. Id., 818-19. Although we agree with the state that the court in <em>Cecarelli </em>was correct in characterizing the privilege against self-incrimination as a personal one; see id., 818; <em>Cecarelli </em>did not involve the invocation of that privilege in the context of determining whether a missing witness instruction was unwarranted on the basis of the witness\u2019 unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In Cecarelli, the defendant, John Cecarelli, sought to call a witness, Anthony Gentile, who, after his arrest on narcotics charges, agreed to cooperate with the police. Id., 813. Thereafter, Gentile, at the behest of the police, purchased narcotics from Cecarelli, who, following his arrest for that sale, claimed entrapment by the police. Id., 816. To support his entrapment defense at trial, Cecarelli attempted to call Gentile as a witness. Id., 817. Gentile\u2019s attorney informed the court, however, that, if called, Gentile would exercise his privilege against self-incrimination. Id. The trial court accepted counsel\u2019s representation and, over the defendant\u2019s objection, declined to conduct a hearing at which Gentile personally could be questioned, outside the presence of the jury, as to whether, in fact, he would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. Id., 817-18. In concluding that the hearing was necessary, the Appellate Corut noted not only that the privilege against self-incrimination is personal to the witness but, in addition, that Cecarelli might have had a bona fide claim that, under the circumstances, Gentile\u2019s constitutional privilege simply did not pertain to some of the questions that Cecarelli might wish to ask him regarding the drug transaction. Id., 818-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We agree that, in circumstances such as those presented in <em>Cecarelli, </em>it is necessary for the court to conduct a hearing to determine whether a witness whom a party <em>seeks to call </em>is unavailable. Indeed, in that case, Cecarelli\u2019s ability to call Gentile as a witness implicated his constitutional right to present a defense, and it, therefore, was imperative that the court hear from Gentile, himself, regarding his decision to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The hearing also was necessary to ensure that Gentile\u2019s invocation of the privilege was proper. Such certainty regarding a witness\u2019 invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination is not nearly so important in the context of determining unavailability under the <em>Secondino </em>rule, however, because, with respect to the latter situation, neither the party seeking the <em>Secondino </em>instruction nor the patty opposing the instruction is attempting to call the witness to testify; the issue, rather, is whether the jury may draw an adverse inference due to a party\u2019s <em>failure </em>to call a particular witness. Because \u201c [t]he giving of <em>a, Secondino </em>charge is purely an evidentiary issue and is not a matter of constitutional [dimension]\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 738; the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense is not implicated by a determination that, because there is a high likelihood that the witness will exercise his privilege against self-incrimination, a missing witness instruction is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">This court previously has indicated that a witness need not personally invoke his privilege against self-incrimination to justify a finding of unavailability for <em>Secondino </em>purposes when, in light of all the facts, it nevertheless is apparent that the witness will refuse to testify.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>170 Conn. 417, 430-31, 365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>A.2d 1135, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 845, 97 S. Ct. 126, 50 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1976) (trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s request for missing witness instruction regarding state\u2019s failure to call defendant\u2019s accomplice as witness because, inter alia, it appeared from record that, if called, witness would invoke her privilege against self-incrimination unless state granted her immunity). Several other courts also have concluded that a witness\u2019 personal invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination is not a necessary prerequisite to a finding that the witness is unavailable when, as in the present case, it is quite clear that the witness, if called, will exercise that privilege. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>526 F.2d 485, 487 (10th Cir. 1975); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>State, </em>315 Md. 309, 316, 554 A.2d 395 (1989); see <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>514 A.2d 787, 792 (D.C. 1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavness, </em>46 Haw. 470, 473, 381 P.2d 685 (1963) (prosecutor improperly urged jury to draw unfavorable inference from defendant\u2019s failure to call accomplice). Because it virtually was certain that Martin would have invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and would have refused to testify if called by the defendant, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion for a missing witness instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to produce Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Our conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion for a missing witness instruction does not end our inquiry; we also must determine whether the impropriety was harmful, thereby entitling the defendant to a new trial on the charges stemming from the November 25,1995 incident. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. As we recently have noted, we have not been fully consistent in our articulation of the standard for establishing harm. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>246 Conn. 746, 759, 719 A.2d 440 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1179, 119 S. Ct. 1116, 143 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1999). One line of cases states that the defendant must establish that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. [E.g.] <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>242 Conn. 318, 329, 699 A.2d 911 (1997) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>236 Conn. 176, 188, 671 A.2d 1296 (1996) .... A second line of cases indicates that the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>245 Conn. 351, 371-72, 716 A.2d 36 (1998) .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>246 Conn. 799, 812, 717 A.2d 1224 (1998). For purposes of the present case, we need not choose between the two formulations or decide whether there is any functional difference between them because, on the basis of our careful examination of the record, we conclude that the defendant has not satisfied his burden of proving harm under either formulation of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Breedlove and Cormier were the only eyewitnesses to testify for the state regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct and, therefore, they provided the key testimony against the defendant. Breedlove testified that the defendant repeatedly had continued to assault and otherwise harass her after the issuance of the protective order in August, 1994, and that the defendant\u2019s conduct on August 4, 1995, compelled her to contact the police. She also testified in detail regarding the events of November 25, 1995, and did not waver from her version of those events on cross-examination. She similarly was steadfast in her testimony regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>defendant\u2019s violation of the protective order on November 30,1995. Cormier\u2019s testimony regarding the November 25, 1995 incident corroborated Breedlove\u2019s testimony in all material respects. Although a friend of Breedlove, Cormier had no apparent motive to fabricate a story about the events of November 25, 1995.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">To be sure, both Breedlove\u2019s and Cormier\u2019s testimony was not unimpeachable. In particular, Breedlove had given two written statements prior to the incident of November 25, 1995, in which she stated\u2014falsely, according to her trial testimony\u2014that the defendant never had harmed her. In Cormier\u2019s case, he testified that he was intoxicated when he left Munn\u2019s Pub in the early morning hours of November 25, 1995, and conceded that his powers of observation consequently were \u201cnot that good.\u201d Breedlove, however, explained that she had made those false statements because she was afraid of the defendant and because she hoped that, by doing so, he would leave her alone. Furthermore, although Cormier candidly admitted that he had been drinking heavily at Munn\u2019s Pub prior to the November 25, 1995 incident, he also testified that he had a clear recollection of those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Moreover, both Breedlove\u2019s and Cormier\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses. For example, with respect to the incident of August 4, 1995, State Trooper Sauve, who had been dispatched to Breedlove\u2019s residence at approximately 1 a.m., spoke to the defendant on the telephone when the defendant attempted to contact Breedlove. In addition, Sauve testified that Breedlove was frightened and upset, and that she became even more concerned after the defendant\u2019s telephone call. Finally, Sauve\u2019s testimony regarding what Breedlove had told him about the defendant\u2019s conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>on August 4,1995, was consistent with Breedlove\u2019s testimony concerning the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The testimony of Breedlove and Cormier regarding the incident of November 25, 1995, also was corroborated by State Trooper Anuszewski, who arrived at Breedlove\u2019s residence at approximately 3 a.m. in response to Breedlove\u2019s call to the police. Anuszewski interviewed Breedlove and Anuszewski\u2019s testimony about her investigation of the November 25, 1995 incident was consistent with Breedlove\u2019s testimony. Anuszewski observed that Breedlove\u2019s face was bruised and swollen, that her lip had been cut, that her hair had been pulled out, leaving a bald spot on the left side of her scalp, and that the driver\u2019s side window of Breedlove\u2019s car had been smashed. Anuszewski also observed scratches and scrapes on the car\u2019s rear bumper, which were consistent with Breedlove\u2019s explanation that the defendant repeatedly had rammed her car from behind. Anuszewski further noted that Breedlove appeared to be very \u201cshaken\u201d by the incident. According to Anuszewski, Cormier, who had accompanied Breedlove to her residence, also was upset by the events, but was \u201ccalm and very cooperative, and willing to assist in any way he could.\u201d Finally, Anuszewski, who traveled to the area where the defendant allegedly had smashed Breedlove\u2019s car window, found a substantial amount of broken glass in the roadway where Breedlove had indicated that it would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Finally, State Trooper Kevin Lyons testified that he had been dispatched to Breedlove\u2019s residence at approximately 2 a.m. on December 1, 1995. According to Lyons, Breedlove informed him that the defendant had been calling her and driving by her home on November 30, 1995. Lyons further testified that Breedlove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>appeared to be \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d by the defendant\u2019s persistent and menacing conduct.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The defendant testified regarding the events of November 25 and 30, 1995. With respect to the second of these two incidents, the defendant denied that he had called Breedlove on the telephone on November 30 or that he had driven by her home. His version of the events of November 25, 1995, also was completely contrary to the evidence adduced by the state. Specifically, he claimed that Breedlove had approached him in the parking lot near Munn\u2019s Pub and, without provocation, proceeded to assault him. The defendant \u00e9xplained that Breedlove had attacked him because she was upset that he was romantically involved with someone else. The defendant also explained that he did not strike Breedlove but, rather, ran away to avoid any further conflict -with Breedlove. According to the defendant, Martin, who was driving the defendant\u2019s car, picked him up shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The defendant further testified that he and Martin were parked on the side of the road when Breedlove, accompanied by Cormier, drove past his car, pulled in front of him and stopped. According to the defendant, he got out of his car and walked over to Breedlove, who also had exited her vehicle. The defendant stated that he hugged Breedlove and told her that he loved her. The defendant testified that Breedlove initially was calm, but that she started hitting him again. According to the defendant, he endeavored to protect himself by repeatedly pushing Breedlove away, but, in doing so, accidentally knocked her to the ground. The defendant stated that when Breedlove got up, she went into her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>car to retrieve a flashlight. Concerned that Breedlove was going to use the flashlight as a weapon against him, the defendant kicked her driver\u2019s side door closed and then returned to his vehicle and drove away to avoid any further trouble. The defendant testified that Breedlove, herself, inadvertently smashed the driver\u2019s side window of her vehicle with the flashlight that she had retrieved from her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On cross-examination, the defendant stated that Breedlove\u2019s physical attack against him \u201cwas her way of telling [him] she still loved [him].\u201d He also stated that he frequently is falsely accused, and that the police have arrested him many times for no reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The state\u2019s case and the defendant\u2019s version of the events, therefore, were diametrically opposed. Consequently, the jury\u2019s primary task was to assess and determine the relative credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses, on the one hand, and the defendant, on the other hand. As its verdicts reflect, the jury credited the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses. We do not believe that the improper <em>Secondino </em>instruction was likely to have affected the jury\u2019s credibility assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Because Martin was not a witness to the incidents of August 4,1995, and November 30, 1995, the improper <em>Secondino </em>charge related only to the incident of November 25, 1995. It is apparent that the jury, by virtue of its guilty verdict on the charge of criminal violation of a protective order arising out of the incident of August 4, 1995, credited Breedlove\u2019s testimony regarding that incident. As to the jury\u2019s finding of guilty of criminal violation of a protective order stemming from the incident of November 30, 1995, it is clear that the jury not only credited Breedlove, but also necessarily disbelieved the defendant\u2019s contradictory testimony. Inasmuch as the jury found Breedlove to be credible with respect to those two incidents, and found the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to lack credibility with respect to the November 30, 1995 incident, the defendant has a difficult burden to show that the improper <em>Secondino </em>charge so undermined the credibility of his version of the November 25,1995 incident, as to entitle him to a new trial on the charges arising therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We are not persuaded that the defendant has satisfied that burden. The defendant\u2019s explanation of what occurred on November 25, 1995, is highly implausible; it strains credulity to believe that Breedlove attacked the defendant, both outside Munn\u2019s Pub and again as she was on her way home with Cormier, as a way of demonstrating her love for the defendant.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> More importantly, however, it is very unlikely that the jury, having concluded that the defendant, on two separate occasions, had violated a protective order that Breedlove obtained to protect herself from the defendant, would credit the defendant\u2019s claim that Breedlove, in the company of another man, Cormier, attacked the defendant because she still loved him so much.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">As we have explained, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion for a <em>Secondino </em>charge.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See part II of this opinion. Moreover, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the circumstances, the assistant state\u2019s attorney should not have been permitted, during closing arguments, to draw the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the defendant did not called Martin as a witness.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we conclude that the instruction, when viewed in the context of the entire trial and in the light of the verdicts returned in connection with the charges to which the improper instruction did not pertain, did not affect the result and was not so prejudicial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict of guilty of the charges arising from the November 25, 1995 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed insofar as it reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction on the charges arising from the November 25, 1995 incident and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-110b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of criminal violation of a protective order when an order issued pursuant to subsection (e) of section 46b~38c has been issued against such person, and such person violates such order. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Public Acts 1995, No. 95-214, \u00a7 5, amended subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-110b to include protective orders issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-lk.

He, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination with respect to the August 4,1995 incident. The opinion of the Appellate Court incorrectly states that the defendant also invoked his privilege against self-incrimination in connection with the November 30, 1995 incident. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 575.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant also claimed that the trial court improperly had: (1) precluded evidence of the victim\u2019s prior misconduct; (2) admitted evidence of a telephone conversation without a proper evidentiary foundation; (3) precluded the defendant from impeaching the victim regarding an alleged act of fraud; and (4) allowed the state to cross-examine the defendant regarding certain prior acts of misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 568. The Appellate Court rejected all but the last of these claims. Id., 576, 578, 580. With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly had permitted the state to cross-examine him regarding certain prior acts of misconduct, the Appellate Court declined to address that claim, concluding that the prior misconduct evidence related only to those charges stemming from the November 25, 1995 incident and, further, that the issue was unlikely to arise at a retrial on those charges. See id., 575. In view of our determination that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the <em>Secondino </em>charge given by the trial court entitles the defendant to a new trial, the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the prior misconduct. evidence must be addressed. Because of the limited nature of the certified issue in this case, the parties did not address the issue concerning the prior misconduct evidence in this court. Thus, the case must be remanded to the Appellate Court for consideration of that remaining issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">It. is also important to note that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the prior misconduct evidence related only to those charges stemming from the November 25, 1995 incident may have been based, at least in part, on its erroneous belief that the defendant testified only as to the November 25 incident, and invoked his privilege against self-incrimination as to the incidents of August 4, 1995, and November 30, 1995. See footnote 15 of this opinion (noting that, defendant invoked his privilege against self-incrimination only as to August 4 incident, and not as to November 30 incident). The trial court, in overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant regarding his prior acts of misconduct, concluded that the defendant opened the door to such cross-examination and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>stated that it would allow the state to use the prior misconduct evidence to shed light on the defendant\u2019s \u201ccredibility.\u201d It is indeed plausible that the jury might have viewed the prior misconduct evidence as casting doubt on the defendant\u2019s credibility in general and, because the defendant testified regarding the November 25 and November 30 incidents, the prior misconduct evidence may have contributed to the jury\u2019s decision to discredit the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding both the November 25 and November 30 incidents. Consequently, the Appellate Court\u2019s resolution on remand of the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the prior misconduct evidence may affect not only the trial court\u2019s judgment pertaining to the November 25 incident but, also, the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction of criminal violation of a protective order arising out of the November 30 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> This court decided H\u00edatowe during the pendency of the defendant\u2019s appeal of the present case to the Appellate Court.

In such circumstances, it simply is unfair for the court to invite the jury to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>an inference, based solely upon a party\u2019s failure to produce the witness, that the testimony thereof would be unfavorable to that party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> Cormier, who indicated that he had dated Breedlove for a short time, testified that they were not romantically involved at the time of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> The state also presented the testimony of Evan Stark, an expert in the field of domestic violence, who testified about battered woman\u2019s syndrome.
