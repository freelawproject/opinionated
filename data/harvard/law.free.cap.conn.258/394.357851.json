On November 10, 1989, the petitioner, William A. Connelly, became involved in an altercation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that resulted in his arrest on kidnapping and assault charges. Following his arrest on November 10, 1989, the petitioner was confined at the Newington police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>department until November 13, 1989, at which time he was transferred to the custody of the respondent, the commissioner of correction (commissioner). The petitioner remained in the custody of the commissioner, in lieu of bail, until April 20, 1990. On that date, the petitioner, who had been charged with two counts of kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-94<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and two counts of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-60,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was tried to the court, <em>Dunn, J., </em>and found not guilty by reason of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petitioner was transferred to Whiting Forensic Institute (Whiting) in Middletown for an examination pursuant to what is now \u00a7 17a-582 (a). On October 26, 1990, following the completion of that examination, the petitioner was committed by the court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>to the custody of the commissioner of mental health for a period of ten years, subject to periodic review by the psychiatric security review board. Judge Holzberg directed that the petitioner be confined at Whiting. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-599.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In 1993, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to have the habeas court vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal by reason of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect. On August 16, 1994, the habeas court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>granted the petition on the ground that the record did not affirmatively establish that the petitioner had been advised of his right to a jury trial. The habeas court vacated the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal by reason of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect and issued a writ of habeas corpus. On September 9, 1994, the petitioner was transferred from Whiting to the custody of the commissioner. In January, 1995, the petitioner was retried by a jury before <em>Scheinblum, J., </em>on the same charges of which he previously had been acquitted by reason of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect, namely two counts each of kidnapping in the second degree and assault in the second degree. On January 26, 1995, the petitioner was found guilty on all counts, and, on March 3,1995, the trial court sentenced him to a total effective sentence of forty years imprisonment. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>46 Conn. App. 486, 513, 700 A.2d 694 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 907, 908, 713 A.2d 829, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 907, 119 S. Ct. 245, 142 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, in which he claimed, inter alia, that the commissioner improperly had refused to grant him credit toward his forty year sentence for the period of time from April 20, 1990, to September 9, 1994, during which he was confined at Whiting pursuant to the first trial court\u2019s order of commitment following his insanity acquittal. In particular, the petitioner claimed that he was entitled to such credit under \u00a7 53a-38 (c), which provides that, when a sentence has been vacated and a new sentence has been imposed for the same offense or for an offense based on the same act, the time served under the vacated sentence shall be credited against the new sentence. The petitioner further claimed that the commissioner improperly denied him good time credit under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for the time that he was confined at Whiting. Finally, the petitioner asserted that the commissioner improperly had refused to grant him presentence confinement credit under General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for the three days that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>was incarcerated at the Newington police department immediately following his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The habeas court, <em>Hon. Thomas H. Corrigan, </em>judge trial referee, agreed with the petitioner\u2019s claims and ordered the commissioner to credit the petitioner\u2019s sentence for all of the time to which he claimed he was entitled under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-38 (c), 18-7a (c) and 18-98d (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The commissioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On appeal, the commissioner claims that the habeas court erroneously concluded that the petitioner was entitled to time credited toward his forty year sentence. We conclude that the petitioner is entitled to credit toward his sentence for the time that he was confined at Whiting and, in addition, that he is eligible for consideration by the commissioner as to whether he is entitled to statutory good time credit in connection with his confinement there. We also conclude, however, that the petitioner is not entitled to presentence confinement credit toward his sentence for the three days that he was confined at the Newington police department following his arrest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s claims raise issues of statutoiy construction, over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 26, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). Our resolution of those claims is governed by well established principles. \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 327-28, 692 A.2d 713 (1997). Guided by these principles, we turn, first, to the issue of whether the petitioner is entitled to credit, under \u00a7 53a-38 (c), for the time that he was confined at Whiting following his insanity acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">As with all issues of statutoiy construction, we begin with the pertinent statutoiy language. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c) provides: \u201cWTien a sentence of imprisonment that has been imposed on a person is vacated and a new sentence is imposed on such person for the same offense or for an offense based on the same act, the new sentence shall be calculated as if it had commenced at the time the vacated sentence commenced, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>time served under or credited against the vacated sentence shall be credited against the new sentence.\u201d Under its plain terms, \u00a7 53a-38 (c) applies to a vacated <em>sentence of imprisonment) </em>it contains no mention of a commitment order issued in connection with a vacated insanity acquittal. Although there is no dispute that both of the petitioner\u2019s trials involved the same conduct and the same charges, the commitment order issued by Judge Holzberg as a result of the petitioner\u2019s insanity acquittal is not a \u201csentence.\u201d Indeed, we consistently have noted the \u201cfundamental distinction between . . . incarceration pursuant to a criminal sentence and . . . commitment following an insanity acquittal\u201d; <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>225 Conn. 46, 49, 621 A.2d 1311 (1993); accord <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 374, 388, 780 A.2d 890 (2001); because commitment, unlike a criminal sentence, is not a sanction or penalty but, rather, a vehicle pursuant to which the court can ensure that a defendant who has engaged in unlawful conduct but has been found not guilty by reason of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect will receive treatment for his or her mental disease or defect. See <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 387. Strict application of the literal language of \u00a7 53a-38 (c), therefore, would preclude a determination that the petitioner is entitled to credit for the time that he was confined at Whiting following his insanity acquittal and subsequent commitment pursuant to \u00a7 17a-582.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">For several reasons, however, we are persuaded that such a strict construction of \u00a7 53a-38 (c) is not warranted. First, it is by no means clear that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 53a-38 (c), contemplated the scenario presented by this case. Because a defendant bears the burden of establishing the affirmative defense of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect under \u00a7 53a-13; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and because proof of that affirmative defense reheves the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>criminal responsibility for his unlawful conduct, it is rare for an insanity acquittee to challenge his or her acquittal; even rarer is the case in which that challenge is successful, as in the present case. It, therefore, is highly unlikely that the legislature anticipated such a situation when it enacted \u00a7 53a-38 (c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Furthermore, we believe that a literal interpretation of \u00a7 53a-38 (c) would result in an inequity that the legislature likely would not have intended. Although the <em>purpose </em>of an order of commitment issued as a result of an insanity acquittal is significantly different from that of a prison sentence imposed as a result of a criminal conviction; see, e.g., <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 387; the <em>effect </em>of such a commitment on the acquittee is no less a deprivation of liberty than that of a prison sentence. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has aptly characterized the involuntary confinement for treatment of mental illness as a \u201cmassive curtailment of liberty.\u201d <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>405 U.S. 504, 509, 92 S. Ct. 1048, 31 L. Ed. 2d 394 (1972); accord <em>Vitek </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 491, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1980). In fact, \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court has recognized involuntary commitment to a mental institution ... as involving more than a loss of freedom from confinement . . . due to its stigmatizing consequences, and the potential exposure to invasive, compulsory medical and psychiatric treatment.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 412-13, 645 A.2d 965 (1994), quoting <em>Vitek </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 492.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We note, moreover, that the loss of liberty is all the more profound when the institution to which the patient has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>been committed is a maximum security facility such as Whiting. See footnote 8 of this opinion and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For these reasons, \u201cour state law has, for certain purposes, likened [insanity] acquittees to prisoners who have been transferred to a mental hospital during the pendency of their jail sentence. We have noted that both classes of hospital inmates are being deprived of their liberty primarily for the protection of society . . . and [that] both have the same need for treatment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Metz, supra, 230 Conn. 417. Moreover, a sentenced prisoner who has been transferred from a penal institution to a mental health facility such as Whiting receives full credit toward his sentence for the time that he is confined at that facility. See generally, e.g., <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>205 Conn. 27, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987). Indeed, a defendant convicted of a crime who is found to be suffering from a psychiatric disability may be transferred to Whiting by the commissioner immediately after sentencing and, depending upon his response to treatment, may be required to serve the balance of his sentence there. At the very least, it is troubling that, under the inteipretation of \u00a7 53a-38 (c) advanced by the commissioner, a sentenced defendant who is transferred to Whiting will receive full credit for all of the time that he is confined at Whiting whereas the petitioner will receive no credit for any time that he was confined there even though the petitioner\u2019s confinement at Whiting, like that of the hypothetical prisoner who serves all or part of his sentence at Whiting, was the direct result of his prosecution for crimes that he ultimately was found guilty of committing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201c[W]e will not undertake an examination of [a statutory provision] with blinders on regarding what the legislature intended [it] to mean. ... In interpreting a statute, common sense must be used .... The law favors rational and sensible statutory construction. . . . The unreasonableness of the result obtained by the acceptance of one possible alternative interpretation of an act is a reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would provide a result that is reasonable. . . . When two constructions are possible, courts will adopt the one which makes the [statute] effective and workable, and not one which leads to difficult and possibly bizarre results. . . . We have long followed the guideline that [t]he intent of the lawmakers is the soul of the statute, and the search for this intent we have held to be the guiding star of the court. It must prevail over the literal sense and the precise letter of the language of the statute. . . . When one construction leads to public mischief which another construction will avoid, the latter is to be favored unless the terms of the statute absolutely forbid [it].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 306-307, 732 A.2d 144 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Section 53a-38 (c) contains no express prohibition against an award of credit when the confinement following a first trial resulted from a commitment order issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>as a result of a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity that subsequently is vacated and not from a sentence imposed after a subsequently vacated conviction. Moreover, we believe that the fundamental purpose of \u00a7 53a-38 (c) is to afford an inmate credit toward his current sentence for the time that he was confined as a direct result of his initial trial on the same charges.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It would be consistent with this basic statutory purpose to award the petitioner credit toward his forty year sentence for the period of time that he was confined at Whiting as a result of his acquittal by reason of insanity on the same charges for which he ultimately was convicted. We also believe that it is the fairer, more reasonable construction of \u00a7 53a-38 (c), and, therefore, the one that the legislature most likely intended. Accordingly, we agree with the habeas court that the petitioner is entitled to credit, under \u00a7 53a-38 (c), for the time that he was confined at Whiting, specifically, the period of time between April 20, 1990, and September 9, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The petitioner also is eligible to be considered for an award of good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) for the duration of his commitment to Whiting because any time for which credit is to be granted under \u00a7 53a-38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>(c) is treated as if that time actually had been served in connection with the sentence imposed after a retrial for the same charges. Consequently, on remand, the habeas court shall require the commissioner to determine whether the petitioner\u2019s conduct at Whiting merits an award of good time credit pursuant to \u00a7 18-7a (c).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Finally, we must decide whether the petitioner also is entitled to presentence confinement credit toward his sentence for the three days that he was incarcerated at the Newington police department after his arrest. General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (a), upon which the petitioner relies, provides in relevant part that presentence confinement credit shall be granted to any person who commits a crime on or after July 1, 1981, and who is \u201cconfined to a <em>community correctional center or a correctional institution . </em>. . under a mittimus or because such person is unable to obtain bail or is denied bail . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Newington police department is neither a community correctional center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>nor a correctional institution. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 1-1 (w).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the legislature had intended to grant credit for presentence confinement in a local or municipal jail or police department, it easily could have expressed that intent by omitting \u201ccommunity correctional center or a correctional institution\u201d from \u00a7 18-98d (a). See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 791, 772 A.2d 559 (2001). Indeed, the statutory interpretation urged by the petitioner would require us to read those words out of \u00a7 18-98d (a). We will not construe \u00a7 18-98d (a) in such a manner, at least in the absence of a compelling reason to do so, because \u201c[i]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Dept. of Consumer Protection, </em>243 Conn. 709, 718, 707 A.2d 713 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The petitioner contends that interpreting \u00a7 18-98d (a) as written would violate double jeopardy principles. In particular, he maintains that the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution, as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> requires that he be granted credit for all of the time that he was confined prior to trial, including the three days that he was incarcerated at the Newington police department. This claim is without merit. For purposes of the petitioner\u2019s claim under \u00a7 18-98d (a), principles of double jeopardy mandate only that \u201cpunishment already exacted must be fully credited in imposing sentence upon a new conviction for the same offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 718-19, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969); see also footnote 16 of this opinion. In other words, \u201cin computing the sentence imposed after conviction upon retrial, credit must be given for time served <em>under the original </em>sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 716-17. Under \u00a7 18-98d (a), a defendant is not entitled to any credit toward his original sentence for presentence confinement in a local jail or police department and that presentence confinement time does not comprise any of the \u201ctime served under the original sentence.\u201d Id., 717. Consequently, the denial of presentence confinement credit for such time upon conviction after retrial simply does not implicate the protections of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The petitioner has failed to articulate any reason to ignore the unambiguous language of \u00a7 18-98d (a) limiting credit for presentence confinement to those persons who have been confined, prior to sentencing, at a \u201ccommunity correctional center or a correctional institution . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (a). We, therefore, reject the petitioner\u2019s claim that he is entitled to presentence credit for the three days that he was confined at the Newington police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The judgment is affirmed insofar as the habeas court concluded that the petitioner is entitled to credit under \u00a7 53a-38 (c) and insofar as the habeas court concluded that the petitioner is eligible for consideration as to whether he is entitled to good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c). The judgment is reversed insofar as the habeas court concluded that the petitioner is entitled to presentence confinement credit under \u00a7 18-98d (a) and insofar as the habeas court concluded that the petitioner is entitled to good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) and the case is remanded to that court with direction to order the commissioner to determine whether, in light of the petitioner\u2019s conduct while the petitioner was confined at Whiting, he is entitled to good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) for that period of confinement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> Simply for ease of reference, we use the terms \u201cinsanity\u201d and \u201clack of capacity due to mental disease or defect\u201d interchangeably throughout this opinion.

Consequently, the parties\u2019 disagreement is limited to whether the petitioner is entitled to credit for: (1) the three days that he was confined at the Newington police department from November 10,1989, to November 13, 1989; (2) the period of time between April 20, 1990, and September 9, 1994, when he was confined at Whiting; and (3) good time for the period that he was confined at Whiting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\"> We note that there is nothing in the pertinent legislative history to suggest a contrary conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\"> In <em>Vitek </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 445 U.S. 494, the court held that the involuntary transfer of a prisoner to a mental hospital implicates a liberty interest that is protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> Of course, the state may petition the Probate Court for the involuntary civil commitment of a person with a psychiatric disability who is a danger to himself. See generally General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-497 through 17a-499. In such circumstances, the state is required to make that predicate showing by clear and convincing evidence. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-498 (c). In the case of an insanity acquittee, however, the acquittee bears the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she should be released prior to the expiration of the maximum term of commitment established pursuant to \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (X) (A). See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-582 (f), 17a-593 (f). Thus, the consequences of being subject to commitment pursuant to \u00a7 17a-582 as opposed to ordinary civil commitment are significantly more far-reaching. That difference is justified on the ground that the insanity acquittee has been found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed a criminal act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 417. Therefore, under our statutory scheme, the fact that an insanity acquittee has been found to have engaged in criminal conduct is a critical factor in regard to the determination of whether the acquittee will be released prior to the expiration of his maximum term of commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\"> We acknowledge that, as the commissioner asserts, constitutional principles of double jeopardy require that a defendant be given credit toward his sentence for any time that he already has served in connection with a vacated sentence for the same charges; see, e.g., <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 718, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 131, 440 A.2d 848 (1981); and that \u00a7 53a-38 (c) was enacted with the intention of implementing that mandate. See <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>202 Conn. 343, 348, 521 A.2d 147 (1987). We also acknowledge that those principles are inapplicable in the present case because the petitioner\u2019s first trial did not result in a conviction. We are not persuaded, however, that the legislature necessarily intended that \u00a7 53a-38 (c) would apply only to those cases in which credit is constitutionally required. Although that class of cases comprises the vast majority of cases to which \u00a7 53a-38 (c) is applicable, we do not think that that fact alone militates against applying \u00a7 53a-38 (c) in the highly unusual circumstances of the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em> </em>Insofar as the award of good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) depends upon good conduct, the awarding of such credit is discretionary with the commissioner. Thus, any decision regarding an award of good time credit necessarily must be made, in thefirst instance,bythe commissioner. Because we do not know whether the petitioner\u2019s conduct at Whiting merits an award of good time credit under any applicable rule or policy of the department of correction, we express no view as to whether the petitioner should receive such credit We conclude only that the petitioner is <em>eligible </em>for consideration by the commissioner as to whether the petit ioner\u2019s conduct at Whiting merit s an award of good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) for the duration of the petitioner\u2019s confinement at Whiting just as if he had been a sentenced prisoner who was transferred to Whiting to serve some or all of his sentence there.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We note that, insofar as the record reflects, the commissioner never has claimed that the petitioner is not entitled to good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) on the ground that his conduct at Whiting would preclude an award thereof. Nevertheless, in light of the discretionary nature of good time credit, we conclude that the commissioner should be afforded an opportunity to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to such credit under applicable rules and regulations. Therefore, to the extent that the judgment of the habeas court <em>directs </em>the commissioner to award the petitioner good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c), that portion of the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b432-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 1-1 (w) provides: \u201c \u2018Correctional institutions\u2019 means the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers; the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Enfield-Medium; the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution, Enfield; the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Niantic; the John R.
