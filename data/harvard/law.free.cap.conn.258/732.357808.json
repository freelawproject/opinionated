Casper, to discharge the mechanic\u2019s hen filed by the plaintiff against their property. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>de Toledo, </em>61 Conn. App. 156, 763 A.2d 28 (2000). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court had used the proper standard of proof in discharging the plaintiffs mechanic\u2019s lien?\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>de Toledo, </em>255 Conn. 938, 767 A.2d 1212 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
