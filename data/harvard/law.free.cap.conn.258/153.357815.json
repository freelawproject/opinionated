On January 21, 2000, the defendant was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment, execution suspended after seven years, and ten years probation for kidnapping. Additionally, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment for risk of injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to a child and five years imprisonment for criminal attempt to commit sexual assault, both to run concurrently with the sentence for kidnapping, for a total effective sentence of twenty years, execution suspended after seven years, followed by ten years of probation. On February 7, 2000, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and the case was thereafter transferred to this court. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 29, 1999, at approximately 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the fourteen year old victim and her friends, D and C, were walking on South Street in Hartford on their way home from school. The victim and C dropped D off at his house and continued along South Street. The victim saw the defendant, whom she had known for about three months, drive past them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The girls separated to begin walking toward their respective homes, and the defendant turned his car around and started back in the victim\u2019s direction. The defendant drove alongside the victim as she continued to walk home. The defendant told the victim that he needed to talk to her, and he asked her to walk over to the car. She initially refused because her grandmother was waiting for her at home. She then moved closer, and he told her to get into the car. The victim sat in the passenger seat and left the door open. The defendant reached across her, shut the door and drove off. As he drove with his left hand, the defendant held the victim\u2019s door shut with his right hand, so that she could not get out. The defendant\u2019s right arm was stretched across the victim, pinning her to the seat. The defendant began speaking harshly and graphically to the victim, telling her that he was going to \u201cfuck [her],\u201d \u201ceat [her] out,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and \u201cleave a mark on [her].\u201d The victim began yelling for the defendant to let her out of the car and started banging on the window. After driving for a few minutes, the defendant stopped the car and turned off the ignition. He turned to the victim and held the passenger door shut with his left hand. The defendant held the victim\u2019s face and tried to kiss her. She told him to stop, and he refused. The defendant began to open the victim\u2019s shirt, pull down her undershirt and unbuckle her pants. The victim began to hit and scratch the defendant. When she punched him in the stomach, he let go of the car door handle, and the victim was able to get her foot out the door. The victim got out of the car and began running down the block toward her home as the defendant drove away. Upon arriving home, the victim found her grandmother on the telephone with her aunt. The victim told her aunt over the telephone what had happened to her. Her aunt called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The defendant raises the following issues in this appeal: (1) whether \u00a7 53-21 is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to the present case; (2) whether the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the elements of risk of injury to a child; (3) whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments to the jury during his rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s closing argument were improper; and (4) whether the evidence was sufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had committed kidnapping in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF \u00a7 53-21</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The defendant first claims that \u00a7 53-21 is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to the present case. The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial, but seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), in which this court held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d We will review this claim because the record is adequate and the alleged error is of constitutional magnitude, thus satisfying the first two prongs of the <em>Golding </em>test. Id. This claim, however, fails on the merits because no constitutional violation clearly exists. We conclude that \u00a7 53-21 is not unconstitutionally vague as it applies to the present case and, therefore, that the claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The void for vagueness doctrine is a procedural due process concept that originally was derived from the guarantees of due process contained in the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> also requires that statutes with penal consequences provide sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>notice to citizens to apprise them of what conduct is prohibited. <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 98-99, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). \u201cThe constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 777, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). \u201cIf the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [mjany statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">This court previously has concluded that, \u201cthe constitutionality of \u00a7 53-21 depends upon a determination of the extent to which prior decisions of this court have supplied sufficient guidelines to save the statute from its facial invalidity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 462, 542 A.2d 686 (1982). \u201cThe apparent legislative purpose in combining the two paits [of \u00a7 53-21] in a single section was to proscribe two general types of behavior likely to injure physically or to impair the morals of a minor under sixteen years of age: (1) deliberate indifference to, acquiescence in, or the creation of situations inimical to the minor\u2019s moral or physical welfare . . . and (2) acts directly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to his moral or physical well-being.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 250, 188 A.2d 65 (1963). The language of \u00a7 53-21 does not limit the prohibited conduct to physical touching of the minor\u2019s private parts. \u201c[Wjhile a defendant who deliberately and improperly touches the private parts of a minor is clearly a hard-core violator of \u00a7 53-21, such conduct is not necessarily the only type of conduct that is proscribed under the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>50 Conn. App. 506, 513-14, 718 A.2d 979 (1998), appeal dismissed, 248 Conn. 668, 728 A.2d 1097 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The defendant claims that this case is analogous to <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 466, in which this court concluded that \u201cgrabbing the waist of a fully clothed minor while uttering a sexually suggestive remark [namely, \u2018all I want to do is feel you\u2019] is not the type of lewd conduct that \u00a7 53-21 proscribes.\u201d We further reasoned in <em>Schriver </em>that \u201cthe defendant had no reasonable opportunity to know that his conduct was prohibited by the impairment of morals clause of \u00a7 53-21.\u201d Id. In the present case, however, the language used by the defendant was significantly more graphic and vulgar. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s actions were much more inimical and injurious to the victim\u2019s moral well-being than the defendant\u2019s actions in <em>Schriver. </em>The victim testified that the defendant had pinned her to her seat with his arm as he held her door shut. Furthermore, he began to unbutton her shirt and pull down her undershirt. He also held her face and tried to kiss her, all the while holding her door shut so that she could not escape. This conduct is much more similar to the conduct of the defendant in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 514, where \u201cthe defendant grabbed the victim\u2019s arm and lay on top of her, face to face, while holding his hand over her mouth to maintain her silence during his repeated attempts to force his tongue into her mouth.\u201d The Appellate Court held that that conduct was clearly proscribed by \u00a7 53-21. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant was on sufficient notice that his conduct would be considered \u201clikely to impair\u201d the morals of the victim, and, therefore, \u00a7 53-21 is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">JURY CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the charge of risk of injury to a child, in that the trial court\u2019s instruction was overly broad and did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the victim\u2019s morals were actually impaired in order to find the defendant guilty. This claim was not preserved at trial, and the defendant again seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We conclude that the defendant has not shown that a constitutional violation clearly exists and, therefore, that this claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review for claims of instructional impropriety: \u201c[IJndividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, 253 </em>Conn. 700, 714, 756 A.2d 799 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 53-21 requires that the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that the child\u2019s morals were impaired in order to find the defendant guilty of risk of injury to a child. The trial court instructed the jury that each element of the crime had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the jury to find him guilty of risk of injury to a child. Furthermore, \u00a7 53-21 does not require a finding that the victim\u2019s morals were actually impaired. On the contraiy, \u00a7 53-21 provides that anyone \u201cwho . . . wilfully or unlawfully . . . does any act <em>likely to impair </em>the health or morals of any such child\u201d may be found guilty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Indeed, the defendant himself, in his request to charge, asked that the jury be instructed that \u201cno actual impairment of the victim\u2019s morals is necessary. The focus is on whether the act was <em>likely </em>to impair the morals of the victim.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendant further contends that the trial court\u2019s use of the phrase, \u201cshall be punished,\u201d rather than \u201cis guilty of this offense\u201d was improper. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Considering the jury instructions as a whole, we conclude that it is not reasonably likely that this minor misstatement by the trial court could have misled the jury in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Finally, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction that \u201c[t]o establish the defendant did an act likely to impair the health of a minor, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed blatant physical abuse that endangered the child\u2019s physical well-being.\u201d Section 53-21 describes the situations wherein a defendant may be found guilty of risk of injury to a child: where the defendant \u201cwilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of such child is endangered, the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child . . . .\u201d In the present case, the state\u2019s information charged the defendant with risk of injury to a child by doing an act likely to impair the morals of a child under the age of sixteen. The trial court instructed the jury accordingly.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court, however, also charged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>jury with regard to the situation where the child\u2019s physical well-being is endangered. Because the defendant was not charged under the physical endangerment section of \u00a7 53-21, this instruction was improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 537, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994) (\u201cit is improper for the trial court to read an entire statute to a jury when the pleadings or the evidence support a violation of only a portion of the statute\u201d). Although we conclude that this instruction was improper, a constitutional violation does not clearly exist within the meaning of the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 537, this court was presented with a similar situation: \u201cThe substitute information . . . stated only that the defendant had compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse \u2018by the use of force.\u2019 In its charge to the jury, however, the trial court read the entire statute, stating that the jury could convict the defendant of sexual assault in the first degree if it found that he had compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or the threat of the use of force.\u201d In <em>Chapman, </em>as in the present case, the defendant argued that the improper instruction had violated the defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional due process rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 539. This court concluded that \u201c[t]he instruction . . . charged the jury on compelled sexual intercourse by the threat of the use of force, a legally adequate theory of liability for which there was no evidence . . . [but that] [t]he jurors . . . were in a position to be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>evaluate the testimony presented and to assess whether the charged theory was supported by the evidence.\u201d Id., 540, citing <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, 502 </em>U.S. 46, 59, 112 S. Ct. 466, 116 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1991) (\u201cWhen . . . jurors have been left the option of relying upon a legally inadequate theory, there is no reason to think that their own intelligence and expertise will save them from that error. Quite the opposite is true, however, when they have been left the option of relying upon a factually inadequate theory, since jurors are well equipped to analyze the evidence . . . .\u201d [Citation omitted.]). Accordingly, we concluded that there was no constitutional violation and no prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Chapman, </em>supra, 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Similarly, in the present case, the state did not present evidence to show that the defendant had committed blatant physical abuse to harm the victim\u2019s physical well-being. On the contrary, the state presented evidence that the defendant\u2019s actions were likely to impair the victim\u2019s morals. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s overinclusive jury charge denied the defendant his due process rights. See id. (\u201ca factual insufficiency regarding one statutory basis, which is accompanied by a general verdict of guilty that also covers another, factually supported basis, is not a federal due process violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The defendant also claims that his right to a fair trial was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s improper arguments to the jury. The defendant asserts that the prosecutor: (1) vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses; (2) suggested that the jury draw inferences from facts not in evidence; and (3) made inappropriate comments about missing witnesses and the defendant\u2019s inability to present a defense. The defendant did not preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>these claims at trial, but again seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, or under Practice Book \u00a7 60-5,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides for plain error review. We conclude that the challenged comments did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial, and, therefore, that this claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">This court previously has held that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 393, 572 A.2d 944 (1990). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987), this court concluded that, in evaluating a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, we must determine \u201cwhether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Factors to consider in this analysis include: (1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the misconduct; (3) the frequency of the misconduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case; (5) the strength of the curative measures adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case. Id., 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Because we find most of the challenged comments to have been either appropriate or invited by the defendant,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and because any improper remarks, taken as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>whole, were not sufficiently prevalent to have established a pattern of misconduct, we conclude that they did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 393 (\u201c[although certain remarks made by the prosecutor, from hindsight, may be deemed imprudent, such isolated and brief episodes as occurred here fail to implicate the denial of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Vouching for the Credibility of Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor, in his rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s closing argument, improperly vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The state argues that statements made during its rebut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>tal to the defendant\u2019s closing statements were in response to the defendant\u2019s attack on the credibility of the victim and C.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In light of the defendant\u2019s relatively lengthy attack on the witnesses\u2019 credibility based on inconsistencies in their stories, it was appropriate for the state to present the jury with an alternative to the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the witnesses must be lying. Furthermore, it was within proper bounds for the state to remind the jury of the witnesses\u2019 young ages and the fact that the incident occurred months earlier, as well as to suggest to the jury that the fact that the witnesses apparently had not rehearsed their stories together could be perceived to enhance their credibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>64 Conn. App. 80, 93, 778 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1249 (2001) (prosecutor may properly comment on credibility of witness where comment reflects reasonable inferences from evidence adduced at trial). In no way did these comments infringe upon the jury\u2019s fact-finding function. Furthermore, the state may properly argue that the witnesses had no apparent motive to lie. See <em>State </em>v. Hicks, 56 Conn. App. 384, 394, 743 A.2d 640 (2000) (holding that prosecutor\u2019s argument that witness had no motive to lie not improper).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We agree with the defendant that it was improper for the state to make the comment, with regard to the alleged telephone calls made by the victim to the defendant after the incident, that \u201cI\u2019ll say I don\u2019t believe [they] happened.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 336, 562 A.2d 493 (1989) (\u201c[w]hile the prosecutor is permitted to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom, he is not permitted to vouch personally for the truth or veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses\u201d). This single impropriety, however, was not sufficiently egregious to infect the whole trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983) (\u201c[t]he fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Facts Not in Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The defendant next argues that the state improperly referred to facts not in evidence during rebuttal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comment that it is possible to hold a car\u2019s passenger door shut with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>one hand while driving with the other was improper. The state argues that these comments merely addressed the investigation underlying the case and the type and amount of evidence presented to the jury, in response to what it perceived as assertions by the defendant that \u201cthe Hartford police did not perform the investigation the way defense counsel thinks it should have been performed\u201d and \u201c[the victim] didn\u2019t behave the way defense counsel thinks a rape victim should behave . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The defendant, having initially suggested to the jury that the defendant could not physically have held the passenger door closed while driving, cannot now complain because the state challenged that assertion. Furthermore, in response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the limited nature of any physical contact was inconsistent with an intent to assault sexually, the state was within its bounds in arguing that the evidence it presented, although limited, was sufficient to convict the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>defendant.

The accused, by his failure to testify, cannot insulate himself from general comment on the weakness of his case, even though his failure so to testify may be perceived by the jury as having contributed to the general weakness about which comment is made.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In this case, the state made no explicit mention of the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the trial court instructed the jury about the defendant\u2019s right not to testify, and the state did not comment on the failure of the defendant to present impeachment witnesses.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 224, 733 A.2d 156 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">To find the defendant guilty of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a), it was necessary for the jury to find all of the following elements to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant had abducted someone; and (2) had restrained that person with the intent to inflict physical injury upon him or abuse him sexually.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 defines the critical terms of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) and provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) \u2018Restrain\u2019 means to restrict a person\u2019s movements intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty by moving him from one place to another, or by confining him either in the place where the restriction commences or in aplace to which he has been moved, without consent. As used herein \u2018without consent\u2019 means, but is not limited to, (A) deception and (B) any means whatever, including acquiescence of the victim, if he is a child less than sixteen years old or an incompetent person and the parent, guardian or other person or institution having lawful control or custody of him has not acquiesced in the movement or confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u201c(2) \u2018Abduct\u2019 means to restrain a person with intent to prevent his liberation by either (A) secreting or holding him in a place where he is not likely to be found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>or (B) using or threatening to use physical force or intimidation. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We conclude that the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to find the defendant guilty of kidnapping in the first degree. The victim testified that the defendant had held her door shut with his right arm, thereby pinning her to her seat as he drove away. Additionally, she testified that he had ignored her screams to stop the car and let her out. Thus, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant had used both physical force and intimidation to interfere with the victim\u2019s liberty and confine her to the car. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 170, 377 A.2d 263 (1977) (no time or distance requirement to constitute asportation in finding sufficient evidence of kidnapping). The jury also could have found sufficient evidence in the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had abducted and restrained her. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>61 Conn. App. 496, 518, 765 A.2d 14, cert. granted, 256 Conn. 910, 911, 772 A.2d 1124, 1125 (2001) (evidence sufficient to support kidnapping conviction where defendant lured victim into wooded area by deception and proceeded to assault her sexually, and placed his hand over her mouth, threatening that if she screamed, he would kill her); <em>State </em>v. <em>Faria, </em>47 Conn. App. 159, 187-88, 703 A.2d 1149 (1997), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 965, 707 A.2d 1266 (1998) (sufficient evidence to support kidnapping conviction where victim tried two or three times to reach for car door but defendant forcibly held her back by her hair, when victim got her feet out door, defendant grabbed her by her hair and shirt in apparent attempt to restrain her, and victim pushed and pulled \u201cwith everything [she] had and was able to break free as her shirt ripped in the defendant\u2019s hand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The victim\u2019s testimony also reasonably could have provided the jury with sufficient evidence of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>dant\u2019s intent to abuse her sexually. It is difficult to prove intent because \u201cdirect evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 239-40, 745 A.2d 800 (2000). In the present case, however, the jury reasonably could have inferred from the substance of the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had intended to abuse the victim sexually. The victim stated that the defendant grabbed her face and tried to kiss her, hurting her face in the process. Furthermore, the victim testified that while the defendant was holding her in the car against her will, he stated that he wanted \u201cto fuck [her],\u201d \u201ceat [her] out,\u201d and \u201cleave [his] mark on [her].\u201d We conclude that the jury reasonably could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that this evidence reflected the defendant\u2019s intent to restrain the victim in order to abuse her sexually. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L.

That\u2019s a pretty big distance. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201c[A]ccording to [the victim], if we\u2019re to accept her testimony, she and [C] pretty much\u2014and [the defendant]\u2014have the south end of Hartford, at least this neighborhood, to themselves. . . . Hmm. [C] points out that, sure, I saw students. There were kids around, like we would normally expect hanging around a large school on a Friday afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201c[W]e have here on State\u2019s Exhibit 1 an \u2018x\u2019 on approximately the halfway point of the South Street School property where [the victim] says she saw and stopped and was finally convinced by [the defendant] to cross the street and go to his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cWell, that\u2019s not at all what [C] told us. [C] told us that they both approached the comer, that they both turned to their right and saw [the defendant], according to [C], about a minute or two later. . . . And she sat in this witness stand and told us that she saw [the victim] get into the car as close as the back row of the spectator seating in this courtroom; that she was that close off the comer, as presumably [the victim] walked diagonally to the car. . . . And she could clearly hear what [the defendant] was saying, that, come on, I need to talk to you. Get in the car, please. . . . Completely different version of facts by these two critical fact witnesses. We saw him come back, [C] says, never saw him turn. I\u2019m walking south, [the victim] says, I\u2019m walking home. I\u2019ve turned to the left. I\u2019m walking home. The next thing I see is this guy\u2019s right along side me up here in the middle of the road, following me slowly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">\u201cCreeping along as she would walk, imploring her, come, get in my car. Didn\u2019t happen, according to [C]. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\u201cTheir story just doesn\u2019t match up. . . . [TJheir stories are that divergent? Their recollection is that off the beam?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\"> During closing arguments, defense counsel argued: \u201cHow would [the defendant] physically close [the passenger door without] coming onto [the victim\u2019s] side of the car, reach across and close that door? Suddenly, without warning, by the element of surprise, to lock her in the car?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u201cWe heard [the defendant\u2019s] dad testify that it was seventy-four inches. Well, I don\u2019t know. I suppose it was his dad. You know how wide a car door opens, and you know that you cannot physically reach across and close the door from the inside without moving at least into the passenger\u2019s seat or getting out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u201cYou just don\u2019t do that, ladies and gentlemen. It doesn\u2019t stack up. It doesn\u2019t make sense.

Bingo. I\u2019m going to fondle her. I\u2019m going to grab her breast. Wouldn\u2019t he?

Now, she gets out of the car. She grabs her backpack, and of course, we have her testimony, \u2018I walked home.\u2019 But did she run to any one of the houses that surround the crime scene on George Street? No. She made the long trek with the perpetrator still in his car.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 provides: \u201c(a) Any person on trial for crime shall be a competent witness, and at his or her option may testify or refuse to testify upon such trial.
