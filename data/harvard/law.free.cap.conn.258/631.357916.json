J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHY\">The defendant appeals from ajudgment of conviction, rendered after a jury verdict of guilty, of the crimes of murder, felony murder, robbery in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, and kidnapping in the first degree. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to grant a defense witness immunity from prosecution, and that the trial court improperly found that that defense witness properly had invoked his fifth amendment right to remain silent. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At about 2 a.m. on November 26, 1995, the defendant, Rasheen Giraud, observed the victim, Corey Gamble, pull up in a car to use the telephone at a telephone booth at a Hartford gas station. The defendant approached the victim, asking for a ride to Charter Oak Terrace. Subsequently, the defendant called his companion, Cleve Ward, over to the telephone booth and told Ward that they had a ride. The defendant and Ward entered the car, the defendant in the front passenger seat and Ward in the backseat on the passenger side. The defendant then directed the victim to the boarded-up Rice Heights housing complex. There, the defendant pulled out a gun, put it to the victim\u2019s head and ordered him out of the car. The defendant took the victim to the back of the car and ordered him to remove his clothes. After the victim had removed his clothes, the defendant ordered him to a grassy area and forced him to his knees. The defendant then fired two gunshots at the victim, killing him. The defendant gathered the victim\u2019s clothing and placed it in the backseat of the car. Then the defendant drove the car from Rice Heights to Edwards Street, where he lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Later in the morning of November 26, 1995, Hartford police officers were directed to the parking lot at the rear of a building where they discovered the body of the victim, who was wearing only socks. Thereafter, the police interviewed the victim\u2019s mother, who told the police that in the early morning hours of November 26, she had asked her son to move a car that she had rented, a blue 1995 Pontiac Grand Am, from the front of her apartment building. She told police that this was the last time she had seen the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The police then began searching for the car that the victim\u2019s mother had rented. At approximately 9:58 p.m. on November 27, 1995, Hartford police observed the car at a gas station in Hartford. The police pulled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>car over a short time later. The defendant was driving the car and was wearing boots and a leather coat that had belonged to the victim. In the pocket of the coat was the victim\u2019s electronic organizer. The police then obtained a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment, and there recovered more of the victim\u2019s belongings: a pair of pants, a black leather belt that went with the coat and a set of keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The defendant was charged with murder, felony murder, robbery in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, robbery involving an occupied motor vehicle and kidnapping in the first degree. After a jury trial, in June, 1998, the defendant was found guilty on all counts. The trial court, Barry, J., sua sponte, vacated the verdict with respect to the charge of robbery involving an occupied motor vehicle and rendered judgment of guilty on the remaining charges, sentencing the defendant to eighty-five years imprisonment, ten of which are nonsuspendable and nonreduceable. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to grant a defense witness immunity from prosecution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">At the trial, the defendant called Dennis Connolly as a defense witness. Before Connolly was sworn, the defendant moved that the state be compelled to grant Connolly immunity \u201crelative to the testimony of Mr. Connolly with the exception [of] any perjury committed by him . . . .\u201d The request did not distinguish between perjury committed before Connolly was granted immunity and perjury committed by him when testifying after such a grant of immunity. Immunity, of course, may not be \u201c \u2018a license to lie\u2019 \u201d while giving immunized testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>mony. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Apfelbaum, </em>445 U.S. 115, 124, 100 S. Ct. 948, 63 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In order to consider this claim, we examine the record before the trial court. The defendant told the court that Connolly had testified at the probable cause hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a state\u2019s witness and had been given immunity by the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant contended that, because \u201cnothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ha[d] changed,\u201d the state should be required to grant Connolly \u201cthe same immunity\u201d as a witness for the defense as it had granted to him as a witness for the state. Defense counsel stated he did not \u201chave any case law to present,\u201d was \u201cnot sure if even any case law exists,\u201d but because of the circumstances the same immunity should be granted at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The state responded that Connolly had been given immunity at the probable cause hearing for making a false statement, a class A misdemeanor as to which the statute of limitations had, at the time of the trial, expired.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not dispute this claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court thereupon denied the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The defendant now argues in this court that we should empower trial courts to compel the state to grant immunity to defense witnesses in certain circumstances. The defendant acknowledges that no such rule now exists in Connecticut. <em>State </em>v. <em>McIver, </em>201 Conn. 559, 566-67, 518 A.2d 1368 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>172 Conn. 542, 561, 375 A.2d 1014, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 855, 98 S. Ct. 174, 54 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 211, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>33 Conn. App. 521, 526-27, 636 A.2d 872, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 901, 640 A.2d 118 (1994). The defendant argues, however, that this court should adopt a rule similar to that adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>684 F.2d 1066 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1174, 103 S. Ct. 823, 74 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1983). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 115 (2d Cir. 1999). We recently recognized that some courts, such as the Second Circuit in <em>Bums, </em>have held that under certain circumstances the federal constitution might require the immunization of a defense witness. We previously declined, however, to decide the merits of the theories of those cases in the absence of circumstances that would give rise to their application. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>257 Conn. 248, 254-55, 777 A.2d 627 (2001). We do so again in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The defendant did not bring <em>Bums </em>to the attention of the trial court, nor did he set forth before the trial court any circumstances required to invoke <em>Bums. </em>Under <em>Bums, </em>\u201c[t]o sustain a requirement that use immunity be granted, a court must find that: (1) the government has engaged in discriminatory use of immunity to gain a tactical advantage or, through its own overreaching, has forced the witness to invoke the Fifth Amendment; and (2) the witness\u2019 testimony will be material, exculpatory and not cumulative and [3] is not obtainable from any other source.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 684 F.2d 1077. The requirements <em>of Bums </em>present a very difficult burden for a defendant to meet. \u201c[Although our test for requiring the government to grant use immunity has been in place for at least eight years, we have yet to be presented with a case in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the defendant gets over the first hurdle, let alone succeeds entirely.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bahadar, </em>954 F.2d 821, 826 (2d Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The defendant\u2019s perfunctory statement that \u201cnothing ha[d] changed\u201d did not meet the <em>Bums </em>requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant did not establish any discriminatory use of immunity by the state. Connolly\u2019s \u201cinvocation of the fifth amendment was not the result of a discriminatory use of immunity by the [state], nor of any other prosecutorial overreaching. In fact, it seemed to be solely the result of [the witness\u2019] own willingness to change his story.\u201d Id. We conclude, therefore, again in the words of the Second Circuit, that the defendant \u201ccannot vault the first hurdle of the <em>Bums . . </em>. test . . . .\u201d Id. Accordingly, we decline, as we did in <em>Holmes, </em>to consider the claim for defense witness immunity in the absence of the circumstances that might give rise to such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Moreover, the defendant asked that the trial court accord Connolly \u201cthe same immunity\u201d as a defense witness that he had received as a state\u2019s witness. The immunity provided at the probable cause hearing was for making a false statement, an offense for which the statute of limitations barred prosecution at the time of trial. It therefore would have been meaningless to grant the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly found that Connolly\u2019s invocation of his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination was valid. The defendant contends that there was no possibility that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Connolly\u2019s answers could have subjected him to prosecution and that the immunity granted at the probable cause hearing continued at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We again review the record before the trial court. After the trial court denied the request for immunity, the defendant called Connolly to the witness stand. Accompanied by his own counsel, Connolly invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant objected, claiming that Connolly\u2019s \u201conly exposure . . . would be as to false statements.\u201d He argued that the charge was a misdemeanor and that the statute of limitations had ran regarding false statement and, therefore, that \u201cexposure would be nonexistent . . . .\u201d Defense counsel then stated that it was \u201cnot clear\u201d to him what Connolly\u2019s \u201cexposure or what his potential incrimination might be . . . .\u201d When the court remarked that it did not \u201cunderstand that from you or our previous discussions,\u201d defense counsel replied that if Connolly\u2019s \u201cconcern is perjury then I guess there would be exposure there . . . .\u201d Defense counsel then reminded the court that his request for immunity did not \u201cencompass perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The state responded that the prior grant of immunity at the probable cause hearing was \u201climited to false statement\u201d and that Connolly was still exposed to perjury charges for his prior testimony at the probable cause hearing. The state argued that Connolly was exposed as to his testimony at the probable cause hearing and potential perjury if he testified falsely at the trial. The state pointed out that the statute of limitations as to perjury arising from testimony at the 1996 probable cause hearing had not run. The defendant did not reply to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The court then upheld Connolly\u2019s invocation of the right against self-incrimination. Immediately thereafter, by agreement, the defendant and the state introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Connolly\u2019s police statement and the transcript of his testimony at the probable cause hearing. Those exhibits were contradictory as to whether Connolly had seen the defendant with the victim early on the morning of the killing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The standard for determining whether to permit invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination is well established. To reject the invocation it must \u201cbe <em>perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have [a] tendency to incriminate\u201d the witness. (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>200 Conn. 310, 319, 511 A.2d 1000 (1986), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra, 170 Conn. 209. The right to the privilege \u201cdoes not depend upon the likelihood of prosecution but upon the possibility of prosecution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The trial court was told that Connolly had received immunity from prosecution for making a false statement to the police when called as a state\u2019s witness at the probable cause hearing. The state\u2019s attorney argued at the trial that, although the statute of limitations would bar prosecution for making an earlier false statement, Connolly\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing still could subject him to prosecution for perjury. Defense counsel had conceded that Connolly could face exposure to a perjury prosecution. From this, the court could have inferred that Connolly was now being called to testify as to his prior testimony at the probable cause hearing. It was apparent on the record, therefore, that Connolly faced the possibility of perjury charges arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>out of his probable cause hearing testimony and that his trial testimony might incriminate him. Connolly would have been \u201cwell within his rights to refuse to testify at the . . . trial, given the real danger that truthful answers would reveal that he committed perjury\u201d at the probable cause hearing. <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeSalvo, </em>26 F.3d 1216, 1222 (2d Cir. 1994), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Housand, </em>550 F.2d 818, 823 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Here the trial court was faced with the defendant\u2019s objection to the invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination because there could be no incrimination. At the same time, however, the defendant conceded that there could be incrimination for perjury. In light of this concession, the trial court properly found Connolly\u2019s invocation of the privilege valid. It is well established law that we will not review trial actions induced by the party challenging the ruling on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>252 Conn. 714, 728-29, 751 A.2d 372 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The defendant also argues that Connolly\u2019s probable cause hearing immunity continued at the trial. The defendant did not make this argument before the trial court and did not give the trial court any facts supporting such a claim. Accordingly, the claim was not properly preserved. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Moreover, the record is clear that immunity was granted at the probable cause hearing only as to Connolly\u2019s December 8, 1995 sworn statement to the police and concerned the crime of making a false statement to the police. Both the trial judge and the state made it clear at the probable cause hearing that the immunity offered to Connolly did not and could not apply if Connolly perjured himself at the hearing. The state\u2019s attorney stated at the probable cause hearing: \u201c[Connolly\u2019s attorney] has represented to me [that] his client\u2019s concern [is] that he would not testify unless given the opportunity to be free from prosecution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>any, what he perceives as, errors in the statement. I have no objection to granting that. I did indicate to [Connolly\u2019s attorney], however, that there would be no immunity, obviously, from any perjury . . . .\u201d The probable cause hearing. . judge stated, \u201c[t]he record should note [that] the immunity, obviously, does not extend to perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly found that Connolly validly invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be held to answer for any crime, punishable by death or life imprisonment, unless upon probable cause shown at a hearing in accordance with procedures prescribed by law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person charged by the state . . . shall be put to plea or held to trial for any crime punishable by death or life imprisonment unless the court at a preliminary hearing determines there is probable cause to believe that the offense charged has been committed and that the accused person has committed it. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a provides: \u201c(a) Whenever in the judgment of the Chief State\u2019s Attorney, a state\u2019s attorney or the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney, the testimony of any witness or the production of books, papers or other evidence of any witness (1) in any criminal proceeding involving narcotics, arson, bribery, gambling, election law violations, felonious crimes of violence, any violation which is an offense under the provisions of title 22a, corruption in the executive, legislative or judicial branch of state government or in the government of any political subdivision of the state, fraud by a vendor of goods or services in the medical assistance program under Title XIX of the Social Security Act amendments of 1965, as amended, any violation of chapter 949c, or any other class A, B or C felony or unclassified felony punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of five years for which the Chief State\u2019s Attorney or state\u2019s attorney demonstrates that he has no other means of obtaining sufficient information as to whether a crime has been committed or the identity of the person or persons who may have committed a crime, before a court or grand jury of this state or (2) in any investigation conducted by an investigatory grand jury as provided in sections 54-471) to 54-47g, inclusive, is necessary to the public interest, the Chief State\u2019s Attorney, the state\u2019s attorney, or the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney, may, with notice to the witness, after the witness has claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, malee application to the court for an order directing the witness to testify or produce evidence subject to the provisions of this section.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201c(b) Upon the issuance of the order such witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, papers or other evidence in such case or proceeding on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>No such witness may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify or produce evidence, and no testimony or evidence so compelled, and no evidence discovered as a result of or otherwise derived from testimony or evidence so compelled, may be used as evidence against him in any proceeding, except that no witness shall be immune from prosecution for perjury or contempt committed while giving such testimony or producing such evidence.
