The plaintiff, Alex Martinez, a former Connecticut state trooper, was prosecuted for a criminal offense arising out of an incident allegedly committed during the course of his duties. He was acquitted of all charges and sought indemnification pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, the department of public safety, division of state police, the plaintiffs employer, refused to indemnify him. As a result, the plaintiff brought this action in the Superior Court, claiming his statutory right to indemnification. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs action, claiming that the state is protected from suit by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the Superior Court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>court, <em>Rush, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The following facts are undisputed. On or about March 18, 1998, while the plaintiff was on duty as a state trooper, he was involved in an incident with a motorist and subsequently was charged with violating General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-83a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 53a-192.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4At a jury trial, the prosecution alleged that the plaintiff threatened a disabled female motorist with a ticket unless she consented to have sex with him. The plaintiff was acquitted of all charges. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CR98-139129 (November 23, 1999). Thereafter, the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 53-39a, requested indemnification from the defendant for the legal expenses and costs he necessarily had incurred in his defense. The defendant denied the plaintiffs request. The plaintiff then filed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The defendant argues that the state is protected from both suit and liability by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. \u201cIt is well established law that the state is immune from suit unless it consents to be sued by appropriate legislation waiving sovereign immunity in certain prescribed cases. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290 (1972); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 262-63, 196 A.2d 596 (1963).\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 227, 464 A.2d 45 (1983). The plaintiff claims that under \u00a7 53-39a, this case presents one of the \u201ccertain prescribed cases\u201d for which the state has waived its sovereign immunity for purposes of indemnification. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The trial court interpreted \u00a7 53-39a \u201cas a waiver of sovereign immunity not only as to liability, but as to suit as well.\u201d Accordingly, the court properly concluded that it did have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The applicable standard of review is well established. \u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 489, 642 A.2d 699 (1994). \u201cA determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>246 Conn. 652, 660, 717 A.2d 706 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\u201cThe question whether the principles of governmental immunity from suit and liability are waived is a matter for legislative, not judicial, determination. . . . The state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued may be waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>by the legislature, provided clear intention to that effect is disclosed by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 228. \u201cTo determine the legislative intent expressed in a statute, we look to its wording and to its history and basic policy as disclosed by preexisting legislation and the circumstances which brought about its enactment.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, to determine whether the state has waived its immunity from suit and liability, we first turn to the relevant statutory language itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\u201cSection 53-39a, which was originally enacted in 1973; see Public Acts 1973, No. 73-627; authorizes indemnification for economic loss, including legal fees, incurred by officers of . . . police departments who are prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed by them in the course of their duties when the charges against them are dismissed or they are found not guilty. See, e.g., <em>Link v. Shelton, </em>186 Conn. 623, 627, 443 A.2d 902 (1982). The general purpose of the statute is to permit police officers to recoup the necessary expenses that they have incurred in defending themselves against unwarranted criminal charges arising out of their conduct in the course of their employment. Id., 628-29.\u201d <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>240 Conn. 590, 598, 692 A.2d 1255 (1997). Section 53-39a explicitly provides that \u201c[w]henever, in any prosecution of an officer of the [division of [s]tate [pjolice within the [department of [p]ublic [s]afety ... for a crime allegedly committed by such officer in the course of his duty as such, the charge is dismissed or the officer found not guilty, such officer shall be indemnified by his employing governmental unit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>economic loss sustained by him as a result of such prosecution . . . .\u201d Applying the plain language of the statute to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff falls within the rubric of \u201csuch officer\u201d who <em>11 shall </em>be indemnified\u201d by the defendant, \u201chis employing governmental unit . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cAs we have often stated, [d]efinitive words, such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 507, 555 A.2d 986 (1989) .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 623, 755 A.2d 180 (2000).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 270-71, 777 A.2d 645 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 284-85. Here, \u00a7 53-39a imposes the substantive duty upon the state employing unit to indemnify a state employee who fulfills the statutory requirements. The use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d therefore, relates to the essence of the statute itself and necessarily imposes a mandatory directive upon the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 53-39a unambiguously provides for the indemnification of state troopers in these particular factual circumstances. Thus, the state clearly has waived immunity from liability. It is now necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>determine whether the state also has waived liability from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The defendant argues that \u00a7 53-39a does not waive or abrogate the state\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit and that the defendant\u2019s claim is completely within the jurisdiction of the claims commissioner, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-165.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *The claims commissioner is granted discretionary duties by statute. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-158, the claims commissioner has sole discretion to pay or reject any claim under $7500.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For any claim in excess of that amount, the claims commissioner \u201cshall make his recommendations to the General Assembly for the payment or rejection of [such claim].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-159.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The General Assembly, as the final arbiter, is then free to accept, reject or alter any recommendation from the claims commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The defendant, however, by arguing that \u00a7 4-165 establishes the claims commissioner\u2019s exclusive juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>diction over the present case, reads \u00a7 4-165 in isolation. Chapter 53 of the General Statutes, of which \u00a7 4-165 is a part, establishes the general process by which an individual may bring claims against the state. Section 4-165 specifically provides in part that \u201c[a]ny person having a complaint for such damage or injury shall present it as a claim against the state <em>under the provisions of this chapter. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The chapter\u2019s provisions include General Statutes \u00a7 4-142, which carves out the exceptions to the jurisdiction of the claims commissioner: \u201cThere shall be a Claims Commissioner who shall hear and determine all claims against the state <em>except . . . </em>claims upon which suit otherwise is authorized by law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 4-142 (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we already have established, \u00a7 53-39a authorizes the liability of the state for the indemnification of a state trooper from his or her governmental employing unit. It falls, therefore, within the exception to \u00a7 4-165 carved out by \u00a7 4-142. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s reading of \u00a7 4-165 would frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 53-39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Where, as here, the legislature expressly has established an obligation on the part of the state to its employee, the state is liable to that employee for the fulfillment of that obligation and, therefore, has waived the state\u2019s immunity as to suit in order to achieve that end. We considered the converse of this situation in an earlier case. In <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 284, 130 A.2d 293 (1957), the General Assembly had passed legislation authorizing the plaintiff to sue the state for damages caused by an accident in a state facility. The state argued that the special act waived only the state\u2019s immunity from suit, not from liability. Id. We disagreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>concluding that an act allowing suit but prohibiting liability would be useless. Id., 287. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that courts must presume that legislatures do not intend to enact useless legislation. ... It would be utterly useless and meaningless to permit a suit which could not end otherwise than in a judgment for the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. A statute must be read as imbued with purpose and with the means necessary to achieve that purpose. \u201c[A] statute conferring a privilege or a right carries with it by implication everything necessary to ensure the realization of that privilege or to establish that right in order to make it effectual and complete.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Norwalk Aluminum Foundry Corp., </em>155 Conn. 397, 405, 233 A.2d 1 (1967). Here, the language of \u00a7 53-39a is explicit and its directive is mandatory. If the state were not liable to be sued, the plaintiffs only means of recourse for indemnification would be through the claims commission. As we have determined, the discretion afforded the claims commissioner to deny or accept the plaintiffs claim for indemnification, however, is at odds with both the mandatory indemnification established by \u00a7 53-39a and the exception carved out by \u00a7 4-142.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, in keeping with our interpretation of the statutory scheme at issue here, we conclude that the legislature implicitly has provided for the waiver of the state\u2019s immunity to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The defendant also points out that this court previously has held that \u00a7 53-39a distinguishes and abro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>gates governmental as opposed to sovereign immunity. This observation, though accurate, is inapposite. It is true that the earlier cases we have considered involved factual scenarios concerning individuals employed by municipalities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 598 (\u201c[\u00a7] 53-39a . . . authorizes indemnification for economic loss, including legal fees, incurred by officers of <em>local </em>police departments who are prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed by them in the course of their duties when the charges against them are dismissed or they are found not guilty\u201d [citation omitted; emphasis added]); <em>Rawling </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>206 Conn. 100, 104-105, 537 A.2d 439 (1988) (\u201c[\u00a7 53-39a] affords a police officer a right of indemnity . . . [and is a statute] that abrogate [s] or modifies] <em>governmental </em>immunity\u201d [citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Link </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 627 (\u201c\u00a7 53-39a authorizes indemnification for legal fees incurred by an officer of a <em>local </em>police department as a result of prosecution for a crime allegedly committed by him in the course of his duty where he is found not guilty of the crime charged\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Although our prior case law has only considered circumstances involving the indemnification of municipal employees, this fact does not affect our conclusion regarding this case.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The explicit language of \u00a7 53-39a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>specifically includes, in its first sentence, \u201can officer of the [division of the [s]tate [p]olice\u201d in the class of employees entitled to indemnification from the governmental employing unit when the statutory requirements are satisfied. In this case, the employing unit is the department of public safety, division of state police.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The defendant finally argues that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision improperly construes \u00a7 53-39a to confer upon state troopers an automatic right to indemnification if they are merely found not guilty of criminal charges. The defendant correctly points out that the second prong of the statutory prerequisite for indemnification is that the alleged crime must have been committed in the course of the state trooper\u2019s duty. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s reading misconstrues the trial court\u2019s memorandum. The trial court clearly asserted the two requirements necessary for indemnification, quoting our decision in <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 598. \u201c \u2018The general purpose of [\u00a7 53-39a] is to permit police officers to recoup the necessary expenses that they have incurred in defending themselves against unwarranted criminal charges arising out of their conduct in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>their employment.\u2019 . . . <em>Given this analysis, </em>the court concludes that the statute is mandatory, and that a right to indemnification is automatic upon a finding of not guilty.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Before us is the appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claim for indemnification. We conclude that the trial court properly concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction of the plaintiffs claim and that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss properly was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a provides: \u201cWhenever, in any prosecution of an officer of the Division of State Police within the Department of Public Safety, or a member of the Office of State Capitol Police or any person appointed under section 29-18 as a special policeman for the State Capitol building and grounds, the Legislative Office Building and parking garage and related structures and facilities, and other areas under the supervision and control of the Joint Committee on Legislative Management, or a local police department for a crime allegedly committed by such officer in the course of his duty as such, the charge is dismissed or the officer found not guilty, such officer shall be indemnified by his employing governmental unit for economic loss sustained by him as a result of such prosecution, including the payment, of any legal fees necessarily incurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-83a (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of patronizing a prostitute from a motor vehicle when he, while occupying a motor vehicle: (1) Pursuant to a prior understanding, pays a fee to another person as compensation for such person or a third person having engaged in sexual conduct with him; or (2) pays or agrees to pay a fee to another person pursuant to an understanding that in return therefor such person or a third person will engage in sexual conduct with him; or (3) solicits or requests another person to engage in sexual conduct with him in return for a fee; or (4) engages in sexual conduct for which a fee was paid or agreed to be paid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-192 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of coercion when he compels or induces another person to engage in conduct which such other person has alegal right to abstain from engaging in, or to abstain from engaging in conduct in which such other person has a legal right to engage, by means of instilling in such other person a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the actor or another will . . .

See footnote 7 of this opinion. We conclude that this remedial scheme is inconsistent with the legislative intent expressed by \u00a7\u00a7 4-142 and 53-39a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\"> In <em>Cislo, </em>the plaintiff was a police officer employed by the city of Shelton, as was the plaintiff in <em>Link. </em>In <em>Rawling </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>206 Conn. 100, 537 A.2d 439 (1988), the plaintiff was a New Haven police officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> We note that the past usage of the terms \u201csovereign\u201d and \u201cgovernmental\u201d immunity has been, at times, somewhat inconsistent and, consequently, confusing. See, e.g., <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 228 (where liability of state commissioner of mental retardation was considered, court stated \u201c[t]he question whether the principles of governmental immunity from suit and liability are waived is a matter for legislative, not judicial, determination\u201d). In <em>Duguay, </em>the term \u201cgovernmental\u201d is used interchangeably with \u201csovereign.\u201d See also <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990) (\u201cThe state and its municipalities enjoy governmental immunity, in certain circumstances, from liability for their tortious acts. . . .

Elsewhere in our jurisprudence, the distinction between the two terms is clear. See, e.g., <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 593, 479 A.2d 793 (1984) (\u201c[t]he state legislature possesses the authority to abrogate any governmental immunity that the common law gives to municipalities\u201d); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 151 Conn. 264 (\u201cA suit against a municipality is not a suit against a sovereign. Towns have no sovereign immunity, and are capable of suing and being sued ... in any action. . . . Municipalities do, in certain circumstances, have a governmental immunity from liability.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). We note that the use of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d has always referred to the sovereignty of the state; \u201cgovernmental immunity,\u201d however, has been used both in its limited form to refer only to the immunity enjoyed by municipalities \u2014 and thereby distinguished from the immunity of the state \u2014 and as synonymous with or encompassing \u201csovereign\u201d or state immunity. None of these usages alters our analysis in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
