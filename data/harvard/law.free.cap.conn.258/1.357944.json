App. 771, 785, 758 A.2d 400 (2000). The state also claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to provide the jury with the requested instruction, if improper, was harmless. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant was not entitled to an instruction regarding the doctrine of nonexclusive possession and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">The opinion of the Appellate Court contains the following facts that a jury reasonably could have found. \u201cOn January 26, 1999, Officer Andrew Lawrence of the Hartford police department was driving in his patrol car when he observed the defendant drive through a stop sign. Lawrence activated his lights and siren, called for backup and pursued the defendant. The defendant pulled into a driveway, got out of the car and knocked on the door or rang the doorbell of a [private] home. Soon thereafter, the defendant walked away from the house and proceeded down the street, leaving the car in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u201cLawrence did not follow the defendant. Instead, while monitoring the defendant as he was walking away, Lawrence approached the vehicle and looked through the car window. Inside, he saw a .38 caliber semiautomatic pistol on the driver\u2019s seat. Once backup officers arrived, Lawrence pursued the defendant while the car was secured by the other officers. Lawrence caught up with the defendant, who had since rounded a street corner, and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cThe state filed a two count information alleging that the defendant used a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119b (a) (l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the defendant was in criminal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1). On May 25, 1999, the defendant filed a motion to suppress all items seized by the police.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s signed oral decision on the motion to suppress focused on the issue of whether the \u2018viewing of a weapon in plain view of the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle [constituted] probable cause to arrest the operator of said vehicle for the crime of weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 29-38<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> . . . .\u2019 The court denied the motion on July 16, 1999.\u201d Id., 773. A jury trial commenced on July 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u201cAt the end of the state\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts. The trial court granted the motion as to the first count of using a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission, but denied the motion as to the second count of criminal possession of a firearm.\u201d Id., 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Thereafter, the defendant presented evidence \u201cto dispute the issue that the weapon found in the car was in his exclusive possession.* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of his arrest, the defendant [allegedly had been seen by Lawrence] driving a rental car owned by National Car Rental. Tammy Dinatale, a representative of National Car Rental, testified that at the time the weapon was found in the car, the vehicle was rented to another individual, [Kirk] Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u201cThe defense also presented Madeline Williams, the defendant\u2019s sister, as a witness. Williams testified [that at] approximately 9 a.m. on the morning of the defendant\u2019s arrest, Williams drove herself and the defendant out to breakfast in her own car. Afterwards, the defendant asked Williams to bring him to a friend\u2019s house, Scott, to get a compact disc [that he previously had loaned to Scott].\u201d Id., 783-84. According to Williams, she and \u201cthe defendant drove to Scott\u2019s house, and Williams accompanied the defendant to Scott\u2019s residence. Scott handed the defendant a key to the rental car. Williams and the defendant then proceeded to the rental car to retrieve the compact disc from the vehicle. At that point, before Williams and the defendant reached the vehicle, the officer approached the defendant and arrested him.\u201d Id., 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u201cOn July 20, 1999, the defendant filed a request to charge the jury on the theory of nonexclusive possession, which was denied the following day by the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The jury returned a guilty verdict on July 21, 1999.\u201d Id., 774. The defendant then filed a postverdict motion for judgment of acquittal. Id. The trial court denied that motion and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict sentencing the defendant to five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had: (1) denied his motion to suppress; (2) denied his motion for judgment of acquittal; and (3) refused to instruct the jury concerning the defense of nonexclusive possession. Id., 772. The Appellate Court held that the trial court properly had denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and his motion for judgment of acquittal. Id., 776, 778. The Appellate Court concluded, however, that the trial court improperly had refused to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s theory of nonexclusive possession. Id., 778. According to the Appellate Court, the testimony of Williams \u201ccontradicted the sequence of events offered by the state and raised the issue of the defense of nonexclusive possession.\u201d Id., 784. The Appellate Court, therefore, reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. Id., 785. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: \u201c(1) Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction regarding the doctrine of nonexclusive possession? (2) If the answer to ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tion one is \u2018yes,\u2019 was the error harmless?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>254 Conn. 952, 762 A.2d 906 (2000). We conclude that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction regarding the doctrine of nonexclusive possession and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The state contends that a jury instruction regarding the doctrine of nonexclusive possession was not warranted because there was no evidence produced at trial to support the claim that the defendant and at least one other individual shared joint access to the weapon. The defendant, however, insists that the Appellate Court properly determined that he was entitled to the requested instruction because there was evidence presented that, if believed, would support a finding that he did not have exclusive possession of the vehicle in which the weapon was found. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u201cWhere the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the [illegal item is] found, it may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the [illegal item] and had control of [it], unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>257 F.2d 121, 128 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 866, 79 S. Ct. 98, 3 L. Ed. 2d 99, reh. denied, 358 U.S. 901, 79 S. Ct. 221, 3 L. Ed. 2d 150 (1958) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 277, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 225, 733 A.2d 156 (1999) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 633, 490 A.2d 75 (1985) (same). The doctrine of nonexclusive possession \u201cwas designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to prevent a jury from inferring a defendant\u2019s possession of [an illegal item] solely from the defendant\u2019s nonexclusive possession of the premises where the [illegal item was] found.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>220 Conn. 628, 636 n.11, 600 A.2d 780 (1991). When the doctrine applies, an instruction focuses the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent to possess, precluding it from inferring possession from the mere fact that the defendant, along with others, occupied or had access to the premises wherein the contraband was found. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKissick, </em>204 F.3d 1282, 1291 (10th Cir. 2000) (proof of nonexclusive constructive possession alone insufficient to justify implication of knowledge; state must present some corroborating evidence of knowledge); <em>Chicone </em>v. <em>State, </em>684 So. 2d 736, 740 (Fla. 1996) (same); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 516, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986) (\u201c[t]he essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead it is the act of being in a position of control coupled with the requisite mental element\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, a defendant is entitled to have instructions on a defense for which there is evidence produced at trial to justify the instruction, no matter how weak or incredible the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Varszegi, </em>236 Conn. 266, 282, 673 A.2d 90 (1996); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 597, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990) (\u201c \u2018[i]f the defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction\u2019 \u201d). As a specific matter, in deciding whether the trial court improperly failed to provide the jury instruction on nonexclusive possession of the premises, as requested by the defendant, \u201cwe must adopt the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 428, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>599 A.2d 1065 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. Lewis, 245 Conn. 779, 810, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>234 Conn. 381, 389, 661 A.2d 1037 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 628, is illustrative of these principles and presents a similar scenario to the present case. In <em>Nesmith, </em>the defendant had been charged with possession of narcotics in conjunction with his arrest in a vacant apartment known by police to harbor drug users. Id., 629-30. At the time of his arrest, from six to eleven people had occupied the front room of the abandoned apartment. Id., 630. Upon seeing the police enter, the defendant attempted to move toward an unoccupied room in the rear of the apartment. Id. An officer pursued the defendant into the empty room and witnessed him drop something to the floor. Id. After restraining the defendant and ordering him to return to the front room where other officers had detained the other occupants of the apartment, the officer investigated the back room further and found a number of envelopes and plastic vials containing narcotics on the floor. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The defendant\u2019s testimony at trial directly contradicted the state\u2019s version of the facts. According to the defendant, he was waiting for a friend in the hallway outside the apartment when a police officer grabbed him and brought him inside the apartment. Id., 630-31. The defendant claimed that he was then directed to sit on the floor with approximately eleven other detainees. Id., 631. While sitting with the other detainees, the defendant explained, he had observed the man next to him drop the narcotics. Id. The defendant, therefore, requested a jury charge on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession. Id., 633. The trial court refused to provide such a charge and the defendant was convicted. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In affirming the judgment of conviction, the Appellate Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he common factor in cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>have applied [the doctrine of nonexclusive possession] is the fact that the narcotic substances were accessible to others and were found in areas that were also occupied by others.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>24 Conn. App. 158, 161, 586 A.2d 628 (1991). The Appellate Court noted, however, that the defendant had been charged only with possession of the narcotics found in the back room. Because no evidence was adduced at trial to demonstrate that any other person had been present in the back room, the situation was not one involving nonexclusivity. Id., 161-62. Thus, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court properly refused to give the requested charge. Id., 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We affirmed the Appellate Court, explaining that the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant \u201cestablished possession of the narcotics without requiring that the jury draw an inference based solely on the defendant\u2019s presence on the premises.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 633-34. We acknowledged that two conflicting stories had been presented through the evidence, each of which identified a different individual as the person discarding the drugs. Id., 635-36. The jury, as fact finder, was entitled to believe the story that it found credible. We concluded that \u201cthere was no risk that the jury would infer the defendant\u2019s possession of the drugs from the mere fact that he was in nonexclusive possession of the premises because the evidence established that either the defendant or another detainee identified by the defendant discarded the drugs.\u201d Id., 636 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">In the present case, we are faced with two mutually exclusive accounts of the facts, neither of which require a charge regarding nonexclusive possession. We review these conflicting accounts seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The defendant presented evidence that he and his sister drove to Scott\u2019s residence, in a vehicle other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the rental car that Lawrence allegedly had seen the defendant driving, in order to retrieve a compact disc. Once arriving at Scott\u2019s residence, the defendant borrowed Scott\u2019s key and proceeded to the rental car. It was at that point, before the defendant had ever reached the rental car, that he was arrested. This version of the facts, taken in the light most favorable to the defendant, supports a conclusion that the defendant was never in the vehicle in which the weapon was recovered. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim should not be categorized as one of nonexclusive possession, but more appropriately as one of no possession at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The doctrine of nonexclusive possession provides that \u201cwhere there exists access by two or more people to the [contraband] in question, there must be something more than the mere fact that [contraband was] found to support the inference that the [contraband was] in the possession or control of the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 161. Thus, the charge is appropriate in circumstances where the defendant has possession of the premises along with at least one other individual. The defendant\u2019s version of the facts, however, calls for neither a conclusion of joint nor exclusive access to the vehicle, but rather one of no access. The nonexclusive possession doctrine is typically implicated where the defendant admits that he had access to the premises, but denies that he had possession of the illegal item. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 262 (defendant was sole occupant of vehicle that contained cocaine hidden in rear of car, but denied knowledge of its presence); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 634 (defendant present in apartment where marijuana found, but denied ownership). Under the defendant\u2019s theory, however, he never had access to the premises. The nonexclusive posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sion doctrine, therefore, is inapplicable to the defendant\u2019s version of the facts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Even if we adopt the state\u2019s version of the facts as those most favorable to the defendant, as the defendant appears to argue, a nonexclusive possession charge was not required. The state presented evidence that Lawrence observed the defendant exit the vehicle, he peered through the car window, and he saw a weapon located on the driver\u2019s seat. In doing so, the state conceded that the defendant was not in physical possession of the firearm at the time of his arrest and acknowledged that, in order to establish possession of the firearm for a conviction under \u00a7 53a-217 by constructive possession, it was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had exercised intentional dominion and control over the firearm and that he had knowledge of its character. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 516 (concluding with respect to constructive possession that \u201ccontrol must be exercised intentionally and with knowledge of the character of the controlled object\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>If the defendant had driven the vehicle and the weapon was located on the driver\u2019s seat, as alleged by the state, then either the defendant was sitting on the weapon while driving or he placed the weapon on the driver\u2019s seat as he exited the vehicle. Either act demonstrates that the defendant had dominion and control over the weapon with knowledge of its character, thereby establishing possession. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2). This court previously has explained that \u201c [t]he essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead it is the act of being in a position of control coupled with the requisite mental intent. In our criminal statutes involving possession, this control must be exercised intentionally and with knowledge of the character of the controlled object.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 516.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, if believed, the state\u2019s evidence supports a conclusion that the defendant exhibited the requisite control and knowledge of the weapon necessary to establish possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The defendant contends that the state\u2019s evidence, coupled with the fact that Scott rented the vehicle and lived nearby, warranted a nonexclusive possession charge. lie relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 258, for support of this proposition. In <em>Delossantos, </em>the defendant, who was the sole occupant of a borrowed vehicle, was pulled over by the police for traveling in excess of the posted speed limit. Id., 261. As a result of the stop and subsequent search of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>vehicle, a bag containing cocaine was discovered hidden underneath a leather cover in the hatchback area of the vehicle. Id., 262. The defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to sell. Id., 260. He testified at trial that he was unaware of the presence of cocaine in the vehicle. Id., 262. The jury found the defendant guilty and he appealed, claiming that the court erred with respect to its jury instructions on constructive possession. Id., 276. This court concluded that the trial court properly instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018[i]f the defendant was not in exclusive possession of the car where the narcotics were found at the time he was apprehended, it may not be inferred that the defendant knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control over them unless there are other incriminating statements, evidence or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u2019 \u201d Id., 277. Thus, the jury was not permitted to infer, without some evidence, that the defendant knew that cocaine was <em>hidden </em>in the rear of the car. The defendant\u2019s attempt to liken the present case to the situation in <em>Delossantos </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Unlike <em>Delossantos, </em>the item in question in the present case was not secreted, but rather was in plain view.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the state\u2019s version of the facts, the defendant either sat on the weapon or placed it on the driver\u2019s seat as he exited the vehicle. Based on the evidence, <em>no one else </em>had access to the vehicle between the time that Lawrence had witnessed the defendant driving, and the officer\u2019s discovery of the firearm.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cThe evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>thus established possession of the [weapon] without requiring that the jury draw an inference based solely on the defendant\u2019s presence [in the vehicle].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 634. Moreover, it would have been improper under these circumstances for the court to have instructed the jury on nonexclusive possession because the evidence would not have supported a finding that there was joint or simultaneous access to a weapon that the defendant either sat upon or held. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Diggs, </em>219 Conn. 295, 299, 592 A.2d 949 (1991) (\u201c[t]he court . . . has a duty not to submit to the jury, in its charge, any issue upon which the evidence would not reasonably support a finding\u201d). Accordingly, there was no need for a nonexclusive possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The cumulative evidence offered in this case reasonably could support two mutually exclusive versions of what transpired prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest. Either the defendant was never in the vehicle, or he was in it and, because of the weapon\u2019s location on the driver\u2019s seat, was in sole possession of the weapon. The jury, as fact finder, was entitled to accept the version of the facts that it found credible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Neither version, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>evidences the defendant\u2019s nonexclusive possession of the weapon. \u201c[A] defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 597. We conclude that no such foundation was established and, therefore, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s request to charge the jury on nonexclusive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C.

Although the majority recognizes that it must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, it examines that evidence in a light that would support an acquittal, rather than simply in a manner that would gauge whether the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, a defendant is entitled to have instructions on a defense for which there is evidence produced at trial to justify the instruction, no matter how weak or incredible the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Varszegi, </em>236 Conn. 266, 282, 673 A.2d 90 (1996); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 597, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990) (\u201c[i]f the defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Specifically, in deciding whether the trial court improperly failed to provide the jury instruction on nonexclusive possession of the premises, as requested by the defendant, \u201cwe must adopt the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 428, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, 245 </em>Conn. 779, 810, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>234 Conn. 381, 388, 661 A.2d 1037 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The state claims that \u201cthe evidence presented by the defendant did not permit a finding that [he] and Kirk Scott [the lessee of the vehicle] jointly had or previously had access to the car [and the firearm, but, rather] . . . the defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that, although he briefly possessed the key to [the] car, he could not have placed the gun on the front seat because Scott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>had sole access to the vehicle.\u201d On the basis of this view of the evidence, the state contends, and the majority agrees, that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion in this case conflicts with the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>24 Conn. App. 158, 586 A.2d 628, aff'd, 220 Conn. 628, 600 A.2d 780 (1991) (affirming conviction for possession of narcotics where trial court refused to charge jury on nonexclusive possession), and this court\u2019s affirmance thereof. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">At trial in <em>Nesmith,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant argued that another detainee in the apartment in which the defendant had been arrested had dropped the narcotics at issue therein and he requested a jury charge on the doctrine of nonexclusive possession, which the trial court refused to provide. Id. In affirming the judgment of conviction, the Appellate Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he common factor in cases that have applied [the doctrine of nonexclusive possession] is the fact that the narcotic substances were accessible to others and were found in areas that were also occupied by others.\u201d Id., 161. The Appellate Court concluded that, because the defendant had been charged with possession of the narcotics found in the back room of the apartment, which he alone had occupied, the evidence did not implicate sufficiently the doctrine of nonexclusive possession to warrant a jury instruction thereon. Id., 161-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">This court affirmed the Appellate Court, concluding that the evidence presented by the defendant \u201cestablished possession of the narcotics without requiring that the jury draw an inference based solely on the defendant\u2019s presence on the premises.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>220 Conn. 628, 634, 600 A.2d 780 (1991). \u201c[T]he conflicting stories [presented by] the defendant and the state\u2019s witnesses both identified a specific person in possession of the drugs: the defendant, [whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>police officer] observed discarding an object later retrieved and identified as narcotics, or another detainee, who, according to the defendant, [had discarded] several glassine envelopes on the floor next to the defendant.\u201d Id., 636. In <em>Nesmith, </em>\u201cthere was no risk that the jury would infer the defendant\u2019s possession of the drugs from the mere fact that he was in nonexclusive possession of the premises because the evidence established that either the defendant or another detainee identified by the defendant [had] discarded the drugs.\u201d Id., 636 n.ll. Thus, this court concluded that the defendant had not been entitled to a jury instruction on nonexclusive possession. Id., 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In the present case, the defendant presented evidence at trial that he had received the key to the car from Scott, but that he had not yet entered the vehicle at the time of his arrest. Tammy Dinatale, a representative from National Car Rental (National), testified that National owned the vehicle, and that during the time that the vehicle had been leased to Scott, he had notified National that the vehicle had been stolen. Dinatale testified further that Scott had called back one and one-half hours later to say that the car had not been stolen, but that he simply had loaned it to a friend. Thus, the evidence presented to the jury established that, not only Scott, but potentially others, had access to the vehicle wherein the firearm was found. During the closing argument, defense counsel argued to the jury that \u201cit could have been somebody else\u2019s gun [someone other than] Kirk Scott, maybe a friend of his. . . . Who\u2019s to say how many people were in and out of [the] car?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In <em>Nesmith, </em>an instruction on nonexclusive possession was not warranted because the evidence presented to the jury established that it was either the defendant who had possessed the narcotics or another identified detainee in the immediate vicinity. There was no danger that the jury would have inferred possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>contraband based solely on the fact that the defendant, along with others, had occupied the vacant apartment wherein the officers had discovered the contraband. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 635. In this case, the evidence showed either that: (1) the defendant had exclusive possession of the car immediately before his arrest, which would have permitted the jury to infer that the defendant constructively possessed the firearm therein; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 203 (2d Cir. 2001) (\u201c[d]ominion, control, and knowledge may be inferred [from] a defendant\u2019s exclusive possession of the premises\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); or (2) the defendant, through possession of the key to the vehicle rented by Scott, who at one point had reported it stolen, had nonexclusive possession of the vehicle, which would have precluded an inference of possession of the firearm in the absence of other evidence linking the defendant to the weapon to support such an inference. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 633; <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 277, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">It bears emphasizing that the issue in this case is not whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt the required elements necessary for a conviction. As the majority noted in its opinion, the \u201cevidence supports a conclusion that the defendant exhibited the requisite control and knowledge of the weapon to establish possession.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, the issue is whether there was any evidence presented at trial, \u201cno matter how weak or incredible,\u201d that would have justified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>requested jury instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Varszegi, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 282. In my opinion, because the majority loses sight of the fact that the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant that would support a requested jury instruction, it concludes that the defendant\u2019s possession of the key to the vehicle is irrelevant, as it was \u201centirely consistent with his theory of defense . . . .\u201d See footnote 9 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Additionally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis concerning the issue of the defendant\u2019s access to the vehicle. The majority asserts that \u201c[t]he nonexclusive possession doctrine is typically implicated where the defendant admits that he had access to the premises\u201d and it maintains that \u201c[u]nder the defendant\u2019s theory [of the case] ... he never had access to the premises.\u201d In this regard, the majority equates the defendant\u2019s ability to access the vehicle through possession of the key with <em>actually having accessed </em>the vehicle prior to his arrest. Although I agree that the defendant argued that he had not yet accessed the vehicle, the question whether he actually had done so, to me, is not dispositive of whether he is entitled to a jury charge on nonexclusive possession. This is particularly true where, as here, the state concedes that it prosecuted the defendant on a theory of constructive possession of the firearm and the trial court charged the jury accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In this case, possession of the key to the vehicle linked the defendant to the firearm contained therein. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>186 Conn. 437, 445, 441 A.2d 857 (1982); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chisolm, </em>165 Conn. 83, 85, 328 A.2d 677 (1973) (insufficient evidence for conviction of possession of narcotics where \u201cthe only evidence of the defendant\u2019s culpability was that he had a key which unlocked a padlock to a bin in the cellar of a multiple dwelling which he owned but in which he did not live and the additional fact that narcotics were found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>bin\u201d). The defendant\u2019s ability to access and exercise control over the firearm through possession of the key to the unoccupied vehicle was but one factor comprising constructive possession. See <em>State </em>v. Hill, supra, 201 Conn. 516. \u201cThe essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead it is the act of <em>being in a position of control </em>coupled with the requisite mental intent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. (refusing to construe phrase \u201cto exercise dominion or control\u201d as referring only to situation where individual <em>has exercised </em>control). Indeed, as the majority aptly recognizes, a jury instruction on nonexclusive possession focuses the jury\u2019s attention on the other aspects of constructive possession\u2014knowledge and intent to exercise control. Therefore, because the defendant, by possessing the key to the vehicle, had the ability to access and control the firearm, I would conclude that he was entitled to the requested instruction on nonexclusive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The state also contends that in order for the doctrine to apply, there must be evidence that the defendant and others not only had access to the location where the firearm was found, but that they jointly occupied that location. In this case, however, at the time that the police discovered the firearm in the vehicle and arrested the defendant some distance from the scene, <em>no one </em>occupied the vehicle. As noted previously, the state concedes that it prosecuted the defendant based solely on his constructive possession of the firearm because, although the state alleged that the officer had witnessed the defendant driving the vehicle, the officer never actually saw the defendant with the firearm. In essence, the state\u2019s theory at trial was that the defendant had been in exclusive possession of the vehicle immediately preceding his arrest. The state contends that, because no one else had access to the vehicle between the time that the officer allegedly had witnessed the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>driving, and the officer\u2019s discovery of the firearm, the defendant constructively possessed the firearm. The defendant, however, claimed that he merely had possessed the key to the car and that others had access to the vehicle. Given these conflicting versions of the events, and particularly because no one occupied the vehicle at the time that the officer discovered the firearm and apprehended the defendant, I would conclude that it was for the jury to determine whether the defendant had been in exclusive or nonexclusive possession of the vehicle. See <em>State v.Delossantos, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 276-77 (characterizing trial court\u2019s instruction on nonexclusive possession as \u201ccorrect\u201d where defendant was sole occupant of vehicle owned by another individual and narcotics found hidden in hatchback of car; inference of possession of narcotics permissible if jury determined that defendant had exclusive possession of vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Because the defendant possessed the key to the unoccupied vehicle, which was owned by a corporation and leased to yet another individual, and he was apprehended some distance from the firearm, the jury should have been instructed to determine whether the defendant was in exclusive or nonexclusive possession of the vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the absence of an instruction requiring it to consider the character of the defendant\u2019s possession of the vehicle, the jury potentially was permitted to draw improper inferences concerning the defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm. In this case, if the jury con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>eluded that, contrary to the state\u2019s theory, the defendant had <em>not </em>possessed the vehicle exclusively just prior to his arrest, the requested instruction would have ensured that any conviction under \u00a7 53a-217 was predicated upon more than \u201cthe defendant\u2019s nonexclusive possession of the premises where the [firearm was] found\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nesmith, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 636 n.11; and would have required the jury to consider \u201cother incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress [the] inference\u201d of possession of the firearm. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 633. Accordingly, I would conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the defendant was entitled to an instruction on nonexclusive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Although the majority never reaches the second certified issue in this case; see footnote 8 of the majority opinion; I would conclude that omitting the requested instruction on nonexclusive possession alleviated the state\u2019s burden of proof on the element of possession and that the trial court\u2019s failure to so instruct the jury cannot withstand harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u201cAn improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>256 Conn. 193, 198-99, 770 A.2d 491 (2001); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 512, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S.

The state also claims that, because the defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that he had not entered the car and had no knowledge of the gun, the trial court\u2019s instruction defining possession as intentional and knowing dominion and control required the jury to find that the defendant knew of the presence and character of the firearm in order to convict him under \u00a7 53a-217. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Although the trial court\u2019s jury charge was a correct statement of the law regarding constructive possession; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 515; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kas, </em>171 Conn. 127, 130-31, 368 A.2d 196 (1976); I am not convinced that the failure to provide further guidance to the jury, as the defendant requested, with respect to the defendant\u2019s claimed nonexclusive possession of the vehicle and constructive possession of the firearm, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence at trial concerning the defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm was neither uncontested nor overwhelming. See <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 17 (\u201cwhere a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that [an] omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error, the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless\u201d). Indeed, because the defendant stipulated to the fact that he had been convicted of a felony in the past, possession of the firearm and its operability were the only disputed issues at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">It is important to remember that no one occupied the vehicle at the time that the gun was discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>therein. Under the state\u2019s theory, the jury was required to infer the defendant\u2019s constructive possession of the firearm from his possession of the vehicle. A critical question for the jury to decide, therefore, was whether the defendant had been in exclusive possession of the vehicle immediately preceding his arrest, as the state had claimed, or whether he simply possessed the key and was not in exclusive possession. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 277-78 (noting that \u201c \u2018[o]ne who owns or exercises dominion or control over a motor vehicle in which [contraband] is concealed may be deemed to possess the contraband\u2019 jury properly instructed that it may infer possession of contraband if defendant in exclusive possession of vehicle). If the jury determined that the defendant had not been in exclusive possession of the vehicle, then an inference that he had possessed the firearm would have been impermissible unless there were \u201cother incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 225, 733 A.2d 156 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 633, 490 A.2d 75 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The issue of whether the defendant had been in nonexclusive possession of the vehicle, and hence of the firearm, turned largely on the credibility of the witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 682, 701 A.2d 1 (1997) (credibility of witnesses for jury to determine). The inferences that the jury properly could have drawn from its determination of that issue, however, are circumscribed by law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>supra, 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Although the evidence here suggested<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the defendant was attempting to retrieve a personal item from the vehicle, there was no other evidence concerning the location of that item to the firearm. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>128 N.H. 81, 86, 512 A.2d 1084 (1986) (noting that evidence of personal possessions of defendant standing in close proximity to contraband may provide sufficiently close nexus between defendant and contraband to allow jury to infer possession). Virtually no other incriminating statements or circumstances were presented in this case that would have buttressed an inference that the defendant constructively possessed the firearm. The entire case hinged on the surmise that the defendant possessed the firearm by possessing the car, and the characterization of the defendant\u2019s possession of the vehicle, as exclusive or nonexclusive, was crucial with respect to the proper inferences that the jury could have drawn concerning possession of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Without a proper instruction guiding the jury to make the proper inferences concerning possession of the firearm, separate from its determination of whether the defendant had possessed the vehicle exclusively or non-exclusively, I cannot conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury was <em>precluded </em>from drawing an improper inference concerning the defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm. That is, in the absence of an instruction directing the jury that, if it determined that the defendant was not in exclusive possession of the vehicle, it could not draw an inference that the defendant possessed the firearm unless there were other statements or circumstances supporting the conclusion that he possessed the gun, I cannot conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury was not misled. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>trial court\u2019s instruction in this case was not sufficient to guide the jury in determining the issue of possession of the firearm and, accordingly, the failure to instruct the jury as the defendant requested was not harmless. <em>State </em>v. Anderson, supra, 255 Conn. 444 (harmless error doctrine \u201cessential to preserve the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> Specifically, the defendant requested that the trial court instruct the jury that \u201c[w]here the defendant is not [in] exclusive possession of the [vehicle wherein] the firearm was found, you may not infer that he knew of its presence and that he had control of it, unless he made some incriminating statement, or unless there are [some] other circumstances [that] tend to support such an inference.\u201d The trial court denied that request and indicated that \u201cwhat I am going to charge [the jury] ... is that possession means intentional dominion and control over the firearm accompanied by knowledge of its character.
