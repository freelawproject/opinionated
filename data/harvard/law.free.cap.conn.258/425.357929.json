J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7h\">The central issue in this appeal is whether a sentencing court has subject matter jurisdiction to impose conditions of probation that remain in effect after the expiration of the probation. The defendant, Arthur Welwood, was charged with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-70<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> three counts of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-73a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two counts of risk of injury to or impairing the morals of a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in connection with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>series of incidents that took place between 1988 and 1990. The alleged victims of the crimes were the defendant\u2019s two stepdaughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On July 12, 1991, the defendant entered into a plea agreement with the state and pleaded guilty to two counts of risk of injury to a child, and the state agreed to nolle the remaining charges. On September 18, 1991, the defendant was sentenced to ten years incarceration, execution suspended, and five years of probation with specific conditions. Pursuant to the conditions of probation, the defendant was to: (1) have no written, oral or physical contact with the minor victims, until they reached the age of twenty-one, unless, after a full hearing, a criminal judge ordered contact for therapeutic purposes only; (2) pay $7000 toward the past therapy bills of his natural daughter; (3) pay unreimbursed expenses for his natural daughter to an annual maximum of $2500 for a period of five years; (4) have no written, oral or physical contact with his natural daughter during probation unless she requested contact; (5) pay all unreimbursed medical and psychological expenses of the two victims until they reached the age of eighteen years; (6) obtain treatment through special services and abide by its conditions; (7) not reside at the family home, even if the two victims were not present there; (8) have no unsupervised contact with any other minor child under the age of sixteen years; (9) raise the issue of his alleged sexual abuse of his natural daughter during his treatment; and (10) enter into a written agreement concerning contact with the victims and payment of fees for their psychological care. The trial court noted that any violation of the defendant\u2019s treatment contract would be grounds for termination of treatment and referral back to the probation department. In accordance with the last condition of probation, the defendant signed an agreement that provided in relevant part: \u201c1.1 will have no contact of any kind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>direct or indirect with the two natural children of my current wife . . . who now are twelve years of age and eight years of age, until each of them reaches her twenty-first birthday . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Between October, 1996, and June, 1997, certain witnesses saw the defendant with one or both of his stepdaughters, neither of whom had yet reached age twenty-one. The witnesses gave statements to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. In June, 1997, one year after the defendant\u2019s period of probation had expired without incident, the state filed a motion for contempt proceedings to enforce the plea agreement incorporated in the judgment. The trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>granted the motion on September 13, 1997, stating: \u201cThis court finds that the plea agreement was knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the defendant. Further, said agreement was incorporated into the court\u2019s judgment and sentence and is enforceable beyond the term of probation. Hence, criminal contempt proceedings may be initiated against [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>defendant].\u201d The state then filed an information alleging thirteen counts of criminal contempt by the defendant in violation of what were then \u00a7\u00a7 7G (4)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 7M of the Practice Book.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Damiani then signed a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Following his arrest, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over postprobation conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>concluded that the sentencing court had issued two distinct orders: (1) that the defendant refrain from contacting the victims until they reached age twenty-one; and (2) that the defendant enter into a written agreement with the state that he have no such contact. The trial court further determined that, \u201c[i]n the absence of a contract or some agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>by the defendant, it is clear that the court had no power to enter a judgment imposing restrictions on the defendant\u2019s activities after the expiration of his probation,\u201d where the period of probation to which the defendant had been sentenced was the statutory maximum. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7\u00a7 53a-29<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 53a-30.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>trial court also concluded that the defendant could not agree to waive objections to the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>166 Conn. 620, 627, 353 A.2d 764 (1974) (jurisdiction \u201cis a matter of law and can neither be waived nor conferred by consent of the accused\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On September 13, 1999, the state appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state claims that for a variety of reasons, the trial court improperly dismissed the contempt proceedings. First, the state claims that the defendant was barred from challenging, in the contempt proceeding, the propriety of the original judgment, because the trial court had both personal jurisdiction over the defendant and subject matter jurisdiction over the criminal case, the no contact order was not \u201ctransparently invalid,\u201d and the defendant did not appeal the original sentence. Second, the state claims that the substantial interest in the finality of judgments militates against a collateral attack on the judgment nearly six years after it was rendered, notwithstanding the fact that the attack was premised on jurisdictional grounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Third, the state contends that principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude relitigation of the validity of both the original judgment of conviction and the state\u2019s postjudgment request for a criminal contempt referral, neither of which the defendant appealed. Fourth, the state maintains that the trial court has the power to render and enforce postprobation terms of plea agreements because: (1) Connecticut courts favor plea agreements that are negotiated fairly and are not against public policy; (2) Connecticut courts have determined that both parties to a plea agreement are entitled to the enforcement of its terms and that the authority to enforce such agreements lies with the judiciary; (3) such power flows from the court\u2019s constitutional and statutory jurisdiction; and (4) parties to plea agreements who, like the defendant, have reaped substantial benefits under the agreements should be estopped from attacking those agreements. Fifth, the state claims that the doctrine of separation of powers is not implicated here because: (1) the enforcement of a plea agreement is not \u201cpunishment\u201d beyond that authorized by the legislature; (2) postprobationary terms of a plea agreement do not constitute an extension of probation beyond that authorized by the legislature; and (3) once a plea agreement has been incorporated into a court judgment, the court has the inherent power to enforce its decree by way of a criminal contempt action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>court exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing probationary conditions that continued beyond the maximum period of probation. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the criminal contempt action against the defendant for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. . . . A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting grant of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>64 Conn. App. 134, 137, 779 A.2d 817 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The defendant seeks to attack collaterally two of the conditions of probation imposed by the sentencing court, namely, that the defendant have no contact with the victims until they reach age twenty-one, and that the defendant enter into a written agreement with the state to that effect. The legislature, by statute, has limited the term of probation that the sentencing court may impose to five years.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The sentencing court recognized that its jurisdiction over the defendant, and, therefore, its ability to enforce the conditions of probation, ended after the five year period of probation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>rather than rely on the no-contact condition of probation, which it would be unable to enforce once probation had ended, the sentencing court also required that the defendant enter into the written agreement with the state, which the state could seek to enforce after the term of probation, and the court\u2019s jurisdiction, had ended. We agree with the trial court that the sentencing court had no jurisdiction to impose the condition or to require the defendant to enter into such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In reaching its decision, the trial court relied on <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>177 Conn. 47, 411 A.2d 25 (1979). In that case, the relevant statute authorized court-ordered support for minor children, i.e., children under eighteen years of age. Id., 49. The parties had entered into an agreement, however, wherein one of the parties agreed to pay support until the child turned twenty-one. Id., 48. After the child turned eighteen, that party ceased paying support. Id., 49. This court held that \u201cparties to an agreement relating to support and education of children cannot impose jurisdiction on the court beyond that granted by the statutes.\u201d Id., 52. Furthermore, we concluded that \u201cany order beyond [the age of majority] is of no force and effect as a court order.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The trial court also relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>37 Conn. App. 72, 654 A.2d 1246, appeal dismissed, 235 Conn. 469, 667 A.2d 797 (1995). In that case, the defendant was found to have violated his probation. At sentencing for that violation, the sentencing court imposed a term of probation that, combined with the period of proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tion that the defendant already had served under the original sentence, exceeded the statutory limit. Id., 83-84. The Appellate Court concluded that the sentence violated General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Relying on <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Yurch, </em>the trial court in the present case concluded that, \u201cthe state\u2019s use of the 1991 judgment as the basis of the present contempt proceeding is not available because the court never had the power under the applicable statutes to order what the parties\u2019 agreement provided; namely, that the defendant would continue to avoid contact with the children after the expiration of his probation.\u201d It also concluded that \u201c[a]ny such order would have the effect, in essence, of extending the term of probation\u201d authorized by statute. We agree with the reasoning of the trial court. Because the sentencing court had no jurisdiction to impose conditions beyond the maximum term of five year s of probation, those conditions were void ab initio. See <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>53 Conn. App. 282, 293, 730 A.2d 1184 (1999) (judgment that exceeds jurisdiction is void ab initio and is subject to collateral attack).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, had no subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the state\u2019s motion for a criminal contempt proceeding based on the violation of those conditions after the expiration of the five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We note that, if the sentencing court\u2019s jurisdiction were not limited in this way, then criminal defendants seeking to enter into a plea bargain could agree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>greater restrictions on their liberty than the legislature authorized, in order to avoid going to trial. The state\u2019s bargaining position could eclipse that of defendants, resulting in excessive periods of probation being imposed on defendants desperate to avoid the possibility of incarceration resulting from a trial and judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Furthermore, we reject the state\u2019s alternative claim that, by signing the agreement, the defendant waived any objection to subject matter jurisdiction. A criminal defendant may not waive the statutory limits on the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in a plea agreement. See <em>State </em>v. Vincent, 194 Conn. 198, 203 n.7, 479 A.2d 237 (1984) (\u201cno party can waive a defect in the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 166 Conn. 627 (jurisdiction \u201cis a matter of law and can neither be waived nor conferred by consent of the accused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Finally, we note that whether the state may enforce the agreement in a civil contract action, rather than in a contempt proceeding, is not at issue in the present case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 314, 699 A.2d 921 (1997) (plea bargains governed by contract principles). Accordingly, we need not decide whether the contract is enforceable, or what an appropriate remedy for breach of the agreement might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-73a provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the fourth degree when: (1) Such person intentionally subjects another person to sexual contact who is (A) under fifteen years of age, or (B) mentally defective or mentally incapacitated to the extent that he is unable to consent to such sexual contact, or (C) physically helpless, or (D) less than eighteen years old and the actor is such person\u2019s guardian or otherwise responsible for the general supervision of such person\u2019s welfare, or (E) in custody of law or detained in a hospital or other institution and the actor has supervisory or disciplinary authority over such other person; or (2) such person subjects another person to sexual contact without such other person\u2019s consent, or (3) such person engages in sexual contact with an animal or dead body.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\u201c(b) Sexual assault in the fourth degree is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\"> The terms of the no contact agreement also contained certain limited exceptions: \u201c2.

The trial court rejected these claims. Last, the defendant. claimed that the statute violated the principle of separation of powers.
