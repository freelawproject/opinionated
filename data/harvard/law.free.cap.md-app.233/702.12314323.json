Eyler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">This case presents the question whether four consecutive 25-year sentences imposed against a juvenile for nonhomicide crimes constitute cruel and unusual punishment, categorically. More specifically, it causes us to consider whether the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010), that it is a categorical violation of the Eighth Amendment for a juvenile nonhomicide offender to be sentenced to life without parole (\u201cLWOP\u201d), extends to these multiple-victim, multiple-crime term-of-years sentences. We hold that <em>Graham </em>does not extend to the sentences in this case and they are not otherwise cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">On Tuesday, May 4, 2004, Matthew Timothy McCullough, the appellant, and Martise Williams, both students at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Randallstown High School, in Baltimore County, got into an argument when Williams called the appellant a \u201cbitch.\u201d Over the next several days, the controversy escalated. Efforts by school officials to \u201ccalm the waters\u201d by meeting with the students and their parents proved fruitless. School officials told appellant not to be on school grounds on Friday, May 7, 2004. He came to the school that day anyway and during the course of a school basketball game let it be known that he and three companions were looking for a fight. School officials ordered them off the grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Later that afternoon, when the basketball game was letting out, the appellant returned with his three companions. The appellant was 17\u00bd years old, but his companions were older and were not students. The four walked together \u201ctowards the school where a group of kids were hanging out on the sidewalk.\u201d <em>McCullough v. State, </em>No. 2812, Sept. Term. 2004, slip op. at 2 (filed Nov. 28, 2005). According to a teacher who witnessed what happened next, the four approached a group of students, \u201c[a] few words were exchanged, a punch was thrown, and there was a fight.\u201d A crowd of 30 or 40 students formed. When it became clear that the four were not going to prevail, one of them, Tyrone \u201cFat Boy\u201d Brown, retrieved a handgun from his car. \u201cFat Boy\u201d and the appellant shared the handgun, using it to fire a total of 12 shots into the crowd. Four students were seriously wounded; one of them was shot in the back of the neck and is paralyzed from the chest down.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On November 23, 2004, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County convicted the appellant of four counts of first degree assault, one for each victim. Sentencing took place on January 27, 2005. Exercising his right to allocution, the appellant made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">Your Honor, I would like to say what happened on May 7th was a tragedy. I\u2019d like to apologize for what happened that day and I\u2019d like to apologize for putting the victims and their families through the pain and suffering. And I know that a punishment is acceptable, and I\u2019m here to accept the punishment. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>When asked by his lawyer whether he thought that, \u201c[a]t some point in [his] life,\u201d he could \u201crejoin [the] community and be a productive part of society[,]\u201d the appellant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The court sentenced the appellant to the maximum 25 years for each conviction, to be served consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 100 years. In doing so, the judge characterized the crimes as \u201cvicious and heinous,\u201d described the \u201chorror\u201d endured by the families of the students and the fear the crimes created in the community, and recounted the seriousness of the victims\u2019 injuries. He characterized the appellant as a \u201csuburban terrorist\u201d and a \u201ccoward\u201d and observed that until sentencing he had shown no remorse and had bragged about \u201cbeat[ing] the attempted murder wrap [sic]\u201d and the use of a handgun charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Eleven years later, on March 25, 2016, the appellant filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, arguing that his aggregate sentence of 100 years violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The circuit court denied the motion without a hearing, by order entered on June 27, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The appellant noted a timely appeal, asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">Does a juvenile nonhomicide offender\u2019s prison sentence of 100 years violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the order of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">The Eighth Amendment to the federal constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), provides that \u201c[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>punishments inflicted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Early Supreme Court jurisprudence interpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibited barbaric punishments, such as torture or methods of execution causing undue suffering. <em>See, e.g., Wilkerson v. Utah, </em>99 U.S. 130, 135-36, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878) (noting in <em>dicta </em>that the punishment of torture is prohibited); <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U.S. 436, 447, 10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519 (1890) (\u201cPunishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death....\").</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910), the Supreme Court recognized in the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause the \u201cprecept ... that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\u201d <em>See also Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 592, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977) (Eighth Amendment \u201cbars not only those punishments that are \u2018barbaric\u2019 but also those that are \u2018excessive\u2019 in relation to the crime committed.\u201d). The sentence at issue in <em>Weems </em>was <em>\u201ccadena temporal,\u201d </em>a punishment permitted by the law of the Philippines for the crime of making a false entry in a public record. <em>Cadena temporal </em>consists of \u201cimprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance.\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 171, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). The Court held that that punishment violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause not because it was barbaric, but because it was excessive and disproportionate to the crime for which it was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">After <em>Weems, </em>two types of proportionality analyses emerged. In one type, the Court imposed \u201ccategorical restrictions on the death penalty.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 59, 130 S.Ct. 2011. In some of those cases, the Court categorically prohibited the death penalty because it was unconstitutionally excessive in relation to the severity of a particular offense. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Kennedy v. Louisiana, </em>554 U.S. 407, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 171 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008) (rape of a child); <em>Coker, </em>433 U.S. at 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861 (rape of an adult); <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982) (non-triggerman felony murderer). In others, the Court categorically prohibited the death penalty because it was unconstitutionally excessive in relation to the diminished culpability of a particular class of offenders. <em>See Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 306, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (\u201cmentally retarded\u201d offenders); <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (juvenile offenders). In determining whether to impose a categorical proportionality restriction, the Court has looked to state legislative enactments and practices to assess whether a national consensus has emerged for or against a particular punishment vis-\u00e1-vis a class of offenders, <em>see, e.g., Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 313-15, 122 S.Ct. 2242; and whether the penological goals of retribution and deterrence are served by imposing the punishment. <em>See, e.g., Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 571, 125 S.Ct. 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In the other type of proportionality analysis, the Supreme Court reviews \u201cthe length of term-of-years sentences given all the circumstances in a particular case .... to determine whether the sentence is unconstitutionally excessive.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 59, 130 S.Ct. 2011. Three \u201c \u2018objective criteria\u2019 \u201d are relevant to this analysis: \u201cthe gravity of the offense as compared to the harshness of the penalty; the sentences imposed on others in the same jurisdiction; and the sentences imposed for the same offense in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>766 F.3d 621, 626 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 288, 292, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983)). Ordinarily, a court will reach the latter two criteria only if its consideration of the first factor gives rise to \u201can initial inference of gross disproportionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In these proportionality review cases, the Supreme Court almost always has upheld the sentences. <em>See Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 273, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980) (\u201cOutside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences have been exceedingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>rare.\u201d) For example, in <em>Harmelin v. </em>Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991), a plurality of the Court upheld a mandatory LWOP sentence for the crime of possession of 672 grams of cocaine, stating that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s \u201cproportionality principle\u201d is \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201cdoes not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 997, 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680. \u201c[I]t forbids only extreme sentences that are \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The Court\u2019s 2010 decision in <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 82, 130 S.Ct. 2011, altered the landscape of proportionality review by imposing, for the first time, a categorical sentencing restriction outside the realm of the death penalty. The defendant in <em>Graham </em>was convicted of armed burglary and another offense, both committed when he was 16. In a plea agreement, he was sentenced to probation before judgment. He committed additional crimes, in violation of his probation. The court found him guilty of the armed robbery and sentenced him to LWOP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held that sentencing juvenile offenders to LWOP for a nonhomicide crime is cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The <em>Graham </em>Court began its analysis by considering \u201cobjective indicia of national consensus\u201d about LWOP sentences imposed against juvenile nonhomicide offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>S.Ct. 2011. It commented that (at that time) thirteen states prohibited LWOP sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thirty-seven states, and the federal courts, permitted LWOP for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, but the sentence very rarely was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Relying on a 2009 study and its own independent research, the Court determined that across the nation only 123 juvenile offenders were serving LWOP sentences for nonhomicide offenses. <em>See </em>P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, <em>Juvenile Life without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation, </em>14 (Sept. 14, 2009) <em>(\u201cJuvenile LWOP Study\u201d). </em>Florida accounted for 77 of those offenders and another 10 states accounted for the remaining 46. Thus, while 38 jurisdictions permitted juvenile nonhomicide offenders to be sentenced to LWOP, only 11 jurisdictions had imposed that sentence and, with the exception of Florida, they did so \u201cquite rarely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 130 S.Ct. 2011. Although the practice of imposing LWOP sentences against juvenile nonhomicide offenders was not as rare as the practices had been in the death penalty cases where the Court had adopted categorical bars, <em>see, e.g., Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 316, 122 S.Ct. 2242 (5 executions of \u201cmentally retarded\u201d defendants over 13 years), it was \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d when measured against the number of juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes each year. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 67, 130 S.Ct. 2011. In the Court\u2019s view, it was \u201c \u2018fair to say that a national consensus [had] developed against it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 316, 122 S.Ct. 2242).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The Court then considered whether in this context LWOP sentences are justified by the \u201cculpability of the offenders,\u201d <em>Id. </em>In doing so, it followed the same rationale undergirding its decision in <em>Roper </em>to categorically prohibit the death penalty for juvenile offenders. In <em>Roper, </em>the defendant was convicted of murder, burglary, and kidnapping, committed when he was 17, and was sentenced to death. Reasoning that the death penalty, being the worst punishment, should be reserved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the worst offenders, the Supreme Court identified \u201c[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults [which] demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 125 S.Ct. 1183. They suffer from \u201c \u2018[a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson v. </em>Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993)). They \u201care more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And their characters are \u201cnot as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 125 S.Ct. 1183. Due to these differences, juveniles have \u201cdiminished culpability\u201d and once that \u201cis recognized, it is evident that the penological justifications for the death penalty apply to them with lesser force than to adults.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 125 S.Ct. 1183. The <em>Roper </em>Court rejected the argument that a categorical bar was unnecessary because the criminal justice system already provides case-by-case consideration of mitigating factors, including the age of the offender. It found that the \u201cdifferences between juvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well understood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive the death penalty despite insufficient culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 125 S.Ct. 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Finally, the Court in <em>Graham </em>examined the \u201cpenological justifications for the sentencing practice\u201d of LWOP, <em>ie., </em>retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, and found that none of them supported LWOP sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 71-74, 130 S.Ct. 2011. The \u201c \u2018heart of the retribution rationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal offender.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Tison v. Arizona, </em>481 U.S. 137, 149, 107 S.Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987)), Once again relying on <em>Roper, </em>the Court reasoned that \u201c \u2018the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cbecomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did not commit homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 571, 125 S.Ct. 1183). Juveniles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u201c \u2018will be less susceptible to deterrence!!,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 571, 125 S.Ct. 1183), because they lack maturity and have an \u201c \u2018underdeveloped sense of responsibility!!.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>509 U.S. at 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658). LWOP sentences have little deterrent effect because they are imposed so rarely. <em>Id. </em>Incapacitation is not an adequate justification because one cannot reasonably assume that a juvenile nonhomicide offender \u201cforever will be a danger to society!!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 130 S.Ct. 2011. And the LWOP penalty runs contrary to the goal of rehabilitation because it is based on an \u201cirrevocable judgment\u201d that a juvenile nonhomicide offender lacks capacity for change and is equally culpable as an adult offender. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 130 S.Ct. 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The <em>Graham </em>Court concluded that the national consensus against LWOP sentences for juveniles, the diminished culpability of juveniles, and the absence of penological justifications together warranted a departure from the ordinary \u201ccase-by-case proportionality approach,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77, 130 S.Ct. 2011, for the imposition of \u201c \u2018the second most severe penalty permitted by law\u2019 \u201d against a juvenile for a nonhomicide crime. <em>Id. </em>at 69, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680). It emphasized that a LWOP sentence \u201calters the offender\u2019s life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable!!,]\u201d and \u201cdeprives the convict of the most basic liberties without giving hope of restoration[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 130 S.Ct. 2011. \u201c[T]his sentence \u2018means denial of hope; it means that good behavior and character improvement are immaterial; it means that whatever the future might hold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he will remain in prison for the rest of his days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Naovarath v. State, </em>105 Nev. 525, 779 P.2d 944, 944 (1989)) (second alteration in <em>Graham). </em>For the same reasons the Court explained in <em>Roper, </em>juveniles cannot \u201c \u2018reliab[ly] be classified among the worst offenders[,]\u2019 \u201d and therefore are undeserving, across the board, of such a harsh sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 569, 125 S.Ct. 1183). Indeed, LWOP \u201cis an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile\u201d because \u201ca juvenile offender will on average serve more years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 130 S.Ct. 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This determination; the limited culpability of juvenile nonhomi-cide offenders; and the severity of life without parole sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing practice under consideration is cruel and unusual. <em>This Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of life without'parole.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 74, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (emphasis added). Further refining its holding, the Court went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime. What the State must do, however, is give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance, ft bears emphasis, however, that while <em>the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile nonhomi-cide offender, it does not require the State to release that offender during his natural life. </em>Those who commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for the duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will remain behind bars for life. It does prohibit States from making the judgment <em>at the outset </em>that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Two years later, in <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>567 U.S. 460, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012), the Supreme Court held that <em>mandatory </em>LWOP sentences for juvenile <em>homicide </em>of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>fenders violate the Eighth Amendment, categorically. The Court reasoned that mandatory LWOP penalty schemes \u201cprevent the sentencer from taking account of\u2019 the diminished culpability of juveniles: \u201cBy removing youth from the balance\u2014by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult\u2014these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law\u2019s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 132 S.Ct. 2455. In addition, mandatory LWOP sentences prevent the sentencer from taking the \u201c \u2018mitigating qualities of youth\u2019 \u201d into account. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 132 S.Ct. 2455 (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>509 U.S. at 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658). The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory-sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Id. at 489, 132 S.Ct. 2455.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In the case at bar, the appellant contends his 100-year sentence, comprising four consecutive 25-year sentences, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the functional equivalent of a LWOP sentence for nonhomicide crimes, and therefore violates the Eighth Amendment under <em>Graham, </em>Because he will not be eligible for parole until he has served 50% of each consecutive sentence, the earliest he may be released is 2054, when he will be 67 years old. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-301(c)(l)(i) of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cCS\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He argues that by imposing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sentence with a 50-year non-parole period, the court denied him a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\u201d while he is of an age to have the chance for reconciliation with society and fulfillment outside prison, contrary to the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. <em>See Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He maintains further that even if the length of the non-parole portion of his sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment, once he becomes parole eligible, the Maryland parole system will not afford him a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d for release. He asks this Court to vacate all four sentences for first degree assault and remand the case to the circuit court for resentencing \u201cin accordance with <em>Graham </em>and its progeny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The State counters that the appellant was not sentenced to LWOP; rather, he was given four consecutive term-of-years sentences, all within the maximum allowed by law and each for a crime against a different victim. It points out that the Supreme Court has never held a term-of-years sentence categorically unconstitutional and maintains there are no \u201cprincipled bases for substituting the statutory maximum set by the legislature with an ad hoc statutory maximum as defined by an appellate court.\u201d Furthermore, the State argues, the appellant may not challenge the constitutionality of the Maryland parole statutes in a motion to correct an illegal sentence and, in any event, the parole statutes require the Parole Commission to consider \u201cdemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\u201d in assessing whether to grant parole to a juvenile nonhomicide offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In the seven years since the Supreme Court decided <em>Graham, </em>courts across the country have grappled with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>impact, if any, it has on term-of-years sentences for juveniles sentenced for nonhomicide crimes, with varying results. <em>See Moore v. Biter, </em>742 F.3d 917, 920 (9th Cir. 2014) <em>(dissent from denial of rehearing en banc) </em>(discussing the split in authority and collecting cases). We shall discuss some of these cases below.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">1. <em>Graham </em>does not apply to consecutive term-of-years sentences imposed for multiple offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Appellate courts in five states\u2014Arizona, Louisiana, Virginia, Colorado, and Missouri\u2014have held that <em>Graham\u2019s </em>categorical prohibition does not apply to multiple term-of-years sentences for multiple offenses that, cumulatively, exceed a juvenile offender\u2019s natural life expectancy. <em>See State v. Kasic, </em>228 Ariz. 228, 265 P.3d 410 (App. 2011); <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 So.3d 332 (La. 2013); <em>Vasquez v. Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>291 Va. 232, 781 S.E.2d 920 (2016), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 568, 196 L.Ed.2d 448 (2016); <em>Lucero v. People, </em>394 P.3d 1128 (Co. 2017); <em>People v. Rainer, </em>394 P.3d 1141 (Co. 2017); <em>Willbanks v.

Some of these courts have held that <em>Graham never </em>applies outside of LWOP sentences. Others have held that even if <em>Graham </em>might apply to one term-of-years sentence for a single offense that is so lengthy as to be a <em>de facto </em>LWOP sentence, it cannot apply to a lengthy aggregate sentence resulting from a multitude of offenses committed by the juvenile offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Arizona (2011): <em>State v. Kasic, </em>228 Ariz. 228, 265 P.3d 410</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">The defendant was convicted of \u201cthirty-two felonies arising from six arsons and one attempted arson committed over a one-year period beginning when he was seventeen years of age.\u201d 265 P.3d at 411. He received an aggregate sentence of 139.75 years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On appeal, he argued that \u201cthe \u2018reasons under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>lying the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Graham </em>[were] applicable to juveniles, such as [him], serving a term-of-years sentence exceeding the juvenile\u2019s life expectancy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414 (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Arizona Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that the opinion in <em>Graham </em>\u201cmade clear\u201d that the case only applied to juvenile offenders sentenced to life without parole; therefore, <em>\u201cGraham </em>does not categorically bar the sentences imposed in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. The court \u201cdecline[d] to extend <em>[Graham\u2019s </em>] reasoning in the manner [the defendant] urge[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>It proceeded with a conventional proportionality review, \u201cconsidering all of the circumstances of [the defendant\u2019s] case[,]\u201d including the \u201cgravity of the offenses and the severity of the combined sentence,\u201d and concluded that the \u201csentences [were] not \u2018constitutionally excessive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that the defendant did not receive any single sentence longer than 15.75 years, and relying upon the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that the court will \u201cnot consider the imposition of consecutive sentences in the proportionality inquiry,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court found that \u201cdifferent considerations apply to consecutive term-of-years sentences based on multiple counts and multiple victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415-16. The \u201csentences, viewed individually and in the aggregate, further Arizona\u2019s penological goals and thus reflect a rational legislative judgment, entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416 (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Louisiana (2013): <em>State v. </em>Brown, 118 So.3d at 332</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The defendant was convicted of one count of aggravated kidnapping, for which he was sentenced to life, and four counts of armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 10 years. He was 16 when he committed the offenses. The court originally had imposed concurrent sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tences, without parole, but amended the sentences post-Ghw-<em>ham. </em>The State took issue with the amendments to the term-of-years sentences. The case came before the Supreme Court of Louisiana on the question \u201cwhether, and to what extent, the ... decision in <em>Graham </em>applies in cases in which the juvenile offender committed multiple offenses resulting in cumulative sentences matching or exceeding his life expectancy without the opportunity of securing early release from confinement on parole.\u201d 118 So.3d at 335. Observing that <em>Graham </em>did not include any \u201canalysis of sentences for multiple convictions and provide[d] no guidance on how to handle such sentences,\u201d the court concluded that <em>Graham </em>does \u201cnot prohibit consecutive term of year sentences for multiple offenses committed [by a juvenile], even if they might exceed a defendant\u2019s lifetime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341. (As we shall discuss, <em>infra, </em>the same court later reached a different result in addressing a lengthy term-of-years sentence against a juvenile for <em>one </em>offense.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Virginia (2016): <em>Vasquez v. Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>291 Va. 232, 781 S.E.2d 920</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">When they were 16 years old, the defendants broke into a townhouse, stole property, and repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted the female occupant at knifepoint. In a joint jury trial, Vasquez was convicted of eighteen felonies and Valentin was convicted of twelve felonies. These crimes included forcible vaginal and anal rape, breaking and entering while armed with a deadly weapon, forcible fellatio, abduction, and robbery. The court sentenced each defendant to multiple term-of-years sentences \u201cwhich, in the aggregate, equaled 283 years for Vasquez, with 150 years suspended, and 148 years for Valentin, with 80 years suspended.\u201d 781 S.E.2d at 926. As a result, Vasquez would serve 133 years of active incarceration and Valentin would serve 68 years. Pursuant to Virginia law, both would become eligible for parole upon reaching the age of 60. <em>Id. </em>at 924 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">In a consolidated appeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that <em>Graham </em>is not implicated for \u201cmultiple term-of-years sentences imposed on multiple crimes that, by virtue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>accumulation, exceed the criminal defendant\u2019s life expectancy.\u201d 291 Va. at 241, 781 S.E.2d at 925. The multiple sentences imposed by the trial court were \u201cnothing like <em>Graham, </em>which involved a single crime resulting in a single [LWOP] sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In reaching this result, the <em>Vasquez </em>court was persuaded by the reasoning of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Bunch v. Smith, </em>685 F.3d 546 (6th Cir. 2012), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Bunch v. Bobby, </em>569 U.S. 947, 133 S.Ct. 1996, 185 L.Ed.2d 865 (2013). The defendant in <em>Bunch </em>was convicted of robbing, kidnapping, and repeatedly raping a young woman when he was 16 and was sentenced by an Ohio state court to \u201cconsecutive, fixed terms totaling 89 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. After <em>Graham </em>was decided, he petitioned, unsuccessfully, for habeas relief in state court. He challenged that ruling in federal court. The Sixth Circuit held that the sentence did not \u201cviolate clearly established federal law\u201d and, therefore, the habeas petition properly had been denied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It distinguished <em>Graham, </em>noting that Graham \u201cwas sentenced to life in prison for committing one nonhomicide offense, [whereas] Bunch was sentenced to consecutive, fixed-term sentences\u2014the longest of which was 10 years\u2014for committing multiple nonhomicide offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551. The Sixth Circuit recognized that \u201cBunch\u2019s 89-year aggregate sentence may end up being the functional equivalent of life without parole,\u201d making it likely that he would \u201cnot be given the \u2018meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\u2019 called for in <em>Graham.\u201d Id. </em>Emphasizing that the <em>Graham </em>\u201cCourt did not address juvenile offenders, like Bunch, who received consecutive, fixed-term sentences for committing multiple nonhomicide offenses,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the <em>Graham </em>holding is limited to cases in which LWOP has been imposed for a single nonhomicide offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Colorado (2017): <em>Lucero v. People, </em>394 P.3d 1128 <em>&amp; People v. Rainer, </em>394 P.3d 1141</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In two cases decided the same day, the Supreme Court of Colorado held that <em>Graham </em>does not apply to aggregate sentences of 84 years and 112 years, respectively, imposed upon juvenile offenders for nonhomicide crimes. <em>Lucero, </em>394 P.3d at 1128; <em>Rainer, </em>394 P.3d at 1141. Lucero was convicted of conspiracy to commit first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and two counts of second degree assault. He committed these crimes in the course of a drive-by shooting when he was 15. He was sentenced \u201cto consecutive term-of-years prison sentences for each count, aggravated as crimes of violence, resulting in an aggregate sentence of eighty-four years[.]\u201d 394 P.3d at 1129. He would become parole eligible at age 57. Rainer was 17 years old when he broke into an occupied dwelling and \u201cshot one of the home\u2019s inhabitants four times and another inhabitant three times, leaving both in critical condition.\u201d 394 P.3d at 1143. He was convicted of \u201ctwo counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault, one count of first-degree burglary, one count of aggravated robbery, and sentence-enhancement counts for crimes of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Sentenced to an aggregate term of 112 years, he would become parole eligible at age 75.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">After <em>Graham </em>was decided, the defendants sought post-conviction relief, arguing that their sentences were \u201cthe functional equivalent of a sentence of life without parole and denie[d] [them] a meaningful opportunity for release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both cases reached the Supreme Court of Colorado, which held that <em>Graham </em>(and Miller) only apply \u201cwhere a juvenile is sentenced to the specific sentence of life without the possibility of parole <em>for one offense\u201d </em>394 P.3d at 1132 (emphasis added.) \u201cMultiple sentences imposed for multiple offenses do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>become a sentence of life without parole, even though they may result in a lengthy term of incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1133. Because \u201ceach sentence is a separate punishment for a separate offense,\u201d the \u201cproper question on review is whether a sentence is constitutionally disproportionate to the offense for which it was imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Close v. People, </em>48 P.3d 528 (Colo. 2002)). Otherwise, a defendant could \u201c \u2018generate an Eighth Amendment disproportionality claim simply because [he] had engaged in repeated criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Close, </em>48 P.3d at 539). Applying those principles, the court held that the defendants\u2019 sentences were not unconstitutionally disproportionate relative to each offense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Missouri (2017): <em>Willbanks v. Department of Corrections, </em>522 S.W.3d 238, 2017 WL 2952445</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">At age 17, the defendant and two accomplices participated in an armed carjacking, shooting the victim four times. The defendant was convicted of first degree assault, kidnapping, two counts of first degree robbery, and three counts of armed criminal action. The court sentenced him to consecutive terms of life for assault; 15 years for kidnapping; 20 years for each robbery count; and 100 years for each armed criminal action count. State statutes required him to serve 85% of his sentences before he could become parole eligible, meaning that he could not be paroled until he was \u201capproximately 85 years old.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 2017 WL 2952445, at *2. After <em>Graham </em>was decided, the defendant filed a declaratory judgment action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>seeking a ruling that these statutes were \u201cunconstitutional as applied to him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">On July 11, 2017, the Supreme Court of Missouri, by a majority of judges, held that <em>Graham </em>does not govern cases in which juvenile offenders were \u201cconvicted of multiple nonhomi-cide offenses and received multiple fixed-term sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 2017 WL 2952445, at *1. In its view, the <em>Graham </em>Court tightly focused its analysis on juvenile offenders serving LWOP sentences and did not consider \u201cthe thousands\u201d of juveniles serving \u201cmultiple fixed-term sentences\u201d that, in the aggregate, will exceed their natural life expectancies. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 2017 WL 2952445, at *3. The Court was not persuaded that \u201cpenological goals [were] not served by sentencing juveniles to multiple fixed term sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 2017 WL 2952445, at*4.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Three members of the court dissented. They opined that <em>Graham </em>applies to aggregate term-of-years sentences for nonhomicide offenses that are so long that the juvenile offender is \u201clikely to die in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 2017 WL 2952445, at *7. They noted that sentencing courts are fully \u201ccognizant of the overall effect\u201d of imposing sentences consecutively, so the likelihood that the offender will die in prison is not merely a \u201ccollateral result of sentencing the juvenile for multiple crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 2017 WL 2952445, at *8. The dissenters were persuaded by many of the cases we shall discuss <em>infra, </em>holding that the principles underlying <em>Graham </em>(and <em>Miller) </em>apply equally to aggregate term-of-years sentences.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>2. <em>Graham </em>applies to any sentence imposed against a juvenile offender for a nonhomicide offense when the sentence exceeds the juvenile\u2019s natural life expectancy</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Appellate courts in at least five other states\u2014California, Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and New Jersey\u2014have reached the opposite result, holding that <em>Graham </em>applies to aggregate term-of-years sentences imposed on juvenile offenders for multiple nonhomicide crimes when the sentences are the functional equivalent of LWOP. <em>See People v.

All of these courts read <em>Graham </em>as a broad mandate that juvenile nonhomicide offenders receive a meaningful opportunity for release upon a showing of rehabilitation, regardless of whether a LWOP sentence was imposed or aggregate sentences amounting to LWOP were imposed.

He was convicted of three counts of attempted murder and was found to qualify for statutory sentence enhancement. He was sentenced to 15 years to life, plus 25 years on the first count; and two consecutive terms of 15 years to life, plus 20 years on the second and third counts, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 110 years to life.

It held that \u201cthe constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under <em>Graham </em>is implicated when a juvenile nonhomicide offender\u2019s sentence does not afford any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u2018meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011). It reasoned that the <em>Graham </em>Court could not have had any \u201cintention of limiting its new categorical rule to sentences denominated under the exclusive term of \u2018life in prison\u2019 \u201d because, given that \u201cjuveniles are different,\u201d the penological goals served in sentencing adult offenders to lengthy prison terms would not necessarily be served by sentencing juvenile offenders to the same lengthy terms. <em>Id. </em>at 680. The court ordered that Henry be resentenced \u201cin light of ... new juvenile sentencing legislation enacted by the Florida legislature.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">On the same day that the Supreme Court of Florida decided <em>Henry, </em>it also decided <em>Gridine v. State, </em>175 So.3d 672 (Fla.2015). Employing the same reasoning, it held that an aggregate 70-year sentence imposed for crimes committed when the defendant was 14 years old was cruel and unusual punishment. It remanded the case for the sentencing court to \u201cconduct proceedings in accordance with <em>Henry\u201d </em>175 So.3d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In <em>Kelsey v. State, </em>206 So.3d 5 (Fla. 2016), the Court extended <em>Henry </em>to juveniles whose LWOP sentences were vacated <em>post-Graham, </em>but who were resenteneed prior to the enactment of the new juvenile resentencing legislation. Kelsey had been convicted of four offenses arising from a home burglary and rape he committed when he was 15 years old. His life sentences for two of those offenses were vacated post-<em>Graham </em>and he was resentenced to concurrent 45-year terms. He appealed from those sentences and the Supreme Court of Florida reversed, clarifying that its holding \u201cthat <em>Graham </em>does indeed apply to term-of-years sentences\u201d was not limited to \u201c \u2018de facto life\u2019 sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Rather, any juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>nonhomicide offender sentenced to a lengthy term of years was entitled to the benefit of the judicial review mechanism adopted by the Florida legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Most recently, in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>215 So.3d 1237, 1242-43, the Florida Supreme Court further refined its holding in <em>Henry, </em>opining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">[W]e must consider three factors when reviewing a juvenile nonhomicide offender\u2019s term-of-years sentence. <em>Postr-Henry, </em>we must ensure that a juvenile nonhomicide offender does not receive a sentence that provides for release only at the end of a sentence (e.g. a 45-year sentence with no provision for obtaining early release based on a demonstration of maturity and rehabilitation before the expiration of the imposed term, such as in <em>Kelsey). </em>Secondly, we must ensure that a juvenile nonhomicide offender who is sentenced post-<em>Henry </em>does not receive a sentence which includes early release that is not based on a demonstration of rehabilitation and maturity (i.e. gain time or other programs designed to relieve prison overpopulation). Last, we must ensure that a juvenile nonhomicide offender who is sentenced post-<em>Henry </em>does not receive a sentence that provides for early release at a time beyond his or her natural life (e.g. a 1,000-year sentence that provides parole-eligibility after the offender serves 100 years). To qualify as a \u201cmeaningful opportunity for early release,\u201d a juvenile nonhomicide offender\u2019s sentence must meet each of the three parameters described in <em>Henry.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Nevada (2015): <em>State v.

Upon conviction, he was sentenced to \u201c14 consecutive life terms with the possibility of parole, plus a consecutive term of 92 years in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was granted, and the State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The Supreme Court of Nevada addressed \u201cwhether the holding in <em>Graham </em>applies when an aggregate sentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>posed against a juvenile offender convicted of more than one nonhomicide offense is the equivalent of a life-without-parole sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It concluded that \u201cthe <em>Graham </em>rule applies to aggregate sentences that are the functional equivalent of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457. Although <em>\u201cGraham </em>provides no direction\u201d on this issue, the <em>Graham </em>Court did not \u201cspecifically limit its holding to offenders who were convicted for a single nonhomicide offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that permitting courts to impose sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders that are the functional equivalent of LWOP will \u201cundermine the [Supreme] Court\u2019s goal of \u2018prohibit[ing] States from making the judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011). Because the defendant\u2019s sentence of almost 100 years was \u201cwithout a doubt the functional equivalent of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 458, the court did not analyze at what point a term-of-years sentence attains that status.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Ohio (2016): <em>State v. Moore, </em>149 Ohio St.3d 557, 76 N.E.3d 1127</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">When he was 15 years old, the defendant \u201cembarked on a criminal rampage of escalating depravity,\u201d robbing a man and woman at gunpoint before carjacking another woman, robbing her, and raping her repeatedly.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> 76 N.E.3d at 1128. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>convicted of twelve offenses, including three counts each of aggravated robbery and rape and one count of kidnapping. The court sentenced him to the \u201cmaximum prison term for each count,\u201d resulting in an aggregate sentence of 141 years, which was subsequently reduced to 112 years. <em>Id. </em>at 1130. He would be eligible for parole at age 92, after serving 77 years of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a minimum sentence for a juvenile nonhomicide offender \u201cthat extends beyond the life expectancy of the offender,\u201d is unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 1134. It construed <em>Graham </em>as \u201cprotecting] juveniles categorically from a final determination while they are still youths that they are irreparably corrupt and undeserving of a chance to reenter society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1136. It noted that although <em>Graham </em>does not guarantee a juvenile nonhomicide offender release during his or her lifetime, it requires that such an offender be given a \u201c \u2018meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1137 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011). It found that a sentence that merely allows such offenders to \u201cbreathe their last breaths as free people\u201d is not the \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d envisioned by the <em>Graham </em>Court. <em>Id. </em>Rather, a juvenile nonhomicide offender must be given an opportunity to show that he or she is entitled to be released to \u201clive part of [his or her] li[fe] in society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For that reason, <em>Graham </em>applies equally to sentences of LWOP and the functional equivalent of LWOP. As the defendant\u2019s first opportunity for release would be at age 92, \u201cwell beyond his life expectancy,\u201d his sentence was a \u201cpunishment that remove[d] [him] from society without a meaningful chance to demonstrate rehabilitation and obtain release\u201d and \u201clacked penological justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1139-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Rejecting the argument that <em>Graham </em>was not meant to apply to \u201cmultiple, consecutive fixed-term sentences for non-homicide offenses[,]\u201d the court noted that Graham himself had committed multiple offenses, although his LWOP sentence was imposed for just one offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1141. It emphasized that even though the sentencing court in <em>Graham </em>had taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Graham\u2019s criminal proclivities into account, the Supreme Court had reasoned that \u201c \u2018it [did] not follow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his life.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1141-42 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 73, 130 S.Ct. 2011.) By imposing a categorical rule for all juveniles convicted of nonhomicide offenses, the <em>Graham </em>Court had rejected a \u201ccase-by-case approach\u201d that would permit courts to impose life sentences for juveniles who committed \u201c \u2018particularly heinous crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1142 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 77, 130 S.Ct. 2011). \u201cWhether the sentence is the product of a discrete offense or multiple offenses, the fact remains that it was a <em>juvenile </em>who committed the one offense or several offenses and who has diminished moral culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The court vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for \u201cresentencing in conformity with Graham.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">New Jersey (2017): <em>State v. Zuber, </em>227 N.J. 422, 152 A.3d 197</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In two consolidated appeals, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that <em>Graham </em>applies to \u201csentences that are the practical equivalent of [LWOP].\u201d 152 A.3d at 201. In one case, the defendant participated in two separate gang rapes when he was 17. He was convicted of 10 offenses and was sentenced, \u201cin the aggregate, to 150 years in prison with a 75-year period of parole ineligibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. His sentence later was reduced to 110 years, with 55 years of parole ineligibility. He would become parole eligible at age 72. In the other case, the defendant was 17 when he participated in four armed robberies. He was convicted of \u201cmultiple counts related to the robberies, including one count of felony murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. He was sentenced to an aggregate term of 75 years in prison, with 68 years and 3 months of parole ineligibility. He would become parole eligible at age 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">In the aftermath of <em>Graham, </em>both defendants filed motions to correct illegal sentences. The cases reached the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Court of New Jersey, which consolidated them for decision. The court found that it makes no practical difference whether a juvenile offender receives a \u201cformal\u201d sentence of LWOP or receives \u201cmultiple term-of-years sentences that, in all likelihood, will keep him in jail for the rest of his life[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. The constitutionality of the sentence should not turn on its \u201clabel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212. The court determined that each defendant\u2019s aggregate sentence was sufficiently lengthy to \u201ctrigger the protections of <em>Miller </em>under the Federal and [New Jersey] Constitutions.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 213. Because the \u201cfocus at a juvenile\u2019s sentencing hearing belongs on the real time consequences of the aggregate sentence,\u201d the sentencing court must consider the <em>\u201cMiller </em>factors\u201d whether it is sentencing the juvenile to a lengthy term-of-years sentence for a single offense or is sentencing the juvenile to multiple term-of-years sentences for multiple offenses resulting in a lengthy period of parole ineligibility. <em>Id. </em>at 212. The court directed \u201cjudges to exercise a heightened level of care before imposing multiple consecutive sentences on juveniles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214. It also urged the New Jersey legislature to \u201cenact[ ] a scheme that provides for later review of juvenile sentences with lengthy periods of parole ineligibility[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Ninth Circuit (2014); <em>Moore v.

He was convicted by a California state court of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auv-dedup-1\">twenty-four counts: nine counts of forcible rape, seven counts of forcible oral copulation, two counts of attempted second degree robbery, two counts of second degree robbery, forcible sodomy, kidnaping with the specific intent to commit a felony sex offense, genital penetration by a foreign object, and the unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>jury found that [the defendant] also used a firearm while committing his crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><em>Id. </em>The court imposed 24 consecutive sentences totaling 254 years and 4 months. He would have to live to the age of 144 to be parole eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">After <em>Graham </em>was decided, the defendant filed a state habeas petition challenging the constitutionality of his sentence. The trial court denied his petition, the intermediate appellate court affirmed, and the Supreme Court of California summarily denied review.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He then filed his federal habeas petition, which reached the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The court held that the California court\u2019s failure to apply <em>Graham </em>to the defendant\u2019s sentences was contrary to clearly established federal law. It concluded that the sentences were \u201cmaterially indistinguishable from the sentence in <em>Graham\u201d </em>because the defendant would remain in prison for the rest of his life without a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to demonstrate any entitlement to release. <em>Id. </em>at 1191. It reasoned that the nonhomicide crimes he committed could not be distinguished in any principled way from those at issue in <em>Graham, </em>because the <em>Graham </em>Court \u201cdrew only one line that was crime-specific: it distinguished between homicide and nonhomicide crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1192. The trial court\u2019s sentence was the equivalent of LWOP and was imposed for nonhomicide crimes against a juvenile offender. It therefore was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The State filed a petition for rehearing and a petition for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>The <em>en banc </em>petition was considered by the entire court and was denied. In a published opinion dissenting from the denial, Judge Diarmuid O\u2019Scannlain, joined by six judges, criticized the majority for \u201cfailing to distinguish one \u2018life without parole\u2019 sentence from multiple \u2018term-of-years\u2019 sentences.\u201d 742 F.3d at 917. The defendant had committed four separate rapes over five weeks and had been convicted of 24 separate crimes; and no single sentence exceeded eight years. In the view of the dissenting judges, it was plain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the <em>Graham </em>Court\u2019s analysis only concerned actual LWOP sentences. That was the \u201c \u2018sentencing practice\u2019 \u201d the <em>Graham </em>Court determined was \u201c \u2018exceedingly rare,\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 919 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 67, 130 S.Ct. 2011). The <em>Graham </em>Court did not even \u201cconsider the prevalence of sentences like [the defendant\u2019s]\u2014lengthy term-of-years sentences adding up to <em>de facto </em>life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that the <em>Graham </em>Court did not include such sentences in its analysis, the dissenters concluded that it did not intend to include them within its categorical bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Tenth Circuit (2017): <em>Budder v. Addison, </em>851 F.3d 1047</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The defendant was 16 when he stabbed a 17-year-old girl multiple times, raped her repeatedly, and forced her to fellate him. He was convicted by an Oklahoma state court of two counts of first degree rape; one count of assault and battery with a deadly weapon; and one count of forcible oral sodomy. He was sentenced to LWOP for each rape conviction, life with parole for assault and battery, and 20 years for forcible oral sodomy, all to run consecutively. Less than two weeks later, <em>Graham </em>was decided. On direct appeal, the defendant\u2019s LWOP sentences were modified to life with parole. The sentences still were to run consecutively. The defendant challenged his sentences again, arguing that because he would have to serve 131.75 years in prison to be eligible for parole, they still violated <em>Graham. </em>The state court held that the defendant\u2019s multiple, consecutive term-of-years sentences did not violate <em>Graham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">On consideration of the defendant\u2019s federal habeas petition premised on the same argument, the Tenth Circuit reversed. In its view, the <em>Graham </em>Court\u2019s decision to impose a categorical bar rested on \u201c(1) the \u2018sentencing practice\u2019; (2) \u2018the nature of the offense\u2019; and (3) \u2018the characteristics of the offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 60-61, 130 S.Ct. 2011)). The court understood the \u201csentencing practice\u201d at issue in <em>Graham </em>to \u201cinclude[ ] any sentence that would deny the offender a realistic opportunity for release in the offender\u2019s lifetime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It pointed out that Graham himself had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>sentenced to life in prison, and it was only because the State of Florida had abolished its parole system that his sentence was treated as LWOP. It opined that the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment cannot depend upon the label applied to a sentence. The \u201cnature of the offense\u201d is any \u201cnonhomicide\u201d crime committed by a juvenile, regardless of the \u201cnumber or severity of nonhomicide crimes committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057. <em>Graham </em>did not \u201cdraw any distinction ]\u201d in that regard and, in fact, \u201cspecifically referred to offenders with multiple crimes and multiple charges, including Budder [the defendant] himself.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the court\u2019s view, the <em>Graham </em>Court intended to put an end to the \u201ccase specific approach\u201d to sentencing that allows a court to impose a sentence equivalent to LWOP by aggregating multiple, consecutive term-of-years sentences for crimes it considers \u201c \u2018particularly heinous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 77, 130 S.Ct. 2011)). Finally, \u201cthe characteristics of the offender\u201d encompasses any offender who was a juvenile when he or she committed the nonhomicide offense(s) because <em>Graham </em>recognized that those offenders are less culpable and the penological goals ordinarily served by LWOP sentences are not served for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The Tenth Circuit concluded that because the defendant \u201ccommitted his crimes as a juvenile ... did not commit homicide[, and] ,.. received a life sentence ... [that] does not provide him a realistic opportunity for release,\u201d his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>violated \u201cthe categorical rule clearly established in Graham\u201d and the Oklahoma appellate court erred by holding otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 1059. It reversed and remanded with \u201cinstructions to grant [the defendant\u2019s] petition for writ of habeas corpus, ... vacate [his] sentence, and to direct the State of Oklahoma to resentence [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">3. Cases holding that <em>Graham </em>may apply to a lengthy term-of-years sentence for one offense (but not multiple offenses)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Finally, some state courts have addressed whether <em>Graham </em>applies to a lengthy term-of-years sentence for a <em>single </em>nonho-micide offense, reaching different results depending upon the length of the sentence imposed. In <em>State v. Smith, </em>295 Neb. 957, 892 N.W.2d 52 (2017), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 16-9416 (May 30, 2017),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the defendant was 16 years old when he and an accomplice robbed a doughnut shop, kidnapped a female employee, sexually assaulted her, and killed her. He plead guilty to kidnapping and burglary, and ultimately was sentenced to 90 years to life. He filed a habeas petition, arguing that his sentence for kidnapping violated <em>Graham. </em>The Supreme Court of Nebraska upheld the sentence. It found that because the defendant would be eligible for parole at age 62, the sentence \u201csatisfied] the \u2018meaningful opportunity\u2019 requirement\u201d of <em>Graham. Id. </em>at 65. Moreover, the sentencing court had considered the relevant mitigating factors and the sentence was not otherwise unconstitutionally excessive relative to the crime of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">In <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. State, </em>217 So.3d 266 (La. 2016), the defendant was convicted of an armed robbery he committed at age 17, and was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment without parole. He filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, under <em>Graham, </em>which was denied. On appeal, he argued that his sentence was the functional equivalent of LWOP. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>State countered that the court\u2019s precedent in <em>Brown, swpra, </em>was dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The Louisiana Supreme Court distinguished <em>Brown. </em>In that case, the defendant had been \u201cconvicted of five offenses resulting in five consecutive sentences which, when aggregated, resulted in a term pursuant to which he would have no opportunity for release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271-72. By contrast, \u201cthe defendant [in the case before it] was convicted of a single offense and sentenced to a single term which affords him no opportunity for release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272. The court found there to be no difference between a 99-year sentence without parole for one crime and a LWOP sentence for one crime; therefore, the sentence at issue was \u201cthe functional equivalent of life without parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277. It noted that even if the 99-year sentence was changed to be with parole, the defendant would not be eligible for release until age 101. The court remedied the situation by determining that the defendant qualified for relief under a <em>post-Graham </em>Louisiana statute making all juvenile offenders serving life sentences for nonhomicide offenses eligible for parole after serving 30 years of their sentences.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In Maryland, a court may \u201ccorrect an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d Md. Rule 4-345(a). An illegal sentence is \u201cone in which the illegality \u2018inheres in the sentence itself; <em>ie., </em>there either has been no conviction warranting any sentence for the particular offense or the sentence is not a permitted one for the conviction upon which it was imposed and, for either reason, is intrinsically and substantively unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colvin v. State, </em>450 Md. 718, 725, 150 A.3d 850 (2016) (quoting <em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 466, 918 A.2d 506 (2007)). We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence <em>de novo. See Carlini v. </em>State, 215 Md.App. 415, 443, 81 A.3d 560 (2013) (whether a sentence \u201cis or is not inherently illegal\u201d is \u201cquintessentially a question of law calling for <em>de novo </em>appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The appellant does not argue that any of the sentences imposed\u201425 years for each first degree assault conviction\u2014 standing alone, is illegal. He concedes that all are within the statutory range permitted by law. <em>See </em>Md. Code (2002, 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 3-202(b) of the Criminal Law Article. Nor does he argue that any one sentence is grossly excessive. He maintains, however, that the aggregate term of 100 years resulting from the sentences being imposed consecutively is a functional LWOP sentence imposed against a juvenile nonhomicide offender, which is unconstitutional under Graham; and an unconstitutional sentence is an illegal sentence. <em>See Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App, 171, 187, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982) (sentencing court had broad discretion to impose any legal sentence for common law crime, meaning any sentence that was not \u201cunconstitutional\u201d). Having considered the <em>Graham </em>decision itself and the cases, discussed above, addressing the implications of <em>Graham </em>for term-of-years sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes, we conclude that <em>Graham </em>does not apply. The appellant\u2019s aggregate sentence of 100 years is not unconstitutional and therefore is not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Graham </em>to impose a categorical bar against LWOP sentences for juvenile nonhomi-cide offenders was a singular departure from its established Eighth Amendment sentencing jurisprudence, which until then only had adopted categorical restrictions against imposition of the death penalty. LWOP for juvenile nonhomicide offenders was the only sentencing practice explored and evaluated by the <em>Graham </em>Court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Its analysis was bound up in that particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>lar sentencing practice. The Court \u201cconducted no analysis of sentences for multiple convictions\u201d and the analysis it did conduct \u201cprovides no guidance on how to handle such sentences.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>118 So.3d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">At the outset of its constitutional inquiry, the Court examined whether there were \u201cobjective criteria\u201d of an evolving national consensus against sentencing juvenile offenders to LWOP for nonhomicide crimes. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 61, 130 S.Ct. 2011. As discussed, in finding that there was, the Court relied upon the <em>Juvenile LWOP Study </em>and its own research, which showed that in the entire country only 123 juvenile offenders were serving LWOP sentences for nonhomicide crimes. The Court did not take into account any aggregate term-of-years sentences, including those for a cumulative number of years exceeding the juvenile\u2019s life expectancy, which could be considered the functional equivalent of LWOP. (And of course, having not considered that, the Court did not consider age at the time of parole eligibility.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Indeed, the Court rejected the State of Florida\u2019s argument that it should include in its analysis juvenile offenders sentenced to LWOP for nonhomicide <em>and </em>homicide crimes. In the Court\u2019s eyes, those cases did not accurately reflect the national consensus on the specific sentencing practice under consideration because those defendants likely were being \u201cpunished in part for the homicide when the judge [made] the sentencing determination [about the nonhomicide crime].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 130 S.Ct. 2011. The Court narrowly tailored its analysis to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>particular sentencing category at issue: LWOP imposed against a juvenile offender for one nonhomicide crime. The emerging national consensus the Court found to exist was against sentencing juveniles to LWOP for a single nonhomi-cide crime. It made no finding of such a consensus against the practice of sentencing juveniles to multiple term-of-years sentences for multiple nonhomicide crimes when the sentences, in the aggregate, exceed the defendant\u2019s life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In addition, nothing in the <em>Graham </em>Court\u2019s analysis touched upon whether such sentences serve penological justifications that are not served when the defendant is convicted and sentenced for a single crime. We think it plain that they do. The \u201c\u2018heart of the retribution rationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 137, 107 S.Ct. 1676). To be sure, as the Court already had held in <em>Roper </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Graham, </em>as a general class of offenders juveniles are less culpable than adults. Within the world of juvenile offenders, however, one who commits multiple nonhomicide crimes against multiple victims, causing injury to each victim, is more culpable than one who commits the same injury-producing crime against one victim. In <em>Brown v. State, </em>311 Md. 426, 435, 535 A.2d 485 (1988), the Court of Appeals stated the common sense proposition that \u201c[pjunishment for criminal conduct should be commensurate with responsibility and <em>a defendant who terrorizes multiple persons with a handgun is more culpable than a defendant who terrorizes only one.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That proposition is no less applicable among juvenile nonhomicide offenders and does not become inapplicable merely because juvenile offenders as a group are less culpable than adult offenders. We agree with the courts in <em>Kasic </em>and <em>Willbanks </em>that \u201cdifferent considerations apply to consecutive term-of-years sentences based on multiple counts and multiple victims[,]\u201d <em>Kasic, </em>265 P.3d at 415-16; and that <em>Graham </em>did not hold that \u201cpenological goals [were] not served by sentencing juveniles to multiple fixed-term sentences.\u201d <em>Willbanks, </em>at 243, 2017 WL 2952445 at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The <em>Graham </em>Court emphasized that the rarity of LWOP sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in jurisdictions permitting such sentences lessened the deterrent effect of those sentences. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 72, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (remarking that juveniles are less easily deterred by the threat of punishment and that this is \u201cparticularly so when that punishment is rarely imposed\u201d). By contrast, the practice of imposing consecutive term-of-years sentences that cumulatively produce a lengthy aggregate sentence is not rare. <em>See Willbanks, </em>at 243, 2017 WL 2952445 at *3 <em>(Graham </em>Court\u2019s analysis did not touch upon \u201cthe thousands\u201d of juveniles serving \u201cmultiple fixed-term sentences\u201d). Thus the deterrent effect of those sentences has not been diminished in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Nor does the practice of imposing cumulative term-of-years sentences for multiple offenses reflect an \u201cirrevocable judgment\u201d that a juvenile nonhomicide offender has no capacity for change. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 74, 130 S.Ct. 2011. Rather, it reflects a series of judgments that for each offense a particular term-of-years sentence within the statutory limit serves the goals of \u201cpunishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. \u201d <em>See Jennings v. State, </em>339 Md. 675, 682, 664 A.2d 903 (1995); <em>Lucero, </em>394 P.3d at 1133 (\u201ceach sentence is a separate punishment for a separate offense\u201d). Viewing the sentences this way adheres to the established case law holding that Eighth Amendment proportionality review must address each individual sentence imposed, not the aggregate sentence that results. In <em>O\u2019Neil v. Vermont, </em>144 U.S. 323, 12 S.Ct. 693, 36 L.Ed. 450 (1892), where the sentencing court imposed 307 consecutive sentences for liquor law violations, the Supreme Court quoted, in <em>dicta, </em>from the sentencing court\u2019s remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cIt would scarcely be competent for a person to assail the constitutionality of the statute prescribing a punishment for burglary, on the ground that he had committed so many burglaries that, if punishment for each were inflicted on him, he might be kept in prison for life. The mere fact that cumulative punishments may be imposed for distinct of-fences in the same prosecution is not material upon this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>question. If the penalty were unreasonably severe for a single offence, the constitutional question might be urged; but here the unreasonableness is only in the number of offences which the respondent has committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 331, 12 S.Ct. 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">As the Supreme Court of Minnesota recently observed in <em>State v. Ali, </em>895 N.W.2d 237 (Minn. 2017), the <em>O\u2019Neil </em>Court\u2019s <em>dicta </em>has been widely followed by state and federal courts in assessing proportionality challenges under the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>See Hawkins v. Hargett, </em>200 F.3d 1279, 1285 n.5 (10th Cir. 1999) (\u201cThe Eighth Amendment analysis focuses on the sentence imposed for each specific crime, not on the cumulative sentence for multiple crimes.\u201d);<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Aiello, </em>864 F.2d 257, 265 (2d. Cir. 1988) (same); <em>State v. Berger, </em>212 Ariz. 473, 134 P.3d 378, 384 (2006) (affirming the imposition of 20 consecutive 10-year sentences for separate convictions for possession of child pornography and remarking that, \u201cas a general rule, this court \u2018will not consider the imposition of consecutive sentences in a proportionality inquiry .,..\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>206 Ariz. 377, 79 P.3d 64, 74 (2003)); <em>see also Pearson v. Ramos, </em>237 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir. 2001) (affirming the imposition of cumulative disciplinary sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>against a prisoner, opining that \u201cit is wrong to treat stacked sanctions as a single sanction. To do so produces the ridiculous consequence of enabling a prisoner, simply by recidivating, to generate a colorable Eighth Amendment claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">An appellate court\u2019s holding necessarily incorporates the factual and procedural context for the issue before it. In our view, the courts that read <em>Graham </em>to \u201chold\u201d that <em>all </em>juvenile nonhomicide offenders must be given an opportunity to seek release at some time, regardless of the individual circumstances (and for some courts, early enough that they can build a life for themselves) are interpreting the case well beyond its actual holding. The holding of <em>Graham </em>is that a juvenile convicted of one nonhomicide crime may not be given a LWOP sentence that from the outset affords him no opportunity to obtain release based on growth and maturity. Given the very different considerations that are in play when a juvenile commits multiple nonhomicide crimes against multiple victims and receives multiple term-of-years cumulative sentences, each of which individually is not grossly disproportionate, we cannot say that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Graham </em>is implicated. This is not a \u201csame sentence different label\u201d situation. Moreover, the rarity of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Graham </em>to impose a categorical restriction outside the context of the death penalty militates in favor of a narrow construction of its categorical bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We hold that <em>Graham\u2019s </em>categorical bar on the imposition of LWOP sentences against juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not apply to a sentence such as the appellant\u2019s sentence that comprises multiple sentences imposed for multiple crimes against multiple victims, where no sentence individually is lengthy enough to trigger a Graham-based challenge. Sentences of this sort were not addressed by the <em>Graham </em>Court and are dissimilar from a LWOP sentence (or even a lengthy term-of-years sentence) imposed for a single offense in terms of the penological goals being served. The appropriate Eighth Amendment analysis when there are multiple nonhomicide crimes committed by a juvenile against multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>victims, with no single sentence for LWOP, is whether, upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances (including the age of the offender), each individual sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime for which it was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Even if we were to adopt the appellant\u2019s position that <em>Graham </em>applies to multiple term-of-years sentences, we nevertheless would hold that the sentences imposed here are not cruel and unusual. The appellant may seek release on parole when he is 67 years old. Most of the cases holding that <em>Graham </em>applies to cumulative term-of-years sentences dealt with much longer periods of parole ineligibility that plainly exceeded the defendant\u2019s life expectancy. <em>See Caballero </em>(age 116); <em>Boston </em>(age 116); <em>Morgan </em>(age 101); <em>Henry </em>(age 95); and <em>Moore </em>(age 92). As the appellant tacitly acknowledges, age 67 is less than his average life expectancy. Therefore, his sentences only would amount to a <em>de facto </em>LWOP sentence if we were to adopt the reasoning of those courts that have held that <em>Graham </em>mandates not only that a juvenile nonhomicide offender be afforded an opportunity for release within his or her lifetime but also an \u201c \u2018opportunity to truly reenter society or have a[ ] meaningful life outside of prison.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>76 N.E.3d at 1146 (quoting <em>Casiano v. Comm\u2019r of Correction, </em>317 Conn. 52, 115 A.3d 1031 (2015)).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In discussing the harshness of a sentence of LWOP, the <em>Graham </em>Court emphasized that that sentence means the juvenile offender will \u201c \u2018remain in prison for the rest of his days,\u2019 \u201d 560 U.S. at 70, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (quoting <em>Naovarath, </em>779 P.2d at 944). The sentence is an \u201cirrevocable\u201d \u201cforfeiture\u201d of a juvenile offender\u2019s \u201cmost basic liberties without giving hope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>restoration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 130 S.Ct. 2011. The <em>Graham </em>Court clarified that while a state is not required to \u201cguarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonho-micide crime,\u201d it must grant him or her a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011. The Court did not specify when that opportunity must be conferred, instead giving deference to the states to fashion sentencing schemes that provide some opportunity for release. <em>See Virginia v. LeBlanc, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1726, 1727-29, 198 L.Ed.2d 186 (2017) (holding that the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s determination that its geriatric release program provided a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d for release was not \u201c \u2018contrary to ... clearly established federal law\" \u201d) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). Each 25-year sentence imposed against the appellant includes the benefit of parole when he has served half of his sentence. While the appellant might not be released during his lifetime, he will have the opportunity to apply for parole when he is 67, which we cannot say is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d language in <em>Graham. See Smith, </em>892 N.W.2d at 52 (sentence affording juvenile offender parole eligibility at age 62 satisfies <em>Graham </em>); <em>Lehmkuhl, </em>369 P.3d at 635 (parole eligibility at age 67 satisfies Graham).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">We now turn to the appellant\u2019s argument, premised largely upon the Fourth Circuit\u2019s since reversed decision in <em>LeBlanc, </em>that under no circumstance will he ever be afforded a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d for release under Maryland\u2019s parole system because that system does not treat maturity and rehabilitation as the dispositive factors for granting parole for juvenile offenders. We disagree with the State that this argument is not cognizable on a motion to correct an illegal sentence, but agree that it lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">CS section 7-305 lists ten factors that the Parole Commission shall consider in deciding whether to grant parole. They include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">(2) the physical, mental, and moral qualifications of the inmate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>(3) the progress of the inmate during confinement ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAQ0F\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">(5) whether there is reasonable probability that the inmate, if released on parole, will remain at liberty without violating the law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">(6) whether release of the inmate on parole is compatible with the welfare of society;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The COMAR regulations implementing CS section 7-305 go even further, requiring the Parole Commission to consider additional factors when a prisoner applying for parole \u201ccommitted [his or her] crime[s] as a juvenile.\u201d Those additional factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">(a) Age at the time the crime was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">(b) The individual\u2019s level of maturity and sense of responsibility at the time the crime was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">(c) Whether influence or pressure from other individuals contributed to the commission of the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">(d) Whether the prisoner\u2019s character developed since the time of the crime in a manner that indicates the prisoner will comply with the conditions of release;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-12\">(e) The home environment and family relationships at the time the crime was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">(f) The individual\u2019s educational background and achievement at the time the crime was committed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-14\">(g) Other factors or circumstances unique to prisoners who committed crimes at the time the individual was a juvenile that the Commissioner determines to be relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">COMAR 12.08.01.18A(3). These factors necessarily encompass the maturity and rehabilitation considerations discussed in Graham. There is nothing in <em>Graham </em>that suggests that they must be the <em>only </em>factors considered by a parole authority in deciding whether a juvenile offender will be released. <em>See Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 75, 130 S.Ct. 2011 (remarking that those who \u201ccommit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for the duration of their lives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Finally, we note that the appellant\u2019s sentences are not excessively disproportionate to the crimes he committed, under traditional proportionality review. \u201c[C]hallenges based on proportionality will be seriously entertained only where the punishment is truly egregious.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>333 Md. 84, 97, 634 A.2d 1 (1993). Here, the appellant and his accomplice shot a gun twelve times into a crowd of teenagers outside a high school, seriously injuring four victims, one of whom was left permanently paralyzed. He was convicted of four counts of first degree assault, one against each victim, and was sentenced to a 25-year term for each conviction. The sentencing court found that these sentences\u2014the maximum permitted by statute\u2014were warranted by the particularly heinous nature of the crimes. It noted that the gravity of the offenses was severe and the potential for much greater harm was high. The crime instilled fear in the community at large and had long-lasting repercussions for the victims and their families and friends. The sentences imposed were not egregious and do not give rise to an inference of gross disproportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Because the appellant\u2019s 100-year aggregate sentence does not fall within the categorical bar imposed by <em>Graham </em>and because the sentences are not otherwise unconstitutionally excessive relative to the crimes committed, they are not illegal as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment or Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The circuit court did not err by denying the appellant\u2019s motion to correct illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The Supreme Court of Virginia had held that the sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment because even though the sentence was without parole the defendant would be eligible for the state\u2019s geriatric release program, at age 60, and therefore would have a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d for release.

The court assumed that <em>Graham\u2019s </em>categorical rule would apply to the multiple sentences, but held that the sentence satisfied the \"meaningful opportunity\u201d requirement given that the defendant would be parole eligible at age 67. The Supreme Court of Colorado granted <em>certiorari </em>in that case, but the petition later was dismissed. <em>Lehmkuhl v. People, </em>2014 WL 7331019 (Colo. 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">.

The Supreme Court of Missouri also decided a second, related case that day: <em>State </em>v. <em>Nathan, </em>522 S.W.3d 881, 2017 WL 2952773 (Mo. 2017). The defendant was convicted of second degree murder and multiple nonhomicide crimes arising from a home invasion robbery and murder he committed when he was 16 years old. As modified on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>appeal, he was sentenced to four life terms, plus 45 years. He challenged those sentences as violative of <em>Graham </em>and <em>Miller. </em>The court rejected his argument, reasoning that <em>Graham </em>did not apply because the defendant was convicted of a homicide crime and <em>Miller </em>was inapplicable both because the court considered Nathan\u2019s age when imposing his sentences and because the sentences imposed were not mandatory and were not for LWOP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b758-12\">. Other state courts have held that <em>Miller </em>applies to lengthy term-of-years sentences imposed for <em>homicide </em>crimes committed by juvenile offenders that may exceed their natural life expectancy, thus entitling them to an individualized sentencing hearing. <em>See People v.

As discussed, <em>supra, </em>the Sixth Circuit rejected a Graham-based challenge to multiple term-of-years sentences resulting in an aggregate sentence that exceeded a juvenile offender's natural life expectancy, holding that an Ohio appellate court\u2019s affirmance of those sentences was not \"contrary to clearly established federal law.\u201d <em>See Bunch, </em>685 F.3d at 550.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\">. That legislation provided that, with certain exceptions not relevant here, a juvenile sentenced to a lengthy prison term shall \"receive[ ] a review hearing after a designated number of years based on the crime for which the juvenile was convicted to allow the sentencing court the discretion to modify the sentence if the juvenile offender has demonstrated sufficient maturity and reform.\" <em>Peterson v.

As discussed, in <em>Miller </em>the Supreme Court held that a juvenile <em>homicide </em>offender cannot be sentenced to a <em>mandatory </em>LWOP and that a sentencing court must take into account the juvenile\u2019s age and maturity in fashioning a sentence. Because one of the defendants was convicted of felony murder, the <em>Zuber </em>court frequently discussed <em>Miller </em>rather than <em>Graham.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">. <em>Caballero, supra, </em>had not yet been decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b769-5\">. This comment is not entirely accurate. In the section of <em>Graham </em>discussing the <em>Juvenile LWOP Study, </em>the Court referenced a May 4, 2010 article in <em>Tulsa World </em>stating that \"since the study was completed, a defendant in Oklahoma has apparently been sentenced to [LWOP] for a rape and stabbing he committed at the age of 16.\u201d 560 U.S. at 64, 130 S.Ct. 2011. This was the reference to Budder. Thus, Budder was included in the <em>Graham </em>Court\u2019s analysis because he was, in fact, serving a sentence (actually two) of LWOP at that time. As discussed, Budder's LWOP sentences were modified <em>after Graham </em>was decided, So, when Budder\u2019s appeal was before the Tenth Circuit, he no longer was in the category of juvenile offenders sentenced to LWOP that he had been in when <em>Graham </em>was decided. The <em>Graham </em>Court did not include Budder in its analysis because he was serving multiple term-of-years sentences that could exceed his life expectancy but because, at that time, he was serving an actual LWOP sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\">.

We disagree with those courts that have stated that because Graham was convicted of crimes in addition to armed robbery, the Supreme Court was addressing multiple conviction sentences. The only sentence that was under consideration in <em>Graham </em>was the sentence of life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>imprisonment for armed robbery; and the sentence clearly was for LWOP because, as we have stated, the sentencing court knew there was no parole system in place when the sentence was imposed,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">. Table A of the Juvenile LWOP Study lists the number of juveniles serving LWOP sentences for nonhomicide crimes in each State for which data was available in 2009. The number of juveniles serving such a sentence in Maryland was zero. At that time, the appellant was in prison serving the sentences in question here, so his multiple-conviction multiple term-of-years sentence obviously was not considered. Neither were the sentences in <em>Lucero </em>and <em>Rainer, </em>as the list gives the number of juvenile lifers in Colorado as zero.

The Tenth Circuit ruled that the sentence was not cruel and unusual despite the defendant's age at the time of the commission of the crimes (13), reasoning, in part, that the length of the sentence would be reduced significantly by good time credits resulting in an active sentence of just over 35 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. The appellant includes in his brief a long passage from the Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision in <em>Casiano, </em>115 A.3d 1044, discussing the fact that while, at the time, the average life expectancy for a male in the United States in 2015 was 76, people living in prison have a reduced life expectancy. The <em>Casiano </em>court reasoned that a lengthy term-of-years sentence that does not exceed a juvenile offender's life expectancy but results in the loss of opportunities to integrate into society is infirm under <em>Graham </em>and <em>Miller. </em>In the case at bar, no evidence bearing on the appellant\u2019s life expectancy was included with his motion to correct illegal sentence, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\">. The \"cruel or unusual punishments\u201d clause of Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights has long been construed to have the same meaning as the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Thomas, </em>333 Md. at 103 n.5, 634 A.2d 1 (\"[W]e perceive no difference between the protection afforded by [the Eighth Amendment] and by the 25th Article of our Declaration of Rights\u201d); <em>Walker v.

Accordingly, there is no basis for the appellant\u2019s argument that he is afforded greater protections by Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights than by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
