(collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d), were brought to Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cAppellee\u201d or the \u201cHospital\u201d) on separate occasions for emergency mental health evaluations to determine whether each should be admitted for involuntary psychiatric treatment. Each Appellant was afforded a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), during which their counsel argued for their release on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ground that the Hospital failed to comply in various respects with the preadmission procedures set out in Maryland Code (1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.), Health-General Article (\u201cHealth-Gen\u201d), \u00a7 10-601 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>pach ALJ concluded the evidence established that Appellants qualified for involuntary admission to the Hospital\u2019s inpatient psychiatric unit in accordance with Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e), and that none of the alleged pread-mission procedure violations warranted Appellants\u2019 release.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Counsel filed a petition for judicial review for each Appellant and a motion to consolidate their cases in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The circuit court granted the motions to consolidate and, after argument, affirmed the ALJs\u2019 decisions with respect to each Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Before this Court, Appellants challenge the ALJs\u2019 decisions and present issues<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> derivative of one overarching question: During involuntary admission hearings are hospitals required to affirmatively prove compliance with preadmission proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>dures beyond the statutorily prescribed involuntary admission elements contained in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decisions ordering the involuntary admission of each Appellant. We hold that at an involuntary admission hearing, the Hospital has the burden to prove the involuntary admission elements enumerated in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e) by clear and convincing evidence, and that the patient has the burden, pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.21.01.09G(2), to raise with particularity any alleged violations of preadmission procedures. Once raised, the burden shifts to the Hospital to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, its compliance with the particular procedural violations raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A. Involuntary Admission Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The following is a summary of the testimony presented at each hearing and the ALJ\u2019s findings as to each Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">1. J.H.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Before J.H. was involuntarily admitted into the psychiatric unit at the Hospital, she lived with her daughter, K.H., and her two-year-old granddaughter, K.H testified that she witnessed her mother\u2019s ability to care for herself decline over the last several years. J.H. was not taking her medications for her psychiatric and other medical conditions, and refused to attend scheduled doctors\u2019 appointments. After her mother became \u201cvery aggressive and verbally abusive,\u201d K.H. filed a petition for the emergency evaluation of J.H. on September 2, 2015. That same day, the police brought J.H. to the Hospital\u2019s emergency room for evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">On September 16, 2015, an ALJ held an involuntary admission hearing for J.H, At the outset of the hearing, J.H.\u2019s counsel stated that he \u201c[would] be bringing up that the notice of admission status and the detention in the emergency room both exceeded the time limits[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Dr. Prasad, J.H.\u2019s treating physician, testified for the Hospital. In regard to J.H.\u2019s eligibility for admission under Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2)(i)-(v)\u2014the controlling statute in this case\u2014Dr. Prasad testified that J.H. has been diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia, diabetes, and hypertension. She had been admitted to the Hospital several times during the year- and-a-half prior to the hearing. He explained that upon discharge, J.H. would refuse to comply with her treatment regimen of psychiatric medication and outpatient care, resulting in her readmission. J.H. failed to maintain her personal hygiene, often stayed in bed, and only occasionally ate meals. Dr. Prasad presented J.H. with the option to voluntarily admit herself, but she refused because she' was unable to \u201cappreciate! ] the nature of her mental illness and need for current treatment.\u201d He testified that J.H. also refused to accept outpatient treatment for her mental illness and medical conditions, which, if left untreated, posed a considerable threat to her health. In Dr. Prasad\u2019s professional opinion, J.H. needed institutional care and there was no less restrictive treatment available for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Next, Dr. Prasad testified that J.H. was certified by two physicians and given notice of her admission status. He did not know how long J.H. waited in the emergency room and said that he would need to \u201clook in the record\u201d for that information. Neither counsel revisited this open issue. In fact, on cross-examination, J.H.\u2019s counsel asked only one question: \u201cHow did my client get to the hospital, Doctor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">K.H. testified that she could not provide the care J.H. required and that J.H. could no longer live with her. K.H. also raised a concern regarding her two-year-old daughter\u2019s safety, referencing J.H.\u2019s cavalier attitude toward storing and disposing of her prescription medications in places accessible by the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">After the conclusion of the Hospital\u2019s case, J.H\u2019s counsel moved to have her released. He alleged that J.H.\u2019s involuntary admission hearing was not conducted within 10 days of J.H.\u2019s initial confinement. He also stated that the Hospital failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>demonstrate when the certifications were completed, or when the Hospital gave J.H. notice of her admission status, or how long J.H. was in the emergency room. Because the Hospital failed to comply with the applicable preadmission procedures, counsel for J.H. argued the ALJ was deprived of jurisdiction to conduct the involuntary admission hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The ALJ denied J.H.\u2019s motion for release, finding that although \u201cthe time periods aren\u2019t really crystal clear ... [J.H.] is having her hearing in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">J.H. was the only witness offered in support of her case. J.H. testified that she intended to continue with her outpatient psychiatric and medical treatment, but she no longer required medication for schizophrenia or diabetes. Her primary reason for no longer taking Haldol\u2014a prescription for schizophrenia\u2014was the unpleasant side-effects. As for the medication for her other medical conditions, J.H. said she no longer had diabetes or high blood pressure because \u201c[she] lost about 79 pounds and that put [her] sugar right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With respect to the alleged preadmission procedure violations, the ALJ declined to make a finding on J.H.\u2019s admission date because \u201c[h]er admission date wasn\u2019t testified to[.]\u201d Then the ALJ made express findings for each involuntary admission element the Hospital is required to prove pursuant to Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2)(i)-(v).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, the ALJ found that J.H. \u201chas a mental disorder diagnosed as schizophrenia chronic.\u201d Second, the ALJ determined that J.H. requires inpatient care and treatment. Regarding the third element, the ALJ found that although J.H. \u201cis mentally ill and unpredictable, [ ] she hasn\u2019t really done anything to anybody ... that would make her dangerous to others.\u201d But he did find that she posed a danger to herself, reasoning that he did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>... believe the patient\u2019s testimony that she is no longer diabetic. Her daughter testified that she has chronic kidney disease, which is often caused by diabetes. She also has hypertension, and the diabetes, both of which ... can kill you if they\u2019re not controlled and treated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">Not bathing, not eating, the patient doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s starving, but ... not taking your medication for medical conditions, thinking that you don\u2019t have these medical conditions, which are serious and life threatening, does threaten your own life and safety and it\u2019s caused by [J.H.\u2019s] mental illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Fourth, he concluded that J.H. was \u201cunwilling and unable to be voluntarily admitted.\u201d Lastly, the ALJ reasoned that \u201cthere [wa]s no less restrictive form of intervention for her [based on] Dr. Prasad\u2019s testimony about her continued history of being discharged and not taking medication and relapsing.\u201d After reciting his findings, the ALJ ordered the involuntary admission of J.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">2. C.B.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Before G.B. was involuntarily admitted into the psychiatric unit at the Hospital on September 12, 2015, she lived alone. A.B., her father, testified that although he and her mother helped C.B. with cutting the grass and grocery shopping, C.B. was not able to maintain the cleanliness of her home. On one visit, A.B. noticed that dirt was visible on the floors and the kitchen sink was clogged and the \u201cwater smell[ed] like it [had] been in there for three months.\u201d A.B. became increasingly concerned for his daughter\u2019s wellbeing after one shopping trip she went on with her mother. Apparently C.B. opened the car door while the car was moving and got out. A.B. also explained that one grocery store banned C.B. for three years after an incident in which she became verbally aggressive with other store patrons. After observing C.B.\u2019s \u201cgradual deterioration,\u201d C.B.\u2019s parents filed a petition for emergency evaluation on September 11, 2015, and brought her to the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On September 16, 2015, an ALJ held an involuntary admission hearing to determine whether C.B. should be involuntari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ly admitted for psychiatric treatment. C.B. was not present at the hearing. At the outset of the hearing, C.B.\u2019s counsel requested her release, vaguely asserting there was an error in the emergency petition and notice of admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The Hospital called as its witnesses Dr. Mirmirani, director of psychiatric services and C.B.\u2019s treating physician, and A.B. Dr. Mirmirani testified to the circumstances of C.B.\u2019s admission and emergency evaluation. When evaluating C.B., Dr. Mirmirani was not able to have a meaningful conversation with C.B. regarding voluntary admission because \u201cshe [wa]s very psychotic, very preoccupied, refused to engage in conversation[,]\u201d and \u201cshe has ... no insight, very poor judgment about her psychiatric condition[.]\u201d Dr. Mirmirani confirmed that two physicians signed the certification and that C.B. was notified of her rights and refused to sign the consent as reflected in the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[By counsel]: ... Before you is the petition for emergency evaluation filed by [C.B.\u2019s] father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">Dr. Mirmirani: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">[By counsel]: And the date of that petition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">Dr. Mirmirani: Is 9/11/2015,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">[By counsel]: Okay. Does the record reflect that she was given her notification of admission status and rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">Dr. Mirmirani: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">[By counsel]: Did she sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">Dr. Mirmirani: She refused to sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">[By counsel]: Thank you. Could you please read what\u2014 what it says? What the completer of this document had [sic] wrote?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">Dr. Mirmirani: Yes. She said she refused, is paranoid, and she \u201csaid she was tricked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">* \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">[By counsel]: Does the record reflect that two qualifying physicians did the certifications for [C.B.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-17\">Dr. Mirmirani: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>[By counsel]: Was [C.B.] given her notice of hearing today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">Dr. Mirmirani: Yes. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">[By counsel]: Does the record reflect that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Dr. Mirmirani: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Dr. Mirmirani then testified to the Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2)(i)-(v) involuntary admission elements. Dr. Mirmirani indicated that C.B, was diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. Dr. Mirmirani prescribed anti-psychotic medication to C.B., but she refused to take the medication. He testified that C.B. \u201cwalk[s] around ... talking to herself\u2019 and is \u201cunder the influence of internal stimuli ... which is a psychotic process that she\u2019s responding [to] and ... [she] continues to be psychotic.\u201d Although she had wandered to the neighbor\u2019s home and the shopping center and caused a disturbance, Dr, Mirmirani testified that he did not believe C.B. presented a risk to others. However, Dr. Mirmirani opined that C.B. was a danger to herself because she had lost a lot of weight, was not eating, and was preoccupied with her \u201cinternal psychotic process.\u201d He also opined that C.B. required institutional treatment because she was not caring for herself and her psychosis rendered her \u201cincapable of even believing that she has mental illness and needs treatment.\u201d Based on C.B.\u2019s six or seven year history of mental illness and severe psychosis, Dr. Mirmi-rani testified that there was no less restrictive alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">On cross-examination, C.B.\u2019s counsel inquired into the alleged procedural error in the petition filed by C.B.\u2019s father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">[C.B.\u2019s counsel]: Doctor, you mentioned there\u2019s an emergency petition. The question number 10 on the emergency petition which says the petitioner or the person to be evaluated is a danger. What does it say as to what her danger is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">Dr. Mirmirani: Well, it says she\u2019s disturbing the neighbors\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">[C.B.\u2019s counsel]: Is that number 9, Doctor, or is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">Dr. Mirmirani: Number 10, I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>[C.B.\u2019s counsel]: Number 10, her dangerousness, it says is not applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">Dr. Mirmirani: Not applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">C.B.\u2019s counsel then asked a set of questions, presumably to show that C.B.\u2019s name and status did not appear on the notice of admission status form. Dr. Mirmirani clarified on redirect, however, that the patient\u2019s first name was at the end of the notice of admission status form, where, below the nurse\u2019s signature it read \u201cI certified that I have informed [C.B.] of his or her admission status and rights [in] accordance with the provision of Health General Article 10 and Criminal Procedure Article, Notice of Admission.\u201d During the hearing, C.B.\u2019s father also testified that his daughter posed a danger to herself and others, and the \u201cnot applicable\u201d \u201ccould have been a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">After the close of the Hospital\u2019s case, C.B.\u2019s counsel did not call any witnesses and proceeded directly to closing arguments. C.B.\u2019s counsel demanded C.B.\u2019s release, reasserting that there was an error in the emergency petition because it did not state how C.B. was a danger to others, and alleging generally that the Hospital did not prove compliance with all relevant preadmission procedures. He also argued, for the first time, that there was no evidence that the petition had been presented to a judge, or that Dr. Mirmirani saw C.B. within 48 hours of her admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The ALJ denied C.B.\u2019s motion for release, finding that the Hospital demonstrated that the proper procedures were followed. The ALJ noted that no one from the patient\u2019s side testified to any alleged errors, and that \u201cif the patient wishes to challenge [the Hospital\u2019s compliance with preadmission procedures], it\u2019s up to the patient to present evidence that the procedures were not, in fact, followed and that the error was of severe magnitude to require release because no other remedy would be sufficient and that has not been done in this case.\u201d With respect to the alleged error in the petition, the ALJ determined the error did not require C.B.\u2019s release because the petition was completed by A.B. and noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201cI\u2019m willing to assume that [the petition] was summoned by a judge because [A.B.] doesn\u2019t have any authority to [ ] have the police or the sheriff pick up his daughter off the street and bring her into\u2014to an emergency room for evaluation. When a civilian fills out that petition, the court has to approve it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Next, the ALJ made express findings for each involuntary admission element enumerated in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2)(i)-(v). First, the ALJ found that C.B has chronic schizophrenia. Then, he determined that C.B. required institutional care and treatment. With respect to the third element, the ALJ found that C.B. was a danger to herself because of her inability to care for herself, and because she \u201cgot out of a moving car\u201d and was so \u201cdisruptive and hostile\u201d that a grocery store banned her. Fourth, he concluded that C.B \u201cis unwilling to be voluntarily admitted.\u201d Lastly, the ALJ determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0L\">there is no less restrictive form of intervention that\u2019s available for her that\u2019s consistent with her welfare because she does not cooperate with mental health professionals] except when she\u2019s forced to in a hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">Dr. Mirmirani said his plan is to take her to a clinical review panel and have her involuntarily medicated if necessary. [A.B.] testified that she hasn\u2019t seen an outpatient psychiatrist or taken her medications in the last six months at least and certainly she has decompensated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">After reciting his findings, the ALJ ordered the involuntary admission of C.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">3. M.G.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">A police officer found M.G. on the street, walking shoeless in traffic. She appeared confused and was almost hit by a car, The officer brought M.G. to the emergency room of the Hospital and filed an emergency petition for M.G.\u2019s involuntary admission in September 2015.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 16, 2015, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ALJ held an involuntary admission hearing for M.G. In his opening statement, M.G.\u2019s counsel alleged the Hospital violated the preadmission procedures by keeping M.G. in the emergency room for 41 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The Hospital called Dr. Mirmirani, the director of psychiatric services and M.G.\u2019s treating physician, as its only witness. Dr. Mirmirani diagnosed M.G. with substance-induced psychosis <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and psychotic chronic mental illness. M.G. may have had an additional mental illness, according to Dr. Mirmirani, however, M.G. was unable to relate her medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On admission, M.G. was psychotic and agitated. The Hospital staff had to restrain M.G. and administer medication intramuscularly. On the day of the hearing, M.G. was still experiencing psychosis but had agreed to voluntarily take the prescribed antipsychotic medication. Despite M.G.\u2019s improvement\u2014resulting from the medication and treatment\u2014Dr. Mir-mirani testified that M.G. did not agree to voluntarily admit herself and that she \u201c[had] very poor judgment about the need for psychiatric care at this time.\u201d Dr. Mirmirani testified that M.G. was a threat to her own safety because the officer found her incoherent, walking in the street and that she was still experiencing psychosis at the time of the hearing. He opined that M.G. requires institutional care and treatment for daily monitoring to stabilize her psychosis and to accurately diagnose her additional mental illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">M.G.\u2019s counsel did not call any witnesses, moved to release M.G., and argued in closing that M.G.\u2019s time in the emergency room exceeded the statutorily prescribed time, and \u201c[t]here\u2019s no evidence that [M.G.] ... was ever certified here, whether [M.G.] was ever given notice of her admission status, [and notice] of this hearing.\u201d Maintaining that the preadmission procedures are jurisdictional, M.G.\u2019s counsel argued that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>must be released unless the Hospital could demonstrate that it complied with the preadmission procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The ALJ agreed that the Hospital did not present evidence regarding the procedural issues. Caught off-guard by M.G.\u2019s procedural error arguments, the Hospital\u2019s counsel requested clarification on the specific procedural issues. A lengthy colloquy then ensued between the parties and the ALJ. The ALJ reiterated his prior conclusion that the Hospital did not present evidence regarding the procedural issues, which \u201care affirmative obligations by ... the Hospital.\u201d The ALJ told the Hospital that the procedural issues \u201care necessary to make a case for me to find that the patient needs to stay here. Anyone can testify to that effect, but I think you need to alert your witnesses that those items are necessary.\u201d Acknowledging that the law and medicine dictated conflicting outcomes, the ALJ explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">I can\u2019t really have the Hospital reopen their case because [M.G.] didn\u2019t present a case. [She] just presented argument. [She] didn\u2019t present any evidence, so there\u2019s no evidence for the Hospital to rebut. So, legally, I must find that [M.G.\u2019s counsel] is correct that the necessary procedures have not been shown to have been followed, and that [M.G.] is entitled to be discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The Hospital\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that \u201c[M.G.] clearly is not in any condition to leave the hospital at this time[.]\u201d The ALJ then determined that \u201c[t]he only remedy that [he] could grant would be to allow the Hospital to reopen their case and present that evidence.\u201d The ALJ permitted the Hospital to continue its direct examination of Dr. Mirmirani on the limited issue of \u201chow [M.G.] came to be admitted,\u201d reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acc-dedup-0\">[M.G.] raises a preliminary issue, the amount of time that she allegedly spent in the emergency room. It\u2019s not up to the Hospital to rebut that point during your case in chief. That\u2019s an affirmative defense, if you will, by which [M.G.] could move for release based on being outside the statutory limits in the emergency room. So, I don\u2019t fault the Hospital for not addressing that during their presentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>As an administrative law judge, my function is basically to try to dispense low level justice and do the best for all the parties. I don\u2019t think it would be good for either the patient or the hospital to discharge her based on the possible technical deficiency and the hospital\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">... I\u2019ll allow [the Hospital] to reopen [its] case if you want to recall Dr. Mirmirani on the issue of how [M.G.] came to be admitted here to this unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">... I\u2019ll allow cross examination to include the issue of how [M.G.] came to the emergency room and how long she was there before she was transferred. I can only assume that those answers are in the medical records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Hospital\u2019s counsel then recalled Dr. Mirmirani, who explained that the Hospital\u2019s emergency room differed from others in that it had a two-step process. The first step is triage and initial assessment by an emergency room physician in the main emergency room. The second step is a 28-hour stabilization unit where the patient is treated by a psychiatrist. In M.G.\u2019s case, she was treated by both an emergency room physician and Dr. Ganjoo, a psychiatrist. Dr. Mirmirani was not able to testify to the length of M.G.\u2019s stay in either the first or second step.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Each party then presented closing arguments. M.G.\u2019s counsel reiterated that the ALJ should grant M.G.\u2019s release because of preadmission procedural errors\u2014the length of stay and the notice of admission. After closing arguments, the ALJ denied M.G.\u2019s motion for release, finding that procedural deficiencies were not \u201cprejudicial to [M.G.] \u201d and did not require her release. Addressing the primary violation\u2014that [M.G.] was in the emergency room allegedly for 41 hours\u2014the ALJ found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">Dr. Mirmirani testified about the uniqueness of this hospital\u2019s emergency room, having a 23-hour stabilization bed where [M.G.] apparently spent some time. That doesn\u2019t really circumvent the necessity of getting the patient out of the emergency room if she\u2019s going to be admitted to a psychiatric unit. But it does show that she\u2014even if she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>in that unit for 41 hours, which is not really established by any evidence, she hasn\u2019t been prejudiced by it, nor has she been prejudiced by any possible failure to inform her of her admission status or her rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">As I said, she is represented. She is here at the hearing. She has the same outlook as far as being released or retained as she would have if all those procedures were followed. I\u2019m not sure that they weren\u2019t followed. So, I do not grant the motion for release based on any procedural errors. So, I find that any procedural errors, if there were any, are not of such magnitude as to require the patient\u2019s release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">(Emphasis added). Then the ALJ made express findings pertaining to each involuntary admission element enumerated in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10\u2014632(e)(2)(i)-(v). First, the ALJ found that M.G. had \u201csubstance abuse psychosis with possible underlying schizophrenia.\u201d Second, the ALJ determined that M.G. required inpatient care and treatment. Third, the ALJ concluded that M.G. was a danger to herself because, among other reasons, an officer found her walking in traffic unaware of her surroundings. Fourth, he concluded that M.G. was unwilling and unable to be voluntarily admitted. Lastly, the ALJ determined that there was no available less restrictive form of intervention because M.G. was still psychotic and she lacked insight and judgment. After announcing his findings, the ALJ ordered the involuntary admission of M.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">4. B.N.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">B.N.\u2019s family member petitioned for her emergency evaluation on December 30, 2015. On January 13, 2016, an ALJ held an involuntary admission hearing. This time, as a preliminary matter, B.N.\u2019s counsel asserted his argument that the Hospital had the burden of proof to establish compliance with the preadmission procedures in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-601 <em>et seq. </em>before the parties could address the merits (the five elements enumerated in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2)). The Hospital\u2019s position was that it bore the burden of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, to establish the five elements contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Health-Gen. \u00a7 10\u2014632(e)(2), but neither the statute nor the corresponding regulation placed the burden on the Hospital to establish compliance with the preadmission procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The ALJ reviewed the applicable regulations and determined that COMAR 10.21.01.09G is silent as to which party-bears the burden of proof as to the preadmission procedures and the applicable evidentiary standard for proving whether the Hospital followed those procedures (i.e., by clear and convincing evidence or by a preponderance of the evidence). Without placing the burden of proof on either party or articulating the applicable evidentiary standard, the ALJ then requested that the Hospital present testimony regarding the preadmission procedures followed by the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Hospital called its only witness, Dr. Maddineni, B.N.\u2019s treating physician and a board certified doctor in the field of psychiatry. He testified that B.N.\u2019s family member petitioned for her emergency evaluation on December 80, 2015, and that she was brought to the Hospital on January 1, 2016. B.N. was evaluated in the emergency room on the same day at 11:30 a.m. After she was medically cleared in the emergency room, B.N. was transferred to the Assessment Stabilization Center (\u201cASC\u201d), which is part of the psychiatric emergency room. On January 2, 2016, Dr. Rahman evaluated B.N, and determined that she qualified for involuntary admission. Dr. Rahman took the steps to transfer B.N. to the inpatient unit on January 2, 2016; however, there were no available inpatient beds at the Hospital or any nearby facilities. B.N. remained in the ASC until she was admitted to the inpatient unit on January 4, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In regard to the prerequisites in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2), Dr. Maddineni testified that B.N. was presenting manic symptoms\u2014rapid speech, flood of ideas, extremely disorganized, irritable, agitated, and insomnia\u2014and psychotic symptoms\u2014hearing voices, actively hallucinating, paranoid delusions, and religious delusions. For example, B.N. had the delusion that \u201cGod healed her of all medical and psychological problems\u201d including her HIV, hypertension, and bipolar disor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>der such that she no longer requires medication. Because of these symptoms, Dr. Maddineni opined that B.N. needed inpatient treatment. Dr. Maddineni testified that B.N.\u2019s failure to manage her HIV and hypertension with medication could result in contracting AIDS, or an increased opportunity for infections, a stroke, or organ failure. B.N. was not voluntarily taking her medication and was not cooperating with treatment. Additionally, Dr. Maddineni testified to an instance on January 8, 2016, in which B.N. required involuntary medication because she became agitated, hallucinated, invaded the personal space of other patients and staff, and accused other patients and staff of trying to harm her. In addition to being a danger to herself, Dr. Maddineni testified that B.N. threatened other patients and staff. In Dr. Maddineni\u2019s opinion, there was no less restrictive form of psychiatric care appropriate for B.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">After the Hospital rested its case, B.N.\u2019s counsel moved for B.N.\u2019s release, reiterating that there were preadmission procedure violations, including \u201cthere was no indication [B.N.] was given her notice of admission status [and] no indication [B.N.] was ever given her notice of the hearing.\u201d Further, B.N.\u2019s counsel argued that B.N. had remained in the emergency room for 75 or 76 hours. The ALJ then permitted the Hospital to reopen its case to conduct a re-direct examination of Dr. Maddineni.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On re-direct, Dr. Maddineni testified that the Hospital completed the application for involuntary admission on January 4, 2016; that the application provided B.N. with notice of a hearing; and that the Hospital gave B.N. the notice on January 4, 2016. At the completion of this redirect testimony, counsel for the Hospital asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">[Hospital\u2019s Counsel:] Your Honor, are there any other items that we need to address procedurally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">Judge; Any questions from the doctor on\u2014based on that testimony, [counsel for B.N.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">[B.N.\u2019s Counsel:] No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The only witness who testified in B.N.\u2019s case was B.N. herself. She testified that she was not a danger to herself or others; and that she \u201cis not a psychiatric patient\u201d and she \u201c[doesn\u2019t] have problems like [schizophrenia].\u201d B.N.\u2019s counsel proceeded to raise, through argument, additional procedural violations not raised earlier in the hearing without asking his witness or the Hospital\u2019s witness, Dr. Maddineni, any questions about the alleged violations. He argued that Dr. Maddi-neni\u2019s testimony did not establish that B.N. was evaluated within six hours of admission as required by Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-624(b)(2). He also asserted that B.N.\u2019s hearing was not held within the 10-day statutory period because she was brought to the hospital on January 1, 2016, for an emergency evaluation, and that the hearing was held on January 13, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ announced his findings, determining that there were no procedural violations and that all of the conditions for admission were met by clear and convincing evidence. With respect to the procedural violations raised by B.N.\u2019s counsel, the ALJ found that although B.N. spent 75-76 hours in the emergency room\u2014well in excess of the 30-hour statutory limit\u2014the violation did not warrant release because there was \u201cno other available space in any other hospitals for her.\u201d Regarding the 10-day hearing requirement, the ALJ found that B.N.\u2019s hearing occurred within the 10-day statutory requirement because although B.N. was brought to the inpatient unit for emergency evaluation on January 1, after 75-76 hours she was admitted to the Hospital on January 4, and the hearing was held on January 13, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">On the merits, the ALJ made express findings on each element contained in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2) that: 1) B.N. had schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; 2) B.N. required inpatient care and treatment; 3) there was no less restrictive form of intervention because B.N. would not seek out mental health care or take medication on her own, 4) B.N. was unwilling to voluntarily admit herself; and 5) B.N. was a danger to herself because of her inability to sleep and seek treatment. He found that she was possibly a danger to others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>because of her manic and agitated behavior. The ALJ then ordered the involuntary admission of B.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">B. Judicial Review in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On September 28, 2015, J.H., C.B., and M.G. separately petitioned the circuit court for judicial review and jointly filed a motion to consolidate their cases on November 19, 2015. The Hospital consented to the consolidation, which the circuit court granted on December 7, 2015. On January 19, 2016, B.N. petitioned the circuit court for judicial review. B.N.\u2019s counsel\u2014who represented all Appellants during their involuntary review hearings\u2014moved to join the consolidated cases on February 2, 2016, and the circuit court granted this motion on February 28, 2016.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">After hearing argument on March 16, 2016, the circuit court issued its memorandum opinion and order affirming the ALJ\u2019s determinations in each case on June 14, 2016. The circuit court concluded that during the involuntary admission hearings, the Hospital was only required to prove the relevant Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-682 elements because \u201c[njeither [Health-Gen.] \u00a7 10-632 nor COMAR 10.21.01.09 mention that the facility has a burden to produce evidence of procedural compliance with any other conditions.\u201d The circuit court also concluded that COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3) \u201caffirmatively placed the burden of production on the individual patient to raise the issue and produce evidence of a substantial procedural error.\u201d Although the circuit court noted that Appellants\u2019 counsel \u201cbroadly raised the possibility of numerous procedural errors,\u201d counsel failed to \u201cprovide evidence to establish exactly what, if any, procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>errors actually occurred that required [Appellants\u2019] release.\u201d The order was docketed on June 22, 2016,</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Appellants noted their timely appeal on July 11, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Appellants contend that the ALJ erred by ordering the involuntary admission of Appellants without first finding that the Hospital complied with the preadmission procedures contained in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-601 <em>et seq. </em>Appellants\u2019 argument, reframed for clarity, is that the preadmission procedures are procedural safeguards, such that noncompliance results in \u201ca substantial deprivation of due process\u201d prohibiting involuntary admission. Appellants assert that establishing the Hospital\u2019s compliance with the preadmission procedures is a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite.\u201d The Hospital counters that a plain reading of the involuntary admission statute indicates that a hospital is required to prove only the elements enumerated in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Whether hospitals are required to affirmatively prove compliance with preadmission procedures during involuntary admission hearings presents a novel question. Before we undertake an analysis of Title 10, Subtitle 6 of the Health General Article and its concomitant regulations, we consider the history that culminated in their passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">A. The Evolution of Law on Involuntary Admission in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">During the 1960s and 1970s, the purpose of involuntary commitment changed from \u201cachieving social control by compelling treatment\u201d to an emphasis on individuals\u2019 constitutionally protected right to liberty. Donald H. J. Hermann, <em>Barriers to Providing Effective Treatment: A Critique of Revisions in Procedural, Substantive, and Dispositional Criteria in Involuntary Civil Commitment, </em>39 Vand. L. Rev. 83, 85 (1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The shift toward protecting the constitutional rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>individuals facing involuntary commitment is reflected, for example, in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 1967 in <em>Specht v. Patterson, </em>386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967). The <em>Specht </em>case involved a petitioner who had been convicted for indecent liberties under one Colorado statute that carried a maximum sentence of 10 years, but who was then committed under another Colorado sex offender statute for an indeterminate term of \u201cfrom one day to life\u201d without notice and full hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 87 S.Ct. 1209. Specht filed a writ of habeas corpus, which was dismissed by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court reversed, recognizing that \u201c[t]hese commitment proceedings whether denominated civil or criminal are subject both to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... and to the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 87 S.Ct. 1209 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">In 1975, the Supreme Court considered an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by Mr. Donaldson, who, at the initiation of \u201chis father, who thought that his son was suffering from \u2018delusions,\u2019 \u201d was confined as a mental patient in a Florida State Hospital in 1957 and kept in custody there against his will for nearly 15 years. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563, 564-66, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975). Throughout his confinement Mr. Donaldson repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, demanded his release. <em>Id. </em>Donaldson\u2019s challenge was not to the initial commitment, but instead, focused upon the nearly 15 years of confinement that followed. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 95 S.Ct. 2486. A jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida found that O\u2019Connor, the hospital superintendent, and others, violated Mr. Donaldson\u2019s constitutional right to freedom and the Court of Appeals affirmed. In the Supreme Court, Justice Stewart writing for the majority queried, \u201cmay the State fence in the harmless mentally ill solely to save its citizens from exposure to those whose ways are different? One might as well ask if the State, to avoid public unease, could incarcerate all who are physically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>unattractive or socially eccentric.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 95 S.Ct. 2486. The Court held that \u201cmere public intolerance or animosity cannot constitutionally justify the deprivation of a person\u2019s physical liberty.... In short, a State cannot constitutionally confine without more a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 95 S.Ct. 2486.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In Maryland, the development of the right to procedural due process for persons involuntarily committed occurred during the 1970s and the early 1980s. Prior to this change in the law, regulations did not provide, for example, for mandatory involuntary admission hearings before patients were formally admitted to inpatient psychiatric facilities. <em>See </em>Neil Solomon, <em>Involuntary Commitment and Due Process: The New Maryland Regulations, </em>8 Md. L. P. 115, 115-16 (1973) [hereinafter Solomon, Involuntary Commitment].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, Maryland employed an <em>ex parte </em>commitment procedure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before he became a judge, then-practicing attorney Howard S. Cha-sanow commented a decade before the law finally changed in Maryland, that Maryland \u201cpermit[ted] an indeterminate commitment without a judicial hearing[,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he problem of hospitalization of the mentally ill is one that is ever growing in scope, and because of its magnitude, should be of vital interest to doctors and lawyers as well as the general public.\u201d Howard Chasanow, <em>Civil and Criminal Commitment of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Mentally III in Maryland, </em>21 Md. L. Rev. 279, 279, 281 (1961). Chasanow acknowledged that the primary criticism of <em>ex parte </em>commitment procedures was \u201cthat they [we]re unconstitutional as violative of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282-84. Although he ultimately concluded in that article that Maryland\u2019s involuntary commitment laws were adequate to protect the rights of patients, he foreshadowed the need to promulgate the very regulations at issue in this appeal, observing that Maryland should develop \u201csome type of emergency commitment procedure for those in need of immediate treatment but who do not submit to examination at the request of near relatives or friends[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>A class action filed in the United States District Court of Maryland in 1970 while Neil Solomon served as Secretary of DHMH precipitated the ensuing regulatory reforms. <em>Anderson v. Solomon, </em>315 F.Supp. 1192 (D. Md. 1970); <em>see </em>Solomon, Involuntary Commitment, <em>supra, </em>at 116. In <em>Anderson, </em>a class of patients involuntarily admitted to state mental institutions challenged the constitutionality of the involuntary commitment statute (then codified at Article 59, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13), that permitted their involuntary admission without a hearing or any due process of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1193. The State moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the General Assembly had enacted recent changes to Article 59 effective July 1, 1970. <em>Id. </em>Acknowledging that Article 59 had been completely rewritten <em>(see </em>1970 Md. Laws, ch. 407 (S.B. 210)), the Court denied the motion to dismiss, reasoning that the allegations in the complaint were still applicable to the revised law. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that a \u201cparticularly serious constitutional question [was] raised by those provisions in both the old and the revised law which permit the involuntary commitment of persons for an indefinite period on the certificate of two physicians, without a prior judicial or administrative hearing, or a mandatory subsequent judicial or administrative hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1194 (footnote omitted). The Court then identified the statutory provisions, which raised constitutional concerns. <em>Id. </em>First, the revised statute \u201cd[id] not provide for a mandatory hearing, at any time, for persons who have been involuntarily committed[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court opined that \u201c[i]t can hardly be doubted that procedural due process requires that a hearing be held at some reasonable point in time before a person can be indeterminately committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Second, it \u201cd[id] not require that a check be made by an independent agency (legal, medical or administrative) charged with the duty of looking out for the interests of patients unable for one reason or another to institute and prosecute such proceedings as necessary to protect their rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, the revised statute limited involuntary admission to people requiring treatment for the protection of themselves or another, but the statute did not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>physicians\u2019 certification to include that determination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The <em>Anderson </em>class-action suit prompted the Office of the Attorney General to conduct a study of Maryland\u2019s existing involuntary civil commitment procedures. Solomon, Involuntary Commitment, <em>supra, </em>at 116. According to Solomon\u2019s article, the Office of the Attorney General concluded that Maryland\u2019s involuntary commitment law was likely unconstitutional and the law should be updated to \u201cafford greater protection\u201d to involuntarily admitted patients. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Following <em>Anderson, </em>Maryland\u2019s involuntary admission procedures first appeared as regulations published by DHMH.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The regulations were signed on June 12, 1973, and became effective October 1, 1973.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A primary focus in revising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>involuntary admission regulations was creating procedures to protect a patient\u2019s due process rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Added to the law were new procedural safeguards, including the requirement of a mandatory hearing conducted by a hearing officer<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> within <em>5 </em>working days of confinement and optional periodic review hearings at the request of the patient. MARR 10.04.03.03G (1974). The regulations placed the burden on the State, by clear and convincing evidence, to establish at the involuntary admission hearing that the patient had a mental illness, required inpatient treatment, and was a danger to him or herself or others. <em>Id; see also </em>Solomon, Involuntary Commitment, <em>supra, </em>at 117. Through these regulations, DHMH attempted to strike a balance between protecting the rights of patients who were involuntarily admitted, and \u201csociety\u2019s interest in minimizing potential injury to its members by involuntarily hospitalizing persons genuinely in need of care or treatment for the protection of themselves or others.\u201d Solomon, Involuntary Commitment, <em>supra, </em>at 118. At the time Solomon published his article, the parties to <em>Anderson </em>agreed to settle the case in light of the revisions to the regulations, pending the court\u2019s approval. <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In 1979, another lawsuit against Dr. Solomon in his capacity as Secretary, <em>Johnson v. Solomon </em>triggered the next wave of reforms. 484 F.Supp. 278 (D. Md. 1979). A class action was initiated on behalf of children in civil confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 280. The class alleged that its members were \u201cdenied periodic review as to whether continued hospitalization is necessary\u201d once civilly committed. <em>Id. </em>at 281. The class argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the lack of mandatory periodic review (\u201cmeaning a review that is automatically initiated by the court at the appropriate time rather than having to wait for the committed person ... to initiate such review\u201d) in the Maryland Juvenile Causes Act and State civil commitment laws violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process rights of the litigants and all members of the class. <em>Id. </em>at 288. The Court found that \u201c[sjince commitments must now be made in terms of constitutionally adequate standards, mandatory periodic review is a necessary complement to this overall approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the Court concluded that \u201cthe absence of a mandatory review of juveniles committed to mental institutions by juvenile courts is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313. The Court ordered the State to \u201cadopt a review process satisfying constitutional prerequisites!)]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">DHMH then amended the regulations in 1981. <em>See 8 </em>Md. Reg. 1635 (Oct. 2, 1981) (notice of final regulations on involuntary admission to mental health facilities and adoption by the Secretary of DHMH); 8 Md. Reg. 1244-46 (July 10, 1981) (notice of re-proposed regulations on involuntary admission to mental health facilities); 7 Md. Reg. 2268-71 (Nov. 28, 1980) (notice of proposed regulations on involuntary admission to mental health facilities). The 1981 revisions required, among other things, that the record must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence three additional elements to establish that a patient qualified for involuntary commitment. COMAR 10.21.01.07M (1981); 7 Md. Reg. 2271 (Nov. 28,1980). Thus, in addition to establishing that the person 1) had a mental disorder, 2) was in need of institutional inpatient care or treatment, and 3) presented a danger to him or herself or others, the new regulations also required that the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>demonstrate that 4) the patient was unwilling or unable to be voluntarily admitted, 5) there is no less restrictive form of treatment available, and, 6) for patients over 65 years of age, an additional evaluation was conducted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In 1982, the General Assembly re-codified the State\u2019s health laws into the Health-General Article (civil commitment laws are located in Title 10) and simultaneously codified the involuntary admission regulations in the new statute. <em>See </em>Comm\u2019n to Revise Annotated Code Report on H.B. 200 (Dec. 10,1981). The purpose of this \u201crevision\u201d was to \u201cbasically codif[y] the most significant parts of current agency regulation.\u201d Summary of S.B. 437, Bill File (1982). The 1981 regulations governing involuntary admissions and the corresponding statute enacted in 1982\u2014Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-601 <em>et </em>seq.\u2014remain substantially the same today.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">B.

People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)); see <em>also Comptroller of Md. v. Miller, </em>169 Md.App. 321, 343, 901 A.2d 229 (2006). We apply a different standard to the ALJs\u2019 findings of fact from the standard we apply to their conclusions of law. In regard to the findings of fact, our role \u201c \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s fmdings[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 67-68, 729 A.2d 376 (quoting <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226). Our review of the ALJs\u2019 conclusions of law is not so narrow\u2014especially in the context of the underlying involuntary admission hearings. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Ordinarily, when a commission or board of review within an administrative agency sits in a quasi-judicial role in a contest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ed case, appellate courts accord deferential review to the decision of that commission or board interpreting the agency\u2019s enabling statute and the corresponding regulations. <em>See Adventist Health Care Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 118-120, 896 A.2d 320 (2006). Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Adventist, </em>thoroughly explained the rationale for this:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Administrative agencies possess an \u201cexpertise\u201d and, thus, have a greater</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">ability to evaluate and determine the matters and issues that regularly arise, or can be expected to be presented, in the field in which they operate or in connection with the statute that they administer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">Moreover, \u201cth[e] authority delegated to executive branch agencies may include a broad power to promulgate legislative-type rules or regulations in order to implement the statute. Such rules or regulations will often, of necessity, embody significant discretionary policy determinations.\u201d <em>Christ v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 445, 644 A.2d 34 (1994). This Court has stated that, in the exercise of that authority, \u201c[a] great deal of deference is owed an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation.\u201d <em>Maryland Transp. Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002). Furthermore:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\u201c[AJgency rules are designed to serve specific needs of the agency, are promulgated by the agency, and are utilized on a day-to-day basis by the agency. A question concerning the interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule is as central to its operation as an interpretation of the agency\u2019s governing statute. Because an agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation, the agency\u2019s expertise is more pertinent to the interpretation of an agency\u2019s statute than to the interpretation of its governing statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\"><em>Md Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 593, 457 A.2d 1146 (1983). <em>See also Pollock v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Patuxent Inst. Bd. of Review, </em>374 Md. 463, 477 n.6, 823 A.2d 626 (2003) (\u201c[A]n agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation. Thus, an agency\u2019s interpretation of the meaning and intent of its own regulation is entitled to deference [citations omitted]\u201d); <em>Maryland Transp. Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288-289, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002) (\u201c[A]n agency\u2019s interpretation of an administrative regulation is \u2018of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 [citations omitted]\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The rationale undergirding the deference normally accorded agencies in interpreting the statutes and regulations they administer does not apply to the ALJs\u2019 decisions in the underlying cases. In other administrative review regulatory schemes by which the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) is delegated authority to conduct hearings on behalf of an agency or commission, the ALJ typically issues a recommended decision, which the agency or commission may adopt, modify, or reject; <em>see, e.g., </em>COMAR 31.02.01.09-1 (Maryland Insurance Administration); or, the applicable regulation permits a party to appeal a final decision by an ALJ to a commission or board within the agency, <em>see </em>COMAR 14.03.01.12 (Regulation provides for review of decisions issued by an ALJ by the Appeal Board of the Commission on Human Relations). A party may then file a petition for judicial review of the final agency decision in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Here, the administrative agency has no role in involuntary admission hearings other than as a party. In 1992, DHMH promulgated regulations assigning the role of the impartial hearing officer to OAH.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>19 Md. Reg. 1708 (Sept. 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>1992) (notice of final rule); 19 Md. Reg. 1319-26 (July 10, 1992) (notice of proposed rule); <em>see also </em>COMAR 10.21.01.09A (\u201cAn ALJ from the OAH shall conduct a hearing at the inpatient facility!.]\u201d). Moreover, appellate review of involuntary admission hearings has been in the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts since 1982. The statute states specifically that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">(a) The Board of Review does not have jurisdiction to review the determination of a hearing officer on an involuntary admission under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">(b) The determination of the hearing officer is a final decision of the Department for the purpose of judicial review of a final decision under the Administrative Procedure Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-633(a)-(b). Although DHMH has its own Board of Review, this Board had never possessed jurisdiction to review involuntary admission hearing determinations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The independence ALJs retain in involuntary admission decisions may, perhaps, warrant even greater deference in reviewing their factual findings. Because ALJs are situated outside of and independent from DHMH, however, without the subject matter expertise traditionally present when an agency sits in the quasi-judicial role, we should not afford deference to the ALJs\u2019 legal interpretations of the involuntary admission statutes and the concomitant regulations promulgated by DHMH. Accordingly, we review all of the ALJs\u2019 legal conclusions <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>C. Preadmission Procedural Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Title 10, Subtitle 6 of the Health-General Article contains provisions governing civil commitment generally, including voluntary admission, involuntary admission, and emergency evaluations. An individual with a mental illness may apply voluntarily for admission to a hospital. <em>See </em>Health-Gen, \u00a7 10-609. An individual may also be involuntarily admitted, either by application for involuntary admission by \u201cany person who has a legitimate interest in the welfare of the individual,\u201d Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-614, or, by a petition for emergency evaluation under Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-624.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">All four Appellants were brought to the Hospital on petitions for emergency evaluation and so we undertake a review of the preadmission procedures applicable to petitions for emergency evaluations. A peace officer or person in a profession listed in Health-Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 10\u2014622(d) and 10-623(a), or any other interested person, may petition for the emergency evaluation of an individual \u201cif the petitioner has reason to believe that the individual: [h]as a mental disorder; and [t]he individual presents a danger to the life or safety of the individual or of others.\u201d Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-622(a). A peace officer \u201cshall take an emergency evaluee to the nearest emergency facility\u201d upon a petition signed by a peace officer or a professional.

If the court makes a finding of probable cause \u201cthat the emergency evaluee has shown the symptoms of a mental disorder and that the individual presents a danger to the life or safety of the individual or others,\u201d then the court shall endorse the petition. Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-623(b). Once a petition is endorsed by the court, a peace officer must take the individual to the nearest emergency facility for evaluation. Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-624(a). If the petition lacks probable cause, \u201cno further action may be taken under the petition.\u201d Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-623(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The emergency facility is required to accept the individual if the petition is properly executed.

Within 6 hours of receiving notification, DHMH is required to admit the individual to an appropriate inpatient facility. Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-625(b)(2). Then, within 12 hours of an individual\u2019s initial admission, the inpatient facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>is required to give the individual a notice of the admission status and notice of involuntary admission hearing rights, including the right to call or write a lawyer and the availability of legal aid and lawyer referral services.

Notably, compliance with the preadmission procedures is not one of these elements, nor does the statute provide anywhere that the hearing officer must make findings in regard to preadmissions procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Although the statute does not provide a definitive answer, it points us to another source of law\u2014the corresponding regulations promulgated by DHMH\u2014that provide additional instruction on how involuntary preadmission procedures are conducted. <em>See </em>Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(d)(l) (\u201cThe Secretary shall [ajdopt rules and regulations on hearing procedures.\u201d) The regulation pertaining to involuntary admission hearings is found in COMAR 10.21.01.09.

Clearly, this regulation addresses additional procedures, rights, and responsibilities of the parties at involuntary admission hearings. First, we observe that DHMH addresses the involuntary admission elements and preadmission procedures in separate sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Focusing on Section F, the burden of proof is expressly placed on the inpatient facility (here, the Hospital) to establish the involuntary admission elements. COMAR 10.21.01.09F. The regulation reiterates that the burden of proof is by clear and convincing evidence. We note that Section F pertains to only the involuntary admission elements and, like the statutory provision on involuntary admission hearings, compliance with the preadmission procedures is absent from the enumeration of involuntary admission elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Unlike the statute, Section G of the regulation addresses how a parly may raise an issue regarding compliance with the preadmission procedures. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.21.01.09G. This section fills in the gap left by the statute. The regulation expressly places the burden on the individual whose involuntary admission is sought to \u201craise\u201d issues \u201crelate[d] to the process by which the: [individual was taken into and confined during observation status[.]\u201d COMAR 10.21.01.09G(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The regulation, however, fails to specify which party bears the burden to prove procedural compliance once the issue is raised. Viewing the statutory scheme as a whole, in light of its purpose\u2014protecting individuals\u2019 liberty interests\u2014it only follows that the burden of proof shifts to the hospital.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See Arrington v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>402 Md. 79, 101, 935 A.2d 432 (2007) (holding that, where Maryland Rule 15-207(e)(4) did not specify which party bore the burden of proof, the burden is on the party with a \u201c \u2018peculiar means of knowledge\u2019 enabling him or her to establish the fact\u201d (citation omitted)). This burden-shifting framework is appropriate in light of the circumstances surrounding emergency petitions for involuntary admission. The patient most likely lacks the cognition during the evaluation and observation period to document the pertinent procedural events; including his or her time of arrival at the hospital, the time of receipt of the notice of admission status, the duration between arrival and evaluation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>and the duration between arrival and admission to an appropriate facility. The hospital, however, maintains and controls access to the patient\u2019s medical records, which are likely the only documentary evidence to establish the hospital\u2019s compliance or non-compliance with the preadmission procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The regulation also fails to identify the hospital\u2019s burden of proof for establishing its compliance with specific issues raised by the individual at the involuntary admission hearing. We look to Maryland Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), \u00a7 10-217 for guidance. This provision states that \u201c[t]he standard of proof in a contested case shall be the preponderance of the evidence unless the standard of clear and convincing evidence is imposed on the agency by regulation, statute, or constitution.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the hospital has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, to establish its compliance with the specific pread-mission procedures at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Fortunately, the statute also addresses what the remedy should be for noncompliance. COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3) provides that the ALJ must \u201c[ojrder the release of the individual from the inpatient facility if: (a) an error in the process occurred; (b) [t]he error in the process is substantial; and (c) [n]o other available remedy is consistent with due process and the protection of the individual\u2019s rights[.]\u201d From this three-part test we observe that the hospital\u2019s non-compliance with a preadmission procedure does not automatically result in the release of the individual from the hospital. Establishing that an error occurred is only one part of the three-part test. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3)(a). The procedural violation only results in the individual\u2019s release from the hospital if 1) the error was substantial and 2) there is no other remedy available that is consistent with due process and the protection of the individual\u2019s rights. COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3)(b)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Based on the foregoing review of the applicable statute and regulations, we hold that the individual bears the burden at an involuntary admission hearing to raise any preadmission procedural violations. Once the issue is raised, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>shifts to the hospital to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, either its compliance with respect to the alleged procedural violation, or that the violation was not substantial or that \u201c[n]o other remedy [wa]s consistent with due process and the protection of the individual\u2019s rights[.]\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">1. The Preadmission Procedures are Not \u201cJurisdictional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Appellants assert that an individual is not \u201clawfully in [a hospital\u2019s] custody\u201d if the hospital failed to comply with the preadmission procedures and, as a result, the hospital\u2019s noncompliance deprives the OAH of jurisdiction to conduct an involuntary admission hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Appellants\u2019 contention is essentially an issue of statutory construction similar to that addressed in <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 844 A.2d 388 (2004). In <em>Jones, </em>an ALJ suspended the respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license because the respondent refused to submit to a chemical breath test after failing a field sobriety test during a traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 844 A.2d 388. The respondent sought judicial review in the circuit court, challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision by asserting that the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) must also establish at the suspension hearing prior to suspending an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license, that the respondent was offered a chemical test within the two-hour statutory limitation as required under [Maryland Code (1977, 1999 Repl. Vol., 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Supp.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d),] \u00a7 10-303. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 844 A.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The circuit court concluded that the MVA had the burden to establish compliance with the two-hour statutory limitation and that there was no evidence in the record that the test was offered within that time limit. <em>Id. </em>After the circuit court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision, the MVA filed a petition for certiorari requesting that the Court of Appeals determine \u201cwhether \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f)(7)(i) implicitly requires that, in a \u00a7 16-205.1 suppression hearing, the [MVA] must also establish that the arresting officers satisfied the requirements of the provisions of [CJP] \u00a7 10-303U\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 844 A.2d 388. After applying the canons of statutory interpretation and reviewing the legislative history, the Court held that \u201cthe text of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i) [ ] is clear and unambiguous and limits the issues to be considered by an ALJ in a suspension hearing to the six enumerated issues of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i)(l-6)\u201d\u2014whether the test was offered within the two-hour statutory time limit was not among those six elements. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 177, 844 A.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The Court reasoned that the use of the word \u201conly\u201d in the language of the statute\u2014\u201cat the hearing the <em>only </em>issues shall be\u201d\u2014served as a limiting word which excluded other possible elements. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 177, 844 A.2d 388 (emphasis added). \u201cIf the Legislature intended the ALJ to consider whether the officers requested the chemical breath test within two hours of his apprehension, it would have included a seventh factor under (f)(7)(i).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 844 A.2d 388. In further support of this interpretation of the statute, the Court observed that \u201cthe Legislature appear[d] to be concerned solely with the issue of whether the refusal was <em>informed </em>and not with the lapse of time between the suspect\u2019s apprehension and the test being requested.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Applying the principles of statutory construction, we look to the plain language of Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632\u2014the statutory provision governing the involuntary admission hearing. Subsection 10-632(e)(2) states that \u201c[t]he hearing officer shall ... [o]rder the release of the individual from the facility <em>unless </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the hearing <em>each of the following elements exist </em>as to the individual whose involuntary admission is sought.\u201d (Emphasis added). This subsection sets forth six elements that <em>must </em>be established before the ALJ may order the involuntary commitment of an individual. Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2). Similar to <em>Jones, </em>none of the preadmission procedures are included in the enumerated list of involuntary admission elements that must be established at the involuntary admission hearing. <em>See Jones, </em>380 Md. at 177, 844 A.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>DHMH promulgated revisions to the involuntary admission regulations in 1981 and the General Assembly followed suit in 1982 by enacting into the Maryland Code the procedures in the regulations to protect individuals\u2019 liberty interests. <em>See, e.g., </em>Solomon, Involuntary Commitment, <em>supra, </em>at 115. The General Assembly intended that the \u201c[s]ix elements must exist for the hearing officer to determine the appropriateness of the involuntary admission.\u201d Fiscal Note, S.B. 437 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Nothing in the legislative history indicates that the General Assembly intended that a hospital must demonstrate compliance with the preadmission procedures as a condition precedent to ordering involuntary admission. Appellants, therefore, are incorrect in their contention that it is a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d prerequisite that a hospital establish compliance with preadmission procedures during an involuntary commitment hearing. Instead, a hospital must only demonstrate compliance with preadmission procedures in those cases in which the patient raises procedural irregularities with particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">E. Application of Law to Each Appellant\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Appellants argue that the Hospital\u2019s errors in the preadmission procedures were substantial and required each ALJ to release each Appellant. COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3)(c). The Hospital contends that the ALJs reviewed and ruled on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>preadmission procedural violations raised by Appellants under the appropriate standard articulated in COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We evaluate each Appellant\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">1. J.H.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Counsel for J.H. alleged, at the outset of the hearing before the ALJ, that \u201cwe will be bringing up that the notice of admission status and the detention in the emergency room both exceeded the time limits[.]\u201d Then, at the conclusion of the Hospital\u2019s case, he again alleged that the Hospital exceeded the statutory time limits for notifying J.H. of her notice of admission status and for the time she spent in the emergency room, and added that there was no evidence that the Hospital completed her certifications or that she was granted an involuntary admission hearing within the applicable time limits. J.H.\u2019s counsel could not provide any factual support for these broad allegations, but maintained that it was the Hospital\u2019s burden to present evidence that the Hospital had complied with the preadmission procedures specified in Title 10, Subtitle 6 of the Health-General Article and corresponding CO-MAR provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">For the reasons stated in the preceding examination of the statute and regulations governing involuntary commitment proceedings, we determine that the ALJ properly placed the initial burden on J.H.\u2019s counsel to raise the alleged preadmission procedural violations with sufficient particularity so that the Hospital would have had the opportunity to submit evidence in response. The ALJ said \u201cif the patient is asking for a release based on some violation of the necessary procedures, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the patient to show that those procedures were, in fact, violated[.]\u201d We note that J.H.\u2019s counsel did not take the opportunity to ask Dr. Prasad, on cross-examination, about either of the alleged procedural violations. In fact, J.H.\u2019s counsel only asked one question on cross-examination: \u201cHow did my client get to the hospital, Doctor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In each instance, J.H.\u2019s counsel did not raise the procedural defects with particularity. As a result the burden did not shift to the Hospital and the ALJ was not required to make findings regarding those alleged violations. Furthermore, in regard to the requirement that patients have an involuntary admission hearing within 10 days, the ALJ concluded that even if there was a procedural violation, it did not warrant J.H.\u2019s release, reasoning that J.H. had a hearing in a \u201ctimely fashion\u201d and any error was not substantial. We agree, and hold that the ALJ did not err in denying J.H.\u2019s motion for release and admitting J.H. to the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">2. C.B.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">C.B. contends that her due process rights were infringed because the Hospital did not establish compliance with the maximum allowable time for evaluation and observation in the emergency room. At the outset of the hearing, C.B.\u2019s counsel indicated that he would \u201cbe bringing up the defect in the emergency petition and the notice of admission\u201d without identifying any specific errors. The Hospital proceeded to examine its witness, Dr. Mirmirani, regarding the contents of the notice of admission, but had no notice of a specific allegation of error. During the cross-examination, C.B.\u2019s counsel intimated there were errors in the notice of admission status form when he questioned Dr. Mirmirani about whether C.B.\u2019s name was on the form, and, why the words \u201cnot applicable\u201d were written by the petitioner (C.B.\u2019s father) next to the question concerning whether C.B. posed a danger to herself or others. On redirect, however, Dr. Mirmirani explained that the patient\u2019s first name was at the end of the notice of admission status form and that a nurse informed C.B. of her status. More importantly, C.B.\u2019s father testified at the involuntary admission hearing that his daughter did pose a danger to herself and to others, and that his notation of \u201cnot applicable\u201d on the form was probably in error. Thus, in regard to the alleged errors in the notice of admission status form and petition, C.B.\u2019s counsel timely raised the alleged errors, and the ALJ properly shifted the burden to the Hospital. As the transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>demonstrates, the Hospital then presented evidence showing compliance with the preadmission procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">After the close of evidence, C.B.\u2019s counsel attempted to raise an additional procedural violation\u2014the time C.B. spent in the emergency room. The ALJ found that C.B. did not raise the alleged procedural violation in time and with particularity. We agree. C.B.\u2019s counsel\u2019s bald allegation\u2014\u201cwe don\u2019t know how long she was in the emergency room[ ]\u201d\u2014during closing remarks was too little too late. Under the circumstances, the burden did not shift to the Hospital to under COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3). We hold that the ALJ did not err in denying C.B.\u2019s motion for release and admitting C.B. to the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">3. M.G.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">M.G. contends that she was not afforded due process because the Hospital kept her in the emergency room for approximately 41 hours prior to her admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit\u2014in excess of the 30-hour statutory limit\u2014and that her record does not indicate that the Hospital provided her with her notice of admission status.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In this case, M.G.\u2019s counsel did attempt to establish the duration of M.G.\u2019s evaluation in the emergency room during his cross-examination of Dr. Mirmirani. Dr. Mirmirani testified that he was not certain exactly how long M.G. was in the emergency room, but conceded that her stay may have exceeded the 30-hour statutory maximum because she was placed in the ASC after her evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">As we have explained, we defer to the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, and if the facts in the record allow reasoning minds to reach the same determination as the ALJ, \u201cthen [the determination] is based upon substantial evidence, and the court has no power to reject that conclusion.\u201d <em>Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 443, 624 A.2d 941 (1993). The applicable regulation provides that where an error in process is established, the ALJ must determine whether it is \u201csubstantial\u201d and whether \u201cthere is no other remedy [ ] consistent with due process and the protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the individual\u2019s rights.\u201d COMAR 10.21.01.09G. In this case, although M.G. was not transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit within the time prescribed in the statute, the emergency room physicians performed their initial evaluation and concluded that M.G. required inpatient treatment. The emergency room physicians began administering that treatment in the ASC prior to her transfer to an available bed in the inpatient unit. On this record, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s determination that the preadmission procedure violation was not substantial and did not warrant M.G.\u2019s release was legally correct and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">M.G.\u2019s counsel raised the alleged errors in the notice of admission status and certifications only after the Hospital rested its case. In this case, however, the ALJ permitted the Hospital to re-open its case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Dr. Mirmirani took the witness stand again and testified to the notice of admission status and the certifications procedures that the Hospital followed. Although Dr. Mirmirani could not clearly state when the emergency physician gave M.G. notice of her admission status, he did testify that two licensed physicians certified M.G. The ALJ determined that, to the extent any procedural violation was established, it was not substantial. We do not find error in the ALJ\u2019s assessment that, to the extent M.G. established any procedural violation, it was not substantial. We affirm the ALJ\u2019s rulings on M.G.\u2019s motion for release and order admitting her to the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">4. B.N.\u2019s Involuntary Admission Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">B.N. contends that her due process rights were infringed because she remained in the emergency room for 76 hours, her involuntary admission hearing took place more than 10 days after her initial confinement, and she was not evaluated within 6 hours of her arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>B.N.\u2019s counsel stated these allegations of procedural violations at the outset of the involuntary admission hearing and argued that the Hospital bore the burden to demonstrate compliance with all relevant statutory preadmission requirements before proceeding to present evidence on the merits of the case (i.e., the involuntary admission elements). The ALJ, after determining that COMAR 10.21.01.09G was silent as to which party bore the burden to prove the Hospital\u2019s compliance with preadmission procedures, instructed the Hospital \u201cto present whatever testimony you wish to present or not on any issue that is relevant in today\u2019s hearingt.]\u201d Without expressly stating so, the ALJ properly placed the burden on the Hospital to prove that either the Hospital complied with that preadmission procedure or the alleged errors were not substantial. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.21,01.09G(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">With respect to the duration of time in the emergency room, Dr. Maddineni\u2019s testimony corroborated B.N.\u2019s allegation that she spent 75 or 76 hours in the emergency room\u2014well in excess of the 30-hour statutory time limit. Procedural violations, however, do not result in a patient\u2019s automatic release. If the Hospital can establish either that the errors were not substantial or that no \u201cavailable remedy [wa]s consistent with due process and the protection of the individual\u2019s rights,\u201d the ALJ is not required to release the patient. COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3). In this case, Dr. Maddineni testified that after B.N. was evaluated in the emergency room, she was transferred to the ASC, which is part of the psychiatric unit in the emergency room, because there were no available inpatient beds. Again, we mind the deference accorded the ALJ under COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3) to determine whether a violation is substantial and whether there was \u201cno available remedy [] consistent with due process and the protection of the individual\u2019s rights.\u201d We hold that the ALJ\u2019s determination that the Hospital\u2019s violation of the 30-hour statutory maximum did not warrant B.N.\u2019s release was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We also discern no error in the ALJ\u2019s ruling that there was no violation with respect to the 10-day statutory hearing requirement. B.N. was admitted to the Hospital on January 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>2016, and the hearing was held on January 13, 2016. B.N.\u2019s involuntary admission hearing occurred within 10 days of her admission. Similarly, we find no error in the ALJ\u2019s decision that there was no violation of the requirement that patients be evaluated within 6 hours of arrival at the Hospital. Dr. Maddi-neni testified that B.N. was brought to the emergency room on January 1, 2016 and evaluated at 11:30 a.m. on the same day. Although the record did not establish that B.N. was evaluated within 6 hours of her arrival, she was evaluated promptly. It was reasonable for the ALJ to conclude that any violation with respect to this preadmission procedure was not substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the ALJ applied the legal burden of proof accurately in all four cases. We agree that J.H. did not raise her alleged preadmission procedure violations in time or with particularity and that the Hospital established its compliance with the preadmission procedures with respect to C.B. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s observation that although Appellants\u2019 counsel \u201cbroadly raised the possibility of numerous procedural errors,\u201d counsel failed to \u201cprovide evidence to establish exactly what, if any, procedural errors actually occurred that required [Appellants\u2019] release.\u201d In regard to M.G. and B.N., the record supports the ALJs\u2019 decisions that the violations of the preadmission procedures were not substantial and there was \u201cno other available remedy consistent with due process and the protection of the individual\u2019s rights.\u201d COMAR 10.21.01.09G(3)(c). In all of four cases, the records demonstrate that the Hospital presented evidence on, and the ALJs examined, each element contained in Health-Gen. \u00a7 10-632(e)(2), establishing that the patients were suffering from serious mental illness and required inpatient treatment in order to protect them from harming themselves or others. We hold that the ALJs\u2019 decisions ordering the involuntary admissions of Appellants were legally correct and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED.

After a period of time DHMH granted Bergstein conditional release. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 588 A.2d 779. After Bergstein violated the terms of his release, the state\u2019s attorney filed a petition to revoke his conditional release, which the DHMH hearing examiner granted. <em>Id. </em>Bergstein unsuccessfully sought judicial review in the circuit court, and then noted an appeal to this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 588 A.2d 779.

Colbourn &amp; Dennis Schnappe, <em>Research Guide for Maryland Regulations, </em>Division of State Documents, 2 (1992). For a number of reasons, including the lack of authority of the Secretary of State\u2019s Office to do more than establish publishing guidelines, this effort was unsuccessful and left incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">In 1974, the General Assembly passed the State Documents Law, now codified in the State Government Article of the Maryland Code, formalizing the rule-making process by which regulations are created. Maryland Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), State Government Article (\u201cSG\"), \u00a7 7-201 <em>et </em>seq.; Colbourn, <em>supra, </em>at 2. Judge Wilner, writing for the Court of Appeals, explained that \"the principal purpose of [the State Documents Law] was to create the <em>Maryland Register </em>(Register) as a mechanism for giving public notice of certain agency actions, including the proposed and final adoptions of regulations, and COMAR, to serve as a permanent repository of agency regulations.\" <em>Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Solomon articulated these considerations in his article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">The first major question facing [DHMH] in formulating the new regulations concerned the point in time which would be most appropriate for setting the hearing to determine the propriety of an involuntary admission. Due process considerations naturally suggested a pre-admission hearing in order that absolutely no deprivation of liberty would be imposed before the State had proven that such confinement was necessary.... The due process argument that a pre-confinement hearing is required must be weighed in light of the resulting difficulties in carrying out such necessary evaluations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAsF\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">The balancing process among the various interests and rights at stake led [DHMH] to devise an arrangement whereby an individual would be temporarily confined at an appropriate facility, after which a series of procedures would be initiated to preserve the due process rights of the proposed patient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Solomon, Involuntary Commitment, <em>supra, </em>at 116.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">.

Between 1973 and 1992, an impartial hearing officer designated by the Secretary of DHMH conducted the involuntary admission hearings. MARR 10.04.03.02D (1974). In 1989, however, the General Assembly formed the OAH as an independent agency created to adjudicate administrative hearings in response to the findings and recommendations of the Governor\u2019s Task Force on Administrative Hearing Officers commissioned by then-Govemor William Schaefer. <em>See Pinal Report of the Governor\u2019s Task Force on Administrative Hearing Officers, </em>(June 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>1998) (explaining that the Task Force was formed to investigate concerns that parties \u201cmay not receive a fair hearing before [a] Hearing Officer\u201d because \"these Hearing Officers are subject to the control and supervision of the agency which as rendered a decision or taken some action that is the subject of the appeal heard by the Hearing Officer\u201d); 1989 Md, Laws, ch. 788 (S.B. 658).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">.

We acknowledge that the Court of Appeals has held that a petitioner must be released from a mental institution and returned to prison to serve his original sentence when it concluded that a provision in the Defective Delinquent Act (since repealed) requiring the examiner to disclose the results of the psychological evaluation to the court and advise the petitioner of his hearing rights was mandatory and was not complied with. <em>See Moss v.
