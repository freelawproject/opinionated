Phillips filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude certain cell phone evidence in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, and, on February 12, 2016, the court granted Phillips\u2019s motion. The State sought in banc review of the order granting Phillips\u2019s motion in the circuit court pursuant to the Maryland Constitution, Article IV, section 22, and Maryland Rules 4-362 and 2-661.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Phillips filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s request for in banc review for lack of jurisdiction. A three-judge panel sitting in banc denied the motion. In a written order and memorandum dated June 3, 2016, the panel found in favor of the State, thereby reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling. Phillips filed a notice of appeal of the in banc decision and presents the following questions for our review:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>1. \u201cDid the three-judge panel lack appellate jurisdiction to review [the trial court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] ruling?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">2. \u201cDid the three-judge panel fail to identify any legal error in [the trial court\u2019s] ruling?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">3. \u201cDid [the trial court] correctly conclude that the State\u2019s use of a drive test for the forensic purpose of pinpointing the location of a cell phone during a crime was not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, as required by the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test for admissibility of expert testimony?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">4. \u201cDid [the trial court] properly exercise [its] discretion under Maryland Rule 5-702 in ruling that the State\u2019s witnesses were not qualified to offer expert testimony about the use of drive tests for the forensic purpose of pinpointing the location of a cell phone during a crime?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The State has filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, arguing that this Court does not have appellate jurisdiction over the appeal filed by Phillips. We deny the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We hold that the in banc panel lacked jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s grant of Phillip\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>because it was an unappealable interlocutory order. Accordingly, we do not reach Phillips\u2019s remaining contentions. We vacate the panel\u2019s order, and remand the case with directions to reinstate the trial court\u2019s order and dismiss the appeal so that criminal proceedings may resume.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">A. Indictment and Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">On July 18, 2014, a grand jury indicted Phillips for the December 10, 2013 murder of Shar-Ron Mason. Phillips was charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, manslaughter, the use of a firearm in a felony, and the use of a firearm during a crime of violence. He was also charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. Phillips was then arrested pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The State notified Phillips that it intended to offer at trial a radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) signal propagation map purporting to establish the approximate location of Phillips\u2019s phone on the morning of December 10, 2013. The propagation map represented data obtained through a drive test<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conducted by Special Agent Richard Fennern, a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Cellular Analysis and Survey Team, on October 23, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Phillips filed a motion <em>in limine </em>on August 7, 2015, seeking to exclude the RF signal propagation map and related testimony. Phillips argued that the method used to create the map was not generally accepted as reliable within the relevant scientific community under Maryland\u2019s <em>Frye-Reed </em>test for admissibility of evidence based on novel scientific methodology.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Phillips acknowledged that cell phone tower \u201cping\u201d evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>dence is admissible, but drew a distinction between the method used to create the RF signal propagation map and the collection of historical cell phone \u201cping\u201d evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Phillips argued that a drive test\u2014in this case conducted ten months after the murder of Shar-Ron Mason\u2014\u201cis merely a snapshot in time that cannot give any reliable prediction of where [radio frequency] signals were or where they were going over time.\u201d \u201cIn order for the test to be reliable, conditions would have to be analogous to those that existed on [the date of the murder] such as but not limited to weather, time, volume of call traffic, and the state of the equipment in use by the cell phone company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">B. <em>Frye-Reed </em>Hearing and the Trial Court\u2019s Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The trial court heard arguments on Phillip\u2019s motion and conducted a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing over four days between September 24, 2015 and October 30, 2015. Phillips maintained that drive tests are routinely performed by cell phone companies to improve coverage and minimize \u201cdropped calls,\u201d but that they are not generally accepted in criminal investigations. Testifying for the defense, William Folson, accepted as an expert witness \u201cin the field of cellular technology and historical cell site analysis\u201d explained that he \u201cconsider[s] [drive tests] a waste of time\u201d because \u201c[tjhey add no value to the historical analysis of a cell phone.\u201d He further testified that the manner in which Special Agent Fennern had performed the drive test was not accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community. Mr. Folson explained that the RF signal range in December 2013 when the murder occurred would be different than the range in October 2014 when the drive test was conducted because the strength of RF signals fluctuate. Because of this, according to Mr. Folson, a drive test is not representative of the strength of the RF signals on any other date. He also pointed out that drive tests were not peer reviewed, accepted by the scientific community, or used in criminal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Providing a different opinion and testifying for the State, Special Agent Fennern was accepted as an \u201cexpert in the field of historical cell site analysis, cellular technology, and [ ] radio frequency drive testing for cell phone mapping.\u201d Agent Fen-nern opined that factors such as weather only have a \u201cminimal\u201d impact on radio frequency strength. He also testified that, relying on information provided by cell phone companies, the RF signal strength only varied by five or ten percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The State also offered the testimony of T-Mobile employee Stephen Willingham, accepted as an expert in radio frequency engineering. He testified that cell phone companies use drive tests for \u201ccompetitive analysis reasons.\u201d He explained that when a customer complains about a missed call, a cell phone company will use a drive test to attempt to recreate that dropped call to identify a gap in service. Mr. Willingham testified that, over time, radio frequency \u201c[fjootprints remain consistent as long as nothing major has changed[,]\u201d referring to the physical layout of the cell site, such as antennas and equipment. He stated that the maximum variation he had seen for a footprint was a quarter mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In a written memorandum and order dated February 12, 2016, the trial court granted Phillips\u2019s motion excluding the RF signal propagation maps and related expert testimony on drive tests. First, the trial court concluded that experts were required to testify on the drive test methodology. Next, the court concluded that law enforcement\u2019s use of drive tests for forensic purposes was novel and, thus, subject to the <em>Frye-Reed </em>reliability and admissibility standards. After determining that the digital forensic science field is the relevant scientific community, the court found that the State\u2019s experts lacked familiarity with that field and were unable to produce studies or peer-reviewed articles in that field supporting the reliability or general acceptance of drive tests for forensic purposes. The court ultimately concluded that the State did not establish that drive tests as used by the FBI are generally accepted in the digital forensic science community. The court then mused that, even if the drive test were considered generally accepted and reliable, the State\u2019s experts were not qualified to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>because they were not members of the digital forensic science community and failed to satisfy the requirement of Maryland Rule 5-702.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">C. In Banc Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"A0F\">i. Article IV, \u00a7 22 and Maryland Rule 2-551</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Displeased with the court\u2019s interlocutory order granting Phillips\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>on February 18, 2016, the State filed a request for in banc review of the trial court\u2019s order pursuant to the Maryland Constitution, Article IV, section 22, and Maryland Rules 4-352 and 2-551. To provide context for the parties\u2019 ensuing filings and arguments, we interpose the relevant text authorizing in banc review in the circuit courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Article IV, section 22, of the Maryland Constitution reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">Where any trial is conducted by less than three Circuit Judges, upon the decision or determination of any point, or question, by the Court, it shall be competent to the party, against whom the ruling or decision is made, upon motion, to have the point, or question reserved for the consideration of three Judges of the Circuit, who shall constitute a court in banc for such purpose; and the motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting at which such decision may be made; and the procedure for appeals to the Circuit Court in banc shall be as provided by the Maryland Rules. The decision of the said Court in banc shall be the effective decision in the premises, and conclusive, as against the party at whose motion said points, or questions were reserved; but such decision in banc shall not preclude the right of Appeal by an adverse party who did not seek in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>banc review, in those cases, civil or criminal, in which appeal to the Court of Special Appeals may be allowed by Law. The right of having questions reserved shall not, however, apply to trials of Appeals from judgments of the District Court, nor to criminal cases below the grade of felony, except when the punishment is confinement in the Penitentiary; and this Section shall be subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Maryland Rule 2-551 provides in pertinent part:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeb\">(a) Generally. When review by a court in banc is permitted by the Maryland Constitution, a party may have a judgment or determination of any point or question reviewed by a court in banc by filing a notice for in banc review. Issues are reserved for in banc review by making an objection in the manner set forth in Rules 2-517 and 2-520. Upon the filing of the notice, the Circuit Administrative Judge shall designate three judges of the circuit, other than the judge who tried the action, to sit in banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">ii. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Phillips filed a motion to dismiss on February 24, 2016, arguing that the in banc panel was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Phillips reasoned that Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have repeatedly recognized that Article IV, section 22, of the Maryland Constitution permits in banc review only when a direct appeal is allowed and the State had no statutory right to appeal the court\u2019s order. Phillips relied on decisional law holding that the standard for appealability to an in banc panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>is the same as that to the Court of Special Appeals, including <em>Board of License Commissioners for Montgomery Cnty. v. Haberlin, </em>320 Md. 399, 578 A.2d 215 (1990), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 873 A.2d 1122 (2005); <em>Dean v. State, </em>302 Md. 493, 489 A.2d 22 (1985), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bienkowski, supra, </em>386 Md. at 516, 873 A.2d 1122; and <em>Estep v. Estep, </em>285 Md. 416, 404 A.2d 1040 (1979), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bienkowski, </em>386 Md. at 516, 873 A.2d 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">In response, the State argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that in banc review of a trial court decision was not an \u201cappeal,\u201d but instead a \u201creview,\u201d and that the Maryland Constitution provided a right to an in banc determination in this context. Specifically, the State argued that the plain, ordinary, and common meaning of the language of the Maryland Constitution expressly permits in banc review \u201cupon the decision or determination of any point, or question, by the Court[.]\u201d The State also maintained that Maryland Rule 2-551 is \u201cstraightforward\u201d in that it provides that upon filing a notice for in banc review, the circuit administrative judge \u201cshall designate three judges of the circuit court ... to sit in banc.\u201d Therefore, the State argued, \u201cthe appointment of a panel is not discretionary, and is not dependent upon the movant first having to clear any sort of merits hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The in banc panel denied Phillips\u2019s motion to dismiss on March 24, 2016, stating that it would reconsider the motion after oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">iii. Further Proceedings and Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The State filed a \u201cMemorandum in Support of its Request for In Banc Review of [the trial courtj\u2019s February 12, 2016 Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Exclude Tangible Evidence and Testimony Regarding Cell Phone Drive Tests\u201d on March 17, 2016. On the jurisdictional question, the memorandum restated verbatim the arguments relied upon by the State in its response to the motion to dismiss. On the merits, the State argued that (1) the trial court incorrectly permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing because this scientific technique is not new or novel; (2) the trial court had incorrectly applied <em>Frye-Reed </em>because drive tests have widespread acceptance in the relevant scientific field; (3) the trial court erred by incorrectly and narrowly defining the relevant scientific community; and (4) the trial court erred in allowing Mr. Folson to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Phillips filed a \u201cDefendant&gt;-Appellee\u201d brief in which he renewed his motion to dismiss, maintaining that: (1) appellate jurisdiction is defined by statute; (2) the right to an in banc appeal is coextensive with the right to appeal to a traditional Maryland appellate court; and, (3) the State had no statutory right to appeal the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling to this Court or the Court of Appeals. Specifically, Phillips maintained that Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 and 12-302 did <em>not </em>allow the State to appeal in this circumstance. Otherwise, in defense of the trial court\u2019s ruling, Phillips averred: (1) the trial court properly admitted Mr. Folson as an expert witness; (2) the trial court properly concluded that the drive test technique is not generally accepted under Frye-Reed; and (3) the trial court properly concluded that the State\u2019s experts lacked a sufficient factual background under Maryland Rule 5-702(3) to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">At oral argument on May 17, 2016, the State persisted in its contention that the in banc panel had jurisdiction. The State asserted that the purpose of section 22 was to \u201callow quick informal reviews of ... errors by trial judges[,]\u201d and that the history of the 1864 Constitutional Convention indicated that \u00a7 22 \u201cwas meant to extend to instances where an appeal ordinarily would not lie[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Phillips countered with the simple proposition that binding Court of Appeals precedent exists contrary to the State\u2019s position on the very same point. Phillips pressed that jurisdiction is not something the in banc panel can create on its own and that it is established by the Constitution and statutory provisions, neither of which permit appeal of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>interlocutory order. Phillips also contended, on policy grounds, that recognizing in banc review of a grant of a motion <em>in limine </em>would open the floodgates to litigants requesting in banc review from all interlocutory orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">On June 3, 2016, the in banc panel entered an order, concluding that it had jurisdiction to hear the State\u2019s appeal and that the trial court abused its discretion in its evidentiary rulings. Addressing the threshold jurisdictional question, the panel acknowledged that the State would be precluded from appealing the interlocutory order to this Court, yet concluded that it had jurisdiction to consider the State\u2019s appeal. The panel relied on <em>Berg v. Berg, </em>228 Md.App. 266, 137 A.3d 1036 (2016), in which we are purported to have \u201cadvocated for a broad interpretation of Art. IV, \u00a7 22, ultimately holding that a Petitioner could properly take an <em>in banc </em>appeal from a post-trial trial motion.\u201d The panel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">In the instant case, this Panel believes that the case at hand is an extraordinary instance in which the legislature failed to address the ability of the State to take an in banc [sic] from a[n] evidentiary determination amounting to both an abuse of discretion of the trial court and an error of law. As previously stated, the State cannot proceed to the Court of Special Appeals, nor can the State take the normal route of an <em>in banc </em>appeal as delineated in <em>Haberlin, </em>because the situation does not fall within the constraints of \u00a7 12-301 <em>&amp; </em>12-302. In this case, however, the Panel concludes that the language of Art. IV, \u00a7 22 of the Maryland Constitution, when read in conjunction with Md. Rules 4-353 and 2-551 and in light of the dicta included within <em>Berg, </em>shows the intention of the legislature to provide an avenue of review for situations akin to the case at hand. As such, the Panel must look to the Maryland Constitution for guidance in the procedural manner in which this matter is to advance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqe-dedup-1\">(Emphasis added; italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On the merits, the in banc panel concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by conducting a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and excluding the drive test evidence. The panel also concluded that the State\u2019s witnesses, Special Agent Fennern and Mr. Willingham\u2014as well as Phillips\u2019s witness, Mr. Folson\u2014were qualified to testify as experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Phillips noted an appeal to this Court on June 13, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"a9m-dedup-0\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"pAu2\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">As previously mentioned, the State filed a motion to dismiss in this Court, arguing that Phillips lacks the statutory authority to appeal an evidentiary ruling before a trial has been conducted. The State contends that this appeal is an interlocutory appeal not subject to any delineated exception to the final judgment rule. The State further maintains that an order of an in banc panel is only as final as the judgment that it reviews, and that, the proper avenue for Phillips to take is to appeal <em>after </em>the trial, if he is convicted, at which point he may present argument concerning any grievances he had with the in banc panel\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Phillips counters that the decision of an in banc panel is a final, appealable judgment. Phillips argues that a court in banc is one acting as an appellate tribunal and that the decisions of such an appellate tribunal are reviewable as final judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Two appellate decisions, <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 304 A.2d 826 (1973), and <em>Estep, supra, </em>are dispositive on the issue as to whether we have jurisdiction in the present case. In <em>Buck, </em>the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[t]he decision of the court en banc is conclusive, final, and non-appealable by the party who sought the en banc review (the moving party).\u201d 269 Md. at 186, 304 A.2d 826 (citations omitted). In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Folkers filed a petition for declaratory relief against Buck in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 304 A.2d 826. On December 30, 1971, the circuit court entered an order in favor of Buck, at which point Folkers appealed to the court in banc. <em>Id, </em>On April 26, 1972, the in banc panel filed an opinion remanding the case for a new trial because of an error it perceived in the admission of evidence. <em>Id. </em>A different circuit court judge then held a new trial on October 2,1972, which resulted in an entry of judgment in favor of Folkers on October 13, 1972. <em>Id. </em>Buck appealed, presenting questions relating only to alleged errors by the in banc panel. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">[wjhile Buck, as the adverse party, was entitled under Article IV, s 22 to appeal from the en banc determination, the order for such an appeal, to be timely, must have been filed within thirty days after April 26,1972. Since it was not, we cannot take cognizance of the questions presented. There being no other questions before us, we dismiss the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 187-88, 304 A.2d 826 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Thus, the proper time to appeal a decision of an in banc panel is directly after the decision of the in banc panel. A party who waits to appeal until after remand and final judgment by the circuit court loses the ability to argue those points decided by the in banc panel. <em>See id. </em>This is contrary to the State\u2019s contention, just mentioned, that Phillips must wait until <em>after </em>a trial and verdict to offer any allegations of error concerning the in banc panel\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, if Phillips were to follow the State\u2019s advice and wait until a full trial, verdict, and appeal to this Court, he would be foreclosed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>offering argument concerning the decision of the in banc panel, as per the stricture from <em>Buck. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>Estep, </em>285 Md. at 416, 404 A.2d 1040, is also instructive here. In that case, Ms. Estep filed a petition for modification of a governing custody order for her four children against her former husband, Mr. Estep, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. <em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 404 A.2d 1040. In response, Mr. Estep argued that, under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (\u201cUCCJA\u201d), the circuit court chancellor was without jurisdiction to grant Ms. Estep\u2019s modification and, also, that Prince George\u2019s County was an inconvenient forum to litigate the case. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 404 A.2d 1040. Mr. Estep also filed a cross-petition for modification of the governing custody order, seeking child support contributions from Ms. Estep. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The chancellor dismissed Ms. Estep\u2019s petition with regard to the three youngest children,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> finding that the court was without UCCJA jurisdiction to hear the case and, further, that Prince George\u2019s County was an inconvenient forum to hear the case. <em>Id. </em>On the same day, Ms. Estep sought in banc review of the chancellor\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>The court in banc reversed the decision on April 26, 1978, even though Mr. Estep\u2019s cross-petition for support and Ms. Estep\u2019s motion for modification of custody regarding the eldest son remained pending in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Estep then appealed to this Court, which dismissed the case, stating that the appeal \u201cwas \u2018not allowed by law[,]\u2019 \u201d without providing further explanation for its reasoning, <em>Id. </em>at 420 and n.3, 404 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">After granting certiorari, the Court of Appeals reversed this Court and instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">If, as petitioner has suggested, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal to it as interlocutory because the court in banc, after reversing the circuit court\u2019s decision, remanded the case for further action on the respondent\u2019s petition for modification, such a ruling by the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Appeals would be in error. In holding that a nonmoving party\u2019s appeal from the decision of a court in banc to grant a new trial would be timely only if it were made immediately, rather than after the new trial was conducted, this Court in <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 187-88, 304 A.2d 826, 828 (1973), clearly indicated that the court in banc acts only as an appellate tribunal so that its decisions are not those of a reconsidering trial court but are reviewable as final appellate judgments. Thus, we find no grounds for the dismissal by the Court of Special Appeals of the petitioner\u2019s appeal and will reverse that action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 420-21, 404 A.2d 1040 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Nonetheless, the Court did not reach the substantive merits of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 421-22, 404 A.2d 1040. The Court concluded that the in banc panel below had no jurisdiction because the in banc panel was reviewing a decision that was not a final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 421-23, 404 A.2d 1040. The Court observed that several claims in the original circuit court action were unresolved, including Ms. Estep\u2019s motion for modification of the custody order for the eldest son, and Mr. Estep\u2019s cross-petition for child support, and concluded that the order appealed to the court in banc was not a final judgment and was, thus, appealed prematurely. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 404 A.2d 1040. The Court then remanded the case back to the original circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 404 A.2d 1040. <em>Estep, </em>therefore, directs that: (1) a decision of an in banc panel is appealable to a higher Maryland appellate court, (2) only final judgments or otherwise appealable orders may be appealed to an in banc panel, and (3) the Court of Appeals or Court of Special Appeals should remand the case back to the circuit court if a non-appealable order is appealed from a circuit court to an in banc panel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 420-24, 404 A.2d 1040; <em>see also Dabrowski v.

Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction over the in banc panel\u2019s decision because it is a \u201cfinal appellate judgment.\u201d <em>Estep, </em>285 Md. at 421, 404 A.2d 1040 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Buck, </em>269 Md. at 187-88, 304 A.2d 826.

The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"ADH\">The parties largely repeat the arguments presented during the proceedings before the in banc panel. Phillips observes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that appellate jurisdiction is defined by statute and maintains that the State would have no right to appeal under CJP \u00a7 12-301\u2014which provides that a party may generally appeal only from a final judgment\u2014because the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was not a final judgment. Phillips then asserts that the State had no right to appeal under CJP \u00a7 12-302\u2014which gives the State the ability to take an interlocutory appeal when the State\u2019s evidence is excluded due to violation of the United States Constitution or the Maryland Constitution or Declaration of Rights\u2014because, in the present case, the evidence was excluded under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>and Maryland Rule 5-702. Phillips claims the in banc panel \u201creached the merits of the appeal in order to justify reaching the merits\u201d and that the panel incorrectly divined legislative intent and misinterpreted Maryland decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The State recognizes that its argument is contrary to the holding in <em>Estep. </em>Nonetheless, the State maintains that the plain language of the constitutional provision, specifically, the phrase \u201cupon the decision or determination of any point, or question,\u201d provides it a right to a review from an in banc panel of the circuit court in precisely this circumstance. <em>See </em>Maryland Const., art. IV, \u00a7 22 (emphasis added). The State further maintains that Article IV, section 22, gives the Court of Appeals the right to adopt rules governing the procedure for in banc appeal, but that neither courts nor the legislature can delimit the original right to appeal. The State claims that there is a distinction between a traditional appeal and in banc review and broadly argues that an in banc panel may review many points of law of a trial court, prior to a final judgment from the trial court. The State maintains that \u201cthe root of the misinterpretation\u201d in the relevant Court of Appeals cases\u2014 including <em>Estep </em>and <em>Dean, </em>supra\u2014\u201clies in the Court\u2019s sometimes imprecise references to <em>Buck[.]\u2019\u2019 </em>Finally, the State concedes that it is unlikely that it would have the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling to this Court under CJP \u00a7 12-302(c), but it states that it \u201cis not \u2018appealing\u2019 the motion court\u2019s ruling[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>In its reply brief, Phillips notes that the State conceded that it had no statutory right to appeal under CJP \u00a7 12-302 and, further, that a court cannot rule on the merits in order to determine it has the ability to rule on the merits, as the in banc panel did in the present case. Phillips further observes that section 22 states that it is \u201c \u2018subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by law[,]\u2019 \u201d which allows the legislature to circumscribe the right to appeal through such enactments as CJP \u00a7 12-301. (Quoting Maryland Const., art. IV, \u00a7 22). Phillips adds, in response to the State\u2019s argument suggesting that the Court of Appeals incorrectly decided cases on this point, that we \u201c[are] not at liberty to reinterpret \u00a7 22 in a manner inconsistent with the decisions of the higher court.\u201d Finally, Phillips reasserts the policy argument that, if we were to allow this appeal to proceed, the \u201ccircuit courts would be inundated with requests for in banc reviews of virtually every type of interlocutory ruling!,]\u201d contending that these \u201cpiecemeal appeals would clog up dockets, making it difficult for already-overburdened courts to guarantee speedy trials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">B. In Banc Review</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Judge J. Dudley Digges, writing for the Court of Appeals, offered the following commentary on section 22 and in banc review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Although the reason for section 22\u2019s inclusion in the constitution is not altogether clear, it appears to have been, as its commonly recognized nickname of \u201cthe poor person\u2019s appeal\u201d suggests, a response to a fear of the framers of the Constitution of that year that the distance to Annapolis and the concomitant delay and expense incident to prosecuting an appeal in the Court of Appeals would discourage or preclude many litigants from seeking justice by means of appellate review.<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"a8c-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Washabaugh v.

It still provides litigants, 150 years later, the right to appeal circuit court judgments to three-judge circuit court panels in certain circumstances. We next examine the contours of the right, contained in section 22, to appeal to an in banc panel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">C. Appellate Jurisdiction of an In Banc Panel</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The Court of Appeals concisely described the role and purpose of in banc review in <em>Haberlin. </em>320 Md. at 406-07, 578 A.2d 215. The in banc panel \u201cfunctions \u2018as a separate appellate tribunal, and not merely as an arm of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 578 A.2d 215 (other citations omitted) (quoting <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. McNeece, </em>311 Md. 194, 201, 533 A.2d 671 (1987)). \u201cThe purpose of the constitutional provision authorizing an in banc appeal was to provide a substitute or alternate for an appeal to the Court of Appeals or, in recent years, to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(other citations omitted) (citing <em>McNeece, </em>311 Md. at 198, 201, 533 A.2d 671). Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>... when no appeal from a circuit court order could be taken to the Court of Special Appeals (or, prior to the 1970\u215b, the Court of Appeals), then no appeal can be taken to a court in banc.

The decision of the panel does not preclude an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals by an opposing party who is otherwise entitled to appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The Court of Appeals has consistently held, upon examination of section 22 and the corresponding Maryland Rules, that a litigant may not appeal to an in banc panel when the litigant could not note an appeal to this Court successfully. <em>See, e.g., Haberlin, </em>320 Md. at 403, 578 A.2d 215; <em>Dean, </em>302 Md. at 496-97, 489 A.2d 22.

The State then noted an in banc appeal, claiming an abuse of discretion by the court in granting a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 489 A.2d 22. The in banc panel vacated the order and reinstated the convictions for the reason that the court did not provide precise findings as to its reason for the grant of a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 489 A.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Upon granting certiorari, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[t]here is no different standard[ ]\u201d \u201cof appealability to a court in banc from that to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 489 A.2d 22. The Court explained that normally a final judgment is required before a party may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to CJP \u00a7 12-301. <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that \u201c[i]t [wa]s clear that the order from which the State sought to appeal in th[at] case was not an appealable final order and thus the in banc court was without jurisdiction to consider the point reserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 489 A.2d 22 (footnote omitted). Thus, <em>Dean </em>stands for the proposition that a litigant may not appeal to an in banc panel in the circuit court if the litigant cannot also note an appeal to this Court successfully. <em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 489 A.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In <em>Dabrowski, </em>the respondent brought an action against Dabrowski &lt;&amp; Son Funeral Home after falling on the funeral home\u2019s premises. 320 Md. at 393, 578 A.2d 211. The circuit court granted a motion for judgment in favor of Dabrowski. <em>Id. </em>After respondent\u2019s timely motion for a new trial was denied, respondent filed an <em>untimely </em>request for review by an in banc panel. <em>Id. </em>The in banc panel reversed the trial court and ordered the case be set for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 578 A.2d 211. The petitioner, Dabrowski, then timely filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Id. </em>This Court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the order by the in banc panel was not a final appealable judgment. <em>Id. </em>After granting certiorari, the Court of Appeals reversed this Court and held that the order by the in banc panel was a final appealable order under CJP \u00a7 12-301. <em>Id. </em>at 395, 578 A.2d 211. The Court cited <em>Estep </em>for the proposition that a \u201ccourt in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>banc acts only as an appellate tribunal so that its decisions are not those of a reconsidering trial court but are reviewable as final appellate judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 578 A.2d 211 (quoting <em>Estep, </em>285 Md. at 421, 404 A.2d 1040). The Court then vacated the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal and vacated the in banc panel\u2019s order, holding that the in banc panel of the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because the respondent\u2019s request for in banc review was untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 397, 578 A.2d 211. The Court reminded us that \u201ctimeliness of an order of appeal is \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 and that if an appeal is not filed within the prescribed time, \u2018the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398, 578 A.2d 211 (quoting <em>Walbert v.

In that case, respondents\u2014Ha-berlin and Plotnick\u2014opposed a liquor license application filed by a competitor. <em>Id. </em>at 401, 578 A.2d 215. After the Board of License Commissioners granted the license, the respondents sought judicial review in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court dismissed the action on the grounds that respondents\u2014competing licensees\u2014lacked standing to request judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 578 A.2d 215. When the court denied respondents\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment, the respondents sought in banc review. <em>Id. </em>The in banc panel concluded that the competing licensees had standing to seek judicial review, reversed the court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case for additional proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 402-03, 578 A.2d 215. The Board then sought an appeal in this Court; however, before we heard the case, the Court of Appeals issued a writ of certiora-ri. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 578 A.2d 215. The respondents moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that the judgment of the in banc panel was not final and appealable because the judgment did not terminate the circuit court proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The Court reiterated Dabrowski\u2019s holding that a judgment of an in banc panel of the circuit court is final and appealable to this Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Next, the Court stated that the purpose of the constitutional provision authorizing in banc review was to provide an alternative to an appeal to this Court, but, this alternative method of appeal must be authorized by statute in order for an in banc panel to assert jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 406-07, 578 A.2d 215. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">In a majority of circuit court cases, an appeal from a final judgment to the Court of Special Appeals is authorized by [CJP] \u00a7 12-801 [ ], and there are no other statutory provisions limiting or modifying the right of appeal under \u00a7 12-301. As to these ordinary cases, Art IV, \u00a7 22, of the Constitution and Rule 2-551 provide an alternate avenue of appeal to a court in banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 407, 578 A.2d 215. The Court reaffirmed its holding from prior cases that <em>\u201cwhen no appeal from a circuit court order could he taken to the Court of Special Appeals </em>(or, prior to the 1970\u2019s, the Court of Appeals), <em>then no appeal can he taken to a court in banc.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted).

The statute expressly stated that the board\u2019s decisions are final and not appealable except to resolve conflicting trial court decisions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>a legal issue. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the in banc panel lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, and the Court of Appeals vacated the in banc panel\u2019s judgement with instructions to dismiss the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 409-10, 578 A.2d 215.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The State directs us to <em>Berg, supra, </em>228 Md.App. at 266, 137 A.3d 1035.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that case, Mr. Berg filed a complaint for divorce in 2005, and the circuit court held a merits trial in 2007 in which the court awarded a $450,000.00 monetary judgment to Ms. Berg. <em>Id. </em>at 269-70, 137 A.3d 1035. Although Mr. Berg made irregular payments over the next seven years, he never satisfied the judgment, and in 2014, Ms. Berg brought a separate garnishment action. <em>Id. </em>at 270, 137 A.3d 1035. In the garnishment action, Mr. Berg objected to the manner in which Ms. Berg had applied his payments to interest, rather than principal. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court then held an evidentiary hearing and entered an order, agreeing in part with Mr. Berg. <em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 137 A.3d 1035. After Ms. Berg\u2019s timely motion to alter or amend the judgment was filed and denied, she noted an in banc appeal, and Mr. Berg contested jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 271, 137 A.3d 1035. The in banc panel ruled that it had jurisdiction and entered an order reversing the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Berg appealed to this Court, arguing that the in banc panel lacked jurisdiction for the reason that in banc appeals could only be taken from merits trials, not from issues arising long after the merits trial had been held. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 137 A.3d 1035. Mr. Berg contended that the phrase \u201cany trial is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ducted\u201d found in Article IV, section 22, of the Maryland Constitution limited in banc appeals to errors occurring during a \u201cmerits trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 137 A.3d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Relying on <em>Dean, Haberlin, </em>and the provision in section 22 which allows in banc appeals \u201cupon the decision or determination of any point, or question ... [,] \u201d we held that \u201cin banc appeals from post trial decisions ... by less than three judges are allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 137 A.3d 1035 (quoting Maryland Const., art. IV, \u00a7 22). We interpreted the word \u201ctrial\u201d used in section 22 of Article IV \u201cas meaning \u2018that step in an action by which issues or questions of fact are decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 137 A.3d 1035 (quoting <em>Miller v. Tobin, </em>18 F. 609, 616 (D. Or. 1883)). Applying this definition, we concluded that a trial was held when the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on the garnishment action and decided, based on evidence, how Mr. Berg\u2019s payments should be applied. <em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 137 A.3d 1035. In the present case, we conclude the court\u2019s four-day <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, in which testimony and evidence was presented and the court made determinations, meets this definition of a \u201ctrial.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We do not agree, however, with the interpretation of <em>Berg </em>urged by the State endorsing a sweeping right of in banc review that would include the right to appeal the grant of the motion <em>in limine </em>in the present case. First, in <em>Berg </em>we cited and relied on <em>Dean </em>and <em>Haberlin, </em>two cases holding that\u2014as stated supra\u2014the right to in banc review and the right to appeal to this Court are coextensive. <em>Berg, </em>228 Md.App. at 278, 137 A.3d 1035. Second, <em>Berg </em>was addressing a post-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>motion, <em>id. </em>at 279, 137 A.3d 1035, and the order the State appealed from in the present case is a pre-trial motion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Given that a party may appeal to an in banc panel only when it has an appeal to this Court, we turn to the relevant statutes addressing this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Generally, CJP \u00a7 12-301 provides that a final judgment is a prerequisite before a party may appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The statute .states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Except as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s grant of Phillips\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was not a final order. However, CJP \u00a7 12-301 also includes exceptions to its final judgment rule. CJP \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3)(i) is one such exception. Its text reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">In a case involving a crime of violence ..., the State may appeal from a decision of a trial court that excludes evidence offered by the State or requires the return of property <em>alleged to have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Maryland Constitution, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Before this Court the State concedes that CJP \u00a7 12-302(c) provided the State no right to appeal the trial court\u2019s eviden-tiary ruling to the Court of Special Appeals. The trial court excluded the State\u2019s evidence pursuant to <em>Frye-Reed </em>and Maryland Rule 5-702, not on federal or Maryland constitutional grounds. If the trial court had based its ruling on federal or Maryland constitutional principles, then CJP \u00a7 12-302 would have provided the State with a right to appeal to this Court or an in banc panel of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Once again, the case law is unambiguous that \u201cwhen no appeal from a circuit court order could be taken to the Court of Special Appeals ..., then no appeal can be taken to a court in banc.\u201d <em>Haberlin, </em>320 Md. at 407, 578 A.2d 215; <em>accord </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Remson v.
