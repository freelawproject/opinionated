Taylor (\u201cTaylor\u201d). The injury occurred on March 31, 2013, as Taylor opened the door of the pub and was shot in the leg. No suspect was apprehended and Taylor did not see who fired the gun. After West End\u2019s insurer, White Pine, denied West End\u2019s request to provide a defense to Taylor\u2019s claim for negligence, West End and Taylor reached a consent judgment agreement (the \u201cConsent Verdict\u201d), in which West End admitted negligence and agreed to a settlement of $100,000.00. Further, West End assigned to Taylor its claims against White Pine for denying indemnity coverage under its commercial general liability policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Thereafter, Taylor filed an action for breach of contract against White Pine seeking judgment in the amount of $74,999.99 in the Circuit Court for Washington County. After a bench trial, during which neither side presented any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>dence of the circumstances leading to the shooting (other than the Consent Verdict), the circuit court found in favor of Taylor and awarded damages in the amount of $100,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">White Pine presents three issues on appeal, which we have reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">1. Whether the circuit court erred by finding that White Pine presented insufficient evidence that Taylor's injury was excluded from coverage under the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion, and therefore, that White Pine had a duty to indemnify West End Pub for its liability to Taylor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">2. Whether the circuit court erred when it did not find that White Pine had established that the Consent Verdict between West End Pub and Taylor, in which West End Pub admitted liability for negligence, was unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">3. Whether the circuit court properly awarded damages in the amount of $100,000.00, which exceeded the $74,999.99 amount of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of Taylor\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"adv-dedup-1\">\n<em>Factual Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On the night of March 81, 2013, Taylor visited the West End Pub in Hagerstown, Maryland, not far from his apartment to watch a basketball game. Taylor began to leave the pub at approximately 1:43 a,m. As Taylor opened the door to exit, however, he was struck by a bullet in his left leg. The police did not apprehend the shooter or determine his or her identity, and the shooter\u2019s motivation for firing the gun remains unknown. Taylor testified that he did not observe anyone brandishing a gun while he was inside West End Pub, nor had he been warned that he was about to be shot. Taylor further testified that he had not heard of any prior shootings at the Pub, and he did not see who shot him or where the bullet was fired. In addition, Taylor testified that approximately ten people were standing nearby when he was shot, two of whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>were employees of the pub. No other evidence regarding the circumstances of the shooting was entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\n<em>Commercial General Liability Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On the first page of the \u201cCommercial General Liability Coverage Form,\u201d the Policy begins by noting that \u201c[vferious provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what is and is not covered.\u201d Under \u201cSection I\u2014Coverages,\u201d the Policy provides that the insurer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. [The insurer] will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking damages for \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any \u2018occurrence\u2019 and settle any claim or \u2018suit\u2019 that may result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAlAX\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">This insurance applies to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">(1) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d is caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d that takes place in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">(2) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurs during the policy period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(3) Prior to the policy period, no insured ... and no \u201cemployee\u201d authorized by [the named insured] to give or receive notice of an \u201coccurrence\u201d or claim, knew that the \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d had occurred in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Under Section IV\u2014\u201cCommercial General Liability Conditions,\u201d regarding third-party actions against the insurer, the Policy provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>sured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us, the insured and the claimant or the claimant\u2019s legal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Finally, Section V\u2014\u201cDefinitions\u201d\u2014defines several terms used in the Policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAxFA\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cOccurrence\u201d means <em>an accident, </em>including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAS2u\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">\u201cSuit\u201d means a civil proceeding in which damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d ... to which this insurance applies are alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">The \u201cAssault, Battery, or Assault and Battery Exclusion\u201d (\u201cAssault and Battery Exclusion\u201d) is an endorsement, which is attached to the Policy.

West End requested a defense and indemnification from White Pine and White Pine denied the request, asserting that the shooting incident was not covered under the Policy. West End and Taylor agreed to settle and the circuit court entered a Consent Verdict in the amount of $100,000.00 for medical expenses and noneconomic damages. Under the terms of the Consent Verdict, West End assigned to Taylor all of its rights, interests, claims, actions, and suits, including extra contractual and punitive damage claims against West End\u2019s insurer, White Pine, for breach of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Thereafter, Taylor made a demand on White Pine for payment, including medical payment benefits, which White Pine denied for the same reasons that it denied West End a defense and indemnification. Taylor filed his Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>against White Pine for breach of contract on March 12, 2015, and White Pine filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief. On or around June 4, 2015, White Pine moved for summary judgment, which the circuit court denied. Both parties presented oral arguments during open court proceedings on March 10, 2016. White Pine moved for judgment at the close of Taylor\u2019s case and renewed the motion at the close of all evidence. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">During the proceedings, Taylor\u2019s counsel argued that Taylor\u2019s injury was covered under the insurance policy, and White Pine argued that the Assault and Battery Exclusion removed the incident from coverage under the Policy. Taylor\u2019s counsel argued that White Pine failed to show that Taylor\u2019s injury was the result of an \u201cassault\u201d or a \u201cbattery.\u201d White Pine argued, and continues to argue on appeal, that the fact that Taylor was shot by a gun is enough to show that the incident constituted a battery, as there is no intent requirement under the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbattery.\u201d In ruling on White Pine\u2019s motion for judgment, the tidal court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">I have to admit that as I was listening to the testimony, the\u2014the brief testimony of Mr. Taylor, it did occur to me that I don\u2019t know what happened. I know he was, based on this testimony, he was shot. That doesn\u2019t seem to be in dispute here. But how\u2014how that happened, I\u2014I don\u2019t know. And I think it\u2019s very easy to have a knee-jerk reaction and say, \u201cWell clearly it\u2019s an assault and battery. If a person\u2019s shot, it\u2019s an assault and battery.\u201d But that\u2019s not necessarily\u2014that\u2019s not necessarily the case .... [I]f I don\u2019t know what happened, then I don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s an assault and battery. And if I can\u2019t say it\u2019s an assault and battery, then I can\u2019t apply ... the exclusion in that contract. So at this time, the Motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">In its defense, White Pine presented one witness\u2014Lauren O\u2019Shea\u2014a Senior Claims Analyst with Conifer Holdings, Inc., of which White Pine Insurance Company is a subsidiary. Through O\u2019Shea\u2019s testimony, White Pine offered into evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the process through which White Pine had reviewed and denied Taylor\u2019s requests and claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">After the presentation of O\u2019Shea\u2019s testimony, White Pine rested its defense and renewed its motion. Counsel for White Pine focused exclusively on the language of the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion. She argued that the exclusion requires that the act be \u201ccommitted by any person.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf you cut yourself on a glass, that\u2019s an accident. But if some person engages in an act which brings about a harmful or offensive contact, that wouldn\u2019t be covered.\u201d The court explained, however, \u201cI don\u2019t have any evidence that another person did that .... I think there\u2019s ... a leap happening here that someone ... shot him.\u201d The court responded, \u201cCan a gun discharge accidentally? Yes .... [C]an a bullet go through the air not intentionally?\u201d Counsel for White Pine attempted to reconcile the difference between an \u201caccident\u201d under the Policy and a \u201cbattery\u201d in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">Sure it can .... But it\u2019s done by a person and it\u2019s an act which brings about a harmful and offensive contact. We don\u2019t need to show for the analysis of this policy that somebody intended to shoot, somebody intended to discharge their gun .... [A]s it\u2019s defined in this policy, it\u2019s whether a person commits an act which brings about a harmful or offensive result. So yes, if it were an accidental discharge of a gun by a person, yes, I would submit that we would still be here saying that this exclusion applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Finally, the court asked, \u201c[I]sn\u2019t it the same scenario as the waitress handing me a broken glass? It\u2019s an act done by another person accidentally that causes me harm.\u201d Counsel for White Pine responded, \u201cI guess ... suppose for ... argument\u2019s sake, perhaps I would be here arguing under that factual scenario that ... in that particular situation, this endorsement would apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On May 4, 2016, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of Taylor in the amount of $100,000.00, the full amount of the Consent Verdict, and denied White Pine\u2019s request for declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tory relief. White Pine filed a timely appeal. Additional facts are discussed herein as they become relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(e), \u201c[w]hen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous ....\u201d To the extent this case involves questions of law, including the interpretation of a contract, we review for legal error. <em>See Clickner v. Magothy River Ass</em>'n, 424 Md. 253, 266-67, 35 A.3d 464 (2012) (quoting <em>Dickerson v. Longoria, </em>414 Md. 419, 432, 995 A.2d 721 (2010)) (\u201cWhere a case involves both issues of fact and questions of law, this Court will apply the appropriate standard to each issue\u201d). \u201cThe interpretation of a contract, including the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law .... \u201d <em>SpaceSaver Systems, Inc. v. Adam, </em>440 Md. 1, 8, 98 (A.3d 264 2014) (citing <em>Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 78, 862 A.2d 941 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">II. The Circuit Court Did Not Err by Finding that White Pine Did Not Meet Its Burden to Show that the Assault and Battery Exclusion Applied to Preclude Coverage for Taylor\u2019s Injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The critical issue in this case is whether the circuit court erred by finding that White Pine failed to establish that Taylor\u2019s injuries were excluded from coverage as a \u201cbattery\u201d as defined in the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion. Our focus, therefore, is on the evidence presented at trial and the interpretation and applicability of the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbattery.\u201d The only evidence presented regarding Taylor\u2019s injuries at West End, however, established only that a bullet hit him in the leg as he opened the door to leave the pub and that he did not know who shot him or from where the bullet was fired. Neither side presented any evidence to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>court tending to show that the shooting was intentional rather than \u201caccidental.\u201d In other words, the trial court had no evidence before it regarding whether or not the shooter intended to harm another person, to put another person in apprehension of harm, or to set a force in motion that ultimately led to Taylor\u2019s shooting injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Nevertheless, on appeal, White Pine frames the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">The trial court based its ruling on the illogical and specious assertion that the evidence did not provide \u201cinformation ... as to how the injury occurred,\u201d presumably because the assailant\u2019s identity and location were unknown, notwithstanding the incontrovertible agreement that Taylor was shot by a gun. The court then followed that fallacy with the concern that it could not \u201cleap to the conclusion\u201d that the shooting of a bystander was \u201can assault, battery, or assault and battery simply because it is a gunshot.\u201d Put quite simply, if shooting someone isn\u2019t a battery, it is hard to say what is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Despite White Pine\u2019s simplistic characterization of the result it seeks in this case, the combination of two specific facts distinguishes this case from other cases addressed previously in our case law. First, the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbattery\u201d in the Assault and Battery Exclusion, at least ostensibly, does not require any particular state of mind. Other cases, decided on different grounds, have involved policies that do not define assault and battery, but leave the determination of whether an assault or battery occurred to be decided in an underlying tort case or related criminal prosecution. <em>See, e.g., 7416 Baltimore Ave. Corp, v. Penn-Am. Ins. Co., </em>83 Md.App. 692, 695, 698, 577 A.2d 398 (1990) (concluding that, where an exclusion in the Policy excludes \u201cclaims arising out of Assault and Battery,\u201d the issue must \u201cbe resolved in the tort action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Second, the shooter in this case was not identified or apprehended. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>any person, including Taylor, witnessed any person shoot Taylor or of any other circumstance leading to the shooting. Whereas in other cases, the evidence presented tended to indicate the shooter\u2019s intent to commit a battery or assault\u2014 such as evidence of an altercation preceding the injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014the absence of this kind of evidence raises the issue of whether the intent of the shooter must be established to distinguish the injury from one that simply arises out of an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">White Pine alternates between two varying positions in arguing that evidence of the cause of or intent behind the shooting is immaterial. On one hand, when White Pine confronts the issue of whether it must establish the intent of the shooter, White Pine argues that we should rely principally on the Policy\u2019s definition of the term \u201cbattery,\u201d which White Pine asserts requires no evidence of the shooter\u2019s state of mind. Nevertheless, without any state of mind requirement, the Policy\u2019s definition of a \u201cbattery\u201d blurs the line between a covered bodily injury as a result of an \u201caccident\u201d and an excluded bodily injury that conceivably arose out of \u201can act which brings about harmful or offensive contact to another\u201d\u2014 the policy\u2019s definition of a \u201cbattery.\u201d Alternatively, when White Pine is faced with the ambiguity raised by the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbattery\u201d in the context of the Policy as a whole, White Pine argues that the Policy\u2019s definition is consistent with a commonsense understanding of the definition of a battery<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within criminal and civil common law contexts. As explained <em>below, </em>however, definitions of battery under both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>criminal and civil law require that the person committing the battery intend to commit some particular act or possess some other culpable state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The rather unique facts of this case raise the question of whether the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion can, properly, exclude from coverage bodily injuries and property damage arising out of <em>any </em>\u201charmful or offensive contact of another.\u201d Put differently, either the Policy\u2019s exclusion bars from coverage all bodily injuries and property damage that arise out of \u201can act which brings about harmful or offensive contact to another\u201d (and it is therefore inconsistent with common law definitions of battery), or White Pine was required to show more than the mere fact that Taylor was shot in order to establish that his injury fell within the exclusion. Indeed, not even White Pine\u2019s counsel\u2014albeit understandably\u2014could reconcile the assertion that virtually all bodily injuries caused by another person are barred from coverage with the Policy\u2019s overall purpose of providing general commercial liability insurance for bodily injuries and property damage arising out of \u201caccidents.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">For the reasons discussed herein, we hold that the circuit court did not err in its finding that White Pine failed to establish that it had no duty to indemnify West End Pub for Taylor\u2019s bodily injury under the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>A. White Pine had the Burden of Establishing that the Exclusion Applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Although the insured has the burden of establishing that a claim falls within the scope of coverage, the insured may meet that burden by showing proof of a valid settlement agreement. <em>See Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp. v. Beebe-Lee, </em>431 Md. 474, 493-94, 66 A.3d 615 (2013). Typically, if the insured establishes that an injury is within the scope of coverage, the burden shifts to the insurer to establish that an exclusion removes the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify. <em>See, e.g., Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of Calvert County v. Ackerman, </em>162 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 872 A.2d 110 (2005) (affirming a circuit court\u2019s decision to place the burden on the insurer to establish whether a house was being used as a \u201cdwelling\u201d at the time of a fire, because the relevant clause in the policy that the insurer argued relieved it of liability constituted an exclusion from coverage). In other words, where an insurer claims that an exclusion removes the insurer\u2019s obligation to indemnify the insured, the insurer bears the burden of showing that the exclusion applies. <em>See id.; Beebe-Lee, supra, </em>431 Md. at 489, 66 A.3d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In the instant case, the circuit court found that Taylor had met his initial burden of proof, that his bodily injury fell within the scope of the commercial liability policy. Taylor entered into evidence the Consent Verdict in which West End admitted to negligence and agreed to a settlement for which West End was liable. Further, Taylor testified at trial and recalled that he had no warning of the shooting and no knowledge of who shot him or even the direction of the bullet. In its defense, White Pine did not present any evidence at all relevant to the cause of the shooting.

Our task in interpreting the Policy\u2019s exclusion, therefore, is to decide whether the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbattery\u201d eliminates White Pine\u2019s duty of indemnification for all \u201cbodily injuries\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d that \u201caris[e] out of or result[ ] from\u201d \u201can act which brings about harmful or offensive contact to another,\u201d whether or not the act was \u201caccidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Interpreting the definition of \u201cbattery\u201d in the context of the remainder of the Assault and Battery Exclusion and the purpose of the Policy as a whole, however, provides an alternative, reasonable interpretation of the scope of the exclusion. First, the Assault and Battery Exclusion provides that \u201cassaults,\u201d \u201cbatteries,\u201d or acts combining the two that are excluded under the Policy are acts that are <em>\u201ccommitted </em>by any person.\u201d Although the Policy does not define the term \u201ccommit,\u201d the plain meaning of the term commonly refers to intentional acts, such as the commission of a crime. <em>See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(11th ed. 2011) (defining \u201ccommit\u201d as \u201cto carry into action deliberately: perpetrate,\u201d e.g. to <em>perpetrate </em>a crime); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201ccommit\u201d as \u201cto perpetrate (a crime)\u201d). In the context of excluding injuries arising from an \u201cAssault,\u201d \u201cBattery,\u201d or \u201cAssault and Battery\u201d\u2014legal concepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that generally refer only to intentional torts\u2014the term \u201ccommit\u201d reinforces the interpretation that the exclusion is arguably limited to intentional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Secondly, as the Court of Appeals has explained, \u201c[i]t is universally understood that some form of intent is required for battery.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Carroll, </em>355 Md. 593, 601, 735 A.2d 1096 (1999). Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[i]ntentional torts, as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts,\u201d \u201cgenerally require that the actor intend \u2018the consequences of an act.\u2019<em>\u201d Kawaauhau v. Geiger, </em>523 U.S. 57, 61-62, 118 S.Ct. 974, 140 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 8A, cmt. a (1964)). Clearly, the element of intent, or the state of mind of the actor, is at the very core of what sets apart negligent acts from intentional torts; perhaps two of the most quintessential of intentional torts at common law are the torts of assault and battery. <em>See </em>Kenneth J. Yandevelde, <em>A History of Prima Facie Tort: The Origins of a General Theory of Intentional Tort, </em>19 Hofstra L. Rev. 447, 450 (1990). To use the language of intentional tort law to encompass accidental acts without explicitly and conspicuously stating such a scope provides a lack of clarity that the law demands from insurers as the drafters of coverage exclusions. <em>See Megonnell, supra, </em>368 Md. at 656, 796 A.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Finally, the Policy\u2019s definition of a \u201cbattery\u201d as a \u201charmful or offensive contact\u201d tracks the language of battery at common law, but the definition is silent as to whether a particular state of mind is required. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this definition can include both intentional and unintentional acts as White Pine asserts, this definition of battery provides no way to distinguish between an act that results in a \u201cbattery\u201d and an \u201caccidental\u201d or negligent act if any cause of bodily injury is set in motion by any person other than the one who is injured. If such a limited scope of coverage under the Policy was intended, White Pine, as the drafter of the Policy could have identified such limitations explicitly in the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>exclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Leaving the definition of battery silent on the issue of intentionality, however, is misleading as to the scope of the exclusion. <em>See JMP Associates, Inc., </em>345 Md. at 635, 693 A.2d 832 (explaining that the test of a provision\u2019s meaning \u201cis what meaning a reasonably prudent layperson would attach to the term\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Although an insurer has a right to determine what \u201coccurrences\u201d it will cover or exclude as the drafter of the Policy, when an exclusion lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation, the exclusion will be construed narrowly against the insurer. <em>See Blackstone Int\u2019l Ltd., supra, </em>442 Md. at 695, 114 A.3d 676. The insured has a right to know the extent to which exclusions from coverage will apply when entering into a contract for insurance, and the position that White Pine advocates provides no clear path to defining the limits under the Policy. Due to the ambiguous nature of the Policy\u2019s coverage and limitations, we construe the scope of the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion against White Pine as the drafter of the Policy. <em>See id. </em>We, therefore, interpret the scope of the Assault and Battery Exclusion narrowly to bar coverage for bodily injuries that arise out of a \u201cbattery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">C. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Its Determination that White Pine Failed to Establish that Taylor\u2019s Injury Arose Out of a Battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">As White Pine concedes, if the definition of \u201cbattery\u201d under the Policy is ambiguous, \u201cthe means to resolve that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ambiguity would be to resort to the ordinary definition of battery and its interpretations in other cases.\u201d White Pine argues that the Policy\u2019s \u201cdefinition of a battery matches the definition in both criminal and civil common law.\u201d Further, White Pine asserts, \u201cby every definition and understanding, shooting someone is a battery.\u201d Although inconsistent with White Pine\u2019s assertion that a shooter\u2019s intent is immaterial to the elements of battery, White Pine refers to definitions of battery as it is defined under Maryland law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">In criminal law, a battery results from \u201cproof that the perpetrator intended to cause harmful or offensive contact against a person without that person\u2019s consent and without legal justification.\u201d <em>Hickman v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 238, 257 [996 A.2d 974] ... (2010). The necessary intent can be found in the concept of transferred intent, which \u201capplies to \u2018bad aim cases,\u2019 where a defendant shoots at X, misses, and hits Y instead.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 208 [214, 73 A.3d 1136] (2013)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">(Emphasis omitted). \u201cIn civil law,\u201d White Pine notes, a battery occurs \u201cwhen one intends a harmful or offensive contact with another without that person\u2019s consent.\u201d (Citations omitted). In its attempt to compare the Policy\u2019s definition of battery with common law definitions, however, White Pine fails to note that both of the civil and criminal law definitions to which it refers include intent as a necessary element of battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In Maryland, the intentional tort of battery is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeH\">the intentional touching of a person without that person\u2019s consent.

In support of its argument, White Pine points to the United States District Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Boxley, </em>215 F.Supp.2d 656 (D. Md. 2002). In <em>Boxley, </em>the court relied on Maryland law to determine that an injury arose out of a \u201cbattery.\u201d White Pine argues that <em>Boxley </em>is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the instant case. The court in <em>Boxley, </em>however, relied on evidence of the circumstances leading to the shooting relevant to the shooter\u2019s intent to commit an assault, and the court\u2019s analysis underscores the significance of the absence of this evidence in the present case regarding Taylor\u2019s injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">Boxley fails to address [the argument that the shooter had the requisite intent to commit an assault] and would be hard-pressed to do so. In this case, as in <em>Nelson, </em>the perpetrator was carrying a loaded gun, which he brandished and then discharged numerous times. All of this occurred in connection with a loud argument with Davis. <em>If the shooter did not intend to harm Davis, the only other reasonable conclusion </em>which can be drawn from this set of tragic circumstances <em>is that the perpetrator intended to cause Davis an imminent apprehension of such harm. </em>Indeed, <em>Boxley </em>recognizes that there is simply no other plausible explanation, as he does not proffer any other theory, stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>only that the shooter intended not to shoot Davis \u201cbut to warn him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 663 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">More specifically, the element of the shooter\u2019s intent to commit an assault was a prominent focus of the District Court\u2019s analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Indeed, whether the shooter even intended to hit Davis is of no legal consequence. As explained in <em>Nelson, </em>the Court of Appeals of Maryland has reiterated the rule that if one commits an assault, and in the course of committing the assault that person comes into contact with the person assaulted, <em>the intent element of battery may be supplied by the intent element of the assault. Nelson, </em>735 A.2d at 1102. Accordingly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">one who <em>intends to frighten </em>another by assaulting him or her, and touches this person in a harmful or offensive manner and claims the touching was inadvertent or accidental, is liable for battery, notwithstanding the contention that the actual touching was never intended. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajq\"><em>Boxley, </em>215 F.Supp.2d at 662-63 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">As the District Court observed, to determine \u201cintent\u201d in a civil battery case involving a shooting, the focus is not on whether the shooter intended to shoot the victim, but rather, whether the shooter intended to \u201cset[ ] a force in motion which ultimately produces the result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 735 A.2d 1096 (citing <em>Nelson, </em>355 Md. at 602, 735 A.2d 1096),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cConsequently,\u201d the court added, \u201ca purely accidental touching is not sufficient to establish the intent requirement for battery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">In <em>Boxley, </em>the shooter\u2019s intent to commit an assault was determinative of the applicability of the Assault and Battery Exclusion. Rather than support White Pine\u2019s contention that evidence of the shooter\u2019s intent is immaterial, <em>Boxley </em>high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>lights the importance of the court\u2019s analysis of evidence relevant to the shooter\u2019s intent. As the trial court observed repeatedly, White Pine presented no evidence to support any inference that any person intended to fire the gun that resulted in Taylor\u2019s injury. White Pine presented no evidence that Taylor argued with the shooter before the shooting, that the shooter intended to harm some other person such as in a \u201cbad aim\u201d or \u201ctransferred intent\u201d case, or even that the shooter had the requisite intent to commit an assault. Indeed, White Pine presented no evidence at all regarding the circumstances leading to the shooting, despite its burden to prove that the exclusion applied. <em>See Beebe-Lee, supra, </em>431 Md. at 493, 66 A.3d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">White Pine argues further that evidence that \u201cTaylor did not see a gun, did not see the assailant, and had no warning of the impending shooting\u201d ... \u201csupports] solely the conclusion that the shooting was unwelcome, offensive, and without consent\u2014a battery of Taylor.\u201d Whether Taylor consented to the shooting is not at issue in this case, as the trial court could reasonably infer that Taylor did not consent to being shot accidentally or unintentionally and still find that a battery had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">White Pine adds that, had the shooter been caught, that person would have been successfully prosecuted \u201cregardless of whether the shooter intended to hit Taylor or simply had \u2018bad aim.\u2019 \u201d To the extent that White Pine argues that intent is irrelevant to proving the battery version of criminal assault in Maryland, we disagree. White Pine assumes, without putting forward any evidence in the court below, that the shooter intended to hit some person, whether or not that person was Taylor. The trial court, however, had no evidence from which it could infer the shooter\u2019s intent such that a theory of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d or \u201cbad aim\u201d could apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We do not agree with White Pine, therefore, that the intent of the shooter is immaterial for determining whether the act leading to the injury constitutes a battery under either civil or criminal law definitions of a battery. In our view, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>shooter\u2019s intent is relevant under either a civil or criminal definition of battery. The primary question we must answer in this case is not whether a \u201cbattery\u201d occurred, but whether the circuit court erred by finding that White Pine failed to establish that Taylor\u2019s injuries arose.out of a battery thereby excluding indemnity coverage under the Policy. The focus of our review, therefore, is concentrated on whether White Pine was required to establish more than the mere fact that Taylor was shot in order to establish that his injury arose out of a battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Clearly, a shooting in many cases would constitute a \u201cbattery\u201d under the common law tort and criminal definitions. Nevertheless, White Pine had the burden of establishing that the exclusion from coverage applied to the facts of this particular case. <em>See Beebe-Lee, supra, </em>431 Md. at 493, 66 A.3d 615. Without sufficient evidence that the exclusion applied, the trial court did not err in failing to issue a declaratory judgment in favor of White Pine, the effect of which would have been to find as a matter of law that a battery had occurred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that the circuit court did not err in finding that White Pine failed to establish that the Policy\u2019s Assault and Battery Exclusion applied to remove White Pine\u2019s obligation to indemnify West End Pub for its liability to Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">III. The Circuit Court Did Not Err by Denying White Pine\u2019s Request for an Order Finding that the Consent Verdict Between Taylor and West End Pub was Unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">White Pine further argues that the circuit court erred when it refused to find that the Consent Verdict between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Taylor and West End Pub was unreasonable regarding West End Pub\u2019s admission of liability for negligence and the amount of the judgment. At the heart of White Pine\u2019s argument that the circuit court should have found the Consent Verdict unreasonable is White Pine\u2019s assertion that \u201cTaylor did not offer any evidence of the reasonableness of the admission of liability and judgment and so failed in his ... burden of proof.\u201d Even by the evidentiary framework offered by White Pine, however, White Pine had \u201cthe burden of producing sufficient evidence to legitimately create an issue\u201d as the party challenging the settlement. <em>Port E. Transfer, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 376, 387, 624 A.2d 520 (1993). In other words, White Pine, at a minimum, was required to create an issue properly before the court before Taylor, as a proxy for the insured, was required to refute any evidence of unreasonableness. <em>See id. </em>(outlining a parallel burden of proof framework where the insurer, rather than the insured, negotiated the settlement at issue and the insured challenged the reasonableness of the settlement). The circuit court did not find, however, that White Pine produced sufficient evidence to support its argument that the Consent Verdict was unreasonable under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">White Pine argued the following before the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">I have a long litany of cases that address the fact that an [unjforseen shooting is something that would not bind ... the establishment .... Mr, Taylor\u2019s testimony confirmed that there were no fights that night. He had never heard of any prior shootings. So we would submit that admission of liability is unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Although White Pine points to several cases in which a landlord or premises owner was found to have no duty to protect tenants or invitees against crimes committed by third parties, the only evidence presented by White Pine relevant to West End Pub\u2019s defenses to liability was Taylor\u2019s own lack of personal knowledge of prior shootings at West End Pub. To the extent that White Pine argues that it was unreasonable for West End to agree to a settlement because West End could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>have successfully defended Taylor\u2019s claims, Taylor\u2019s lack of knowledge provides no support that West End had no prior knowledge of dangerous conditions on its premises such that the settlement was unreasonable. White Pine presented no testimony regarding West End\u2019s knowledge or lack of knowledge of dangerous conditions or the history of dangerous conditions on the premises. The only other evidence put forth by White Pine was the testimony of an agent of White Pine\u2019s parent company who recounted only that White Pine denied West End\u2019s requests for a defense and Taylor\u2019s demands for indemnity as the assignee of West End\u2019s rights under the Policy. Additionally, the witness recalled that White Pine conducted a \u201cbrief investigation ... just to perform our due diligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">To be sure, an insurer has a right to challenge the reasonableness of a settlement for which it may be held liable, even when it declines to provide a defense to the insured. <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co. v. Nat\u2019l Paving &amp; Contracting Co., </em>228 Md. 40, 48, 178 A.2d 872 (1962). The insured, however, whose insurer has refused to provide a defense and is left to litigate the complaint on his or her own is entitled to \u201cmake a reasonable compromise of the suit without losing his right to recover from the insurer under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48,178 A,2d 872. Under these circumstances, a provision in the policy requiring the insurer\u2019s consent or participation in a settlement to be bound by the settlement is effectively waived. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The circuit court was presented with the medical bills, lost wages, and other damages claimed by Taylor. In addition, the circuit court had before it West End Pub\u2019s admission of wrongdoing in the Consent Verdict. White Pine was not able to produce evidence during the trial that was sufficient to create an issue properly before the trier of fact on the issue of the unreasonableness of the Consent Verdict. Without sufficient evidence, the circuit court properly denied White Pine\u2019s request for a declaration that the Consent Verdict and the amount of the settlement was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>IY. The Circuit Court Erred in Awarding Judgment in Excess of the Amount Sought by Taylor in the <em>Ad Damnum </em>Clause of the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Finally, White Pine argues that the circuit court erred by awarding an amount above the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of the complaint. Maryland Rule 2-305 requires that \u201c[a] pleading that sets forth a claim for relief, ... shall contain a clear statement of the facts necessary to constitute a cause of action and a demand for judgment for relief sought. Unless otherwise required by law, a demand for a money judgment shall include the amount sought.\u201d In addition, Md. Rule 2-341 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] party may file an amendment to a pleading after the dates set forth in section (a) of this Rule only with leave of court.\u201d The Committee note to Rule 2-341 provides that \u201c[t]he court may grant leave to amend the amount sought in a demand for a money judgment after a jury verdict is returned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In this ease, the circuit court heard the case without a jury and the court awarded damages in excess of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause. We treat the circuit court\u2019s award of damages as the entry of judgment pursuant to a jury award. Although Taylor\u2019s complaint stated a claim for damages in the amount of $74,999.99, the circuit court awarded judgment in the amount of $100,000.00\u2014the full amount of the Consent Verdict between Taylor and West End Pub and the maximum amount of coverage under the Policy. Taylor did not file a proper motion to amend the <em>ad damnum </em>clause even after the court returned its verdict in excess of the amount requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Much of our case law in this area addresses whether a circuit court may grant leave to amend the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of the complaint, particularly where a jury has already returned a verdict awarding damages in excess of the <em>ad dam-num </em>clause. In <em>Bijou v. </em>Young-Battle, 185 Md.App. 268, 969 A.2d 1034 (2009), we reviewed in depth the various rule changes and implications regarding the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant leave to amend an <em>ad damnum </em>clause. To be sure, the circuit court\u2019s judgment cannot be reversed on the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>basis that the court awarded an amount above what was requested in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause. Md. Rule 8-604(c)(2) (\u201cA judgment will not be reversed because it is for a larger amount than claimed in the complaint if the plaintiff files in the appellate court a release of the excess.\u201d). In <em>Bijou, </em>however, we held that \u201cas a general rule, a circuit court, in the absence of an amendment to the <em>ad damnum, </em>commits error by not reducing the judgment to the amount of the <em>ad </em>damnum....\u201d 185 Md.App. at 290-91, 969 A.2d 1034. Further, we explained that the Court of Appeals in amending the Rules \u201cmaintained the requirement that the amount of money damages sought be plead and that, to save the verdict on appeal, any excess of the <em>ad damnum </em>be released.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 969 A.2d 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Taylor concedes that the circuit court\u2019s award of $100,000.00 exceeded the amount originally sought in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause, and that he did not seek to amend the amount of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause; therefore, Taylor\u2019s counsel does not dispute that the amount of the circuit court\u2019s award should be lowered to $74,999.99. Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment of $100,000.00 and remand for the entry of a judgment in favor of Taylor against White Pine Insurance Company in the amount of $74,999.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART. THE JUDGMENT ENTERED BELOW IN THE AMOUNT OF $100,000.00 IS HEREBY VACATED, AND THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF HOWARD TAYLOR AGAINST WHITE PINE INSURANCE COMPANY IN THE AMOUNT OF $74,999.99.

During oral argument before the circuit court, counsel for White Pine argued that a gunshot injury is excluded pursuant to the Policy's definition of \"battery,\u201d even if the discharge is accidental, because \"it\u2019s done by a person and it\u2019s an act which brings about a harmful and offensive contact.\u201d Noting the Policy\u2019s use of the language \"committed by any person,\u201d she offered the distinction between an act \"committed\u201d by another person and a \"slip and fall\u201d injury\u2014a covered \"accident.\u201d The court responded, \"Well isn\u2019t that the same scenario as the waitress handing me a broken glass? It\u2019s an act done by another person accidentally that causes me harm. I put it in my mouth, and I'm cut because she gave me a broken glass.\u201d White Pine's counsel tentatively conceded that perhaps that scenario may fall under White Pine\u2019s interpretation of the Policy's definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\">. White Pine put forth this argument before the circuit court, arguing that \"[t]he only thing that needs to be shown is if it\u2019s a harmful contact. That\u2019s how this policy defines it. There was a harmful contact and, unfortunately, there is no coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">. For example, similar assault and battery exclusions involved in cases from other jurisdictions have excluded \"harmful or offensive contact between two or more persons\u201d adding the language, \u201cregardless of degree of culpability or intent.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Miami Beach Entertainment, Inc. v. First Oak Brook Corp., </em>682 So.2d 161, 162 (Fla. 1996). We note, however, that even when the policy\u2019s language explicitly and conspicuously includes both intentional and unintentional conduct, some courts have found that \u201cremoving] 'culpability or intent' from the definition of battery simply renders the term meaningless\u201d and \"creates an exclusion that swallows up the coverage the [pjolicy purports to provide for claims arising from 'bodily injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Canopius U.S. Ins., Inc. v.

In Maryland, the crime of \"battery\u201d and its common law elements have been consolidated into Maryland\u2019s \"assault\u201d statutes. <em>See </em>Md. Code (2002, Repl.

Further, in its application of Maryland law to the facts in <em>Boxley, </em>the District Court reiterated the statement by the Court in <em>Nelson: </em>\"[I]t is universally accepted that some form of intent is required for battery .... \u201d 215 F.Supp.2d at 662 (citing <em>Nelson, supra, </em>355 Md. at 601, 735 A.2d 1096).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">.

At trial, White Pines did not rule out the (remote) possibility that Mr, Taylor was shot by a sleepwalker or that he was wounded after someone carelessly dropped a loaded weapon. For that reason, I agree that the circuit court was not compelled to rule in White Pine\u2019s favor at trial. If White Pine put on some admissible evidence to show that someone intended to fire the shot that injured Mr. Taylor, and if Mr. Taylor had persisted in his professed ignorance about how the shooting occurred, I do not see how the court could have failed to rule in White Pine\u2019s favor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
