After the captain\u2019s conduct came to light, the fire department terminated his employment. He applied for retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The Board of Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System denied the captain\u2019s application on the ground that he had not rendered \u201chonorable and faithful service as an employee,\u201d a condition for the receipt of benefits under the Baltimore County Code. The Baltimore County Board of Appeals affirmed that determination, and the Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The captain appealed to this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">A. Captain Priester</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Theodore C. Priester, Jr., joined the Baltimore County Fire Department in 1982. He received many commendations throughout his career, including a Silver Star for heroic conduct in fighting a fire. He became a lieutenant in 1992 and a captain in 1999. By March of 2013, he had acquired the rank of Fire Captain and was in charge of Fire Station 18 in Randallstown.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">B. The \u201cBathroom Incident\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">At Station 18 the downstairs bathroom had been designated as the women\u2019s bathroom. Notwithstanding that designation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Captain Priester would sometimes use the downstairs bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Kathleen Duncan-Fulton, an Emergency Medical Technician (or \u201cEMT\u201d), was sometimes responsible for cleaning the women\u2019s bathroom. On several occasions, she had complained to a superior officer about Captain Priester\u2019s use of the women\u2019s bathroom. According to EMT Duncan-Fulton, Captain Priester would not flush the toilet or clean up after himself, and he would leave the bathroom in what she called a \u201cdisgusting\u201d condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">On the afternoon of March 15, 2013, Captain Priester, who is over six feet tall and weighs more than 300 pounds, leaned over EMT Duncan-Fulton in the station\u2019s kitchen and, in a loud voice, demanded to know whether she had complained about him using the downstairs bathroom. She said, yes. He responded: \u201cThis is my house, and I\u2019ll shit wherever I want.\u201d He added that she was \u201csupposed to clean the bathroom and like it.\u201d He threatened to remove her from duty if she refused to clean the bathroom. A number of employees witnessed some or all of this exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">EMT Duncan-Fulton told Captain Priester that he was creating a hostile work environment because of his tone of voice. He ordered her to meet him in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">When EMT Duncan-Fulton met with the captain in his office a few minutes later, he denied that he had yelled her. He said: \u201c[Everybody here\u2019s going to be a witness that I didn\u2019t yell at you the way you\u2019re saying I did.\u201d She responded: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. They\u2019ll take your side because you let them do whatever the fuck they want.\u201d He told her to leave, and she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">EMT Duncan-Fulton was extremely upset by Captain Priester\u2019s aggressive demeanor and his threat to remove her. She called a superior officer, Captain Thomas Hoffman, who intervened and obtained an apology from Captain Priester.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On the following day, EMT Duncan-Fulton met with Captain Hoffman and Captain Franklin E. Penn Jr. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>meeting she reported that Captain Priester had begun to complain about her job performance after she resisted his unwelcome advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">C. The Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">EMT Duncan-Fulton\u2019s complaint prompted an internal investigation. In the meantime, on March 22, 2013, Captain Priester was summarily suspended from duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The investigation uncovered allegations that Captain Pries-ter had sexually harassed numerous female employees, as well as at least one civilian. The alleged harassment occurred while the captain was on duty and, in many instances, in the presence of other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">At the close of the investigation, on April 9, 2013, the fire department issued a notification of charges, which summarized the allegations against Captain Priester. In total, the captain was charged with 19 violations of the fire department\u2019s rules and regulations and two violations of County rules. The charges included violations of multiple departmental regulations concerning a captain\u2019s duty, a violation of the fire department\u2019s fair practices policy, and a violation of the County\u2019s sexual harassment policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">D. The Termination of Captain Priester\u2019s Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The Department\u2019s Administrative Hearing Board held a hearing on the charges against Captain Priester on April 30, 2013. Although the captain had initially protested that he had \u201cbeen falsely accused\u201d of sexually harassing female employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>he advised the board that he wished to plead no contest and to submit a letter expressing remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In his letter Captain Priester expressed regret and remorse, apologized \u201cfor any negative light shown on the department,\u201d and asked for \u201cdue consideration\u201d for his faithful service throughout his career. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Obviously, had any person advised me that they took offense to personal actions, comments, or gestures I would have immediately ceased and desisted. I have always been of a joking and flirtatious character. The Fire Department has changed drastically over these past 30 years. Sadly I must admit, that while climbing the infamous \u201cDinosaur List\u201d the department has left me behind. I realize that the responsibility falls completely to me to keep up with the changing times. I am especially accountable in my rank of Fire Captain and held to a higher standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">At another point in the letter, Captain Priester referred to the \u201chorseplay, hazing, practical jokes, and basic clowning around of the \u2018old fire department.\u2019 \u201d He expressed his desire to be allowed to retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The board found Captain Priester guilty of 19 of the 21 charges against him and recommended that his employment be terminated. The Fire Chief, John J. Hohman, accepted that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">On the following day, May 1, 2013, Captain Priester exercised his right, under the County Code, to appeal the decision to terminate his employment. In a letter to Chief Hohman, Captain Priester asked for permission to retire. While apologizing \u201cfor any embarrassment\u201d that he had caused the department and expressing his understanding that he \u201cmust face some form of discipline,\u201d Captain Priester appeared to question the bona fides of his accusers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">[I]f one single individual had ever said they were offended I assure you behavior modification would have been immediate. Certainly an individual should not be able to hold-back on issuing a complaint (2 years) until such time [as] they are in trouble. Also to have the same individual recruit addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>al complainants and have identical language is suspect as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The department formally terminated Captain Priester\u2019s employment on May 16, 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">E. The Application for Retirement Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">On July 31, 2014, Captain Priester filed an application for retirement in which he sought pension benefits. The Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System met on December 9, 2014, and voted 4-1 to deny the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Writing for the Trustees, the Director of the County\u2019s Office of Budget and Finance explained that, to qualify for retirement benefits (i.e., \u201ca service retirement allowance\u201d) under the Baltimore County Code, an employee must accumulate a certain period of \u201ccreditable service.\u201d <em>See </em>Balt. County Code \u00a7 5-1-213. The Code defines \u201ccreditable service\u201d as \u201cprior service,\u201d such as service in the armed forces of the United States, plus \u201cmembership service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-l-201(i). The Code, in turn, defines \u201cmembership service\u201d as \u201chonorable and faithful service as an employee rendered while a member of the retirement system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-l-201(p). The Trustees reasoned that Captain Priester\u2019s service \u201cwas not honorable and faithful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and is therefore not creditable towards a retirement allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">F. Appeal to the Baltimore County Office of Administrative Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Captain Priester exercised his right to appeal the Trustees\u2019 decision to the Baltimore County Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). The OAH held four days of hearings between February 23, 2015, and May 28, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">1. EMT Duncan-Fulton\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">At the hearing, EMT Kathleen Duncan-Fulton testified that, after Captain Priester arrived at Fire Station 18 in 2010, he would periodically approach her from behind while she was washing dishes or working at a computer. He would \u201cnibble\u201d on her neck and ear, use crude language to tell her that he thought that she was sexually aroused, and make other lewd and sexually suggestive comments. On other occasions, when he was in a room with her and other employees, he would call her name, put his hands to his face, and make a crude gesture that is meant to signify cunnilingus.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">She said that Captain Priester would engage in this behavior \u201cat least once a day on the two days that [she] would see him and over a span of several months.\u201d After several months, she told him to stop. Shortly thereafter, he began to complain about her job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">EMT Duncan-Fulton testified that she did not immediately report the harassment because she had been employed with the department for only nine or ten years, as opposed to Captain Priester\u2019s 30 years. In her view, it was \u201ca little difficult to think that somebody [was] going to take [her] side and believe [her].\u201d After the \u201cbathroom incident,\u201d however, she \u201cfinally had enough\u201d and decided to notify Captains Penn and Hoffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Baltimore County submitted a written statement that EMT Duncan-Fulton made to the investigators. The statement corroborated the EMT\u2019s testimony and included additional details. For example, she wrote that when Captain Priester would approach from behind while she was working, he would press her against the counter. She also wrote that she at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tempted not to \u201center a room if he was alone\u201d and that she \u201cwould leave the room if Capt. Priester appeared to be approaching [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">2. The Testimony of Captains Penn and Hoffman</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Captains Penn and Hoffman corroborated EMT Duncan-Fulton\u2019s account of previous complaints about Captain Pries-ter\u2019s misuse of the women\u2019s bathroom. Both captains said that they had never had any problems with EMT Duncan-Fulton\u2019s job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">3. Lieutenant Stevens\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Lieutenant Michelle Stevens testified that Captain Priester was her captain for six to eight months when he was assigned to a different station. She testified that while she was working at a computer, Captain Priester would \u201cput his hand on [her] leg and run it up [her] thigh.\u201d She would tell him to \u201cknock it off\u2019 or \u201csay please don\u2019t do that\u201d or try to \u201claugh it off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The lieutenant \u201ctried to not put [her]self in situations\u201d where she could be subject to Captain Priester\u2019s harassment. In an attempt to protect herself, she said that she did not go into closed rooms with Captain Priester.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">During firefighting operations, Captain Priester would \u201cpat her butt\u201d or behave inappropriately by touching women. He would call her \u201ctoots,\u201d to which she would reply, \u201c[C]all me Lieutenant Toots[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Lieutenant Stevens said that Captain Priester would make inappropriate gestures to make others laugh. She said that people would laugh because they did not want to be \u201csingled out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">When asked whether she thought that Captain Priester was just joking, Lieutenant Stevens said that he might have been, but that he did not stop once he was told to stop. She added that he was in the position of power. She had begun as an EMT and had gotten promoted to the position of fire-suppression officer, and she believed that he did not want her \u201con the fire side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Lieutenant Stevens said that she did not immediately report Captain Priester's harassment because she did not \u201cwant to be labeled.\u201d She stated that it was difficult for women to report harassment in the Baltimore County Fire Department and that she reported Captain Priester\u2019s harassment only after she was questioned by Battalion Chief Peter Hill. On cross-examination, she explained that the department is \u201ca paramilitary organization.\u201d \u201cYou go to your Captain first for everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In a letter to Battalion Chief Hill, which was admitted into evidence at the hearing, Lieutenant Stevens wrote that she \u201cstruggled with the decision\u201d to reveal any issues with Captain Priester, because it was difficult to be a woman, and a woman fire-suppression officer, in the Baltimore County Fire Department. Like EMT Duncan-Fulton\u2019s written statement, Lieutenant Stevens\u2019s letter corroborated her testimony and included additional details. She wrote that Captain Priester would breathe on her neck, kiss her neck, and whisper in her ear and that he would breathe heavily when she answered a telephone call that he had placed. Other employees would laugh when they witnessed his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Lieutenant Stevens would \u201ctry to laugh it off too,\u201d because she did not want to be (in her words) \u201cshunned\u201d and did not \u201cwant a \u2018label.\u2019 \u201d In her testimony, she said, \u201cI\u2019m labeled now.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">4. Lieutenant Greenfeld\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">EMT District Lieutenant Barbara Greenfeld testified that, shortly after she heard about the confrontation between Cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tain Priester and EMT Duncan-Fulton, she reported two instances in which she was a victim of his sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In the first incident, which occurred in 2012, she was on a call with Captain Priester. While they were loading a patient on a stretcher into an ambulance, she climbed onto the first step. Captain Priester put his hand on her ankle and ran it up her leg into the vicinity of her crotch. His conduct elicited laughter from some of the men who were present. She said nothing, but finished loading the patient into the ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The second incident occurred in 2018, when Lieutenant Greenfeld was conducting a training session for about eight people. She was seated with a computer in front of her. Captain Priester came up from behind her and put his lips all over her face and ear. She screamed. Everyone else laughed and acted as though it was a big joke. As a result of that incident, she stopped visiting Station 18, would not let Captain Priester get behind her, and tried to protect herself when she had to respond to emergency calls with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When asked why she did not report Captain Priester after he had inappropriately touched her, she explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">The Fire Department people work very closely with one another. You depend on them to be there to protect your back, to support one another... [Tjhere\u2019s not any part of that job you could do by yourself. You have to have other people to help you do that job. And you don\u2019t want to alienate those people by being the tattletale ... the person that turns ... someone in and gets them in trouble.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">When asked whether she had some particular concern about what might happen in a firefighting operation if she reported Captain Priester, Lieutenant Greenfeld responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">I\u2019ve had Captains before that have ordered their crews not to help a certain person. You know, I\u2019m telling you right now do not help that person. And when you\u2019re on an emergency incident ... you need that help. You need that backup. You need ... people that you trust to have your back if things get ugly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>On cross-examination, Lieutenant Greenfeld testified that inappropriate conduct was commonplace in the department when she began her career in 1986, but that Captain Priester was the only supervisor who had ever touched her. She said that she felt embarrassed when Captain Priester grabbed her from behind, especially because so many people were present. She believed that Captain Priester engaged in such behavior \u201cto show everybody\u201d that he was the captain and could \u201cdo whatever [he] want[ed] to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">5. Paramedic Kelly\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Paramedic Amber Kelly testified that, when she was a student and not yet a member of the department, Captain Priester \u201cwould come up behind [her] and put his hands on [her] shoulders and rub [her] shoulders and down into [her] back and neck.\u201d On one occasion, Captain Priester \u201cplaced his hand on [her] knee and slip[ped his hand] up slightly[,] approximately an inch toward [her] thigh.\u201d Other times, she said, \u201che would come up behind [her] and whisper in [her] ear,\u201d and he would take a \u201clarge breath in ... order to blow into [her] ear.\u201d If she felt uncomfortable, she would move to another seat or to a different room to avoid Captain Priester.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Paramedic Kelly said that she did not report the incidents because she was in training and, fearing retaliation, thought that it might prevent her from being hired. She believed that Captain Priester had some influence over whether she would be hired.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">6. Paramedic Glenn Harris\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Paramedic-Firefighter Glenn Harris testified that, before the \u201cbathroom incident\u201d between Captain Priester and EMT Duncan-Fulton, she had confided to him on several occasions that Captain Priester had \u201ctouched\u201d her. She expressed concern about the \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>in the station. She had also expressed concern about Captain Priester\u2019s use of the women\u2019s bathroom and the condition in which he left it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Paramedic Harris had witnessed an incident, about two and a half years earlier, when Captain Priester leaned onto the rails of Paramedic Kelly\u2019s chair and asked her for a light. He saw her stiffen up and tell him that she would give him a light, but to back off.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On the day of the \u201cbathroom incident,\u201d Paramedic Harris observed part of the confrontation between Captain Priester and EMT Duncan-Fulton. He said that EMT Duncan-Fulton seemed to be \u201cfearful\u201d and in a \u201cpanic,\u201d while Captain Priester \u201cwas more agitated and angry.\u201d He observed EMT Duncan-Fulton \u201cmoving about the room ... to get away\u201d from Captain Priester.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">According to Paramedic Harris, a nursing technician at Northwest Hospital (whom he described as a \u201crock solid person\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> became enraged as a result of an encounter with Captain Priester. The technician complained to him that Captain Priester had touched her inappropriately and made suggestive comments to her while he was escorting a patient to the hospital. Paramedic Harris called Lieutenant Greenfeld to alert her to what had occurred and to seek guidance. Lieutenant Greenfeld corroborated his account in her testimony, saying that Paramedic Harris had called her and asked her to come to Northwest Hospital because Captain Priester was \u201c \u2018at it again\u2019 with either a nurse or a tech[nician].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Paramedic Harris also testified that during Captain Pries-ter\u2019s suspension several members of Station 18 attended a funeral for a relative of one member. While at the funeral, Captain Priester named several of his accusers and said that \u201cthey better watch out.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s a threat.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">7. Fire Chief Hohman\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At the time of the hearing in 2015, Fire Chief Hohman had spent 38 years in the department. He had been the chief for 15 years. In that capacity he reviewed every disciplinary decision in the department. Earlier, he had served for eight years as the union representative who defended employees against disciplinary charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">When asked for his opinion about Captain Priester\u2019s work performance, Chief Hohman stated that the captain \u201chad a long-standing tendency to abuse power and authority and to curry favor with the people that worked with him by ... not enforcing the rules.\u201d To his knowledge, no other officer had been disciplined as frequently as Captain Priester: his record was the worst of any officer that the chief had ever seen. On one occasion, the chief had demoted Captain Priester, but the demotion was overturned on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Captain Priester\u2019s prior infractions involved giving \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d to some members of his team. \u201cIf they were on his team,\u201d the chief said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t have to follow the rules that everyone else followed.\u201d Some of the infractions entailed false statements that were made to assist favored employees in obtaining sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Chief Hohman regarded Captain Priester\u2019s conduct, as reported by the complaining witnesses in this case, as \u201cthe ultimate abuse of power and authority.\u201d The captain had \u201cdenigrat[ed] other employees\u201d and made employees \u201cafraid to do their jobs.\u201d He deemed it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that Lieutenant Greenfeld was afraid to conduct training sessions at Captain Priester\u2019s station because \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to be subjected to his behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Because of the \u201cpower and authority\u201d that a captain wields at a fire station, Chief Hohman said that he \u201ccould understand why somebody would not come forward\u201d and complain of sexual harassment. He said that the captain\u2019s intimidation of women created the \u201cworst possible\u201d image of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">According to Chief Hohman, the department had been conducting training to combat sexual harassment since the 1980s. Hence Captain Priester had undoubtedly been taught that his conduct was against the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Chief Hohman concluded that, in his view, Captain Pries-ter\u2019s service was not honorable and faithful.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">8. Captain Priester\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Captain Priester testified on his own behalf. Although he had expressed remorse, pleaded no contest to the employment charges against him, and depicted himself as a \u201c[djinosaur\u201d who had failed to \u201ckeep up with the changing times,\u201d he said that he had done so on the premise that the union would work out a deal under which he could retire and receive his entire pension.

The ALJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">On June 12, 2015, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued an opinion and order, in which he affirmed in part, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>reversed in part, the decision of the Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Crediting the testimony against Captain Priester, the ALJ found that his service was not \u201chonorable and faithful,\u201d because it represented an abuse of his position as a captain. On that basis, the ALJ concluded that Captain Priester\u2019s service as a captain, from 1999 until the date of his termination in 2013, did not qualify as \u201ccreditable service.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ ordered that Captain Priester would be \u201centitled to receive a service retirement allowance from Baltimore County, and the \u2018number of years of credible [sic] service\u2019 ... shall not include that period of time during which [Captain Priester] held the rank of Captain.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s ruling resulted in a forfeiture of some, but not all, of Captain Priester\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">G. Proceedings Before the Board of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Neither side was satisfied with the ALJ's Solomonic decision. Both sides appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In his appeal Captain Priester did not dispute the facts that were presented before the ALJ, but focused on what he regarded as flaws in the process, including the alleged vagueness of the terms \u201chonorable and faithful.\u201d For its part, the Employees\u2019 Retirement System contended that the ALJ did not have the authority to revoke only part of the pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">On October 16, 2015, the Board issued an opinion and order, in which it affirmed the finding that Captain Priester had not rendered \u201chonorable and faithful\u201d service, but reversed the conclusion that he could receive a pro-rated portion of his pension. The Board found \u201cno precedent allowing the ALJ to deny pension benefits for only part of Mr. Priester\u2019s employment with Baltimore County.\u201d Accordingly, the Board denied Captain Priester\u2019s entire claim for pension benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>H. Judicial Review in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Captain Priester petitioned for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On June 20, 2016, the court signed a written order in which it upheld the Board\u2019s decision. Captain Priester filed a timely notice of appeal on July 19, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Questions Presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Captain Priester raises the following four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">1. Is the undefined term \u201chonorable and faithful\u201d service, which may restrict pension entitlement, so impermissi-bly vague that it must be struck down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">2. If the term \u201chonorable and faithful\u201d service is not impermissibly vague, was it applied by the Board in an arbitrary and capricious manner, inconsistent with the County pension statute and the relevant case law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">3. Is the Board\u2019s decision, which revoked and forfeited Mr. Priester\u2019s entire County pension inconsistent with the plain and unambiguous language of the pension statute and pension case law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">4. Should the Board\u2019s decision be reversed because it was not supported by substantial evidence in the record?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">For the following reasons, we answer each question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Consequently, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment affirming the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">I.

The Code Provision Is Not Void for Vagueness</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">As an implicit corollary to the prohibition against the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, the Fourteenth Amendment invalidates legislation that is unduly vague. <em>See, e.g., Finucan v.

Md. Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>380 Md. at 591-95, 846 A.2d 377; or for \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d which included \u201cprofessional incompetency,\u201d <em>Unnamed Physician v.

Similarly, the Court of Appeals rejected a vagueness challenge to a criminal child-abuse statute that defined \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201cphysical injury sustained as result of cruel or inhumane treatment,\u201d <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. at 127-28, 389 A.2d 341; and to a criminal statute that defined a \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d as someone who occupied the position of \u201corganizer, supervisor, financier, or manager\u201d in a drug conspiracy. <em>Williams v.

In reaching its decision, this Court quoted an earlier, unreported opinion in the same case, which discussed the meaning of the terms \u201chonorable\u201d and \u201cfaithful\u201d in the relevant section of the Baltimore County Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u2018\u201cHonorable\u201d carries a number of connotations, including: \u201cperformed or accompanied with marks of honor or respect,\u201d \u201cattesting to creditable conduct[,]\u201d \u201cconsistent with an untarnished reputation,\u201d \u201ccharacterized by integrity: guided by a high sense of honor and duty.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>556 (10th ed. 2000). The definition of \u201cfaithful\u201d includes the following: \u201csteadfast in affection or allegiance,\u201d \u201cfirm in adherence to promises or in observance of duty,\u201d and it implies unswerving adherence to a person or thing or to the \u201coath or promise by which a tie was contracted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In our view, these plain English terms are \u201cunderstandable to a person of ordinary intelligence.\u201d <em>Finucan v.

Therefore, they give fair notice of the nature and quality of the service that members of the retirement system must give before they may obtain a pension. <em>See id. </em>For the same reason, they establish adequate standards and guidelines for the executive officers who are charged with enforcing and applying the law. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 846 A.2d 377 (citing <em>Kansas State Bd. of Healing Arts v.

In fact, \u201cbecause of the absence of established and official definitions and guidelines as to what constitutes \u2018honorable and faithful\u2019 service,\u201d the Board initially concluded that \u201cthe decision of the Retirement System,\u201d that Officer Brown had not rendered honorable and faithful service, \u201cwas <em>ipso facto </em>\u2018arbitrary and capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In its unpublished opinion, this Court rejected the Board of Appeals\u2019 original decision. <em>Id. </em>at 303, 973 A.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In reversing the Board of Appeals, this Court held that the Board could, but was not required to, find that the officer had failed to render honorable and faithful service even though his drug use had occurred only when he was off duty. <em>See id. </em>at 304-05, 973 A.2d 879. In so holding, this Court implicitly rejected the Board of Appeals\u2019 original position, that the relevant statutory language was defective \u201cbecause of the absence of established and official definitions and guidelines as to what constitutes \u2018honorable and faithful\u2019 service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 973 A.2d 879. Similarly, we reject Captain Priester\u2019s contention that the statutory language is void for vagueness because of the absence of a statutory or regulatory definition of the key terms \u201cfaithful\u201d and \u201chonorable.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>II. The Board Did Not Apply the Code Provision in a Manner that was Inconsistent with Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In <em>Brown </em>this Court recognized that the Board had to make \u201ca judgment call\u201d in weighing the evidence and deciding whether an employee\u2019s misconduct was sufficiently \u201cgrievous\u201d as to be labelled dishonorable or unfaithful. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 973 A.2d 879. As in this case, the issue in <em>Brown </em>was not whether the employee had breached his duties, but \u201chow serious a breach of his duty\u201d had occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The <em>Brown </em>Court expressly recognized that the Board of Appeals would have to resolve those questions in <em>ad hoc </em>factual decisions on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 973 A.2d 879. \u201cIn terms of what criminal behavior, even off-duty criminal behavior, might be considered serious enough to render the officer\u2019s service less than \u2018honorable and faithful,\u2019 there is, of absolute necessity, an enormous range of discretion entrusted to the decision makers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court likened the decision to \u201cthe discretionary weighing of the gravity of an offense\u201d <em>(id.), </em>which \u201cis something that every sentencing judge must do\u201d in deciding between probation or imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">[A] single act of unlawfully exceeding the speed limit or a discreetly executed act of adultery (with its maximum $10 f\u00edne) could not reasonably abrogate the accrued benefits of 20 years of faithful employment. That is not to say, however, that even a single act of murder or rape or armed robbery might not so qualify, even if the public never knew that the perpetrator was a police officer. The seriousness of the crime committed is one of the infinite variables. A crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>calling for a ten dollar fine is obviously not the same as a crime calling for five years of imprisonment or for life imprisonment. A single criminal act might well not be given the same weight as a dozen such acts over a period of months or a hundred such acts over a period of years. Are victimless crimes given less weight than crimes with victims? Is there a distinction between crimes of vice, crimes of violence, crimes of greed, and crimes of falsity? Does the reason for the commission of a crime make a difference? Is the stealing of a loaf of bread by Jean Valjean no different than the deliberate flouting of the law for casual amusement? All of this is obviously a part of the totality of the circumstances that must be weighed on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis. There are infinite variables and there is no way to reduce them to a predictable and easily administered matrix.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Captain Priester complains that because of its recognition of the necessity of <em>ad hoc </em>decision-making in the application of statutory terms to the facts of a given case, the <em>Brown </em>decision itself \u201chardly provides adequate notice\u201d of what constitutes dishonorable or unfaithful service. To the contrary, <em>Brown </em>expresses the uncontroversial proposition that the Baltimore County Council cannot codify every possible application of the legal standard (\u201chonorable and faithful conduct as an employee\u201d) to the disparate array of facts that may come before the Board. Just as a judge must exercise discretion in applying the law to the facts in deciding whether to incarcerate a defendant and (if so) for how long, so too must the Board of Appeals exercise discretion in deciding whether an employee\u2019s conduct was so dishonorable or unfaithful as to result in the forfeiture of pension rights. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 973 A.2d 879. Furthermore, just as a statute does not become void for vagueness merely because the legislative body allowed \u201c \u2018for the exercise of some discretion\u2019\u201d <em>(Finucan v. Md. Bd. of Physicians Quality Assurance, </em>380 Md. at 592, 846 A.2d 377 (quoting <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d 341); <em>accord Blaker v.

Captain Pries-ter interprets the Board\u2019s statement to mean that he might have been on notice that his conduct might affect his \u201cemployment status\u201d (i.e., that he might lose his job), but not that he would lose his pension benefits. In our view, he is interpreting the Board\u2019s conclusion too narrowly. \u201cEmployment status\u201d encompasses \u201cemployment rights,\u201d such as pension rights, because employees may lose their pension rights if their \u201cemployment status\u201d comes to an end as a result of dishonorable or unfaithful conduct. <em>See, e.g., Empls.\u2019 Ret.

He fails to appreciate, however, that his conduct was not merely \u201crude and offensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Captain Priester abused his status as a captain by creating a hostile and predatory environment, in which he exhibited a pattern of sexually harassing women for his amusement and the amusement of his minions. He presided over a workplace in which women were afraid to complain because they were concerned that no one would take their word over his (and that of his allies), that they would be shunned by their peers and subjected to retaliation, or that their co-workers might be ordered to withhold support from them when they were in danger. He fostered an environment in which one woman was unwilling to come to his station to train his employees because of her concern about his abusive behavior. He was responsible, as captain, for enforcing the very rules that he flagrantly violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In the second decade of the twenty-first century, 30 years after the Supreme Court held that \u201chostile environment\u201d sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> no reasonable employee could believe that he or she could engage in a longstanding pattern of abusive misconduct such as Captain Priester\u2019s without putting pension rights at risk. The Board of Appeals, therefore, did not err in concluding that Captain Priester had adequate notice of the consequence that he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">III. The Forfeiture of the Entire Pension is Consistent with the Code</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Despite the finding that he failed to render \u201chonorable and faithful service,\u201d Captain Priester argues that, under the \u201cplain and unambiguous language of the most substantive and important section of the County pension statute,\u201d he is entitled to a pension. He cites \u00a7 5\u20141\u2014217(b)(l)(i)(l) of the County Code, which states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATu\">a member who retires on or after January 1, 1999, shall be entitled to receive a service retirement allowance ... upon the completion of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">1. Twenty-five (25) years of creditable service regardless of age[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Citing the ALJ\u2019s opinion, Captain Priester reasons that \u201c[t]he first instance of any alleged misconduct occurred in \u2018late 2010,\u2019 \u201d which was after he had completed more than 25 years of service. Because the record contained no direct evidence of any dishonorable or unfaithful conduct during his first 25 years of service, Captain Priester concludes that he is entitled to his pension.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Captain Priester\u2019s conclusion is absurd. Under his interpretation of the Code, he would still be entitled to his pension even if, on the day after he completed his twenty-fifth year of honorable and faithful service, he began to inflate his earnings by submitting false claims for overtime, concealed evidence of arson in exchange for a bribe, or contributed to a co-worker\u2019s injury or death by directing his subordinates to withhold assistance from her when she was in danger. The County Code cannot reasonably be read to mean that, regardless of what he did after the twenty-fifth anniversary of his employment, Captain Priester had an indefeasible right to a pension merely because the County introduced no evidence of his misconduct in the first 25 years.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Had Captain Priester retired after 25 years, before any dishonorable or unfaithful conduct occurred (or before any came to light), he would have been entitled to a pension. Captain Priester, however, chose to remain in the County\u2019s employment after the twenty-fifth anniversary of his employment. He had a financial incentive to do so, because his pension would increase by two percent of his average final compensation for each year that he remained in service after year 25 and by three percent of his average final compensation for each year that he remained after year 30. <em>See </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 5\u20141\u2014217(b)(l)(ii)(2). By choosing to remain after 25 years, Captain Priester subjected himself to the statutory condition that he would be entitled to a pension only if, at the time of his retirement, his service had been (or had continued to be) \u201chonorable and faithful.\u201d <em>See </em>Baltimore Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ty Code \u00a7 5-l-201(p). Because the Board of Appeals reasonably concluded that his service was not honorable or faithful at that time, he forfeited his right to a pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Captain Priester responds that, even if he is not entitled to his entire pension, the Board of Appeals committed an error of law in construing the Code to mean that he must serve honorably and faithfully throughout his entire tenure in order to receive a pension. He complains that, in the Board\u2019s view, <em>\u201cany </em>incident of dishonorable or unfaithful service, no matter how fleeting or insignificant over the course of an employee\u2019s 30-year career, could result in\u201d the loss of the entire benefit. His argument misconstrues the concept of \u201chonorable and faithful service,\u201d as interpreted in <em>Bro%m </em>and applied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Under <em>Brovm, </em>it is very clear that \u201cfleeting or insignificant\u201d misconduct cannot amount to dishonorable or unfaithful service. \u201c[A] single act of unlawfully exceeding the speed limit or a discreetly executed act of adultery (with its maximum $10 fine) could not reasonably abrogate the accrued benefits of 20 years of faithful employment.\u201d <em>Empls.\u2019 Ret. Sys. of Baltimore Cnty. v. Brown, </em>186 Md.App. at 317, 973 A.2d 879. \u201cA crime calling for a ten dollar fine is obviously not the same as a crime calling for five years of imprisonment or for life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA single criminal act might well not be given the same weight as a dozen such acts over a period of months or a hundred such acts over a period of years.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Neither <em>Brovm </em>nor the Board held that a single instance of trivial misconduct could put an employee\u2019s entire pension in jeopardy. To the contrary, under <em>Brown, </em>employees may be divested of their pension rights only if the Board reasonably finds that they engaged in misconduct that was sufficiently serious or grievous as to taint or contaminate their entire record of service. A single incident of misconduct, if sufficiently blameworthy, might suffice to support the divestiture of pension benefits: would anyone doubt that a fire officer would forfeit a pension if he or she took a bribe in exchange for a promise to conceal evidence of an arson? On the other hand, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>pattern of misconduct, such as a years-long pattern of abuse of power and authority, like the pattern that was disclosed by the evidence in this case, would support the divestiture of benefits as well.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Captain Priester goes on to complain that the Board (in its words) \u201cassumed\u201d that if it were permissible to award a portion of the pension for the period before a member\u2019s dishonorable or unfaithful service began, the Code would have expressly said so. He argues that the Code repeatedly refers to \u201cyears of creditable service\u201d and \u201cyears of membership service,\u201d which, in his view, suggests a statutory basis for apportionment. He recognizes, however, that the Code \u201crelies\u201d on those \u201cyearly credits as a method to calculate an employee\u2019s benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">As we read those provisions, the yearly credits are relevant to the computation of the pension benefit for employees who have served honorably and faithfully. The statutory references to yearly credits do not require the Board to view an employee\u2019s serious or grievous misconduct in isolation from the rest of his or her career and to award benefits only for the period in which the misconduct did not occur. Nor do the references to yearly credits prohibit the Board from concluding that an employee\u2019s misconduct was so serious and so grievous as to require the forfeiture of the entire pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Finally, Captain Priester argues that the Board\u2019s decision ignores the contractual nature of pension rights as earned compensation for work performed. He asserts that forfeitures of pension rights should be \u201cnarrowly construed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Captain Priester is correct that a pension is a form of deferred compensation\u2014compensation earned during the time of employment, but paid after the term has ended. Pension benefits form a significant part of the total compensation package for employees of the Baltimore County Fire Department. An employer cannot divest an employee of such a pension for trivial or insignificant reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">But the Board was entitled to find that the misconduct in this case was neither trivial nor insignificant. It was not, as Captain Priester characterizes it, a few \u201cinstances of rude and offensive behavior committed over the last few years of employment.\u201d It involved the abuse of his authority as a captain through a discernible pattern of sexual harassment of subordinates, who were afraid to make a public complaint precisely because of Captain Priester\u2019s power and influence. It involved the violation of the rules that he, as captain, was charged with enforcing. Because honorable and faithful service is a condition precedent to a pension under the Baltimore County Code, the Board did not err in holding that this dishonorable or unfaithful conduct warranted the forfeiture of Captain Pries-ter\u2019s pension in its entirety.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>IV. The Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In his final assignment of error, Captain Priester contends that the Board lacked a factual basis to conclude that he should forfeit his entire pension. In view of the deferential standard of review on such a contention, he argues that no \u201creasoning mind\u201d could conclude that he should lose his entire pension based on what he calls \u201cnoncriminal behavior\u201d that, he says, \u201chad no direct impact on his service to the public\u201d and \u201ccovered, at most, the last <em>10% of </em>his career.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In support of his contention, Captain Priester argues that he received awards and favorable performance ratings throughout his career, that his witnesses praised his firefighting and leadership skills, and that he did not commit a crime and was not charged with a crime. He adds that his conduct did not lead to a lawsuit or a news story that cast the County in a negative light.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>In our view, Captain Priester\u2019s arguments do not show that the Board was required to rule in his favor. For the reasons that we have previously articulated at greater length, we believe that the Board was, at the very least, equally entitled to rule against him, as it did. Simply put, a reasoning mind could conclude that a fire officer\u2019s service was not honorable or faithful if he was found, over the course of several years, to have abused his authority by violating the rules that he was obligated to enforce and sexually harassing subordinates, who were unable to complain precisely because of his position of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment affirming the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Captain Priester\u2019s challenge eventually came before the Personnel and Salary Advisory Board (\u201cPSAB\u201d). The PSAB deadlocked, with two members voting for termination and two voting for reinstatement. The PSAB notified Captain Priester that it would rehear his grievance, but before a new hearing was scheduled, he filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, asking the court to order the PSAB to issue its tied vote as a final order and to reinstate him as an employee. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the County. Captain Priester appealed. We held that, because \"the board ha[d] not yet issued a final order and plans to rehear the appeal, Priester ha[d] not exhausted his administrative remedies, and his action d[id] not fall within a recognized exception to the exhaustion doctrine.\u201d <em>Priester v.

Both parties called a number of other witnesses, but their testimony is largely immaterial to the legal issues on this appeal. Captain Priester\u2019s witnesses included several of his subordinates, who denied any knowledge of sexual harassment and, in one instance, attacked the bona fides of one of the captain\u2019s accusers.

Notwithstanding Captain Priester\u2019s characterization of his conduct as noncriminal, which he repeats throughout his brief, the County argued that some of his conduct rose to the level of a second-degree assault <em>(see </em>Md.

Although the department\u2019s investigation stopped as of 2010, there is little reason not to believe that Captain Priester\u2019s pattern of misconduct extended farther into the past. In his letter of remorse, he characterized himself as a practical joker who had not kept up with the times. He wrote that \"[t]he Fire Department has changed drastically over these past 30 years.\u201d He referred to himself as a \"[djinosaur\u201d and said that \"the department has left [him] behind.\u201d He admitted to having failed in his \"responsibility ... to keep up with the changing times.\u201d He portrayed himself as someone who had engaged in the same conduct all along, but did not realize that it had only recently become unacceptable.

In holding that Captain Priester had forfeited his entire pension because of his dishonorable or unfaithful conduct, the Board said that it relied on \"prior Maryland cases,\u201d but it did not cite them at that point in its opinion. Captain Priester criticizes the Board for not citing the cases on which it relied. He speculates that the Board was referring to its own unpublished opinions. He questions why the Retirement System\u2019s website does not mention the prior opinions.

In its brief, the County relies extensively on a number of older cases in which an employee lost pension rights because of dishonest conduct, typically criminal in nature: <em>Baltimore Cnty.

We decline to rely on those cases, in part because they concern different statutory provisions, but also because they predate the general recognition that public pension rights are contractual in nature and are not mere gratuities. <em>See City of Frederick v.
