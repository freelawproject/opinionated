The court then sentenced Kranz to a total term of five years\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Thereafter, Kranz filed a petition, under the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, seeking to vacate his convictions on the ground that the State had committed a <em>Brady </em>violation\u2014that, at the time of his trial, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney in Cecil County, although not involved in Kranz\u2019s criminal case, was representing the two victims in that case in a separate civil action against Kranz, arising out of the same incident, but that that conflict had not been disclosed to the defense. The postconviction court ruled that the State had, indeed, failed to make a required disclosure to Kranz, but it nonetheless denied his petition on the basis that the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>nondisclosure was not \u201cmaterial\u201d because it did not \u201ccreate a reasonable probability of a different result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Subsequently, Kranz filed an application for leave to appeal from that decision, which this Court granted. It, therefore, appeared that the issue before us was whether the postconviction court had erred in concluding that the State\u2019s nondisclosure was not \u201cmaterial\u201d and, concomitantly, whether the postconviction court had applied the correct materiality standard under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, unbeknownst to the applications panel, sometime after Kranz had filed his application for leave to appeal but prior to the granting of that application, Kranz completed serving his sentence, including the three-year probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In its brief, the State has included a motion to dismiss, asserting that, upon the completion of Kranz\u2019s sentence, this Court was divested of appellate jurisdiction and therefore must dismiss this appeal. For the reasons that follow, we shall grant that motion,</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We quote the memorandum opinion of the posteonviction court for factual background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Kranz was convicted of first degree assault and reckless endangerment by a jury in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, for shooting victims Brandi Schaffer and George McSwain when they were accidentally driving on his property. After his conviction, but before sentencing, Kranz learned that Ms. Schaffer and Mr. McSwain had filed a civil suit against him over the same incident. They were seeking damages in excess of one million dollars. They obtained Kevin Urick as counsel in the civil suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">Mr. Urick (hereafter ASA Urick) serves as a full time [Assistant [Sjtate\u2019s [Ajttorney while also maintaining a private practice.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> As an ASA, Mr. Urick worked under the State\u2019s Attorney, Christopher Eastridge: the prosecuting attorney in Mr. Kranz\u2019s criminal trial. ASA Urick was in no way involved in the criminal prosecution of Mr. Kranz and had no contact with Mr. Eastridge regarding preparation for the case. However, Mr. Eastridge was aware of ASA Urick\u2019s representation of Ms. Schaffer and Mr. McSwain in the civil suit and at no time disclosed this information to Mr. Kranz nor to his attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">Mr. Kranz\u2019s criminal trial may reasonably be considered close as he was tried twice as a result of a hung jury in his first trial.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> In the latter trial the [Sjtate\u2019s case was put on primarily by use of circumstantial evidence as the [Sjtate was not able to present any direct evidence against Mr. Kranz. Likewise, victims Ms. Schaffer and Mr. McSwain were the [Sjtate\u2019s key witnesses. The record states that neither Ms. Schaffer nor Mr. McSwain could positively identify Mr. Kranz as the shooter and instead could only testify as to seeing a shadowy figure immediately prior to the shots being fired. Mr. Kranz\u2019s trial counsel cross-exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ined both witnesses but ultimately was unsuccessful in persuading the jury to find in favor of Mr. Kranz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">After the jury\u2019s verdict but prior to being sentenced, Mr. Kranz was notified of the civil suit filed against him by Ms. Schaffer and Mr. McSwain. Subsequently, he notified his trial counsel of the information. Prior to sentencing defense counsel filed a motion for new trial that did not include claims regarding a <em>Brady </em>violation by the [Sjtate for failing to disclose ASA Urick\u2019s representation of Ms. Schaffer and Mr. McSwain in the civil suit. The trial court denied this motion. Mr. Kranz filed an appeal on August 17, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">On September 23, 2009 another motion for new trial was filed. A hearing for this new trial motion was held on December 11, 2009 before Judge Kahl. This motion was denied. Subsequently, the Court of Special Appeals issued Judge Moylan\u2019s unreported opinion on November 9, 2010 affirming Judge Kahl\u2019s denial of Mr. Kranz\u2019s motion for a newtrial.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>Kranz v. State, </em>No. 07-K-06-000806, slip op. at 2-3 (Cecil Cnty. Cir. Ct. May 20, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Kranz was sentenced, on July 31, 2009, to two consecutive five-year sentences for the first-degree assault convictions, the latter suspended, to be followed by three years\u2019 probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was thereafter released (apparently through operation of diminution credits, <em>see </em>Correctional Services Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-701 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>3-711), and his probation concluded on April 7, 2015.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, on August 31, 2016, his application for leave to appeal from the denial of his postconviction petition was granted. As we shall see, that timeline is crucial to our disposition of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">This appeal turns upon an issue of statutory construction, which is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 452, 879 A.2d 1111 (2005). The canons of statutory construction are well settled and begin with the \u201ccardinal rule\u201d\u2014that is, we must \u201cascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Jamison v. State, </em>450 Md. 387, 396 n.9, 148 A.3d 1267 (2016) (citation and quotation omitted). \u201cIn ascertaining legislative intent, we first examine the plain language of the statute, and if the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the statute's apparent purpose, we give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.),. Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), \u00a7 7-101, the first section of the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-A\">This title applies to a person convicted in any court in the State who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">(1) confined under sentence of imprisonment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(2) on parole or probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">That provision, known as the \u201ccustody\u201d requirement, <em>Obomighie v. State, </em>170 Md.App. 708, 712 n.2, 908 A.2d 132, <em>cert. denied, </em>396 Md. 13, 912 A.2d 649 (2006) (citing <em>McMannis v. State, </em>311 Md. 534, 539, 536 A.2d 652 (1988)), \u201cis jurisdictional in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 908 A.2d 132. In <em>Obomighie, </em>we examined the application of that jurisdictional requirement to a person who, at an earlier stage of a postconviction proceeding, had been eligible to seek relief under the Act, but subsequently, during the pendency of that proceeding, became ineligible because he had finished serving his sentence. For reasons that will become clear, <em>Obomighie </em>bears closer scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Obomighie had been convicted of assault in the second degree and sentenced to a term of eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment, all of which was suspended in favor of eighteen months\u2019 supervised probation. <em>Id. </em>at 710, 908 A.2d 132. While on probation, he filed a postconviction petition, but, before a hearing could be scheduled and his petition heard, Obomighie completed serving his sentence. <em>Id. </em>The postconviction court subsequently conducted a hearing and \u201centered an order dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction because Obomighie was no longer on probation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">He filed an application for leave to appeal from that ruling, which this Court granted, and, thereafter, we affirmed the postconviction court\u2019s order, dismissing Obomighie\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. Especially pertinent here, we noted that the \u201capparent conflict\u201d between CP \u00a7 7-101, \u201cwhich limits the scope of the title, and the jurisdiction of the circuit court, to persons imprisoned or on parole or probation,\u201d and CP \u00a7 7-102,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which (subject to the ten-year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>limitations, CP \u00a7 7-103), \u201con its face, permits initiating\u201d a postconviction proceeding \u201cat any time,\u201d was resolved by the Court of Appeals in McMannis,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which held, in effect, that the \u201ccustody\u201d requirement of CP \u00a7 7-101 takes precedence over CP \u00a7 7-102. <em>Obomighie, </em>170 Md.App. at 712, 908 A.2d 132. That is to say, <em>\u201cMcMannis </em>makes it clear that petitions may be \u2018filed at any time,\u2019 \u201d but \u201conly by persons who are either confined, or on parole or probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712-13, 908 A.2d 132. And that is true despite the fact that the purpose of the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act is remedial, <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 175, 31 A.3d 250 (2011); in other words, the remedies afforded by that Act are expressly limited to those who satisfy the \u201ccustody\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In the instant case, we must resolve a different apparent conflict regarding which statute (CP \u00a7 7-101 or CP \u00a7 7-109) governs appeals in postconviction proceedings. The latter statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">(a) Within 30 days after the court passes an order in accordance with this subtitle, a person aggrieved by the order, including the Attorney General and a State\u2019s Attorney, may apply to the Court of Special Appeals for leave to appeal the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">According to Kranz, this provision confers appellate jurisdiction upon this Court, regardless of whether or not he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>custody, at the time we purported to grant his application for leave to appeal, so long as he was in custody when the circuit court ruled on his postconviction petition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">For the same reason that <em>McMannis </em>and <em>Obomighie </em>held that the \u201ccustody\u201d requirement of CP \u00a7 7-101 takes precedence over the filing provisions of CP \u00a7 7-102, we conclude that the \u201ccustody\u201d requirement must also take precedence over the appeals provisions of CP \u00a7 7-109. That is because CP \u00a7 7-101 states, without qualification, that \u201c[t]his title applies to a person convicted in any court in the State who is\u201d in \u201ccustody,\u201d whether incarcerated or on parole or probation. \u201cThis title,\u201d of course, refers to the entirety of Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article (that is, the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act), including the appeals provisions of CP \u00a7 7-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">To be eligible for relief under Title 7, the convicted person must, as we explained in <em>Obomighie, </em>be presently either incarcerated or on parole or probation, because CP \u00a7 7-101 \u201cuses the present tense when it states that \u2018[t]his title applies to a person ... who is ... on parole or probation.\u2019\u201d 170 Md.App. at 711, 908 A.2d 132 (emphasis added). And, concomitantly, as we further explained, the language, in CP \u00a7 7-101, setting forth those to whom the Act applies, \u201cis equivalent, under the doctrine of <em>expressio unius, </em>to saying that people who do not meet [the \u2018custody\u2019 requirement] are ineligible\u201d for postconviction relief \u201cbecause they are outside the scope of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Throughout the time period during which Kranz filed his postconviction petition, the circuit court ruled on that petition, and Kranz filed an application for leave to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s ruling, Kranz was in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland Postconviction Procedure Act. However, during the pendency of his application for leave to appeal, Kranz completed serving his sentence, thereby attaining the status of a person who is \u201cineligible\u201d for postconviction relief because he is \u201coutside the scope of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the same reason that the change in Obomighie\u2019s status, during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the pendency of his postconviction petition, from a person in \u201ccustody\u201d to one no longer in \u201ccustody,\u201d divested the circuit court of jurisdiction to rule on the petition in that case, <em>id, </em>at 713, 908 A.2d 132, the change in Kranz\u2019s status, during the pendency of his application for leave to appeal, from a person in \u201ccustody\u201d to one no longer in \u201ccustody,\u201d divested us of appellate jurisdiction. We, therefore, are constrained to grant the State\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED. COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE APPELLANT AND CECIL COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. Generally, the materiality standard in a case alleging a <em>Brady </em>violation is \"whether there is a <em>'reasonable probability\u2019 </em>that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have led to a different result.\u201d <em>Yearby v. State, </em>414 Md. 708, 717, 997 A.2d 144 (2010) (quoting <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)). A different standard applies, however, in cases where \"the undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution's case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). In that case, a \"new trial is required if \u2018the false testimony could ... in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (quoting <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 271, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959)). Whether the latter standard should apply in a case such as this, where the prosecution apparently failed to disclose a conflict of interest, which, arguably, created an appearance that the prosecution had a financial interest in obtaining a conviction, is unclear, and, given our disposition of this appeal, we need not further consider that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">2. It appears that Urick still maintains a private practice in Cecil County but no longer works as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney in that county. <em>See </em>\"Kevin Urick, Attorney at Law, Attorney Profile,\" available at ht1p:// www.kevinurick.net/attorney_profile.html (last visited June 28, 2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">3.

In fact, this Court concluded that Kranz\u2019s September 23, 2009 motion for new trial was not properly before it because that motion had been filed <em>after </em>the notice of appeal was filed, and <em>no </em>notice of appeal was filed after the September 23, 2009 motion was denied. <em>Kranz v. State, </em>No. 1548, Sept. Term, 2009, slip op. at 2-3 (filed Nov. 9, 2010). The panel opinion went on to conclude that, even had a proper appeal been taken from the denial of the September 23, 2009 motion for new trial, Kranz could not have prevailed because the allegation raised would have had to qualify as newly discovered evidence, under Maryland Rule 4-331(c), but it was clear from the record that it did not. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 16-17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">.

The record submitted to this Court does not contain sufficient information for us to determine the factual basis for this statement. Attached to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, however, is a letter, from Eleanor McMullen, Special Assistant to the Director of the Division of Parole and Probation, addressed to appellee\u2019s counsel, stating the supporting facts. In his reply brief, Kranz does not challenge those factual assertions, claiming instead that they do not support the legal conclusion that his appeal should be dismissed. We shall therefore assume the veracity of the assertions stated in that letter. Md. Rule 5-201(b), (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\">. CP \u00a7 7-I02(a) provides in pertinent part that, subject to various enumerated conditions (including the ten-year statute of limitations in CP \u00a7 7-103), \"a convicted person may begin a proceeding under this title in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>place at any time,\u201d provided that his claims are cognizable under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">. <em>McMannis </em>interpreted Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.

In fact, the only significant substantive difference between the 1987 version of the Act and the present one is that the former was <em>less </em>restrictive of a petitioner\u2019s right to file, as it lacked the ten-year statute of limitations in the present statute, which was enacted in 1995. 1995 Md.
