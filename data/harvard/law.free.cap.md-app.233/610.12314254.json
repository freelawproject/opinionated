Years after the divorce, Husband was reevaluated for a military service disability benefit and his disability rating increased, which made him eligible for more disability benefits and allowed him to waive a portion of his pension (which is taxable and may be considered marital property) in favor of disability benefits (which are not taxable and may not, as a matter of federal law, be considered marital property). The result was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>that the federal government paid Husband the same amount of money each month, but Husband retained a greater share of it than the circuit court had awarded him: Wife received one-third of a smaller pension benefit, and Husband kept two-thirds of the smaller pension and all of the disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Wife sought a declaratory judgment seeking, in effect, a ruling that Husband\u2019s election had circumvented the divorce judgment and that awarded her the same amount she previously had been receiving. Over the course of three different orders, the court ruled that Wife was entitled to the same overall dollar amount from Husband\u2019s total military benefits, notwithstanding the reduction in his pension payout. That result was consistent with three reported decisions of this Court and the greater weight of cases across the country. Husband challenges these decisions and argues, among other things, that our cases were wrongly decided. We need not revisit our earlier decisions ourselves, though, because the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019s opinion in <em>Howell v. Howell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1400, 197 L.Ed.2d 781 (2017), issued after argument in this ease, effectively overrules our precedents and compels us to reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Husband served in the Army National Guard of Maryland from July 8, 1969 to June 14, 1971 and from May 15, 1985 to October 1,1987. He suffered three injuries during his time in the service\u2014one during the first period and two during the second. After his first injury, Husband received a ten percent disability rating that entitled him to a Wartime Disability Compensation award pursuant to 88 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. He retired from the Army National Guard in 1998 and later applied for retirement benefits, which would kick in after he turned sixty years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Husband and Wife married in 1972, and divorced on October 26, 2004, via a Judgment of Absolute Divorce issued by the circuit court. Among other things, the judgment awarded Wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>alimony of $600 per month for three years and \u201cone-third of the marital share of [Husband]\u2019s pension from the United States Army, the marital share ... to be calculated from June 3, 1972 to April 1, 2002.\u201d Everyone agrees that at the time that it entered the Judgment of Absolute Divorce, the court was not aware that Husband was receiving disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On January 13, 2009, Husband \u201cfiled a claim for increased evaluation\u201d of his disability with the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d). While awaiting the DVA\u2019s decision, Husband turned sixty years old and began collecting his Army pension as a reservist. <em>See </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731. Because a retiree may not receive both reservist retirement and disability compensation, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5305, Husband\u2019s receipt of disability benefits from the DVA automatically reduced his retirement pension from the Department of Defense on a dollar-for-dollar basis. On December 15, 2009, the DVA issued a Rating Decision that increased Husband\u2019s monthly disability entitlement and allowed him to receive thirty, rather than ten, percent of his total military benefits as disability benefits rather than pension:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">Evaluation of right knee replacement, which is currently 10 percent disabling, is increased to 100 percent effective December 19, 2008. An evaluation of 30 percent is assigned from February 1, 2010[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">On October 26, 2011, Wife reopened the case and filed a Complaint for Entry of Qualified Domestic Relations Orders. One of the two orders she sought pertained to Husband\u2019s military pension, and would have provided that \u201cany portion of the Service Member\u2019s Disposable Retired Pay that he waives in order to receive military disability retired pay ... in lieu of Disposable Retired Pay shall be added back in, and any deficiency resulting from any such waiver that affects the amount paid directly to [Wife] by the Designated Agent shall be paid to her directly by [Husband].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>answer stating that Wife\u2019s proposed orders were \u201cseriously inconsistent with the October 26, 2004 order.\u201d After a hearing on February 27, 2012, the circuit court denied Wife\u2019s Motion for Entry of Qualified Domestic Relations Orders and entered an order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On August 21, 2012, Wife filed a Motion for Declaratory Judgment and Ancillary Relief, requesting that the circuit court determine that she had a valid claim to Husband\u2019s pension arrears and that the court enter a Constituted Pension Order that included a provision that \u201c[t]o the extent the Designated Agent is prohibited by law or regulation from paying the entire amount required by this order to [Wife], [Husband] shall personally pay any shortfall to [Wife].\u201d Husband responded that \u201c[t]he order violates federal law and deprives [Husband] of disability benefits for a disability which occurred before the marriage, worsened during the marriage. Such action by the state court is explicitly barred by federal law.\u201d The court held a hearing and determined that Wife was entitled to the same division of retirement benefits in the 2004 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">I agree with both of you. [Husband\u2019s counsel], yes, the court can\u2019t order retirement benefits and disability benefits for\u2014 from your client\u2019s military award, but at the same time I agree with [Wife\u2019s counsel] in terms of the Allen case and the argument that every person in the military would then file then later disability and then try and cut the spouse off completely or to a certain percentage of the disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">I don\u2019t think that was the intent of the courts. I\u2019ve looked at the\u2014and reviewed the judgment of divorce in 2004, and it looks like the court contemplated that [Wife] would receive one-third of all retirement benefits accrued between June 3rd, 1972 and April 2nd, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">To deny her benefits that were originally for\u2014I\u2019m sorry, to deny her benefits that the court originally intended for her to share today would be contrary to the intent, I believe, of the court based on the court\u2019s determination after a hotly contested trial of the testimony and the exhibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>And of course I\u2019m not going to demand that the military-payments be paid directly to [Wife] because it would be in violation of federal law, but in principle not of contract, but out of principle of the intent of the original court that issued the absolute divorce I think and I believe that\u2014and I\u2019m not in [the 2004 judgej\u2019s head, but I think he was trying to award her one-third of the spouse\u2019s, [Husband]\u2019s military retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">In terms of some sort of provision, [Wife\u2019s counsel], that you\u2019re asking the court to put in here that would limit the amount or prevent her from\u2014that\u2019s something in the future, and because there\u2019s no number that we have definitive now I hesitate to do that, and of course I think if there is ever a 30 percent, they stay with 30 percent or go higher I\u2019m sure\u2014and this court does have jurisdiction over the parties\u2014that you will come back to court and ask for some relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">After two days of hearings on April 16 and 17, 2014, the circuit court entered a Constituted Pension Order that awarded Wife \u201c26.57<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> percent of [Husband\u00ed\u2019s disposable military retired pay [and] a pro rata share of any post-retirement increases and cost of living adjustments to [Husbandj\u2019s Disposable Retired Pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On November 14, 2014, Husband filed a Motion to Modify or Reconsider Ruling As to Military Disability Compensation or, in the Alternative, for Judgment in Favor of Defendant and Request for Hearing. Wife responded on December 1, 2014, and in an order filed December 9, 2014, the circuit court denied Husband\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In March 2015, Husband filed a Motion to Amend Constituted Pension Order in which he requested that the court change the percent of the total pension to which Wife was entitled to 23.97% rather than 26.57%. The court denied Husband\u2019s motion, and on September 18, 2015, entered a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, that provided, among other things, \u201cthat the trial court intended through its Judgment of Absolute Divorce for [Wife] to receive one-third of [Husband]\u2019s military pension benefits accrued between June 3,1972 and April 1, 2002\u201d and that the parties agreed that Wife\u2019s \u201cmarital share of [Husbandj\u2019s military pension is 26.6%.\u201d The court further recognized that directing the military to pay the full amount of the pension owed to Wife would contravene federal law and \u201c[ordered] that [Husband] shall pay to [Wife] the differential between the amount [Wife] receives directly from the government once [Wife] begins to receive her portion of the pension through the Constituted Pension Order, and the full amount of the pension she is entitled to receive pursuant to the divorce judgment.\u201d On May 16, 2016, the parties filed a Proposed Supplemental Order, which the court entered on June 14, 2016, that ordered that Husband pay Wife \u201c26.57% of [his] military disability payments by direct payment as a result of converting a portion of his military retired pay to disability pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The circuit court then entered a Declaratory Judgment, dated July 15, 2016, declaring that Wife was not entitled to any portion of Husband\u2019s disability benefits and that any portions of the Judgment for Absolute Divorce requiring division of Husband\u2019s disability benefits was unenforceable. The circuit court explained in its accompanying memorandum that it \u201clack[ed] authority to order division of [Husband]\u2019s military disability benefits, where, as here, [Husband] took no steps to dilute [Wife]\u2019s ordered share of the benefits and the parties reached no agreement regarding division of such benefits.\u201d The court, however, \u201c[declared] that to the extent funds are available for payment of benefits to [Wife] from [Husband]\u2019s disposable retirement pay, [Wife] is entitled to receive the benefits, up to one-third of [Husband]\u2019s benefits as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>quired by the Judgment of Absolute Divorce.\u201d This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Husband challenges the portion of his military benefits that the circuit court required him to pay to Wife after his military disability benefits increased,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that decision is grounded in legal conclusions that we review <em>de novo. Wilson v. Wilson, </em>223 Md.App. 599, 609, 117 A.3d 138 (2015) (citation omitted). He offers three arguments in favor of reversal. <em>First, </em>he attempts to distinguish this case from three reported cases of this Court that address the division by agreement of a spouse\u2019s military retirement benefits. <em>Second, </em>whether or not this case is distinguishable, he argues, the earlier cases on which the circuit court relied were decided wrongly. <em>Third, </em>Husband argues that the circuit court considered improperly his future eligibility for military disability compensation when it considered and awarded alimony to Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Although it might seem like a regular family law case, this appeal poses a thorny federalism question. Marriage, divorce, and the division of marital property are quintessentially matters of state law, and pension or retirement benefits normally are considered marital property at the time of divorce. But military benefits are creatures of federal law, and the treatment of military benefits in state divorce proceedings has been a source of federal and state tension for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In 1981, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the federal statute governing military benefits preempted state family law and precluded those benefits from being treated as community property in state divorce proceedings. <em>McCarty v. McCarty, </em>453 U.S. 210, 232-33, 101 S.Ct. 2728, 69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>L.Ed.2d 589 (1981). The Court of Appeals extended the <em>McCarty </em>principle to marital property in this equitable distribution state soon after. <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>291 Md. 615, 620-21, 436 A.2d 67 (1981). In response to <em>McCarty, </em>Congress passed the Uniform Services Former Spouses Protection Act (\u201cUSFS-PA\u201d), codified in pertinent part at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408. That statute authorized states to treat the net disposable pay of retired service members as divisible property. <em>Collins v. Collins, </em>144 Md.App. 395, 421-22, 798 A.2d 1155 (2002). The USFSPA defines \u201cdisposable retired pay\u201d as \u201cthe total monthly retired pay to which a member is entitled\u201d minus certain amounts. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4). \u201cAmong the amounts required to be deducted from total pay are any amounts waived in order to receive disability benefits.\u201d <em>Mansell v. Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 585, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675 (1989) (citing 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4)). \u201cThus, under the Act\u2019s plain and precise language, state courts have been granted the authority to treat disposable retired pay as community property; they have not been granted the authority to treat total retired pay as community property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 109 S.Ct. 2023.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Faced with the <em>McCarty </em>issue under the then-new statute, the Supreme Court held in <em>Mansell </em>that \u201cthe [USFSPA] does not grant state courts the power to treat as property divisible upon divorce military retirement pay that has been waived to receive veterans\u2019 disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594-95, 109 S.Ct. 2023. And in the course of explaining the differences between the two forms of benefits, the Court recognized the tax advantages of waiving retirement pay in favor of disability benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">Members of the Armed Forces who serve for a specified period, generally at least 20 years, may retire with retired pay. The amount of retirement pay a veteran is eligible to receive is calculated according to the number of years served and the rank achieved.... The amount of disability benefits a veteran is eligible to receive is calculated according to the seriousness of the disability and the degree to which the veteran\u2019s ability to earn a living has been impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>In order to prevent double dipping, a military retiree may receive disability benefits only to the extent that he waives a corresponding amount of his military retirement pay. <em>Because disability benefits are exempt from federal, state, and local taxation, </em>... <em>military retirees who waive their retirement pay in favor of disability benefits increase their after-tax income. Not surprisingly, waivers of retirement pay are common.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 109 S.Ct. 2023 (emphasis added) (internal citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">As to military pension benefits, though, the USFSPA \u201cspecifically overruled the Supreme Court with the intent to return to state law. \u2018Under Maryland law, ... pensions generally, including military pensions, are marital property.\u2019\u201d <em>Collins, </em>144 Md.App. at 422, 798 A.2d 1155 (quoting <em>Andresen v. Andresen, </em>317 Md. 380, 384, 564 A.2d 399 (1989)). \u201c[A] military pension shall be considered in the same manner as any other pension or retirement benefit\u201d when determining whether property is marital property. Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Yol.), \u00a7 8-203(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d); <em>see also Collins, </em>144 Md.App. at 415, 798 A.2d 1155 (\u201cThere is no question that a pension, or rights to a pension, are part of marital property.\u201d (citations omitted)). Thus, a court \u201cmay transfer ownership of an interest in a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, from one party to either or both parties,\u201d FL \u00a7 8-205(a)(2)(i), \u201cto the extent it was earned during the marriage,\u201d <em>Woodson v. Saldana, </em>165 Md.App. 480, 488, 885 A.2d 907 (2005). \u201c[T]he court has broad discretion in evaluating pensions and retirement benefits, and in determining the manner in which those benefits are to be distributed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 885 A.2d 907 (quoting <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>135 Md.App. 29, 54, 761 A.2d 949 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The veteran spouse\u2019s ability to waive retirement pay in favor of disability benefits creates opportunities for disagreements and gaming, though, especially when the election comes after the property division is finalized. In earlier cases, we and other state courts reconciled this tension by treating the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>military benefit as a whole. <em>See Allen v. Allen, </em>178 Md.App. 145, 155, 941 A.2d 510 (2008) (stating that the term \u201cpension/retirement plans\u201d included \u201call retirement benefits accrued as a result of appellant\u2019s military service\u201d); <em>see also Bandini v. Bandini, </em>935 N.E.2d 253, 260-61 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010) (stating that the term \u201cmilitary retirement/pension plan\u201d is broad and refers to the appellant\u2019s retirement benefits as one unit such that, in the absence of any limiting language, it \u201cencompasse[d] [appellant\u2019s gross retirement pay, before any deductions for [his Survivor Benefit Plan] costs or amounts waived to receive [DVA] disability benefits\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>37 S.W.3d 892, 896-97 (Tenn. 2001) (stating that where the phrase \u201call military retirement benefits\u201d was undefined, it unambiguously included \u201call amounts to which the retiree would ordinarily be entitled as a result of retirement from the military,\u201d including amounts waived to receive disability benefits). Although the portions of a veteran\u2019s gross retirement pay waived to receive disability benefits may not be included in a marital award, <em>Mansell, </em>490 U,S. at 594-95, 109 S.Ct. 2023, several states\u2019 courts have enforced agreements\u2014in other words, kept the non-veteran spouse whole\u2014 where the veteran elected <em>after the decree </em>to waive all or some of a military retirement pension to receive disability benefits. <em>See, e.g., Bandini, </em>935 N.E.2d at 262, 266; <em>Allen, </em>178 Md.App. at 155-56, 941 A.2d 510; <em>Dexter v. Dexter, </em>105 Md.App. 678, 680, 661 A.2d 171 (1995); <em>Johnson, </em>37 S.W.3d at 896-97. Although the veteran was entitled as a matter of federal law to make the election, divorce courts viewed the exercise of that right as altering the parties\u2019 bargain as a matter of state law, and took steps to maintain the balance that the parties intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Our Court confronted this tension in three reported cases over the years. In <em>Dexter, </em>the parties reached an agreement regarding the division of one spouse\u2019s military pension, and that agreement was read into the record and incorporated into their divorce judgment. <em>Dexter, </em>105 Md.App. at 680, 661 A.2d 171. Shortly thereafter, the military spouse voluntarily waived his rights to military retirement benefits in favor of disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>benefits, and the non-military spouse stopped receiving pension payments. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 661 A.2d 171. We concluded that \u201c[t]he inability of [the non-military spouse] to receive the benefits she bargained for [wa]s caused not by any federal statute or case law, but by [the military spouse]\u2019s rejection, by waiver, of the retirement benefits that he had agreed were to be partially hers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 661 A.2d 171. Relying on Maryland contract law, we held that the military spouse\u2019s voluntary waiver of his military retirement pension breached his contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">where ... the parties enter into an agreement that one spouse will receive a percentage of pension benefits, on a periodic basis, when they become payable, and when ... they are already payable and being paid, the pensioned party may not hinder the ability of the party\u2019s spouse to receive the payments she has bargained for, by voluntarily rejecting, waiving, or terminating the pension benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 686, 661 A.2d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">We reached similar conclusions in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Wilson. </em>In <em>Allen, </em>we determined that a military spouse who had agreed to share a pension may not take steps to dilute the other spouse\u2019s share by rejecting, waiving, or terminating pension benefits voluntarily. 178 Md.App. at 155-56, 941 A.2d 510. Viewing the case through a contractual lens, we concluded that the nonmilitary spouse would be entitled to the agreed percentage of the veteran\u2019s overall military benefit \u201cbecause [the military spousej\u2019s disability retirement benefits are paid as pension and retirement benefits and take the place of other pension and retirement benefits, [and thus,] they are subject to the division of \u2018pension/retirement plans.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>And we recognized that although federal law precludes state courts from treating disability retirement benefits as marital property, the veteran spouse could discharge his obligations without spending disability benefits to do it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">[t]he circuit court\u2019s ruling on appeal does not require payment to [the spouse] of any disability benefits, thus, the court, in essence, is not treating as property divisible, payment that has been waived to receive disability benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>When [the military spouse] was discharged from the military, he received in entirety the benefits the United States owed to him for his service. These assets have become part of [the retiree\u2019s] general assets. Accordingly, [the military spouse] can satisfy the judgment against him with any assets, thereby not violating <em>Mansell. </em>We, therefore, affirm the circuit court\u2019s determination of arrearages to be satisfied by [the military spouse] out of his general assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7F\"><em>Id. </em>at 153-54, 941 A.2d 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>Wilson, </em>we held as well that where a party agrees to a transfer of assignable pension benefits as part of a divorce settlement, he may not frustrate that agreement by waiving those pension benefits. 223 Md.App. at 629, 117 A.3d 138. We noted that, as in <em>Allen, </em>178 Md.App. at 146, 941 A.2d 510, the parties agreed that the spouse would receive a percentage of the marital portion of the military spouse\u2019s military retirement benefits and \u201cthat those benefits were not required to be paid by the military.\u201d 223 Md.App. at 626, 117 A.3d 138. After looking at <em>Allen </em>and <em>Dapp v. Dapp, </em>211 Md.App. 323, 65 A.3d 214 (2013), we concluded that the military spouse\u2019s \u201canticipated military benefits were divisible and assignable at the time of contract,\u201d that \u201cthe parties\u2019 property settlement agreement was valid at the time it was executed, and the trial court had the authority to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>223 Md.App. at 629, 117 A.3d 138 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Our eases are consistent with the majority view in other states\u2019 courts, <em>i.e., </em>that <em>Mansell </em>and the USFSPA did not preclude courts from requiring a military spouse to compensate a spouse when the spouse\u2019s share of retirement pay was reduced by the military spouse\u2019s unilateral waiver of retirement pay in favor of disability benefits. As in our cases, these courts proceeded from the principle that it is inequitable to allow a veteran to diminish voluntarily the military retirement benefits owed to a spouse as part of a valid and enforceable divorce judgment. <em>E.g., In re Marriage of Krempin, </em>70 Cal. App.4th 1008, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 134, 143 (1999); <em>In re Marriage of Warkocz, </em>141 P.3d 926, 929-30 (Colo. Ct. App. 2006); <em>Black v. Black, </em>842 A.2d 1280, 1285 (Me. 2004); <em>Shelton v. Shelton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>119 Nev. 492, 78 P.3d 507, 509-10 (2003); <em>Whitfield v. Whitfield, </em>373 N.J.Super. 573, 862 A.2d 1187, 1192 (App. Div. 2004); <em>Hadrych v. Hadrych, </em>140 N.M. 829, 149 P.3d 593, 597 (App. 2006); <em>Resare v. Resare, </em>908 A.2d 1006, 1009-10 (R.I. 2006).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Some courts distinguished pre-divorce and post-divorce waivers on the ground that <em>Mansell\u2019s, </em>holding, <em>ie., </em>that state courts may not \u201ctreat as property divisible upon divorce military retirement pay that <em>has been waived </em>to receive veterans\u2019 disability benefits,\u201d 490 U.S. at 594-95, 109 S.Ct. 2023 (emphasis added), extended only to waivers known at the time of the divorce. <em>See, e.g., Krempin, </em>83 Cal.Rptr.2d at 139. Some focused more on the non-military spouse\u2019s vested interest in the military retirement pay, and precluded the military spouse from waiving retirement pay in favor of disability benefits after the divorce judgment. <em>E.g., Surratt v. Surratt, </em>85 Ark. App. 267, 148 S.W.3d 761, 767 (2004); <em>In re Marriage of Neilsen &amp; Magrini, </em>341 Ill.App.3d 863, 275 Ill.Dec. 369, 792 N.E.2d 844, 849 (2003); <em>Black, </em>842 A.2d at 1286; <em>Hadrych, </em>149 P.3d at 598; <em>Hodge v. Hodge, </em>197 P.3d 511, 515-16 (Okla. Civ. App. 2008); <em>Johnson, </em>37 S.W.3d at 897-98.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Either way, these courts, like the circuit court in this case, recognized the federal law that creates the veteran\u2019s right to different types of benefits, but sought, in the context of state law divorce proceedings, to blunt the opportunity for veterans to game their divorce judgments through after-the-fact elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">But a new Supreme Court decision, issued since oral argument in this case, diminishes state courts\u2019 efforts to carry out state law objectives in this quintessentially state law space. In <em>Howell v. Howell, </em>the Supreme Court held that state law purporting to recognize a vested interest in military retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ment pay is preempted by federal law, period. - U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1400, 1405-06, 197 L.Ed.2d 781 (2017) (citing <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. at 594-95, 109 S.Ct. 2023). Put another way, the veteran\u2019s ability under federal law to waive retirement pay for disability benefits, at whatever time his disability status might change, overrides (preempts!) any state law agreement he might have made, or state court judgment to which he was a party, relating to his military retirement benefits, and the parties and state court should have factored this possibility when valuing the parties\u2019 marital property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">Hence here, as the Solicitor General emphasizes, the nonmilitary spouse and the family court were likely to have assumed that a full share of the veteran\u2019s retirement pay would remain available after the assets were distributed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">Nonetheless, the temporal difference highlights only that [the veteran\u2019s] military retirement pay at the time it came to [the spouse] was subject to later reduction (should [the veteran] exercise a waiver to receive disability benefits to which he is entitled). The state court did not extinguish (and most likely would not have had the legal power to extinguish) that future contingency. The existence of that contingency meant that the value of [the spouse\u2019s] share of military retirement pay was possibly worth less\u2014perhaps less than [the spouse] and others thought\u2014at the time of divorce. So too is an ownership interest in property (say A\u2019s property interest in Blackacre) worth less if it is subject to defeasance or termination upon the occurrence of a later event (say, B\u2019s death).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">137 S.Ct. at 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Before <em>Howell, </em>our decisions in <em>Allen, Dexter, </em>and <em>Wilson </em>supported the circuit court\u2019s decision here. And as a matter of real-world logic, those decisions made sense. In a divorce like this, where the military spouse\u2019s pension comprises a meaningful proportion of the couple\u2019s marital property, the court presiding over the divorce has to value the assets based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>information available at the time of trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When Husband and Wife divorced, the trial court didn\u2019t know that Husband was receiving disability benefits, and the record before us reveals no inkling that his disability status might increase over time. Even if the parties had had such an inkling, there would have been no way to know whether the military would have granted a change in status, how much of a change it might grant, or when. <em>Allen, Dexter, </em>and <em>Wilson </em>respected the federal law defining military retirement and disability benefits, but viewed the federal law as defining the property that the divorce court was to value and divide, and allowed our courts to adapt the implementation of their marital property awards to the fluid real-life circumstances of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><em>Howell </em>effectively overrules these cases. And as a result, Husband\u2019s ability to elect disability benefits over retirement pay overrides our courts\u2019 ability to amend the marital property award to reflect post-judgment changes in circumstances. Although the circuit court could not have known this at the time, we now know that military retirement benefits are <em>always </em>contingent, whether or not the veteran has a disability rating at the time of divorce. The possibility of a new disability rating is <em>always </em>out there, and parties and courts must account for (and attempt to predict the likelihood of) these contingencies when valuing military retirement pay. To be sure, the Supreme Court recognized that its holding might work as a hardship on divorcing spouses, and \u201cnote[d] that a family court, when it first determines the value of a family\u2019s assets, remains free to take account of the contingency that some military retirement pay might be waived, or ... take account of reductions in value when it calculates or recalculates the need for spousal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1406. But of course, that doesn\u2019t help Wife in this case, whose \u201cone-third of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>marital share of [Husbandj\u2019s pension from the United States Army, the marital share ... to be calculated from June 3, 1972 to April 1, 2002\u201d was grounded on a then-valid valuation of Husband\u2019s benefit stream, but now finds herself entitled to a one-third share of a smaller pie.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Without <em>Howell, </em>our precedents would have supported a decision to affirm the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Howell </em>changed the superseding federal law on the question before us in this case, and compels us to reverse the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Even so, the preemptive scope of <em>Howell </em>governs only the treatment of this particular asset in the analysis of marital property awards, and doesn\u2019t seem to preclude a court from considering the contingent or diminished value of a military pension in connection with other relevant decisions in divorce cases. When Congress preempts state law, it does so \u201c \u2018against the background of the total <em>corpus juris </em>of the states.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wallis v. Pan Am. Petro. Corp., </em>384 U.S. 63, 68, 86 S.Ct. 1301, 16 L.Ed.2d 369 (1966) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]his is especially true where a statute deals with a familial relationship; there is no federal law of domestic relations, which is primarily a matter of state concern.\u201d <em>De Sylva v. Ballentine, </em>351 U.S. 570, 580, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956); <em>see also U.S. v. Yazell, </em>382 U.S. 341, 351, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966) (explaining that the Supreme Court\u2019s theory and precedent \u201cteach us solicitude for state interests, particularly in the field of family and family-property arrangements\u201d); <em>Ex parte Burrus, </em>136 U.S. 586, 593-94, 10 S.Ct. 850, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890) (\u201cThe whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife ... belongs to the laws of the states, and not to the laws of the United States.\u201d). As part of our federalist bargain, Congress may preempt state law \u201cwhere clear and substantial interests of the National Government, which <em>cannot </em>be served consistently with respect for such state interests, will suffer major damage if the state law is applied.\u201d <em>Yazell, </em>382 U.S. at 351, 86 S.Ct. 500 (emphasis added). \u201cOn the rare occasion when state family law has come into conflict with a federal statute,\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s review under the Supremacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Clause is limited to \u201cdetermining] whether Congress \u2018has positively required by direct enactment\u2019 that state law be preempted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. 572, 581, 99 S.Ct. 802, 59 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (quoting <em>Wetmore v. Markoe, </em>196 U.S. 68, 77, 25 S.Ct. 172, 49 L.Ed. 390 (1904)). We presume, therefore, that Congress\u2014and by extension, the Supreme Court\u2014preempts no more broadly than necessary, and only to the extent it has said so. <em>Cf. Wissner v. Wissner, </em>338 U.S. 655, 658, 70 S.Ct. 398, 94 L.Ed. 424 (1950) (Congress must preempt state authority with \u201cforce and clarity,\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><em>Howell </em>dealt solely with the distribution of federal military benefits, and that is as far as we think it reaches. The Supreme Court itself has long recognized that issues of family law are \u201c \u2018utterly incapable of being reduced to any pecuniary standard of value, as [they] rise[ ] superior to money considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ex parte Burrus, </em>136 U.S. at 595, 10 S.Ct. 850 (citing <em>Barry v. Mercein, </em>46 U.S. 103, 5 How. 103, 12 L.Ed. 70 (1847)). The distribution of the marital property, even the marital property of military couples, encompasses more than the proper valuation and treatment of federal benefits\u2014it involves the consideration of equities that transcend accounting and money, a balancing analysis distinctly and historically a matter of state law. <em>See Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 509, 629 A.2d 70 (1993); <em>see also Ex parte Burrus, </em>136 U.S. at 597, 10 S.Ct. 850 (\u201c[A] federal court cannot decide a family law case.\u201d). All the more so in Maryland, an <em>equitable </em>property state. <em>See Alston, </em>331 Md. at 508-09, 629 A.2d 70 (\u201cThe Maryland Legislature specifically rejected the notion that marital property should be divided equally\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><em>Howell </em>now has redefined (or maybe re-redefined) the federal retirement and disability benefits that may be considered \u201cmarital property.\u201d But a Maryland trial court\u2019s equitable division of marital property only truly begins \u201conce property [i]s determined to be \u2018marital\u2019 \u201d in the first place. <em>See id. </em>at 508, 629 A.2d 70. In other words, the Supreme Court may have shrunk the size of a slice (i.e., military pension benefits) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>in the marital award pie, but it is still up to our trial courts to determine the size of the pie under state law, then divide it equitably under the totality of the circumstances, and, alongside that process, to make other decisions about the parties\u2019 post-marital financial future. To posit one other example, the impact of <em>Howell </em>may in a particular case constitute a change in circumstances entitling a court to revisit an alimony award, which is \u201calways subject to reconsideration and modification in the light of changed circumstances,\u201d <em>Heinmuller v. Heinmuller, </em>257 Md. 672, 676-77, 264 A.2d 847 (1970), whether or not the parties or the court were aware <em>ex ante </em>that a spouse could elect to waive pension payments for disability benefits. We don\u2019t have any of these questions before us in this case, and <em>Howell </em>leaves them to be decided by trial courts\u2014our State\u2019s trial courts\u2014in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
