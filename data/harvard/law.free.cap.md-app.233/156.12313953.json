On June 9, 2010, appellant Manekin Construction, LLC (\u201cMane-kin\u201d) was awarded a contract with DGS to construct a two-story barrack and a one-story garage for the Maryland State Police in Hagerstown, Maryland. The contract price totaled more than eight million dollars and was subject to mutually agreed upon Proposed Change Orders (\u201cPCOs\u201d). As we discuss in detail below, Manekin submitted PCO No. 68 to DGS requesting additional compensation during the construction of the project. After the project was complete, Manekin submitted a \u201cRequest for Equitable Settlement\u201d on March 18, 2013. After DGS\u2019s procurement officer denied Manekin\u2019s claim for compensation, Manekin appealed to the Board. On September 17, 2016, during a hearing on the merits of the claim, the Board stopped the proceedings and granted DGS\u2019s Third Motion for Summary Decision. The Circuit Court for Howard County affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The primary issue we must decide on appeal is whether the Board erred when it stopped the evidentiary hearing and granted summary decision in favor of DGS. More specifically, we must decide whether the Board improperly made findings of fact on disputed issues, including whether Manekin knew or should have known that DGS disputed or rejected Manekin\u2019s request for compensation detailed in PCO No. 68. For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>reasons explained below, we hold that the Board erred in its decision to grant summary decision in favor of DGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Construction of the barrack and garage took place from June 21, 2010 until the project was substantially complete on or around July 26, 2012. Approximately every two weeks throughout the construction process, Manekin and DGS officials held meetings (\u201cProgress Meetings\u201d) to discuss Mane-kin\u2019s progress and other issues. During performance of the construction, Manekin encountered certain difficulties that it attributed to delays caused by DGS (among other reasons) and submitted numerous PCOs, thereby requesting additional compensation. On November 2, 2011, Manekin notified DGS of the \u201ccumulative impact and ripple effect of\u2019 certain factors. On December 7, 2011, Manekin submitted PCO No. 68, requesting compensation for the \u201cadditional time, and associated general conditions costs resulting from changes\u201d discussed in the November 2, 2011 letter. A letter attached to PCO No. 68 detailed the changes requested, including the five \u201cimpact factors\u201d that affected the cost of the project. Manekin and DGS discussed PCO No. 68 at three Progress Meetings, during which the issue was designated as \u201cvoid\u201d in the minutes for Progress Meetings and in the \u201cPCO Log.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">After the completion of the project, on or around March 18, 2013, Manekin sent a \u201cRequest for Equitable Settlement\u201d to DGS requesting compensation for additional time caused by the same five impact factors as outlined in PCO No. 68. DGS denied the request in a letter dated April 3, 2013. DGS indicated in its letter, \u201cif you wish to further pursue this matter, you may do so in accordance with COMAR [Code of Maryland Regulations] 21.10.04 and the Contract Documents, General Conditions, Section 6.13, \u2018Disputes and Contract Claims.\u2019 \u201d On April 10, 2013, Manekin submitted its notice of claim, and on April 29, 2013, submitted its formal claim to the procurement officer. The procurement officer denied Mane-kin\u2019s claim on November 12, 2013, finding that the notice of claim was not submitted within thirty days of when Manekin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>knew or should have known of the basis of a claim. Manekin timely appealed to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">On September 17, 2016, the Board stopped the proceedings and granted DGS\u2019s pending Third Motion for Summary Decision, finding that Manekin knew of the basis of its claim by no later than March 1, 2012, which was more than thirty days before Manekin submitted its notice of claim. On September 21, 2015, the Board issued a written order. Manekin filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County. After a hearing on April 21, 2016, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s grant of summary decision in a written opinion issued on April 27, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\n<em>DGS Contract &amp; Relevant COMAR Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A25\">The \u201cDepartment of General Services General Conditions for Construction Contracts (Revised March 2007)\u201d contains the conditions of the contract between DGS and Manekin. As required, the contract incorporates the language of COMAR 21.07.02.05-1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under a section of the contract entitled \u201c6.13 Disputes and Contract Claims (COMAR 21.07.02.05-1),\u201d the contract provides that it is \u201csubject to the provisions of State Finance and Procurement Article, Title 15, Subtitle 2, Annotated Code of Maryland, and COMAR 21.10.\u201d The following are other pertinent provisions incorporated in the contract from COMAR 21.07.02.05-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">B. Except as otherwise provided in this contract or by law, all disputes arising under or as a result of a breach of this contract that are not disposed of by mutual agreement shall be resolved in accordance with this clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">C. As used herein, claim means a written demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking, as a legal right, the payment of money, adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief, arising under or relating to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>contract. A voucher, invoice, or request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under this clause. However, if the submission subsequently is not acted upon in a reasonable time, or is disputed as to liability or amount, it may be converted to a claim for the purpose of this clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">D. Within 30 days after Contractor knows or should have known of the basis for a claim relating to this contract, Contractor shall file a written notice of claim with the procurement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\u215c * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">F. The claim shall set forth all the facts surrounding the controversy. Contractor, at the discretion of the procurement officer, may be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>PCO No. 68</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On December 7, 2011, Manekin submitted PCO No. 68 providing two methods for calculating the amount of compensation it asserted to be due for the five impact factors discussed in PCO No. 68\u2014a \u201cChange Order Analysis\u201d and a \u201cMeasured Mile Approach.\u201d Manekin notes in the PCO that, although these two methods produced two different time calculations, they were intended to provide a basis for further negotiations. Manekin relied on its \u201cGeneral Requirements Costs\u201d of $1,315.00 per day, as provided in the original contract with DGS, and requested 96 days of \u201cContract Time Extension\u201d plus other expenses, for a total of $128,134.00. Within the PCO, however, Manekin \u201creserve[d] the right to request compensation for all direct and indirect costs attributable to this delay impact.\u201d At the end of PCO No. 68, Manekin added, \u201cWe believe our calculations to be reasonable and an appropriate representation of the impacts to Manekin on this project. However, we are willing to meet and negotiate an acceptable compromise without this matter escalating to another level.\u201d Thereafter, the parties\u2019 representatives discussed PCO No. 68 at multiple Progress Meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\n<em>PCO Log</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The PCO Log is a record of all PCOs as well as each PCO\u2019s status. The status of each PCO is indicated in the \u201cRemarks/Days\u201d column. Some of these status designations include \u201cVOID,\u201d \u201cREJECTED,\u201d \u201cCREDIT,\u201d and various phrases such as \u201cNo charge VOID,\u201d \u201cLocated in PCO # 13 VOID,\u201d or \u201cG.C. agrees to amt.\u201d Additionally, in the date column, either the date of the action is indicated or, if the PCO\u2019s status is \u2018VOID,\u201d only the word \u2018VOID\u201d is listed in place of the date. A column labeled \u201cPCO AMT.\u201d lists the amount requested for each PCO, and a column labeled \u201cDGS EST.\u201d lists the amount to be added to the total amount due to Manekin. For any item designated as \u201cVOID,\u201d the \u201cDGS EST.\u201d is either blank or has a value of \u201c$0.00.\u201d At the end of the PCO Log, the total \u201cDGS EST.\u201d indicated is $1,232,918.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">For PCO No. 68, which is described as \u201cTime Extension Request to justify new schedule,\u201d the table indicates a \u201cPCO AMT.\u201d of $128,134.00, and the term \u2018VOID\u201d is included under the \u201cREMARKS/DAYS\u201d column and in the date column. For comparison purposes, PCO No. 22 (\u201cSoil Fill Material Phase # 1), which had a \u201cPCO AMT.\u201d of $117,642.00, is recorded as \u201cREJECTED\u201d in the \u201cREMARKS/DAYS\u201d column. PCO No. 70 (\u201cRevise Membrane @ Phse Chimney Caps\u201d), on the other hand, is listed as \u201cNo charge VOID\u201d and no amount was added to the total.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Progress Meetings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The record before the Board contained the minutes for each relevant Progress Meeting, including Progress Meetings 37, 38, and 39. The minutes for each Progress Meeting include the names of persons attending, who would receive a copy of the minutes, a synopsis of the progress of the project as of that date, and notes of the topics discussed at the meeting. The minutes from Progress Meeting 37, held on January 5, 2012, include a section entitled \u201cTime Extension PCO Discussion\u201d containing eighteen points of discussion. The relevant portion of the minutes from Progress Meeting 37 includes the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>14. J.

A fragnet is a detailed analysis of how particular factors impacted the construction project, such as when and how the contractor lost scheduled time. The minutes indicate that the parties continued to discuss PCO No. 68, referenced by the following notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">VOIDED AA. PCO 068\u2014Rock extension is not approved to April 14, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-15\">Day after Jan. 27, 2012 Liquidated Damages will be accessed [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-16\">Fragnets must be submitted and part of the time extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>01-05-12 VOIDED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Finally, the minutes from Progress Meeting 39, held on February 2, 2012, included the same notations under points 14, 15, and 18 as the minutes from Progress Meeting 37, with the addition of the following notes added to point 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">01-19-12 52 days currently being allowed for extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">02-02-12 Substantial Complete is now May 1st (Added 131 days)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\n<em>Hearing Before the Board and the Board\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In a letter dated August 7, 2015 from Board Member Dana Dembrow, the Board notified the parties of the trial date for Manekin\u2019s appeal of the procurement officer\u2019s denial of its claim. The brief letter included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">As you know, there are three (3) Motions pending for Partial Summary Decision in this matter, which is currently scheduled for trial on September 14, 2015.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">Counsel understand that the pending Motions must be based on factual matters as to which there is no genuine dispute, and that all factual inferences must be resolved in favor of the adverse party at this point in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">At the present time, the Board does not anticipate making any decision on the pending Motions until after evidence is presented at trial. Of course, counsel are also free to renew Motions during the course of trial as evidence is adduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">We hope this correspondence is useful to your trial preparation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Hearings before the Board were held on September 14, 16, and 17, 2016. The only witness to testify before the Board ended the proceedings by granting DGS\u2019s motion for summary decision was Daniel Sharpe, Vice President and Project Manager for Manekin. Sharpe testified regarding when he became aware that DGS had denied the request contained in PCO No. 68. The following colloquy between the Presiding Member of the Board and counsel for DGS ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>PRESIDING MEMBER DEMBROW: ... Now, frankly, ... there\u2019s nothing in this affidavit that says what Mr. Rohrbach intended by the word void or voided. And that\u2019s the crux of the issue. [... ] We\u2019re still trying to figure out what was meant by void. So hopefully we\u2019ll get to that point. [...] [YJou\u2019ve made a very effective point that the State told the Appellant this PCO 68 was void. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">[COUNSEL FOR DGS]: Mr. Dembrow, ... I gave you a Daniel Webster\u2019s Dictionary definition of the word void. [...] You\u2019re not going to get anything more from the State. We just\u2014we use English words .... And [counsel for Manekin] will agree with me, the word void isn\u2019t defined anywhere in the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">PRESIDING MEMBER DEMBROW: ... I\u2019ve been waiting to hear from Mr. Rohrbach. In this affidavit he ... reiterates that he uses the word void. It seems odd that he doesn\u2019t say PCO 68 was rejected. What it says is it was void. And it further says that it was void with the opportunity to submit or the request and requirements to submit fragnets. And Mr. Sharpe, if we can [direct] your attention to the progress meeting on January 5, 2012 ... that\u2019s where the progress meeting reports say, quote, Dan Sharpe offered March 1, 2012 and leave discussion open on compensational. Whatever that means ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Counsel for DGS returned to questioning Sharpe and asked whether his belief \u201cin his mind\u201d that the issue in PCO No. 68 was left open had been documented. After Sharpe pointed to the Progress Meeting minutes notation \u201cleave open on com-pensational [sic],\u201d Presiding Member Dembrow added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">PRESIDING MEMBER DEMBROW: I think he has ... I think that the progress meeting notes are consistent with what he said. He\u2019s saying that he asked for the compensation to be left open, and the minutes of the progress meeting say leave discussion open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Thereafter, Presiding Member Dembrow interrupted cross-examination to ask a question directed at counsel for DGS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>PRESIDING MEMBER DEMBROW: ... Mr. Rohrbach is not going to testify, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">[COUNSEL FOR DGS]: I haven\u2019t made that decision yet, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">PRESIDING MEMBER DEMBROW: I\u2019m curious to know why it says in the affidavit that he never told anyone that they could wait until a later date, but all the notes reflect that they\u2019re asking for fragnets. They\u2019re requiring fragnets. They want proof that it\u2019s on the critical path. Obviously there was an anticipation that [Manekin was] going to submit something or [DGS] wouldn\u2019t have required and requested it. And ... that\u2019s sort of a mystery at this point. [.,. ] [H]e voided and asked for fragnets. That\u2019s the dilemma. That\u2019s the dichotomy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">[COUNSEL FOR DGS]: No, no, no, that\u2019s not what his ... if you .., Mr. Dembrow, it says that he repeatedly had questions\u2014conversations with Chris Ment\u00f3 where Dan Sharpe was not present and he repeatedly said this is what I need, and they never came forward. [...]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">PRESIDING MEMBER DEMBROW: That makes your claim clearer. I\u2019m sure [counsel for Manekin] has a different point of view. We\u2019re going to hear evidence about that. [,..] I interjected. I\u2019m putting the State on fair notice where we need, where at least I need clarification. And that goes to the question of what they meant when they said voided give us fragnets. We\u2019re trying to get to that, and the parties have opposite points of view. So let\u2019s just try to go through the ... evidence as we should with the next, with another question of Mr. Sharpe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAIU\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">[Redirect by counsel for Manekin]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">Q. ... Your request for payment ... for ripple effects, was that in dispute at the time you submitted it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">Q. Was PCO 68 in dispute at the time you submitted it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adq-dedup-0\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Chairman Collins interjected during redirect with additional questions directed at Sharpe, which were focused primarily on why Sharpe had not filed a claim after PCO No. 68 was marked \u201cVOID.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">A. ... I didn\u2019t feel that I had any claim or anything at the time when I was going through these things initially \u2018cause we were trying to work through them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">CHAIRMAN COLLINS: ... Because you thought in your mind we can do it all at the end. When in reality the general conditions said you had to do it within 30 days of when you should have known. [...] That\u2019s the trouble I\u2019m having as a Board Member here\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">A. But Mr. Collins, what I would like to answer back\u2014 CHAIRMAN COLLINS: Yeah, [pjlease do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">A. \u2014is I really ... didn\u2019t know ... I had a dispute going on. I was asked to try to produce a fragnet which I worked vigorously to try to do, and I was\u2014because I never could really produce that fragnet that stated all these different things, that\u2019s the reason why I felt that ... I wasn\u2019t like in a ... claim mode or this major dispute mode \u2018cause I was still trying to figure a way to produce the evidence or the backup that the State was asking for. [... ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">CHAIRMAN COLLINS: Yeah, but even though you knew, you knew that it was gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">A. Well, it wasn\u2019t ... really gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">CHAIRMAN COLLINS: Well, yeah, it was really gone. Mr. Ment\u00f3 acknowledged it was really gone, and so did Mr. Rohrbaeh in this deposition say it was really gone. What he did say, so we are going to void this, and you can come back later. This is null and void. This is gone. But you know if you can produce that fragnet down the road show me another PCO. Well when someone says that to me ... you got to say to yourself at that point, there\u2019s a potential claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">[By counsel for Manekin]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Q. ... [The] question to you is was there a dispute that had arisen during this process that you could file a notice of claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">A. Not at the time ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">A. Because we didn\u2019t receive any official thing. Except I understand the conversations that were had, but we were still having basically ongoing meetings, ongoing discussions about a lot of different things on the project, and I didn\u2019t get, until I got that letter slammed back at me[,] that was when I realized I didn\u2019t really have a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Q. Which letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">A. ... It was a letter that came back from the State which was from DGS that basically denied ... everything,...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agm-dedup-1\">Q. ... Mr. Collins\u2019 point was that you knew that there was at least that PCO 68 was void. [... ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">A. Well it didn\u2019t mean to me it was off the table. It meant to me that I still had to come back, ... and once I produced the additional backup that I could bring that thing back up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYqS\">Near the conclusion of Sharpe\u2019s testimony, the Board stopped the proceedings and granted DGS\u2019s Third Motion for Summary Decision. Presiding Member Dembrow provided the following rationale for the Board\u2019s Decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">Okay. At this time there will not be a need for recross-examination because the Board has unanimously determined to grant the State\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Number 3. After listening carefully to the testimony of Mr. Sharpe, who is the Vice President of the Appellant Construction Company, Manekin, and the Project Manager on this job, it is clear that even giving the Appellant the benefit of all doubt the ripple effect claim was first raised to the State by correspondence November 2, 2011. It was formally submitted as a proposed change order on December 7, 2011. And the very next day the State indicated to Appellant that that PCO was, quote, void, end quote. Now that was clear in the mind of some of the Members of the Board that that meant reject. But giving Appellant the benefit of all doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>because there is a bit of a nuance in that DGS also noted on that voiding of that PCO that they wanted fragnets. The Board notes that the last request, and there are a couple of them at least, that the State made of the Appellant to submit the fragnets needed to support PCO 68, the last reference to fragnet was made on January 19, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">There was a progress meeting on February 2, 2012, and in the minutes of that progress meeting, the minutes being dated February 7, 2012, there is reference that Mr. Sharp[e] stated or at least the minutes state, quote, Dan Sharpe offered March 1, 2012 and leave discussion open on compen-sational, period. That\u2019s certainly not an example of the greatest grammar because it\u2019s somewhat difficult to know what that even means. But it does appear beyond a shadow of a doubt that on February 2, 2012, when PCO 68 was marked void there was no reference to fragnets at that point. There had not been a reference for the need for further documentation by way of fragnets since January 19, 2012. At least as of February [2nd] Mr. Sharpe was saying we\u2019ll do this by March 1, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">[COMAR 21.10.04.02] says ... a contractor shall file a written notice of a claim relating to a contract with the appropriate procurement officer within 30 days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known. It appears that the basis of the claim was initially known back in November of 2011. It certainly was known as of February 2012. But this claim was not filed until a year later. So even if we give the ... Appellant the benefit of all doubt and give them [until] March 1, 2012, as the trigger date for the beginning of that 30-day statute of limitations, we\u2019re still a year late.

Therefore, it will be dismissed at this time without the necessity of further testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Presiding Member Dembrow confirmed that the other Board Members concurred in the decision before adding the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">We wanted to hear testimony from Mr. Sharpe and give the Appellant the benefit of all doubt. We are comfortable that we\u2019ve done that now. So this was not a decision made in haste, but one that we\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time. And the testimony ... confirmed the view of some of the Board Members a long time ago.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>The Circuit Court\u2019s Affirmance of the Board\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJTx\">On April 27, 2016, the Circuit Court for Howard County affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to grant summary decision. The written opinion of the circuit court provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7L\">The parties\u2019 first dispute is over the standard of review to be applied by the Circuit Court in reviewing the decision of an administrative agency.... Specifically, Manekin argues that the VOID notation indicated it was to provide more documentation or information, and that it\u2019s right to appeal did not attach until its more formal claim letter was denied 14 months later. [... ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">DGS reminds the Court that because of the MSBCA members\u2019 familiarity with the subject matter, state procurement law, and expertise in that area, the appellate decisions and statutes allow the Court a very limited scope of review. [...]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">When the Court is reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency, the Court determines the legality of the decision and whether there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d from the record as a whole to support the decision. [...]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">Case law is clear that the Circuit Court[ ] is not to make findings of fact. That function is entirely within the realm of the agency, as is determining the inferences to be drawn from those facts. [...] Even though the final decision was reached by way of a ruling on a motion for summary decision, and not as the result of a contested hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>analysis is the same.... The Court must determine if the findings of fact are supported in the record by substantial evidence, and if so, whether the decision of the agency was legally correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">After articulating this standard of review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the circuit court analyzed the Board\u2019s decision and characterized the Board\u2019s findings regarding notice as a \u201cfinding of fact.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">The [Board] made a finding of fact that Manekin was on notice of DGS\u2019s denial of its requests under PCO 68 by the end of February 2012 when Presiding Member Dana Dem-brow stated, \u201cIt appears that the basis of the claim was initially known back in November of 2011. It certainly was known as of February 2012. But this claim was not filed until a year later. So even if we give the [ ] Appellant the benefit of all doubt and give them [until] March 1, 2012, as the trigger date for the beginning of that 80-day statute of limitations, we\u2019re still a year late.\u201d [...] This finding of fact was supported in the record by the Progress Meeting Notes for January 5, 2012, January 19, 2012, and February 2, 2012 which were received as evidence at the [Board] hearing. Reasoning minds examining this evidence could reasonably reach the conclusion that Manekin was on notice (knew or should have known) that DGS denied its claim for costs under PCO 68 by the end of February 2012. Inferences were resolved in Manekin\u2019s favor when the Presiding Member gave Manekin until March 1, 2012.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Thereafter, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s determination finding that DGS was entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">I. Judicial Review of an Agency\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The Court of Appeals has explained that we \u201clook[ ] through the circuit court\u2019s ... decision[ ], although applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the same standards of review, and evaluate[ ] the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore Cnty. v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899 (2007). In other words, we \u201creview! ] the agency\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 273, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012) (citation omitted). We review questions of law <em>de novo. See Assateague Coastkeeper v. Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>200 Md.App. 665, 690, 28 A.3d 178 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We note that \u201c[a]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts,\u201d <em>Piney Orchard Cmty. Ass\u2019n v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, </em>231 Md.App. 80, 92, 149 A.3d 1175 (2016) (citation omitted); however, we owe no deference to an agency\u2019s erroneous conclusions of law. <em>See Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs for St. Mary\u2019s Cnty. v. S. Res. Mgmt., Inc., </em>154 Md.App. 10, 34, 837 A.2d 1059 (2003) (citations omitted) (\u201c[W]here an administrative agency renders a decision based on an error of law, we owe the agency\u2019s decision no deference.\u201d). \u201cIn contrast to administrative findings of fact, questions of law, including the proper construction of a statute, are subject to more plenary review by the courts.\u201d <em>Md. Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Md. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>226 Md.App. 483, 501, 130 A.3d 1061 (2016) (quoting <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Md. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. 1, 14, 733 A.2d 996 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Although we \u201creview[ ] the agency\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>Long Green Valley, supra, </em>206 Md.App. at 273, 47 A.3d 1087, we note that the circuit court\u2019s recitation of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review as the appropriate review of an administrative agency\u2019s summary decision was incorrect. The circuit court noted that the Board\u2019s \u201cfinding of fact that Manekin was on notice of DGS\u2019s denial of its requests under PCO 68 by the end of February 2012 .... March 1, 2012 at the latest\u201d was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Further, the circuit court found the Board's finding of March 1, 2012 as an \u201cinference[ ] ... resolved in Manekin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>favor.\u201d The circuit court, therefore, erred in determining whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings of fact. That error compounded the Board\u2019s error in making findings of fact on disputed issues prior to the conclusion of Manekin\u2019s presentation of evidence on the issue. Although DGS attempts to provide us with support for the circuit court\u2019s review and argues that \u201cthis Court should apply a more deferential \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard of review,\u201d we reject this assertion. The correct standard of review, at both the circuit court level as well as for this Court, is whether the Board\u2019s decision to grant summary decision in favor of DGS was correct as a matter of law. <em>See Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs. v. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 228-29, 825 A.2d 966 (2003) (citations omitted) (\u201cThe standard for appellate review of a summary judgment is whether it is \u201clegally correct. [...] This is the same standard of review we apply to the question of the legal correctness of an administrative agency\u2019s decision.\u201d). Because the Board made its decision on a motion for summary decision, we examine whether the Board\u2019s decision was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">II. Summary Decision Standard &amp; State Procurement Contract Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Critically, only when there is no genuine dispute of material fact may the Board determine whether a party is entitled to summary decision as a matter of law. COMAR 21.10.05.06D provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">(1) A party may move for summary decision on any appropriate issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">(2) The Appeals Board may grant a proposed or final summary decision if the Appeals Board finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">(a) After resolving all inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion is asserted, there is no genuine issue of material fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">(b) A party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The Board\u2019s two-step process in deciding a motion for summary decision begins with the determination of whether there is any \u201cgenuine issue of material fact.\u201d COMAR 21.10.05.06D(2)(a). If the moving party is unable to demonstrate that no material fact is in dispute, the analysis ends and summary decision is not appropriate. Only \u201c[a]fter resolving all inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion is asserted\u201d and finding that \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact\u201d should the Board determine whether the moving \u201cparty is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d COMAR 21.10.05.06D(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Put differently, the Board is not authorized to make findings of fact on material issues that remain in dispute. To the extent the court considers a disputed fact, the court must view that fact in favor of the nonmoving party and determine whether the moving party is entitled to summary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">III. The Board Erred In Granting DGS\u2019s Third Motion for Summary Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We have explained that contract claims arising out of state procurement contracts are subject to statutorily-prescribed administrative procedures. <em>See McLean Contracting Co. v. Md. Transp. Auth., </em>70 Md.App. 514, 523-24, 521 A.2d 1251 (1987). The mandatory claims process is set forth in Maryland Code (2009, 2015 Repl. Vol.), State Finance &amp; Procurement Article (SFP), Title 15 and COMAR 21.10. COMAR 21.07.02.05-ID provides, \u201c[wjithin 30 days after contractor knows or should have known of the basis for a claim relating to this contract, contractor shall file a written notice of claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>with the procurement officer.\u201d Further, \u201c[a] notice of claim or a claim that is not filed within the time prescribed in Regulation .02 of this chapter shall be dismissed.\u201d COMAR 21.10.04.02C.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">A. Knowledge Of A Basis For Submitting A \u201cRequest for Payment\u201d That Is Not In Dispute When Submitted Does Not Establish Knowledge Of \u201cA Basis For A Claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">To determine whether Manekin failed to comply with the timing requirements, the Board was required to consider whether Manekin \u201c[knew] or should have known of the basis for a claim\u201d more than thirty days before it submitted its notice of claim to the procurement officer on April 10, 2013. <em>See </em>COMAR 21.07.02.05-ID. To apply this provision correctly, therefore, the Board was required to make a finding of fact, accurately identifying \u201ca <em>basis </em>for a claim\u201d pursuant to CO-MAR 21.07.02.05-1. A \u201cclaim\u201d is defined in the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">As used herein, claim means a written demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking, as a legal right, the payment of money, adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief, arising under or relating to this contract. A voucher, invoice, or request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under this clause. However, if the submission subsequently is not acted upon in a reasonable time, or is disputed as to liability or amount, it may be converted to a claim for the purpose of this clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">COMAR 21.07.02.05-1C (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Pursuant to COMAR 21.07.02,05-lC, a contractor\u2019s knowledge of the basis for \u201crequesting] payment that is not in dispute when submitted\u201d is not the same as having knowledge of the basis of a \u201cclaim.\u201d Manekin\u2019s submission of a PCO, therefore, is not dispositive evidence of having knowledge of the basis for a claim. Once a request for payment is disputed, however, a claim arises. The thirty-day limitations period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>under COMAR 21.07.02.05-ID would begin, therefore, once the contractor knows or should have known of a dispute or denial of its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">As we have explained supra, although we attribute some weight to an agency\u2019s expertise and its interpretation of a statute that it administers, we review questions of law <em>de novo. See Assateague Coastkeeper, supra, </em>200 Md.App. at 690, 28 A.3d 178. Here, however, the Board in its decision provided no interpretation of COMAR 21.07.02.05-1. Indeed, in explaining the Board\u2019s decision, Presiding Member Dembrow stated, \u201c[i]t appears that the basis of the claim was initially known back in November of 2011,\u201d referring to the date that Manekin first raised the issues contained in PCO No. 68 in a letter to DGS prior to submitting PCO No. 68. It is not clear, therefore, whether the Board equated having knowledge of a basis for submitting a request for payment that was not in dispute when submitted with a \u2018Toasis for a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Although the Board\u2019s prior interpretations of a statute do not create mandatory authority for this Court, we note that the Board\u2019s application of the timing provisions in COMAR 21.07.02.05-1 in this case is inconsistent with the Board\u2019s own interpretations in some of its prior decisions. For example, in <em>Info. Sys. &amp; Networks Corp., </em>MSBCA No. 2225 (March 4, 2004), the Board found that the thirty-day limitations period began upon the appellant\u2019s receipt of the procurement officer\u2019s letter denying the appellant\u2019s change order request (i.e. a \u201cPCO\u201d). On January 22, 1999, after the parties had contemplated an increase to the contract ceiling during weekly progress meetings, the appellant submitted a formal request for a change order. Thereafter, the appellant sent the agency two follow-up requests for a decision on its January 22, 1999 request and did not receive a response until the procurement officer\u2019s July 23, 1999 denial letter. The Board concluded that the thirty-day limitations period did not begin until the appellant received the procurement officer\u2019s denial letter. <em>Id. </em>at 13. In its written decision, the Board reached the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Until [the procurement officer\u2019s] letter of July 23, 1999 rejecting Appellant\u2019s change order request, Appellant had no reason to believe that its change order was in dispute. Appellant timely filed a notice of claim and claim regarding the Procurement Officer\u2019s ... July 23, 1999 rejection of its change order request, which was confrontational and put Appellant on notice that it must file a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Similarly, in <em>David A. Bramble, Inc., </em>MSBCA No. 2823 (July 5, 2013), the Board found that the contractor\u2019s notice of claim was not timely because the contractor admitted that he had actual notice of the agency\u2019s <em>rejection </em>of his proposal more than thirty days before filing a notice of claim. In <em>Syscom, Inc., </em>MSBCA No. 2268 (July 5, 2002), the Board found that a dispute triggering the limitations period did not arise prior to the procurement officer\u2019s decision that the agency\u2019s additional reporting directives to the contractor were within the scope of the underlying contract. <em>Id. </em>at 8. Notably, in that case, the contractor had previously sent a letter to the agency, refusing to carry out the directives without an approved change order. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In these decisions, the Board\u2019s findings are consistent with our interpretation in this case of COMAR 21.07.02.05-1C and D\u2014that the thirty-day limitations period begins when the contractor has notice that the agency disputes the contractor\u2019s request. In determining whether Manekin complied with the timing requirements, the Board was charged with deciding whether Manekin had notice from DGS that DGS disputed or denied its request contained in PCO No. 68 more than thirty days before Manekin filed its notice of claim,</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">B. The Board Made Findings of Fact on Disputed Issues by Determining the Meaning of \u201cVoid\u201d and that Manekin was to Provide Additional Information by March 1,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In addition to finding that Manekin knew of the issues raised in PCO No. 68 as early as November 2, 2011, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>found, alternatively, that Manekin should have known that DGS disputed the request contained in PCO No. 68 by February 2012. In so doing, the Board relied primarily on notations in the PCO Log and Progress Meeting minutes to make at least two improper findings of fact prior to a full hearing on the merits. Critically, both of these factual conclusions were determinative in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">First, the Board relied, in part, upon the fact that PCO No. 68 was designated as \u201cVOID\u201d in the PCO Log to conclude that Manekin knew or should have known of the basis of a claim by December of 2011, and \u201ccertainly ... as of February 2012.\u201d Presiding Member Dembrow explained the Board\u2019s reliance on the \u201cVOID\u201d notation in the following portion of the Board\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">[I]t is clear that even giving the Appellant the benefit of all doubt the ripple effect claim was first raised to the State by correspondence November 2, 2011\". It was formally submitted as a proposed change order on December 7, 2011. And the very next day the State indicated to Appellant that the PCO was, quote, void, end quote. Now that was clear in the mind of some of the Members of the Board that that meant reject. [...]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">It appears that the basis of the claim was initially known back in November of 2011. It certainly was known as of February 2012. But this claim was not filed until a year later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">At various points during the evidentiary hearing, however, Presiding Member Dembrow emphasized the need for additional clarification. Presiding Member Dembrow found the term \u201cvoid\u201d particularly troubling in relation to the undisputed fact that the minutes from Progress Meetings 37 and 39 reference a comment by Sharpe to \u201cleave discussion open on compensational [sic],\u201d which the Board acknowledged is difficult to interpret. Further, in addition to the term \u201cvoid,\u201d the PCO Log included the term \u201crejected\u201d as the status for other PCOs. Presiding Member Dembrow pointed out that Rohr-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>bach admitted during his deposition that there was a difference between the terms \u201cvoid\u201d and \u201crejected, explaining that \u201cvoid\u201d meant \u201cyou can come back later.\u201d During the evidentia-ry hearing, Presiding Member Dembrow stated to counsel for DGS, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to hear from Mr. Rohrbach. In this affidavit he ... reiterates that he uses the word void. It seems odd that he doesn\u2019t say PCO 68 was rejected.\u201d He later added, \u201cNow, frankly, ... there\u2019s nothing in this affidavit that says what Mr. Rohrbach intended by the word void .... \u201d Thereafter, Presiding Member Dembrow informed counsel for DGS, \u201cI\u2019m putting the State on fair notice where we need, where at least I need clarification. And that goes to the question of what they meant when they said voided give us fragnets. We\u2019re trying to get to that, and the parties have opposite points of view.\u201d As Presiding Member Dembrow stated, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s the crux of the issue. [...] We\u2019re still trying to figure out what was meant by void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The only evidence presented at trial that was relevant to the meaning of the term \u201cvoid,\u201d however, was Sharpe\u2019s testimony concerning his understanding of the term. Sharpe testified that he interpreted \u201cvoid\u201d to mean that the issue would be left open to raise again at a later date, and in this case, not until Manekin had compiled and submitted the information requested. Further, Sharpe testified that he was not aware that DGS disputed Manekin\u2019s request until DGS denied Manekin\u2019s \u201cRequest for Equitable Settlement\u201d on March 18, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The blurring of the line between a hearing on the motion for summary decision and the evidentiary hearing, during which testimony had already begun, presents procedural challenges. Without hearing Rohrbach\u2019s testimony on the merits of the claim, certain Board Members found his deposition testimony and affidavit convincing enough to draw conclusions of fact regarding the meaning of the \u201cvoid\u201d notation. For instance, Chairman Collins stated to Sharpe during his cross-examination, \u201cMr. Rohrbach in this deposition [said PCO No. 68] was ... gone.\u201d Chairman Collins paraphrased his understanding of Rohrbach\u2019s deposition testimony, in which Rohrbach explained his interpretation of the meaning of \u201cvoid,\u201d in the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>way: \u201c[W]e are going to void this, and you can come back later. This is null and void. This is gone. But you know if you can produce that fragnet down the road show me another PCO.\u201d Based, in part, on Rohrbach\u2019s explanation, Chairman Collins added that Manekin should have known there was a dispute. This factual finding, however, was not permitted at this stage of the proceeding. The parties disputed the meaning of the term \u201cvoid,\u201d which was not defined in relevant statutes or the parties\u2019 contract. The Board erred, on a motion for summary decision, in determining whether the notation of \u201cvoid\u201d indicated that Manekin knew or should have known that DGS had rejected PCO No. 68, and thus, that the basis of a claim had arisen more than thirty days before Manekin submitted its notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The Board further erred in finding that Manekin had committed to providing the fragnets for PCO No. 68 by March 1, 2012. The Board reached this finding based on a vague notation contained in the minutes from Progress Meeting 39 held on February 2, 2012.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Presiding Member Dembrow stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">[I]n the minutes being dated February 7, 2012,<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> there is [a] reference that Mr. Sharpe stated or at least the minutes state, quote, Dan Sharpe offered March 1, 2012 and leave discussion open on compensational, period.... [I]t\u2019s somewhat difficult to know what that even means. [... ] [But] [t]here had not been a reference for the need for further documentation by way of fragnets since January 19, 2012. At least as of February 2nd, Mr. Sharpe was saying we\u2019ll do this by March 1, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">So even if we give the, the Appellant the benefit of all doubt and give them [until] March 1, 2012[ ] as the trigger date for the beginning of that 30-day statute of limitations, we\u2019re still a year late.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">During the hearing, however, the Board raised questions regarding why DGS continued to ask for fragnets while designating PCO No. 68 as void. Indeed, Presiding Member Dem-brow acknowledged during Sharpe\u2019s testimony that, although Rohrbach stated in his affidavit that he did not tell Manekin that they could later return to PCO No. 68, the minutes reflect that DGS had continued to ask for fragnets while simultaneously marking it as \u201cvoid.\u201d Presiding Member Dembrow stated, \u201cThey\u2019re requiring fragnets. They want this information. [... ] Obviously there was anticipation that they were going to submit something or they wouldn\u2019t have ... requested it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The Board\u2019s conclusion that Manekin\u2019s Vice President had offered March 1, 2012 as the deadline by which Manekin would provide the fragnets involves a finding of fact on a disputed issue. The Board acknowledged during the proceedings that the notation \u201cDan Sharpe offered March 1, 2012 and leave discussion open on compensational [sic]\u201d required further clarification. Manekin did not concede that the parties had discussed a particular deadline for Manekin\u2019s submission of the fragnets for PCO No. 68. Instead, Sharpe explained during his testimony only that he had requested that the parties leave the issue open.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, other notations within the minutes for Progress Meeting 39, under the same points of discussion, refer to \u201cMarch 1, 2012\u201d in relation to the notation \u201cSubstantial Completion Punch List and begin Barrack move.\u201d In other words, whether the notation indicated that Sharpe had agreed to a March 1, 2012 deadline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>produce fragnets for PCO No. 68 was not a permissible finding at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Furthermore, although March 1, 2012 is later than the other dates considered by the Board as potentially starting the limitations period, the finding that the thirty-day period began on March 1, 2012 was not sufficient to \u201cresolv[e] all inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion is asserted.\u201d COMAR 21.10,05.06.D(2)(a). Manekin argued that the limitations period did not begin until April 3, 2013, when DGS denied Manekin\u2019s \u201cRequest for Equitable Settlement.\u201d The Board inferred that Manekin was required to provide fragnets by March 1, 2012, and therefore, that Manekin knew or should have known of a dispute on that date. This inference was not permitted since the relevant COMAR provision directed the Board to resolve all inferences at this stage of the proceeding in favor of Manekin. Based on the Board\u2019s determination of March 1, 2012 \u201cas the trigger date for the beginning of [the thirty-day] statute of limitations,\u201d however, the Board concluded that Manekin had submitted its notice of claim more than a year late. The Board\u2019s conclusion that Sharpe was required to provide the fragnets for PCO No. 68 by March 1, 2012 was, therefore, an improper finding of fact at this stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The point at which the thirty-day limitations period began, as the Board has indicated in several prior decisions noted <em>supra, </em>is the moment Manekin knew or should have known that DGS rejected or denied the request contained in PCO No. 68. The point in time when Manekin should have known of a denial of its request involves a disputed material fact, which the Board was not authorized to resolve via summary decision. The Board\u2019s task was, first, to determine if there existed any \u201cissue[s] of material fact,\u201d after resolving all reasonable inferences in favor of Manekin. The Board, therefore, was required to hear the merits of the case and apply the appropriate meaning of \u201ca basis for a claim\u201d under COMAR 21.07.02.05-1 in its final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The Board erred by terminating the proceedings after hearing from only one of Manekin\u2019s witnesses. The Presiding Member of the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">At this time there will not be a need for recross-examination because the Board has unanimously determined to grant the State\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary [Decision] Number 3. After listening carefully to the testimony of Mr. Sharpe, ... it is clear that even giving the Appellant the benefit of all doubt the ... claim was first raised to the State by correspondence November 2, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Presiding Member Dembrow concluded, \u201cWe wanted to hear testimony from Mr. Sharpe and give [him] the benefit of all doubt. We are comfortable that we\u2019ve done that now.\u201d Presiding Member Dembrow added that \u201cthe testimony ... confirmed the view of some of the Board Members a long time ago.\u201d Sharpe made no explicit concession during his testimony, however, that was dispositive on the issue of when Manekin knew or should have known that DGS disputed Manekin\u2019s request for additional compensation contained in POO No. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The Board\u2019s error in this case stems, primarily, from its failure to adhere to procedural processes. The standards for summary decision as opposed to a merits hearing are fundamentally different. The Board should not consider a motion for summary decision during an evidentiary hearing, unless the rules expressly provide for it. The only evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing at the time the Board stopped the proceedings was testimony that served to confirm that the parties disputed a material fact. The Board, however, made findings of fact on those disputed issues and then granted summary decision. In doing so, the Board blurred the line between determining whether a disputed fact existed and making findings of fact based on the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing. The Board\u2019s consideration of whether to grant summary decision during the proceedings on the merits creates confusion and, as shown here, increases the chance for error by both the Board and the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that the Board erred in its decision to terminate the proceedings and grant summary decision in favor of DGS. We, therefore, remand to the Board to decide, after hearing all of the evidence, when DGS communicated a dispute or denial of PCO No. 68 to Manekin such that it knew or should have known that it was required to submit a notice of claim to DGS within 80 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. Similarly, COMAR 21.10.04.02 provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Unless a lesser period is prescribed by law or by contract, a contractor shall file a written notice of a claim relating to a contract with the appropriate procurement officer within 30 days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-17\">. As we discuss <em>infra, </em>whether the notation indicated that Manekin had committed to providing the fragnets by March 1, 2012 was not established at the evidentiary hearing as an undisputed fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">. We note, preliminarily, that the circuit court relied upon an incorrect standard of review, as we discuss in further detail below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\">4. This standard for summary decision in administrative decisions provided by COMAR 21.10.05.06D is similar to the standard for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>judgment, as provided by Maryland Rule 2-501(a): \u201cAny party may file a written motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">. The Board itself acknowledged these criteria in its letter of August 7, 2015, reminding the parties that \"the pending Motions must be based on factual matters as to which there is no genuine dispute, and that all factual inferences must be resolved in favor of the adverse party at this point in the proceeding.\u201d Thereafter, the letter provides that the parties should prepare for trial accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">. The circuit court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s decision supports our finding that the Board made findings of fact that were material to the Board's decision to grant summary decision in favor of DGS. Indeed, we agree with the circuit court that \u201c[t]he [Board] made a finding of fact that Manekin was on notice of DGS\u2019s denial of its requests under PCO 68 by the end of February 2012,\u201d because Manekin had not produced the requested fragnets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[7]\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">7. The minutes for Progress Meeting 39 were finalized on February 7, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">. Additionally, when the notation was raised during the cross-examination, Presiding Member Dembrow agreed that Sharpe\u2019s testimony\u2014that he had requested the parties keep the issue of PCO No. 68 open\u2014was consistent with his own interpretation of the meeting minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
