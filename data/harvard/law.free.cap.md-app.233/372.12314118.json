The investigation stalled for years, but on March 1, 2001, a jury in the Circuit Court for Talbot County convicted Jonathan D. Smith, appellant, of felony murder and daytime housebreaking. The circuit court subsequently sentenced him to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Approximately 10 years later, after appellant\u2019s effort to reverse his convictions by appeal and post-conviction relief were unsuccessful, the Innocence Project in New York filed Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cMPIA\u201d) requests regarding this case. Based on information received from those requests, appellant filed a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence and a Motion to Reopen Post-Conviction Proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court denied both the petition and the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">On appeal, appellant presents several questions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for this Court\u2019s review, which we have consolidated and rephrased, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>1. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">2. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Motion to Reopen Post-Conviction Proceedings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate the judgments of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The Murder of Adeline Wilford</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">On January 5,1987, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Jack Ripley, Ms. Wilford\u2019s friend, discovered Ms. Wilford\u2019s body in her kitchen and called the police. Ms. Wilford had been photographed by her bank\u2019s security system driving her car through the bank drive-through that day at 2:10 p.m., and therefore, the murder appeared to have been committed at some point in the 50-minute period of time between when she left the bank and when her body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Maryland State Police (\u201cMSP\u201d) officers responded to the scene shortly after the call. A window on the west side of the house was propped open with a stick. The police believed that entry to the home had been made through that window, which led to a utility room.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">When the police entered the house, they saw that the keys to the house were still in the door lock, and Ms. Wilford was lying face up on the floor. She was wearing a blue coat, and she had a set of glasses on a cord around her neck. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>were numerous stab wounds to her hands and face, and a large butcher knife with an eight-inch blade was \u201cshoved right through the side of [her] cheek and head.\u201d There were groceries on the kitchen table that had not been taken out of the bag, which suggested that she had surprised someone in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The officers performed a sweep of the house to ensure that no one else was inside. Items inside the home seemed \u201cout of place,\u201d and dressers were opened with \u201cstuff taken out,\u201d which suggested that \u201csomeone had broken into the house and was looking for money or other goods.\u201d The police lifted fingerprints and palm prints from various places in the house, including the outside of the utility room window and the washing machine in the utility room.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">A number of items were missing from Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence, including the tan pocketbook that Ms. Wilford was seen carrying that day, Ms. Wilford\u2019s custom-made diamond and sapphire ring, and her wallet containing credit cards and an undetermined amount of cash. The police did not recover any of these items.</p>\n<p id=\"pAQB\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Subsequent Investigations</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">After a number of years passed and the murder investigation had stalled, the victim\u2019s son, Charles Curry Wilford, encouraged the police to reopen the investigation. He offered a reward of $10,000 for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator(s) and an additional $15,000 if there was a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Sergeant John Bollinger met with Beverly Haddaway on January 14, 2000, and she told him that her nephew, appellant, and two others had committed the crime. Ms. Haddaway stated that, approximately two years after the incident, appellant confessed to her that he had killed Ms. Wilford.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Ms. Haddaway agreed to wear a \u201cwire\u201d and surreptitiously record appellant. On April 11, 2000, she recorded a eonversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>tion with appellant that occurred in a shed behind her house. During that conversation, Ms. Haddaway asked appellant about the day she saw him on \u201cKingston Road when that old woman got murdered and you told me the dog bit ya and you stabbed it.\u201d She asked who killed the woman. After appellant initially stated, while laughing, that he did not know,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">[BH:] Why were you in that field with blood all over ya? And they take, I seen ya goin\u2019 up the road that day, you know it? And you had a blue coat on and Ray [Andrews] and you both had huntin\u2019 hats on. And then when I come back by there and you were in that cornfield and you said that blood come off a dog, but I think that you held her and David [Faulkner] killed her or one of you three done it,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">[JS:] They never found out yet have they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">[BH:] I know, that\u2019s why I want to know \u2019fore I die. I seen ya, did I ever tell anybody? You know I ain\u2019t gonna tell on ya, goddamn, you\u2019re my blood, I just wanted to know if you done it. I didn\u2019t really think you did. I think crazy David did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">[JS:] It\u2019s a secret. It\u2019s a secret when one person knows[.] It aint [sic] a secret when two people know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">[BH:] Well, the three of you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">[JS:] Right, there\u2019s only two left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">[BH:] It was you and Ray and David.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">[JS:] Ray wasn\u2019t there until after it was over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">[BH:] Where was he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">[JS:] Down the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">[BH:] Ray was right with you in the goddamn field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">[JS:] Yeah. That was after it was all done with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">Ms. Haddaway asked again who killed the victim. When appellant responded that he could not remember, Ms. Hadda-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>way stated: \u201cJonathan, you\u2019re lying \u2019cause you\u2019re laughing,\u201d The conversation continued, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">[BH:] Well why do you think I would tell anybody. I ain\u2019t told nobody in 12 goddamn years. I just wanted to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">[JS:] (Inaudible) she had money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">[BH:] Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">[JS:] She had money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">[BH:] She had money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">[JS:] Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">[BH:] [Dick] said that he\u2019d heard three or four times that you had tried to get somebody to .... But, ah ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">[JS:] It\u2019s been a long time. I don\u2019t even remember it no more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">[BH:] Oh. You know whether you done it or David done it if Ray weren\u2019t there. I\u2019ll tell ya reason I ask. ... [T]his lady that lived over Ridgley .... told me that David\u2019s foster mother had something and ... the old woman said that they had bought David out of a murder. And I was wondering, you know, if she knew anything or did she tell you, I just wondered if he did it or you. Tell me. I ain\u2019t gonna tell nobody, I just want to know (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">[JS:] He didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">[BH:] You done it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">[JS:] Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-17\">[BH:] You said you did it before. Why did you kill her? I thought she let you in there when you went fishin\u2019[.] ... What, you didn\u2019t know her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">[JS:] I knew she had money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">[BH:] You knew she had money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\">[JS:] She had money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-22\">[BH:] But you didn\u2019t get none?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>[JS:] Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">[BH:] You did get it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">[JS:] Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Appellant then stated that the men got $60,000, and they split it three ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In response to Ms. Haddaway\u2019s question regarding why Mr. Faulkner had appellant\u2019s coat, appellant said that Mr. Faulkner \u201cgot cut\u201d and had too much blood on his coat, so he got rid of it. Appellant then stated that both he and Mr. Faulkner had stabbed the victim, and the conversation continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">[BH:] [T]hat day you told me' I thought no, he ain\u2019t done it, that stupid David if he, anybody done it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">[JS:] If there\u2019s enough money I\u2019ll do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">[BH:] Enough money. Well, it\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t get caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">[JS:] I won\u2019t get caught.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">On April 25, 2000, the police brought appellant, Mr. Faulkner, and Mr. Andrews to the Easton MSP barrack for questioning. Appellant was advised of his rights, and although he initially \u201calmost seemed happy to be answering [their] questions,\u201d his demeanor changed when Sergeant Jack McCauley asked if appellant and Mr. Faulkner had been involved in any criminal activity together. At that point, appellant \u201cbecame somewhat withdrawn, dropped his head .... [a]nd he became very evasive, fidgety in his seat.\u201d Appellant denied any involvement with the murder of a woman. He acknowledged his conversation with Ms. Haddaway, but he claimed that he admitted involvement in the murder because he wanted Ms. Haddaway to think that he was a tough person.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">Sergeant Bollinger and another officer interviewed appellant again later that day. Sergeant Bollinger advised appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, giving him a copy of the form to \u201cfollow along as [Sergeant Bollinger] was reading it to him.\u201d Before Sergeant Bollinger asked any questions, appellant volunteered his narrative of what had happened, and Sergeant Bollinger listened for several minutes without interrupting. Appellant stated that \u201che, David Faulkner, [and] Ray Andrews, had gone to the residence,\u201d and \u201che and David Faulkner broke into the residence,\u201d but Mr. Andrews stayed outside. While appellant and Mr. Faulkner were in the house, Ms. Wilford returned, and when appellant \u201cnoticed her she was standing in front of him screaming and ... David Faulkner was stabbing her.\u201d Appellant stated that Ms. Wilford was wearing a blue coat and had glasses on a chain around her neck, and \u201cshe was fighting and moving her arms about.\u201d As Mr. Faulkner was stabbing Ms. Wilford, she fell back on appellant, getting blood on his shirt. Sergeant Bollinger then asked appellant if he had stabbed Ms. Wilford, and at that point, appellant asked for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Mr. Andrews also talked to the police. He told Sergeant Joseph Gamble that appellant and Mr. Faulkner discussed burglarizing Ms. Wilford\u2019s house, but he did not want to, so they told him to stay in the wooded area. Approximately 20 minutes after appellant and Mr. Faulkner approached the house, Mr. Andrews saw a vehicle pull up the Wilford driveway. A few minutes later, appellant and Mr. Faulkner ran from the house. Appellant had blood on his shirt. The three men then ran through woods and fields until they reached Black Dog Alley, where they saw Ms. Haddaway driving down the road. Ms. Haddaway asked appellant why he had blood on his shirt, and appellant replied that he had been attacked by a dog. The three men then went to appellant\u2019s house, where appellant changed his clothes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant and Mr. Faulkner removed money from their pockets and divided it up. The next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>day, appellant told him that the woman at the house was dead, and Mr. Andrews should never tell anybody about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-1\">Appellant\u2019s Trial</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">Appellant\u2019s four-day trial began on February 26, 2001. In addition to the evidence discussed, <em>supra, </em>Alexander Manke-vich, a fingerprint expert for the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory, testified that he did not match any fingerprints left at the scene to any known suspects. He further explained how a fingerprint typically is left on a surface, why fingerprints might not be located, and the inability to determine the length of time a fingerprint has been on any surface. Sergeant Bollinger testified that, although fingerprint, DNA, and hair samples were taken from appellant, those samples did not match any of the evidence the police had collected from the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\">Ms. Haddaway testified that, on January 5, 1987, she was driving on Black Dog Alley and saw her nephew, appellant, emerge from a cornfield with Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Andrews.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She pulled over to the side of the road, and appellant approached her truck. His glasses were broken and repaired with tape or a bandaid, and he was wearing a white t-shirt that had \u201cred dots\u201d around the collar. Ms. Haddaway asked him what he was doing there.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant stated that he was waiting for somebody, and he thought that person was in the truck Ms. Haddaway was driving. When asked again what the men were doing, appellant said that he had just killed a dog. Ms. Haddaway called appellant a liar. Appellant started laughing and stated: \u201cYes I did. I killed him cause [sic] it bit me.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>He told her that he had stabbed the dog. Another truck then pulled up behind Ms. Haddaway, and the three men got into the truck. As Ms. Haddaway drove away, she saw a number of police vehicles and an ambulance driving fast on Black Dog Alley and then turning left onto Kingston Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Mr. Andrews testified, consistent with his statement to the police, that he waited in a wooded area while appellant and Mr. Faulkner went to Ms. Wilford\u2019s house, and after they came running back, the three men ran until they arrived at Black Dog Alley and saw Ms. Haddaway in her vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ms. Haddaway asked appellant what happened to him, and appellant responded that he had been attacked by a dog. Mr. Andrews believed that someone was with Ms. Haddaway that day, but he was \u201cnot sure if it was a man or not.\u201d The three then went to appellant\u2019s house.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant and Mr. Faulkner did not talk about what happened, but they pulled out of their pockets a large quantity of cash, approximately $300 to $400. Mr. Andrews did not get any of the money. Appellant and Mr. Faulkner never talked to him about what occurred that afternoon. When Mr. Andrews saw a report in a newspaper the next day, appellant and Mr. Faulkner told him \u201cto keep quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On cross-examination, Mr, Andrews acknowledged that, in exchange for his testimony against appellant and his agreement to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea to the crime of involuntary manslaughter for his role in Ms. Wilford\u2019s murder, the prosecutor would recommend that he be sentenced to five years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Mr. Andrews testified, however, that he had not been promised any financial reward or incentive to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Michael Snow, a former Baltimore City police officer who had been convicted of bank robbery, testified that he was housed with appellant in the same protective custody ward at the Talbot County Detention Center. At one point during their detention, he asked appellant if he really killed \u201cthat lady.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant \u201cjust looked at [him] and said uh-hum.\u201d When Mr. Snow asked how appellant killed her, appellant \u201chad his hand kind of just folded like if he was holding something,\u201d and he made stabbing motions. When Mr. Snow asked appellant why he killed the woman, appellant stated that \u201cshe was an old lady\u201d who \u201cstartled him when she came in.\u201d Appellant explained that \u201che was fighting with her trying to get away\u201d when \u201cshe bit him,\u201d and he then \u201cwent crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Mr. Snow testified that he did not receive a plea deal or anything else in exchange for his testimony. He stated that he testified against the advice of his attorney because he found what appellant said to him \u201cappalling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">After the State concluded its case-in-chief, the defense recalled Ms. Haddaway. Defense counsel questioned her about inconsistencies between her testimony and the police report of her conversation with Sergeant Bollinger on January 17, 2000. Ms. Haddaway stated that a \u201clot of things that they wrote down [were] wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Ms. Haddaway acknowledged that she had visited Mr. Andrews in jail. There were occasions that Mr. Andrews\u2019 lawyer was present when she went to visit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Ms. Haddaway also testified that she received a $10,000 deposit on a $25,000 reward for providing information that led to an arrest. The police told her that, to get the $25,000 reward, all she had to do was testify, which she agreed to do \u201cas long as [she could] tell the truth and only the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On the last day of trial, appellant testified. He recalled his April 11, 2000, recorded conversation with Ms. Haddaway, but he stated that the \u201cwhole time [he] did not ever know what she was saying, referring to or what she was talking about or nothing.\u201d He denied admitting to Ms. Haddaway that he killed Ms. Wilford. Although he did tell her that \u201call three got the money,\u201d and they \u201call split $20,000 apiece,\u201d that statement was not true. He testified that he lied to Ms. Haddaway because she kept asking him questions \u201cabout something that happened that I had no knowledge [of]\u201d and \u201cthat was the only way [he] could think of to get her to leave [him] alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Appellant also testified about his interview with Sergeant Bollinger. He stated that he could not hear the recording Sergeant Bollinger tried to play for him. Sergeant Bollinger then advised that if he did not \u201ccome clean you\u2019ll never, ever see your wife or your kids again.\u201d At that point, and because Sergeant McCauley told him that he would see appellant \u201cstrapped down and [given] lethal injection,\u201d he told Sergeant Bollinger that he \u201cdid it, David did it. Ray was there. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Appellant acknowledged that he was placed in protective custody with Mr. Snow. He denied, however, that he told Mr. Snow that he killed Ms. Wilford or that he made \u201cstabbing motions\u201d with his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Appellant denied taking part in Ms. Wilford\u2019s murder. He testified that he was not with Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Andrews at the time because he \u201cdid not know neither of the (inaudible) at all, neither one.\u201d He also denied seeing Ms. Haddaway on Black Dog Alley that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Sergeant McCauley was recalled as a rebuttal witness for the State. He testified that he had reviewed various newspaper articles from 1987 through 1999, and none of the articles that he reviewed contained a description of what Ms. Wilford was wearing when she was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">As indicated, on March 1, 2001, a jury found appellant guilty of felony murder and daytime house breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Subsequent Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">On March 18, 2001, appellant filed a motion for new trial, arguing that \u201cexculpatory DNA evidence was withheld from the defense,\u201d specifically that DNA analysis of debris taken from under the victim\u2019s fingernails was not a match for appellant or Mr. Faulkner. The circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">On appeal, this Court rejected appellant\u2019s claims of error during the trial, but we concluded that the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial without a hearing, and therefore, we remanded for a hearing on the motion. <em>Smith v. State, </em>No. 688, Sept. Term, 2001 (filed Jan. 17, 2002). The Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed. <em>Smith v. State, </em>371 Md. 496, 810 A.2d 449 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">On remand, defense counsel abandoned the argument regarding the withheld DNA evidence, and instead argued that appellant had been \u201cset up\u201d by Ms. Haddaway and Mr. Andrews. Defense counsel argued that, Mr. Andrews\u2019 attorney, Grayson Eckel, had a conflict of interest because he represented; (1) Mr, Andrews in the criminal case regarding Ms. Wilford\u2019s murder; (2) Lacy Janda, Ms. Haddaway\u2019s daughter, in an estate matter addressing whether appellant or Ms. Janda would inherit appellant\u2019s father\u2019s property; and (3) Ms. Haddaway in a civil suit against Ms. Wilford\u2019s son, regarding the reward money. The circuit court denied the motion, stating that the argument that the dual representation suggested that Mr. Eckel exercised any influence against Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Andrews on behalf of Ms. Haddaway was \u201cconjecture.\u201d This Court affirmed. <em>Smith v. State, </em>No. 1184, Sept. Term, 2003, slip op. at 7-8 (filed Nov. 4, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">On September 28, 2005, appellant, an unrepresented litigant, filed a Petition for Post Conviction Relief. On April 13, 2009, the circuit court denied his petition, and this Court subsequently denied his application for leave to appeal. <em>Smith v. State, </em>No. 850, Sept. Term, 2009 (filed June 9, 2010). On December 27, 2011, appellant, again unrepresented, filed a motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings, which the court subsequently denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence and Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In 2011, the New York Innocence Project filed MPIA requests on behalf of appellant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A paralegal with the Innocence Project visited MSP, and she observed a number of \u201ctape cassettes\u201d in the boxes of evidence. Upon request, and after other legal maneuvers, MSP produced copies of the tapes, which contained several recorded conversations between Sergeant Bollinger and Ms. Haddaway (\u201cthe Bollinger-Haddaway tapes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">On August 2, 2013, appellant filed a Motion to Reopen Postconviction Proceeding, arguing that, \u201cbased on newly-discovered and otherwise-suppressed evidence,\u201d \u201cthe State violated his Due Process rights by withholding exculpatory evidence and affirmatively misleading both [appellant\u2019s] prior counsel and the jury on material issues in the case.\u201d Specifically, he pointed to his discovery of the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, and the State\u2019s alleged wrongful withholding of \u201cDNA test results showing a foreign profile on the victim\u2019s fingernails from which all defendants were excluded.\u201d He asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>that these violations, in addition to ineffective assistance of counsel, warranted reopening his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">As explained in more detail, <em>infra, </em>Mr. Mankevich subsequently entered the unidentified palm prints from Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence into the Maryland Automated Fingerprint Identification System (\u201cMAFIS\u201d or \u201cAFIS\u201d). He determined that Tyrone Anthony Brooks (\u201cTy Brooks\u201d) was the source of the palm prints found on Ms. Wilford\u2019s washing machine and on the outside of the utility room -window.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On June 11, 2015, appellant filed a petition for writ of actual innocence. In his petition, and at the subsequent hearing, he asserted three claims of newly discovered evidence: (1) the identification of Ty Brooks as the source of the palm prints; (2) the recorded conversations between Ms. Haddaway and Sergeant Bollinger; and (3) statements by an eyewitness that he saw a vehicle at Ms. Wilford\u2019s house at approximately 2:00 p.m. on the day of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The circuit court consolidated the hearings on appellant\u2019s and Mr. Faulkner\u2019s petitions and motions. The court issued an order detailing the order of presentation, which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">I. Opening Statements limited to the Petitions for Writs of Actual Innocence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">II. Presentation of evidence in support and rebuttal of Petitions for Writs of Actual Innocence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">III.

If the Court does not grant or defers ruling on the Petitions for Writs of Actual Innocence and provided there is time remaining, the Court will entertain proceedings regarding Petitioners\u2019 Motions to Reopen their prospective Post-Conviction Petitions starting with opening statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">VI. Presentation of evidence/information in support of rebuttal of Motion to Reopen Post Conviction Proceedings[; and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">VIL Closing Arguments limited to the Motion to Reopen Post Conviction Proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">A seven-day evidentiary hearing began on April 11, 2016. We will discuss the evidence as it relates to the various claims raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The Utility Room Palm Prints</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Mr. Mankevich testified that, after the police discovered the palm prints on the outside of the utility room window and on the washing machine at Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence, the local MSP implemented a policy, in several jurisdictions, of collecting palm prints from all arrestees, on the chance that, if the perpetrators were engaging in a pattern of burglaries, they might return to the area and commit more offenses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> From 1987 to 2000, Mr. Mankevich performed 72 manual comparisons of the prints lifted from Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">In October 2008, the State\u2019s vendor for the MAFIS system \u201cwent online\u201d with the ability to perform electronic fingerprint searches, and in 2009, the vendor added the ability to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>electronic palm print searches. The system uses an algorithm that performs a \u201cstatistical analysis of the minutia[e]\u201d and creates a score for possible candidates, which are then listed and ranked by the closeness of the match. Mr. Mankevich explained that, before the MSP Crime Laboratory gained access to MAFIS, there was \u201cno systematic way to follow through\u201d with an unidentified print. \u201cSo if a print was unidentified at that time it would remain sealed as evidence until another name got forwarded. There was no follow through with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In August 2013, appellant and Mr. Faulkner filed a motion for post-conviction comparison of latent fingerprints, requesting that the court order the State to enter the unidentified latent palm prints found at the crime scene into the MAFIS database to determine whether an unknown suspect could be identified. The State opposed this motion, stating that appellant failed to cite any authority that gave the court the power to order the State to provide such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On October 16, 2013, however, the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Talbot County, prior to a ruling by the court, contacted Mr. Mankevich and asked him to run the palm prints lifted from the crime scene through the MAFIS database. He retrieved the lift cards from the Hall of Records and personally put them into the MAFIS system. After receiving the computer generated list of potential matches, Mr. Manke-vich compared Ty Brooks\u2019 known prints to the palm print taken from Ms. Wilford\u2019s washing machine and the palm print taken from the bottom pane of the \u201cpoint of entry\u201d utility room window. He concluded that Ty Brooks was the source of those prints.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On March 22, 2016, Mr. Mankevich received a request from appellant\u2019s defense counsel to compare the remaining prints with known samples from William (\u201cBoozie\u201d) Clarence Thom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>as. Of the eight remaining \u201cunidentified latent print impressions,\u201d Mr. Mankevich eliminated Mr. Thomas as the source for seven of the prints, but he was unable to perform a full comparison of the eighth print, which was taken from the porch door. The methodology used to perform a manual comparison was the same that he used in 2000, i.e., the science had been the same since 1987, and the \u201cdevelopment of the AFIS system played no part in [his] ability to examine the prints and [make a] comparison for [Mr.] Thomas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">On cross-examination, Mr. Mankevich testified that \u201c[p]art of the mission of Maryland State Police is to provide forensic services to any legitimate party requesting, whether it\u2019s the defense part or the [S]tate.\u201d When asked whether he would have compared prints of Mr. Thomas or Ty Brooks to the latent prints recovered if appellant had asked, he responded that he would have if the person requesting had \u201cinvestigative authority,\u201d which could include the Public Defender\u2019s Office, private defense attorneys, and the Innocence Project. Mr. Mankevich agreed that, except in cases where he received a match \u201cgenerated by the AFIS system,\u201d all he needed to make a comparison between Ty Brooks\u2019 hands and the latent prints was \u201can inked print\u201d from Ty Brooks\u2019 hands and \u201ca request to do so,\u201d which could have been initiated by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">With respect to the process of comparing latent print lifts, Mr. Mankevich explained that he looked for \u201cartifacts in the background,\u201d such as \u201cscratches, nicks, cuts, those sort of things,\u201d which \u201ccould be matched from image to image.\u201d The State then followed up on Mr. Mankevich\u2019s testimony that, with respect to the prints here, he \u201cnoticed rain drops or something.\u201d Mr. Mankevich stated: \u201cRight, moisture, that would be in the second group of impression[s] so that moisture that gets on the background, whether it\u2019s again raindrops or it could be spray from Windex. Some liquid source will leave a distinguishing mark that later gets developed with powder.\u201d He explained that in one group of prints, he saw a \u201cU shaped feature in the center,\u201d which he believed was \u201ccaused by extraneous moisture being present that the powder had adhered to.\u201d The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>[STATE:] So the existence of raindrops after the print was left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">[MR. MANKEVICH:] Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">[STATE:] Which would indicate the print was left before it rained. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">[MR. MANKEVICH:] You really can\u2019t make that age, time-line association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">[STATE:] Okay, let\u2019s talk about that. You can\u2019t tell whether it was before it rained or after it rained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">[MR. MANKEVICH:] That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">[STATE:] You couldn\u2019t tell how long a print had been there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">[MR. MANKEVICH:] There is no forensic technique to allow you to date a fingerprint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">[STATE:] You cannot testify to a degree of scientific certainty at all about the timing of these prints relative to the date of collection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">[MR. MANKEVICH:] Again we have no reliable consistent validated forensic techniques that can indicate the lifetime of a latent print.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Kate Wilford Carraher and Evelyn Wilford Lippincott, the daughters of Ms. Wilford, testified that, in the months leading up to the murder, the window in the utility room was propped open with \u201ca stick\u201d because there was a \u201cpersistent,\u201d \u201cGod awful\u201d odor that smelled \u201clike a family of dead mice.\u201d The window being open was particularly memorable to Ms. Lippin-cott because Ms. Wilford had the window open \u201cin the middle of the winter,\u201d and she gave her mother \u201ca hard time about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Mr. Butler, a member of the MSP evidence collection unit, noted that, if the utility room window was opened, the lower portion where a palm print was found would be \u201cpushed up\u201d behind the upper portion, rendering the exterior panes \u201c[[Inaccessible to anyone\u2019s hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Keene Observation</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Sergeant Sabrina Metzger testified about a police report, dated June 12,1987, in which Sergeant James Harmon reported that he was contacted by Daniel (\u201cDanny\u201d) O\u2019Neil Keene on January 9,1987. That police report stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">Same date [January 9,1987,] the writer [Sergeant Harmon] and [Sergeant Samuel] Shelly were contacted at the Easton Barrack by Danny Keene. He reported seeing a silver colored vehicle he believed to be an Olds Cutlass. He was taken to the victim\u2019s residence, at which time he showed the writer the location he observed the vehicle parked. The location was backed in next to the front porch, next to several bushes, bearing a similar type leaf as found in the living room floor of the victims [sic] house. He was [driven] around Easton, and upon observing a vehicle at the Bonanza Rest[a]urant, he stated it was a vehicle similar to the one he observed. He had picked out a 77 Olds Cutlass. Refer to [Sgt.] Shelly\u2019s supplements for further details of this individuals [sic] interviews.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Mr. Keene\u2019s observation also was noted in a case review complied by Sergeant Bollinger.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Neither document, however, specifically noted <em>when </em>Mr. Keene observed the Oldsmobile Cutlass.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Mr. Keene testified that, in January 1987, he lived in Trappe, Maryland, and he was working as a hunting guide. He rented a farm next to Ms. Wilford\u2019s house. He often drove by Ms. Wilford\u2019s house, but he did not know her. On the afternoon of January 5,1987, between approximately 1:50 and 1:55 p.m., he drove past Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence. It was sunny, and he looked at Ms. Wilford\u2019s property for geese. Although he had driven past Ms. Wilford\u2019s house multiple times, he had never seen any \u201csigns of life.\u201d On that occasion, however, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>looked and saw some \u201cclothes on [a] line\u201d next to and behind Ms. Wilford\u2019s house, and he thought to himself, \u201cwell somebody does live there.\u201d After the clothes on the line drew his attention to the property, he began \u201clooking all around.\u201d As he reached the point where some \u201clittle trees start thinning out,\u201d he saw a \u201cjacked up\u201d Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme \u201c[blacked up against\u201d Ms. Wilford\u2019s house.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The car was parked \u201cvery close\u201d to the house, \u201c[l]ike it was backed in.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Approximately four days later, Mr, Keene reported his observation to the police. They interviewed him at the Easton barrack and drove him around Easton until he spotted a car \u201cthat resembled the one that was parked in the lane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The police also had Mr. Keene hypnotized on February 9, 1987, in an attempt to develop more information about his observation. A copy of a recording of this hypnosis session, which originally was recorded on Betamax videotapes, was provided to appellant in 2016. During the actual innocence hearing, the beginning of the video was played, in which Sergeant Shelly explained the attempt to get more information regarding Mr. Keene\u2019s statement that he saw a vehicle at the residence of Ms. Wilford at approximately 1:55 p.m. on the date of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Mr. Keene denied asking for any money in exchange for his assistance. He testified that he \u201c[n]ever heard another word\u201d about the murder until years later, when he was approached by appellant\u2019s post-conviction counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">On cross-examination, the State asked Mr. Keene if George Merritt was with him when he witnessed the car parked at Ms. Wilford\u2019s house. He did not \u201cremember anybody being in that truck with [him]\u201d at that time, but when confronted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>a recording in which he told the police that Mr. Merritt was with him when he saw the car, Mr. Keene stated: \u201cI guess he was, you know.\u201d Mr. Keene stated that, notwithstanding his inability to recall other circumstances, his observation of the Oldsmobile was particularly memorable because that was the first time he had seen a car parked there, and the car had a distinctive appearance, i.e., it was \u201cjacked up. She had chrome wheels. She had whitewalls. Split grill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">James Brooks Implicates Others in the Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">James Brooks, Jr., testified that he grew up in Trappe, Maryland, and he was a longtime friend of Mr. Thomas. At some point around 1991, he contacted MSP and advised that Mr. Thomas had told him that he and Ty Brooks had murdered Ms. Wilford.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">James Brooks testified, consistent with his statement to the police, that Mr. Thomas confessed to him in late 1989 or early 1990.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Mr. Thomas told him that he had borrowed his uncle\u2019s car to get to Ms. Wilford\u2019s house, Ms. Wilford \u201cmight have wrote [sic] down the tag number\u201d of the car when she came home that day, and Mr. Thomas instructed him not to tell anyone about his confession. When asked if he could recall if Mr. Thomas said where that the victim had been stabbed during the murder, he said \u201cit might have been in the back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the court sustained the State\u2019s objection to the question whether Mr. Thomas had named another individual involved in breaking into the house, on the ground that this hearsay statement did not fall within the hearsay exception for a statement against penal interest because the \u201cparticular identification of who the accomplice is ... goes beyond [a] statement against penal interest.\u201d James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Brooks subsequently testified, without naming the person, that Mr. Thomas told him that he was with another person when Ms. Wilford was murdered. James Brooks stated that he was acquainted with Ty Brooks, and Mr. Thomas and Ty Brooks were brothers-in-law and knew each other in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Counsel for Mr. Faulkner subsequently moved to admit into evidence James Brooks\u2019 written statement to the police. In this statement, he explained that he and Mr. Thomas were on a drinking binge one night, and Mr. Thomas confessed to killing Ms. Wilford, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">[H]e said that him and a guy named Ty Brooks were in her house stealing and the lady came home early on them[.] [H]e had borrowed his sister\u2019s car [and] she noticed the car parked near her house and wrote the tag # of the car down before she entered the house[.] [H]e took a butcher knife I believe [and] hid behind the kitchen door[.] [W]hen she came in he stabbed her to death and left her for dead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_D\">The circuit court admitted the statement, over the State\u2019s objection, but it ruled that it would redact two words, i.e., \u201cTy Brooks,\u201d to be \u201cconsistent with [its] earlier ruling [on] the identity of any other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">When counsel for Mr. Faulkner asked James Brooks about his motivation for contacting the police, he testified: \u201cI was strung out on drugs. I was trying to cash in on the reward.\u201d James Brooks admitted that he previously had been convicted of a number of offenses, including uttering a false document, taking a car without the owner\u2019s permission, and various thefts. When asked whether there was any motivation for him \u201cto be testifying here today other than to tell the truth,\u201d James Brooks responded: \u201cYeah. I mean I was told to do what was right and turn it over to God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Ty Anthony Brooks and William Clarence Thomas</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Appellant introduced evidence of Ty Brooks\u2019 extensive criminal history, including breaking and entering and burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>charges in 1986. The State stipulated that Ty Brooks and Mr. Thomas were not incarcerated in Maryland at the time of Ms. Wilford\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Appellant attempted to call Ty Brooks as a witness and to introduce a portion of Ty Brooks\u2019 2015 recorded interview with the police. In this interview, Ty Brooks admitted that he had committed numerous offenses in Easton, but he did not recall going to Ms. Wilford\u2019s house, stating that murder was not his \u201cMO.\u201d As explained in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the court sustained the State\u2019s objection to the admission of this evidence on the ground that Ty Brooks had been convicted of perjury, and therefore, he was not a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Appellant also introduced a statement of charges that alleged that, on March 12, 1987, Ty Brooks was observed riding as a passenger in a blue 1982 Oldsmobile. Donald M. Stoop, a staff investigator with the MidAtlantic Innocence Project, testified that his investigation revealed that Ty Brooks \u201chad access to multiple vehicles,\u201d but \u201cnone [were] registered to him at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The Bollinger-Haddaway Tapes</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Sergeant Bollinger, who became lead investigator on the Wilford murder case in 1999, testified that he spoke to Ms. Haddaway \u201cseveral hundred times\u201d before appellant\u2019s trial. One of the reasons Ms. Haddaway contacted Sergeant Bollinger in 2001 was to request that the criminal charges pending against her grandson, Landon Janda, be dropped. When questioned whether Ms. Haddaway asked \u201cin an aggressive manner,\u201d Sergeant Bollinger stated that Ms. Haddaway \u201cdid everything in an aggressive manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">At some point before February 2, 2001, Sergeant Bollinger participated in a meeting at the Talbot County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office with Marie Hill, the prosecutor on appellant\u2019s case, and John Mark McDonald, the prosecutor on Mr. Jan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>da\u2019s case. Sergeant Bollinger asked Mr. McDonald to drop the charges against Mr. Janda, but he \u201csaid no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Sergeant Bollinger recorded some of his conversations with Ms. Haddaway because they were \u201cdirectly involved with [his] homicide investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> One of these conversations occurred on February 2, 2001, during which Sergeant Bollinger told Ms. Haddaway that the State was not going to drop the charges against her grandson. Sergeant Bollinger tried to clarify whether she was \u201cstill going to come and tell the truth,\u201d and Ms. Haddaway replied: \u201cI\u2019m going to come in and tell the truth but I don\u2019t think the truth is going to want to be known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Sergeant Bollinger then stated that he could ask the State to reconsider its position regarding her grandson after the trial, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">Haddaway: Well, it won\u2019t be no need to ask after the trial\u2019s over because [defense counsel is] going to win hands down. They\u2019ll be doubt in everybody on the jurors\u2019 mind and I\u2019m the one that\u2019s going to roll the iceberg right down there and watch that son of a bitch hit everybody in that fucking courtroom. Do you think I\u2019m kidding, John? I\u2019m not. You can go get the newspaper to start printing: Three People <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Found Innocent and I\u2019ve got just one little piece of paper and it can all be had with one word that nobody knows but I know and I got the paper and I got the proof and one word, just one word out of the English language will let all three of them walk and for my grandson, you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll use that fucking word? ...<footnotemark>[23]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">Bollinger: [Chuckles]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">Haddaway: Now .... Do you think I\u2019m kidding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">Bollinger: No, I know you\u2019re not kidding. You just make me laugh sometimes.<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Ms. Haddaway subsequently stated that the one word was \u201ccrazy,\u201d meaning that she was crazy. She showed Sergeant Bollinger a document from a doctor that she had \u201can extensive emotional and psychological problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">During that conversation, Ms. Haddaway suggested that Sergeant Bollinger go over Mr. McDonald\u2019s head to \u201cthe boss,\u201d i.e., the State\u2019s Attorney, to get the charges against Mr. Janda dropped. Sergeant Bollinger stated that he would talk to the State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">During their conversations that day, statements were made indicating that Ms. Haddaway had access to case files related to the Wilford murder. For example, Sergeant Bollinger stated that he \u201cgot the stuff [she] wanted [him] to get,\u201d that she could \u201csee the pictures if you want,\u201d and he got her \u201ctwo pages of a letter\u201d and a drawing of a ring. Ms. Haddaway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>indicated that defense counsel gave her things illegally, such as a report which she then underlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Sergeant Bollinger testified that he did not allow Ms. Hadd-away to look through his \u201cinvestigative file,\u201d but he did show her some photographs of the Wilford property and \u201ca letter.\u201d Although it was not common practice for the police to permit a witness to look at case files before trial, he showed Ms. Haddaway the evidence \u201cat the direction of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d Counsel asked Sergeant Bollinger why he would \u201cshow a witness who was not by Ms. Wilford\u2019s house on January 5th, 1987 pictures of the property,\u201d and he responded: \u201cShe wanted to see them.\u201d Sergeant Bollinger could not recall whether he showed Ms. Haddaway an illustration of Ms. Wilford\u2019s ring, which the police believed was taken from Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Sergeant Bollinger did note, however, that Mr. Eckel, who represented Mr. Andrews, had \u201callowed [Ms. Haddaway] to view everything he had in his possession.\u201d He did not know whether she had access to \u201ceverything or not,\u201d but he did \u201cknow she had access to his files.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Sergeant Bollinger identified Ms. Haddaway\u2019s handwriting on a seven-page police report, written by Sergeant Gamble on June 8, 2000, that detailed an interview with Mr. Andrews. Ms. Haddaway wrote \u201clie\u201d a number of times on the report. Sergeant Bollinger could not say when Ms. Haddaway made those annotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The February 2, 2001, conversation between Ms. Haddaway and Sergeant Bollinger also indicated that Ms. Haddaway had a conversation with Mr. Andrews before she testified at appellant\u2019s trial. Ms. Haddaway advised that she had gone to the jail with defense counsel and talked with \u201cRay.\u201d Although Sergeant Bollinger knew that Ms. Haddaway, a fact witness, had met with another fact witness, Mr. Andrews, he did not inform appellant\u2019s trial counsel of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">On February 8, 2001, Sergeant Bollinger had another conversation with Ms. Haddaway, which he also recorded. That conversation referred to a conversation the previous day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>where Sergeant Bollinger told Ms. Haddaway that the State\u2019s Attorney had decided to \u201cnolle [pros] Landon\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Ms. Haddaway wanted the decision to be in writing, but Sergeant Bollinger told her that was not going to happen. Ms. Hadda-way was not happy, and Sergeant Bollinger then said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna do. But, but the only thing we want, and protecting whatever we\u2019re trying her[e], our interest, is all we\u2019re doing. We have three murder trials coming up.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As soon as Sergeant Bollinger finished recording these conversations, he put them in the case file, which \u201cwas sent to [a] centralized location ... for the Maryland State Police homicide files.\u201d He could not say whether the tapes made it to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. On cross-examination, Sergeant Bollinger agreed that he \u201cmade no effort to inform anybody of [the] alleged deal\u201d with Ms. Haddaway,\u201d but he \u201calso made no effort to hide it from anybody.\u201d On redirect, counsel asked Sergeant Bollinger whether he \u201cpurposely ... refused to put [the deal with Ms. Haddaway] in writing so that it would remain secret,\u201d and he responded: \u201cThat was not my decision.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>F.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Discovery Provided</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Scott Patterson, the State\u2019s Attorney for Talbot County, testified that, at some point after taking office in 1991, he established an \u201copen file\u201d discovery policy. This policy entailed copying \u201ceverything in the file,\u201d i.e., \u201cpolice investigative reports, witness statements, technical lab reports or, or reports from other experts, anything of that nature,\u201d but not \u201cattorney\u2019s notes, work product, that sort of thing,\u201d and turning the copies over to the defense. He noted that confidential informants were \u201ctricky,\u201d but if they were \u201cactively involved in the case then they would have to be disclosed.\u201d Handwritten police notes would also be included \u201c[i]f they were part of [a police] report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Counsel then asked Mr. Patterson about his understanding of the State\u2019s <em>Brady </em>obligations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He stated that <em>\u201cBrady </em>now is a lot more comprehensive [than] it was 10, 15, 20, 35 years ago when I started prosecuting cases.\u201d He agreed that <em>Brady </em>as it currently is interpreted requires prosecutors to inquire into the knowledge of State agents \u201cabout the existence of any exculpatory information,\u201d but he could not say whether that rule was clear at the time appellant was prosecuted. Similarly, he agreed that, today, it would be a prosecutor\u2019s obligation, pursuant to <em>Brady, </em>to disclose to the defense an agreement between the State and a witness to drop charges against the witness\u2019 family member in exchange for the witness\u2019 testimony, but he could not say whether that rule was clear at the time appellant was prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Ms. Hill testified that she complied with the State\u2019s discovery obligations in two ways: \u201cautomatic discovery\u201d and \u201copen file\u201d discovery. She sent out the \u201cbasics\u201d in \u201cautomatic discovery,\u201d which included documents such as a witness list, police reports, defendant, co-defendant, and witness statements, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>an autopsy report. The automatic discovery packet included a \u201cSuspect Information\u201d list, which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">James Edward BROOKS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2gt\">William Clarence THOMAS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agx-dedup-0\">Anthony BROOKS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">James BROOKS was originally a confidential source who came forward and provided information regarding an individual identified as William THOMAS. BROOKS alleged that THOMAS told him that he and Anthony BROOKS were responsible for the homicide. James BROOKS provided a written statement and submitted to a polygraph examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">With respect to the Talbot County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s \u201copen file\u201d discovery policy in 2000 and 2001, \u201c[defense] attorneys would have full access to [the State\u2019s] files. They could come in and go through [their] cases, the files for them.\u201d Defense attorneys could look at \u201c[a]ny of the police reports, written statements, [and other] things that the defense was entitled to.\u201d They were permitted to take notes, request photocopies, and come back any time to review the files. Ms. Hill followed this open file discovery policy in appellant\u2019s case, and it was her intent to have defense counsel rely on their open file policy as her <em>Brady </em>disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Ms. Hill recalled that appellant\u2019s trial counsel came to her office to review the State\u2019s files, but she could not recall when that occurred. After trial was over, the files in each case were securely stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Ms. Hill could not recall if there were any audio or video cassette tapes in her files, but she noted that, if they were in her possession, defense counsel would have had access to them. Counsel showed Ms. Hill two audio cassette tapes containing the Bollinger-Haddaway conversations, but she did not recall seeing them before. She stated that, in her -view, dismissing criminal charges against a grandson of a witness was not required to be disclosed under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>VIL</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The Circuit Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On June 21, 2016, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s petition for writ of actual innocence and motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings, as well as those of Mr. Faulkner. As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the court found that the evidence presented did not indicate that appellant was innocent of the crimes, that the court was not \u201cpersuaded that there is newly discovered evidence that would lead to a substantial or significant possibility of a different result in the Petitioners\u2019 respective trials,\u201d and that it would not advance the interests of justice to reopen the post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in denying his Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence. He asserts that the following evidence was \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence that \u201cmandates granting of [his] Innocence Writ\u201d: (1) the identification of Ty Brooks as the person who left the palm prints on a window on the exterior of Ms. Wilford\u2019s utility room and the washing machine inside the room; (2) Mr. Keene\u2019s statement that he saw a vehicle in Ms. Wilford\u2019s driveway at approximately 2:00 p.m. on the day of the murder; and (3) the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes discussing, <em>inter alia, </em>the nol pros of the charges against Ms. Haddaway\u2019s grandson.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Appellant argues that the court\u2019s ruling denying his petition was \u201cpremised on erroneous evidentiary rulings, factual findings unsupported by the record, and legal errors in determining\u201d that the evidence was not newly discovered. He asserts that these errors prevented the court from \u201cproperly considering the totality of the evidence, which far exceeds the quantum necessary to demonstrate\u201d that the new evidence created a substantial possibility that the result of the trial may have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The State contends that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in denying the petition. It makes two arguments in this regard. First, it argues that appellant did not present evidence of innocence, asserting that the above-referenced evidence was not \u201cexonerating\u201d evidence. Second, the State asserts that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellant was not diligent in discovering the evidence that he alleges is \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In 2009, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Maryland Code (2016 Supp.) \u00a7 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), which allows certain convicted persons to petition for a writ of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence. <em>See Smallwood v. State, </em>451 Md. 290, 313-20, 152 A.3d 776 (2017) (setting forth the legislative history of CP \u00a7 8-301). CP \u00a7 8-301 states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">(a) A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">(g) A petitioner in a proceeding under this section has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The court has several options if it grants the petition; it \u201cmay set aside the verdict, resentence, grant a new trial, or correct the sentence, as the court considers appropriate.\u201d CP \u00a7 8-301(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Thus, to prevail on a petition for writ of innocence, the petitioner must produce evidence that is newly discovered, i.e., evidence that was not known to petitioner at trial. <em>Hawes v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 105, 134-36, 85 A.3d 291 (2014). Pursuant to CP \u00a7 8-301, the newly discovered evidence must satisfy two requirements: (1) it must be such that it \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331\u201d; and (2) it must create \u201ca substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The Maryland appellate courts, however, recently have made clear that there is a third requirement for newly discovered evidence. Relief under CP \u00a7 8-301 is limited to situations where the petitioner shows newly discovered evidence that supports a claim that the petitioner is innocent of the crime of which he or she was convicted. <em>See Smallwood, </em>451 Md. at 320, 152 A.3d 776 (\u201cOnly defendants who can allege that they are \u2018actually innocent,\u2019 meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they were convicted, may bring a petition for relief under [CP] \u00a7 8-301.\u201d); <em>Yonga v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 45, 61-62, 108 A.3d 448 (2015) (The \u201cthrust of the writ\u201d and the \u201csubstantive object that has to be asserted and then supported by an adequate show of proof\u2019 is actual innocence.), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>446 Md. 183, 130 A.3d 486 (2016). <em>See also Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 176, 31 A.3d 250 (2011) (a petition for writ of actual innocence gives a convicted person \u201can opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>seek a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that speaks to his or her actual innocence\u201d); <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 219, 909 A.2d 1020 (2006) (CP \u00a7 8-201 was \u201cdesigned to provide an avenue for the exoneration of the actually innocent\u201d); Md. Rule 4-332(d)(9) (petition for writ of actual innocence must allege \u201cthat the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Accordingly, a petitioner asserting newly discovered evidence must satisfy three requirements to prevail in a petition for actual innocence. A petitioner must produce newly discovered evidence that: (1) \u201cspeaks to\u201d the petitioner\u2019s actual innocence; (2) \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Md. Rule 4-331\u201d; and (3) creates \u201ca substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">When an appellate court reviews a circuit court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for writ of actual innocence, we limit our review \u201cto whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>451 Md. at 308-09, 152 A.3d 776. <em>Accord Patterson v.

A trial court must, however, \u201c \u2018exercise its discretion in accordance with correct legal standards.'\u201d <em>Jackson v.

With respect to the circuit court\u2019s factual findings, we accept these findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>Yonga, </em>221 Md.App. at 95, 108 A.3d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Applying this standard of review, we address the requisite elements of a petition for writ of actual innocence as they apply to the present case. Initially, we note that there is no dispute that the three categories of evidence, the Keene evidence, Ty Brooks\u2019 palm prints, and the Bollinger-Hadda-way tapes, were not known at trial, and therefore, this evidence was newly discovered evidence. There is a dispute, however, regarding whether this newly discovered evidence meets the three requirements to entitle appellant to relief. We will address, in turn, these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Actual Innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As indicated, a petition for writ of actual innocence is limited to cases involving newly discovered evidence that \u201cspeaks to\u201d the petitioner\u2019s actual innocence. The State argues that this requirement was not met here because the newly discovered evidence alleged, i.e., the Keene evidence, Ty Brooks\u2019 palm prints, and the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, \u201cdid not tend to exonerate\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The State points to several categories of evidence that were provided to the General Assembly as types of evidence that could support a finding of innocence, including scientific evidence found after trial \u201c \u2018to be unreliable or completely false after subsequent research and analysis,\u2019\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>451 Md. at 318, 152 A.3d 776 (quoting Testimony of Delegate Samuel I. Rosenberg on H.B. 366, before the House Judiciary Committee (Feb. 17, 2009)), as well as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">(1) a confession by another individual to having committed the crime; (2) acknowledgement by an eyewitness or other evidence indicating he was mistaken; (3) acknowledgment by an eyewitness or other evidence indicating that the witness intentionally lied; or (4) evidence casting serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>doubt on the reliability of scientific evidence used against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 319, 152 A.3d 776 (quoting Memorandum from the Governor\u2019s Office of Crime Control and Prevention and the Office of the Public Defender to Chairman B. Frosh and Members of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, at 8-9 (Jan. 15, 2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">With respect to the newly discovered evidence here, the State contends that the evidence regarding Mr. Keene did not tend to exonerate appellant and was not \u201cthe type of evidence that the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Smallwood </em>that an innocence petition was designed to address.\u201d It asserts that the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes \u201cdo not show Haddaway as a recanting, mistaken or intentionally lying eyewitness.\u201d With respect to the Ty Brooks palm prints, it contends that the \u201cpresence of his palm prints in Mrs. Wilford\u2019s home does not mean\u201d that appellant was \u201cnot in Mrs. Wilford\u2019s home at the time of the murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The State\u2019s view of the type of evidence of innocence required under CP \u00a7 8-301 is too narrow. Initially, as appellant notes, the enumerated list of types of evidence that could support a finding of innocence, upon which the State relies, was a recitation of categories of evidence provided to the General Assembly by various stakeholders; it did not purport to be an exhaustive list. Moreover, no case has held that the evidence must definitively exonerate the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">We hold that, although CP \u00a7 8-301 applies only to newly discovered evidence that \u201cspeaks to\u201d actual innocence, the petitioner need not definitively prove his or her innocence to warrant relief under the statute. That the newly discovered evidence does not definitively exonerate appellant, or may be countered by other evidence, goes to the weight of the evidence, which is considered in the third part of our analysis. In the first part of the analysis, we look to whether the newly discovered evidence \u201cspeaks to,\u201d or could support, a claim that the petitioner did not commit the crime for which he or she was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Applying this analysis to the present case, we conclude that the newly discovered evidence \u201cspeaks to,\u201d or could support, appellant\u2019s claim that he did not commit the crimes for which he was convicted. Appellant contends that the match of the palm prints found at the scene to Ty Brooks, a person with a history \u201cof committing crimes similar to the break-in that led to Mrs. Wilford\u2019s murder,\u201d and which corroborated \u201ca 1992 informant\u2019s report that [Mr.] Thomas confessed that [he] and [Ty] Brooks committed the murder,\u201d shows that Ty Brooks, and not appellant, was guilty of the murder. We agree that the palm print evidence, as well as the Keene observation, \u201cspeaks to\u201d appellant\u2019s innocence because the evidence, if believed and sufficiently proved, could support appellant\u2019s contention that \u201ctwo career criminals, Ty Anthony Brooks and William Thomas, Jr., actually committed this crimes.\u201d To the extent the evidence was offered to show that someone other than appellant and Mr. Faulkner committed the crime, it was evidence that supports a claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">With respect to the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, appellant argues that they undermine \u201cthe State\u2019s Haddaway-based theory of the crime.\u201d He contends that Ms. Haddaway was a crucial witness for the State, and the statements that Ms. Haddaway made in those recordings places her credibility and objectivity seriously into question. Appellant asserts that the tapes show that Ms. Haddaway \u201cextorted a deal from the prosecution with threats to torpedo the State\u2019s case by threatening to \u2018come in and tell the truth\u2019 that the State would not \u2018want to be known,\u2019\u201d and they \u201creveal a shocking level of corruption, an utter disregard for the truth, and the willingness of the prosecution to give in to extortion to obtain [appellant\u2019s] conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Although appellant\u2019s characterization of the effect of the tapes appears to be overstated, we do agree that the tapes could support an argument that Ms, Haddaway may have deliberately lied. In the context of this case, where Ms. Haddaway was a key witness for the State implicating appellant, and the new evidence could significantly impair her credibility regarding the core merits of the case, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that this newly discovered evidence satisfies the first prong of the analysis, i.e., the evidence speaks to actual innocence. <em>See Smallwood, </em>451 Md. at 319, 152 A.3d 776 (listing as an example of evidence supporting a finding of innocence evidence indicating that an eyewitness intentionally lied).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Could Not Have Been Discovered by Due Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Having determined that the newly discovered evidence satisfies the first requirement, we turn to the second prong of the analysis, which is whether the newly discovered evidence \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.\u201d CP \u00a7 8-301(a)(2). A Rule 4-331 motion based on newly discovered evidence must be filed \u201cwithin one year after the later of (A) the date the court imposed sentence or (B) the date the court received a mandate issued by the final appellate court to consider a direct appeal from the judgment or a belated appeal permitted as post conviction relief.\u201d Rule 4-331(c)(l). Here, the docket entries indicate that the circuit court received the mandate from this Court affirming his convictions on direct appeal on February 8, 2005. Accordingly, the appellant must show that the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered before the one-year deadline of February 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It is important to note that the requirement that the petitioner show that evidence could not have been discovered at an earlier time does not require that defense counsel exhaust every lead or seek to discover a needle in a haystack. <em>Cf. Maryland v. Kulbicki, </em>- U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2, 4-5, - L.Ed.2d - (2015) (standard of \u201creasonable competence\u201d does not require defense counsel to \u201cgo \u2018looking for a needle in a haystack,\u2019 even when they have \u2018reason to doubt there is any needle there\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em>546 U.S. 374, 389, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005)). Rather, CP \u00a7 8-301(a)(2) requires only that defense counsel exercise due diligence to discover evidence. <em>See Hawes, </em>216 Md.App. at 136, 85 A.3d 291 (CP \u00a7 8-301(a)(2) requires a showing that newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>discovered evidence \u201ccould not, with due diligence, have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.\u201d). <em>See also Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 600-01, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998) (\u201cTo qualify as \u2018newly discovered,\u2019 evidence must not have been discovered, or been discoverable!],] by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d); Md. Rule 4-332(d)(6) (A petition for a writ of actual innocence must allege that it is based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d \u201cwhich, with due diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This second requirement, that the evidence could not, with due diligence, have been discovered in time to move for a new trial, is \u201ca threshold question.\u201d <em>Argyrou, </em>349 Md. at 604, 709 A.2d 1194. <em>Accord Jackson v. State, </em>216 Md.App, 347, 364, 86 A.3d 97, <em>cert. denied, </em>438 Md. 740, 93 A.3d 289 (2014). \u201c[U]ntil there is a finding of newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered by due diligence, no relief is available, \u2018no matter how compelling the cry of outraged justice may be.\u2019\u201d <em>Argyrou, </em>349 Md. at 602, 709 A.2d 1194 (quoting <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 432, 621 A.2d 910 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Here, appellant claims that the newly discovered evidence, including Mr. Keene\u2019s observations, the identification of Ty Brooks\u2019 palm prints, and the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, satisfied this requirement. The circuit court disagreed, and we review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Love, </em>95 Md.App. at 435, 621 A.2d 910 (\u201cWe cannot say that [the judge] abused his discretion in finding the absence of due diligence.\u201d). With this background in mind, we review the three categories of evidence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The Keene Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">We begin with appellant\u2019s contention that information contained in undisclosed MSP notes and Betamax videotapes of an interview with Mr. Keene, indicating that Mr. Keene saw an Oldsmobile at Ms. Wilford\u2019s house the day of the murder at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>1:55 p.m., was newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered with due diligence before February 2006. The circuit court rejected that argument, noting that the following statement, available to defense counsel prior to trial, was contained in a report by Trooper Harmon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">Same date [January 9,1987,] the writer [Sergeant Harmon] and Tfc. Shelly were contacted at the Easton Barrack by Danny Keene. He reported seeing a silver colored vehicle he believed to be an Olds Cutlass. He was taken to the victim\u2019s residence, at which time he showed the writer the location he observed the vehicle parked. The location was backed in next to the front porch, next to several bushes, bearing a similar type leaf as found in the living room floor of the victims [sic] house. He was [driven] around Easton, and upon observing a vehicle at the Bonanza Rest[a]urant, he stated it was a vehicle similar to the one he observed. He had picked out a 77 Olds Cutlass. Refer to Tfc. Shelly\u2019s supplements for further details of this individuals [sic] interviews.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Appellant contends that this report was part of \u201cover 700 pages of documents\u201d provided in discovery, and because it did not \u201cindicate when [Mr. Keene] saw the vehicle,\u201d \u201cthere was nothing to tip anyone that he had seen the vehicle at the time of the murder.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The circuit court, noting that it must consider the totality of the circumstances in considering due diligence, found that the \u201csubstance of Mr. Keene\u2019s testimony was available at trial and [appellant was] on notice that he was a possible witness.\u201d Because the State\u2019s theory of the case was that appellant and his two companions were \u201con foot\u201d on January 5, 1987, and they walked several miles to Ms. Wilford\u2019s house and back to Black Dog Alley, the court reasoned that \u201cany information that would have contradicted the story that [they] were on foot for the entire time would have been highly relevant to mounting a defense.\u201d The circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>found that \u201c[d]ue diligence required a reasonable good faith effort to follow up on this information and assess Mr. Keene\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s finding in this regard. It is undisputed that appellant was provided access to the Harmon police report, which included Mr. Keene\u2019s observation. And as the circuit court stated, a sighting of a vehicle at Ms. Wilford\u2019s house would have been relevant, either to counter the State\u2019s theory that appellant travelled on foot to and from Ms. Wilford\u2019s residence or to develop whether someone else was at the residence at the time of the murder. The defense could have discovered the time when Mr. Keene saw the car by contacting Mr. Keene or seeking to review the \u201csupplements\u201d referred to in the report, which included \u201cfurther details.\u201d A reasonable investigation would have led them to discover the additional details regarding the timing of his observation. <em>See Argyrou, </em>349 Md. at 605, 709 A.2d 1194 (\u201c \u2018[D]ue diligence\u2019 contemplates that the defendant act reasonably and in good faith to obtain the evidence, in light of the totality of the circumstances and the facts known to him or her.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellant failed to exercise due diligence by not investigating further into Mr. Keene\u2019s sighting of a car, and therefore, that the evidence of the timing of the observation did not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that could not have been discovered with due diligence in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331. Because the newly discovered Keene evidence did not satisfy the second prong of the analysis, the court was not required to address the third requirement, that it creates a substantial possibility that the result of the trial may have been different, before concluding that this evidence did not warrant granting the petition for writ of actual innocence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Bollinger-Haddaway</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Appellant next claims that the circuit court erred in finding that the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, which were not discovered until after the New York Innocence Project filed a MPIA request in 2011, did not qualify as newly discovered evidence pursuant to CP \u00a7 8-301. Appellant contends that these tapes revealed: (1) the State\u2019s agreement to Ms. Hadda-way\u2019s demands to drop charges against her grandson; (2) that Ms. Haddaway, Mr. Andrews, and his attorney, Mr. Eckel \u201ccolluded to frame\u201d appellant; and (3) that Ms. Haddaway was \u201ca dishonest, scheming manipulator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The circuit court initially found that the tapes, \u201cwhich discuss an agreement between the State and Ms. Haddaway to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the case against her grandson,\u201d were not disclosed prior to trial. Given this undisputed factual finding that the tapes were not known to appellant at trial, and were discovered more than 10 years later, they constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>See Hawes, </em>216 Md.App. at 136, 85 A.3d 291 (report in existence prior to trial but not known to defendant was newly discovered evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The circuit court, therefore, correctly stated that the question \u201cbecomes whether this information could have been discovered within the timeframe set forth in Rule 4-331(c).\u201d The court concluded that appellant\u2019s argument that the tapes could not have been discovered in this timeframe was \u201cdoomed by [his] own efforts,\u201d noting that appellant discovered the tapes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>through his MPIA requests, and \u201c[tjhese requests could have been made within the time frame set forth in Rule 4-331 (c) and the information could have been available.\u201d Accordingly, the circuit court concluded that \u201cthe tapes of the Hadda-way/Bollinger conversations do not meet the definition of newly discovered evidence\u201d that warrants relief under CP \u00a7 8-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in holding that due diligence required him to file a MPIA request to discover the tapes prior to the Rule 4-331(c) deadline. He notes that, pursuant to <em>Conyers v. State, </em>367 Md. 671, 603, 790 A.2d 15, <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 942, 123 S.Ct. 341, 154 L.Ed.2d 249 (2002), when a prosecutor relies, as the State did here, on an open file policy to satisfy its <em>Brady </em>obligations, \u201cdefense counsel may reasonably rely on that file to contain all materials the State is constitutionally obligated to disclose under <em>Brady.\u201d </em>He asserts that he was \u201callowed to take the State at its word that it disclosed all of its evidence through its open file and there was no exculpatory evidence,\u201d and \u201c[diligence did not require him to seek the information that was hidden from him.\u201d Appellant also contends that the circuit court\u2019s due diligence ruling conflicts with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hawes, </em>which he asserts \u201crejected an identical argument\u201d and held \u201cthat exculpatory evidence suppressed by the State was \u2018newly discovered\u2019 for the purposes of a writ of actual innocence, even though it was later obtained through public information requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The State argues that \u201cthe court\u2019s due diligence determination as to the discoverability of ... the Haddaway/Bollinger tapes was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d It contends that appellant failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel was diligent in counsel\u2019s review of the State\u2019s files, asserting that the evidence adduced at the hearings below indicates that \u201cthe tapes were contained within the police investigative files,\u201d and it was \u201cnot usual for defense counsel to sift through the police investigative files in advance of trial.\u201d The State also argues that it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude that appellant was not diligent because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>could have filed a MPIA request \u201cto review the investigative boxes post-trial, before the expiration of the Rule 4-331 (c)\u201d time period. Finally, the State disagrees that <em>Hawes </em>resolves the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We begin with appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Hawes. </em>Initially, we note that, in <em>Hawes, </em>216 Md.App. at 130-31, 85 A.3d 291, the circuit judge dismissed the petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing, and the issue we addressed involved the pleading requirements for a petition for writ of actual innocence, not the burden of proof at the hearing, the issue here. The petition in <em>Hawes </em>was based, in part, on a withheld police report that subsequently was obtained through a MPIA request. <em>Id. </em>at 134-36, 85 A.3d 291. We noted that defense counsel diligently attempted to obtain all police reports prior to trial, through discovery requests and subpoenas, but he did not receive it until a MPIA request was filed after trial. <em>Id. </em>Hawes did not allege in his petition, however, the date that he received the report. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 85 A.3d 291. We explained that this was a \u201ccritical\u201d date because it determined whether he could have moved for a new trial within the one-year time frame. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 85 A.3d 291. In light of that deficiency, we concluded that Hawes\u2019 petition did not state a claim for writ of actual innocence as a matter of law, and the circuit court properly dismissed the petition without a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 85 A.3d 291. <em>Hawes </em>did not, as appellant asserts, address whether \u201cdue diligence\u201d requires a criminal defendant to file a MPIA request to seek documents not disclosed.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In this case, we will address whether \u201cdue diligence\u201d requires a criminal defendant to file a MPIA request. In this regard, we note that the State was obligated to disclose the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, which included favorable impeachment evidence of Ms. Haddaway\u2019s request for dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>charges against her grandson. A prosecutor has a duty to disclose any understanding or agreement with a key witness requiring a future prosecution because it would be relevant to. the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 210, 896 A.2d 973 (2006); <em>Conyers, </em>367 Md. at 597-98, 790 A.2d 15. This disclosure obligation exists even as to evidence \u201cknown only to police investigators and not to the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 790 A.2d 15 (quoting <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 280-81, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)). <em>Accord Riggins v. State, </em>223 Md.App. 40, 56, 115 A.3d 224 (2015) (\u201cThat the ... reports were in the physical possession of the [Police] Department did not obviate the State\u2019s responsibility to disclose them.\u201d). Md. Rule 4-263(c)(22) (the obligations of the State\u2019s Attorney extend to material and information that must be disclosed under this Rule and \u201care in the possession or control of the attorney, members of the attorney\u2019s staff, or any other person who either reports regularly to the attorney\u2019s office or has reported to the attorney\u2019s office in regard to the particular case.\u201d). Indeed, the State conceded below, and on appeal, that it should have turned over the Bollinger-Hadda-way tapes to appellant pursuant to its disclosure obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We hold that the due diligence requirement in CP \u00a7 8-301 does not encompass a requirement that a defendant file a MPIA request with the police, or other agency that reports to the prosecutor, seeking information that the State is required to disclose pursuant to <em>Brady </em>and Rule 4-263. As appellant notes, a criminal defendant should be able to rely upon the State to comply with its <em>Brady </em>and discovery obligations. <em>Conyers, </em>367 Md. at 603, 790 A.2d 15 (\u201c \u2018[I]f a prosecutor asserts that he complies with <em>Brady </em>through an open file policy, defense counsel may reasonably rely on that file to contain all materials the State is constitutionally obligated to disclose under <em>Brady.\u2019 </em>\u201d) (quoting <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 283 n.23, 119 S.Ct. 1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The parties do not cite, and we have not found, any case supporting the proposition that due diligence requires a defendant to file a public information act request to double-check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>that the State complied with its disclosure obligations. The only case found to be remotely on point is <em>Ex Parte Miles, </em>359 S.W.3d 647, 671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). In that case, the court did not specifically discuss this issue, but it held that, where the State failed to produce police reports that identified other potential suspects, and reports were discovered years later pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request, the evidence constituted newly discovered evidence that could not be known with the exercise of due diligence. This holding supports, albeit indirectly, our holding that the due diligence requirement in CP \u00a7 8-301 does not encompass a requirement that a defendant file a MPIA request to ensure that the State complied with its disclosure obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The circuit court, in finding that appellant did not meet the requirement of due diligence in discovering the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes because he did not file an earlier MPIA request, misconstrued the legal standard for due diligence. Accordingly, the circuit court abused its discretion in finding that the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes did not meet the second requirement for newly discovered evidence, i.e., that it could not have been discovered with due diligence in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331. <em>See Jackson, </em>449 Md. at 196, 141 A.3d 1122 (\u201c \u2018[A] trial court must exercise its discretion in accordance with correct legal standards.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Alston, </em>331 Md. at 504, 629 A.2d 70); <em>Bass v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 1, 11, 47 A.3d 582 (2012) (\u201c \u2018[A]n exercise of discretion based upon an error of law is an abuse of discretion,\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Brockington v. Grimstead, </em>176 Md.App. 327, 359, 933 A.2d 426 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">At oral argument, the State shifted gears and argued, as an alternative ground, that the circuit court properly found a lack of due diligence because the tapes were contained within the police investigation files (although mislabeled), and counsel could have looked through these files, either in advance of trial or after conviction. Again, the issue is not whether counsel <em>could </em>have looked through these files. Rather, the issue is whether due diligence <em>required </em>counsel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>seek review of the files for information that the State was obligated to provide. As indicated, when the State has an obligation to provide evidence, defense counsel is entitled to rely on the State\u2019s disclosure as satisfaction of its obligation. In a situation such as that involved here, where the State uses open file discovery to satisfy its obligations, and defense counsel has no reason to believe that the State has not satisfied those obligations, due diligence does not require defense counsel to \u201cscavenge for hints of undisclosed <em>Brady </em>material.\u201d <em>Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 695-96, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004) (rule declaring \u201c\u2018prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek,\u2019 is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We also note that, even if defense counsel had looked through the police boxes during the course of preparing for trial, a fact that is not clear from the record, counsel might not have seen the tapes.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In addition to the evidence that the tapes subsequently were found in a mislabeled envelope, the tapes were not created until February 2 and February 8,2001, and appellant\u2019s trial began approximately three weeks later, on February 26, 2001. Thus, even if counsel had requested to see the police files and been granted access during pre-trial investigation, the tapes may not have been in existence at the time of access. Once the tapes were made, the State had the obligation to disclose them</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Accordingly, the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes meet the second prong of the analysis; they could not have been discovered with due diligence in the requisite time period. As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>this evidence, therefore, must be assessed to determine if it satisfies the third requirement for newly discovered evidence pursuant to CP \u00a7 8-301, whether it creates a substantial possibility that the result of the trial may have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Palm Prints</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We turn next to the third item of newly discovered evidence, the discovery more than ten years after appellant\u2019s conviction that Ty Brooks\u2019 palm prints matched the prints discovered in Ms. Wilford\u2019s utility room. Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in finding that this newly discovered evidence failed to satisfy the second requirement, that it could not have been discovered with due diligence within the requisite time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In addressing this claim of newly discovered evidence, the circuit court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Again the court must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether this identification could have been known at the time of trial as a result of due diligence. First, as noted before, the identification [of] Ty Brooks as a possible suspect was available to the Petitioners at the time of their respective trials because of the statement that James Brooks made to Trooper Wiley. The crux of the Petitioners\u2019 contention is that the AFIS system was not in place at the time of trial, and, therefore, matching the latent palm print to Ty Brooks. Mr. M[a]nkevich, whose testimony the court finds to be credible, stated that, although there had been advances in the ways of gathering information, the fundamental means of identifying fingerprints, visual observation, is the same technique that was available in 1987 and 2000. He also stated that the AFIS did not represent a new technology for comparing prints. It was a much more efficient database for finding known prints and became available in 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">Mr. M[a]nkevich testified that, between June 2000 and March 2016, the prints of seven people, including the Petitioners, Ty Brooks and Boozie Thomas, had been compared to the latent palm prints. Mr. M[a]nkevich noted that the palm print used to identify the latent print with Ty Brooks was on file, and that it was not necessary to have him take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>additional prints. He did not indicate the file print from Mr. Brooks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">Looking at the totality of the circumstances, it appears to the court that due diligence would have required the Petitioners to seek palm prints from Ty Brooks and Boozie Thomas through the use of Rule 4-264. Again, the MSP investigative file, which was available to the Petitioners, indicated that these two men were suspects in the murder.<footnotemark>[35]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Accordingly, any evidence regarding the possible identification of Ty Brooks and Boozie Thomas to the murder was available to the Petitioners at the time of their trial and could have been obtained through due diligence. In this regard, it should be noted that Mr. Smith\u2019s defense was premised on the lack of credibility of Ms. Haddaway .... The purpose of the statute is to afford the innocent the opportunity to show their innocence, and not to recast their defense with information that was otherwise available to them.<footnotemark>[36]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Appellant contends that the court\u2019s ruling that he could have obtained evidence that the unidentified palm print belonged to Ty Brooks was erroneous, asserting that \u201creasonable diligence does not require defense counsel to conduct a full forensic investigation into dozens of potential suspects that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the State ruled out.\u201d He argues that the search was impossible prior to the addition of palm prints to the database in 2009. Accordingly, he asserts, \u201cthe palm print match and all the information that flowed from that match were not available through the exercise of diligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The State concedes that the court\u2019s finding that appellant could have obtained palm prints from Ty Brooks pursuant to Rule 4-264 was erroneous, stating that Rule 4-264 \u201chas little utility [to appellant] in this context.\u201d That concession was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Maryland Rule 4-264 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">On motion of a party, the circuit court may order the issuance of a subpoena commanding a person to produce for inspection and copying at a specified time and place before trial designated documents, recordings, photographs, or other tangible things, not privileged, which may constitute or contain evidence relevant to the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">In <em>Chew v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 681, 721, 627 A.2d 332 (1987), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>317 Md. 233, 562 A.2d 1270 (1989), this Court held that Rule 4-264 \u201cdoes not authorize subjecting a human being to physical examination, such as the furnishing of pubic hair, a blood sample, a voice exemplar, etc.\u201d Pursuant to this reasoning, Rule 4-264 would not have permitted appellant to obtain an order requiring Ty Brooks to provide a palm print.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The State argues, however, that although the circuit court\u2019s reliance on Rule 4-264 was erroneous, the court\u2019s \u201cpoint\u2014that [a]ppellants could have set into motion legal proceedings to compel Ty Brooks to submit to fingerprinting\u2014is well founded.\u201d At oral argument, when pressed to explain what mechanism counsel could have used in this regard, counsel for the State argued that appellant could have asked the circuit court to issue an order to compel Ty Brooks to submit to palm printing based on <em>Howard v. State, </em>232 Md.App. 125, 156-57, 156 A.3d 981 (2017), which the State argues supports the proposition that the due process right to present a meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>defense would enable a defendant to obtain such evidence, based on need.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument. In <em>Howard, </em>232 Md.App. at 146, 156 A.3d 981, this Court stated that, in a criminal case, \u201cdiscovery only may be obtained when permitted by the common law, by statute, or by court rule, or when it is constitutionally necessary.\u201d We declined to decide whether \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entitles a criminal defendant to obtain, pre-trial, evidence relevant and material to his defense that is not in the possession or control of the SAO,\u201d noting that, even if it did, Howard failed to make the requisite threshold showing of a need to make an inspection of the crime scene, the rape victim\u2019s home, to obtain evidence that was relevant and material to his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 156 A.3d 981. This case, the only authority cited by the State, does not support the State\u2019s argument that appellant was entitled to a court order to have Ty Brooks submit his palm prints or that defense counsel did not act with due diligence in failing to seek such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The State also argues that counsel could have asked Mr. Mankevieh to manually compare the palm prints found at the murder scene with Ty Brooks\u2019 prints, which it asserts \u201cwere already on file.\u201d It contends that appellant knew that Ty Brooks was a suspect, based on the statement by James Brooks that Mr. Thomas identified himself and Ty Brooks as possible perpetrators. Under these circumstances, the State argues that Ty Brooks\u2019 prints \u201cwere discoverable,\u201d and due diligence required a request to compare the unidentified prints found at the scene with those of Ty Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">There are two problems with this argument. First, contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, the evidence does not reflect that Ty Brooks\u2019 palm prints were on file and available for a manual comparison, either at the time of trial or during the time period in which to file a motion for new trial. Indeed, the record reflects that the police did not begin taking palm prints of arrestees in the area until after Ms. Wilford\u2019s murder, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the known palm prints that Mr. Mankevich used to make the match were taken from Ty Brooks in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Second, as appellant notes, Ty Brooks was one of 24 potential suspects disclosed to trial counsel, not including appellant, Mr. Faulkner, and Mr. Andrews. To be sure, this list of persons who could have left the palm prints could be further narrowed down to 12, including Ty Brooks, Boozie Thomas, and James Brooks, based on police records that showed that other suspects already had been palm printed or could otherwise be eliminated as suspects. Ty Brooks, however, remained as just one of a number of suspects.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Given the number of possible suspects, we cannot conclude that \u201cdue diligence\u201d required appellant to take legal action, assuming that was possible, to obtain palm prints of all of the potential suspects, including Ty Brooks, Mr. Thomas, and James Brooks, and have them manually compared to the crime scene lifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We agree with appellant that the palm print \u201cmatch\u201d satisfied the second prong of the CP \u00a7 8-301 test, i.e., newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered by due diligence in the requisite time period. It is not disputed that the palm print match was not known prior to February 2006, and the capability of the automated system to conduct palm print searches was not available before 2009, when the State\u2019s AFIS vendor added the function. Under these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>stances, and given that the match was determined only after a new development in matching technology, we hold that the evidence that the previously unidentified palm print was a match to Ty Brooks constitutes newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered with due diligence. <em>See Ward v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 146, 168, 108 A.3d 507 (2015) (newly discovered evidence can include new testing methods that did not exist at trial and are used to test evidence introduced at the original trial). <em>See also Ex Parte Miles, </em>359 S.W.3d at 664 (new evidence of identifiation of the source of the previously unidentified fingerprint was \u201cnot ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence\u201d prior to the requisite time period). The circuit court abused its discretion in finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In sum, appellant met his burden of showing that the palm print evidence and the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes constituted newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331. Accordingly, the next step in the analysis is whether that evidence met the third requirement for newly discovered evidence, that it creates \u201ca substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined.\u201d CP \u00a7 8-301(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Substantial Possibility of a Different Result</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The third prong of the analysis \u201cinvolves a determination regarding the impact of the evidence.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 366, 86 A.3d 97. The test is \u201cwhether, if [the convicting] jury had the benefit of the newly discovered evidence as well as the evidence that was before them, would there be \u2018a substantial or significant possibility that the result would have been different?\u2019\u201d <em>Yonga v. </em>State, 446 Md. 183, 211, 130 A.3d 486 (2016) (quoting <em>Yonga, </em>221 Md.App. at 69, 108 A.3d 448) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018[T]he substantial or significant possibility standard falls between \u201cproba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ble,\u201d which is less demanding than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and \u201cmight\u201d which is less stringent than probable.\u2019\u201d <em>McGhie v. State, </em>449 Md. 494, 510, 144 A.3d 752 (2016) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 588, 556 A.2d 230 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erroneously discounted the significance of the newly discovered evidence, which he asserts \u201cboth (1) undermines the State\u2019s case against Smith at its core and (2) implicates Brooks and Thomas as the murderers.\u201d He argues that, given the presence of Ty Brooks\u2019 prints at the point of entry, \u201ccorroborated by [Mr.] Thomas\u2019 confession independently made years earlier, [Mr.] Keene\u2019s observation of a suspicious car at the house, and evidence showing [Ms.] Haddaway\u2019s corruption of the prosecution, the proof of innocence is overwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The State argued in its brief that, given the court\u2019s determination that appellant did not exercise due diligence with respect to discovering the new evidence, \u201cit is not necessary to consider whether the evidence created substantial possibility of a different outcome.\u201d As indicated, we have rejected that proposition, at least with respect to the palm print evidence and the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes. On the merits of the court\u2019s decision in this regard, the State argues merely that the circuit court is presumed to properly exercise its discretion in applying the substantial possibility test to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Our review of the circuit court\u2019s memorandum opinion suggests that the circuit court rested its decision on its finding that the second prong of the test, due diligence, was not satisfied, and therefore, the court did not address the third prong, the substantial possibility of a different result. After a five-page discussion of the evidence as it related to the second prong of the test, the circuit court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">The court is, therefore, not persuaded that the Petitioners have proved that there is a substantial or significant possibility that the result in their respective trials. Nor is the court persuaded that there is newly discovered evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>that would lead to a substantial or significant possibility of a different result in the Petitioners\u2019 respective trials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The State argues that, in the first sentence, the words \u201cwould have been different\u201d simply were deleted, and this sentence shows that the court did address the substantial possibility prong and resolved it against appellant. Although that is one possibility, a review of the entire memorandum opinion suggests the more likely possibility that the denial of the petition was based on the second requirement, due diligence, and the first sentence, which is incomplete, was intended to be cut, or rewritten, as opposed to words being inadvertently omitted. We are not persuaded that the court conducted an independent analysis of the third requirement, the substantial possibility of a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">That presents a problem for review of this requirement by this Court, which reviews the circuit court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. Indeed, the statute provides, contrary to the State\u2019s argument that we presume that the court correctly applied the statute, that the court \u201cshall state the reasons for its ruling on the record.\u201d CP \u00a7 8\u2014301(f)(2). The court here did not give its reasons for a finding, if any, that the tapes and the palm print evidence did not create a substantial or significant possibility of a different result in appellant\u2019s trial. As indicated, that is a trial court function that we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 713-14, 884 A.2d 694 (2005) (\u201cIt is not for an appellate court to decide whether it thinks a piece of newly discovered evidence might have made a difference\u201d in appellant\u2019s trial; that is for the trial judge, \u201cwho is uniquely competent to assess whether the new evidence is worthy of being credited\u201d and whether there was a substantial possibility it would have led to a different result.).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Indeed, in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>411 Md. 664, 683-84, 985 A.2d 32 (2009), where the circuit court, in the context of a CP \u00a7 8-201 claim, applied the wrong standard, i.e., whether the evidence \u201cwill exculpate the Petitioner,\u201d the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the circuit court to consider, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>appropriate test, whether a \u201csubstantial possibility exists that the petitioner would not have been convicted.\u201d We also will remand the case to the circuit court to consider whether, if the jury that convicted appellant had the benefit of the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes and the palm print evidence, there is a substantial or significant possibility that the result of the trial would have been different. The circuit court will determine whether presentation of new evidence will be permitted on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in curtailing his ability to present evidence at the innocence hearing that implicated Ty Brooks in Ms. Wilford\u2019s murder. Specifically, he asserts that the court erred: (1) in precluding him from calling Ty Brooks as a witness on the ground that he was incompetent to testify based on his out-of-state perjury conviction; and (2) in redacting Ty Brooks\u2019 name from Mr. Thomas\u2019 statement implicating the two of them in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Because we are remanding the case for further proceedings, we need not decide these claims. On remand, the parties can choose whether to revive these issues, and if so, the court can determine whether evidence in this regard is admissible in the court\u2019s analysis of the substantial possibility of a different result. We will, however, for the guidance of the circuit court, offer a few comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Scope of the Admissible Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">As indicated, the appellate courts have explained that the third requirement requires an analysis regarding \u201cwhether, if [the convicting] jury had the benefit of the newly discovered evidence as well as the evidence that was before them, would there be \u2018a substantial or significant possibility that the result would have been different?\u2019\u201d <em>Yonga v. State, </em>446 Md. 183, 211, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>130 A.3d 486 (2016) (quoting <em>Yonga, </em>221 Md.App. at 69, 108 A.3d 448) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 670, 821 A.2d 1 (2003) (The trial judge \u201cweighed the newly discovered evidence and considered its significance in relation to the evidence already presented at trial\u201d). Thus, the analysis focuses on the significance of the newly discovered evidence on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Here, however, the evidentiary claims involve evidence that is not claimed to be newly discovered.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Neither party on appeal addresses whether, in addressing a petition for writ of actual innocence, the court can consider evidence other than the newly discovered evidence in assessing the possibility of a different result. <em>Compare State v. Hess, </em>231 Ariz. 80, 290 P.3d 473, 476 (App. 2012) (in determining whether newly discovered evidence probably would result in a different verdict, court should consider other evidence affecting value of new evidence), <em>with Commonwealth v. Reese, </em>444 Pa.Super. 38, 663 A.2d 206, 209-10 (1995) (in determining whether newly discovered evidence would have affected the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced, court should not consider other evidence that was not introduced at the original trial). If, on remand, appellant wants the court to consider the Ty Brooks evidence that is not claimed to be newly discovered evidence, nor evidence presented at trial, the court should assess whether that is appropriate in the context of the CP \u00a7 8-301 analysis of the substantial possibility of a different result. If the court determines that it is appropriate to consider this evidence, we suggest it reassess its original rulings in light of the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Ty Brooks</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Appellant\u2019s first claim is that the circuit court erroneously precluded him from calling Ty Brooks, a convicted perjurer, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>a witness at the hearing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The court\u2019s decision barring testimony by Ty Brooks was based on Md. Code (2015 Supp.) \u00a7 9-104 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\"), which at the time of the hearing stated: \u201cA person convicted of perjury may not testify.\u201d The parties on appeal dispute the applicability of this statute to out-of-state perjury convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Although this presents an interesting issue, it will not be relevant to the proceedings on remand. The General Assembly repealed CJP \u00a7 9-104, effective October 1, 2016. The effect of a prior perjury conviction is now addressed in CJP \u00a7 10-905(c), which states: \u201cEvidence that a witness has been convicted of perjury shall be admitted for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness, regardless of the date of the conviction, if the evidence is elicited from the witness or established by public record during examination of the witness.\u201d Accordingly, on remand, Ty Brooks\u2019 perjury conviction will no longer be a bar to his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Redacting Ty Brooks\u2019 Name from James Brooks\u2019 Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Appellant\u2019s second evidentiary claim involves James Brooks\u2019 statement that Mr. Thomas advised that he and Ty Brooks killed Ms. Wilford. The court precluded reference to Ty Brooks, noting that a \u201cstatement against penal interest ... applies to the declarant not some other person.\u201d It ruled that counsel could ask James Brooks if Mr. Thomas \u201cmight have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>had an accomplice,\u201d but counsel could not attempt to elicit an identification of any accomplice because the \u201cparticular identification of who the accomplice is ... goes beyond [a] statement against penal interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In <em>State v. Matusky, </em>343 Md. 467, 482, 682 A.2d 694 (1996), the Court of Appeals applied a more nuanced test. It held that, in determining the admissibility of a declaration against the penal interest of an unavailable declarant, the court should review \u201cthe entire declaration to determine which portions of it are directly contrary to the declarant\u2019s penal interest, and which collateral portions are so closely related as to be equally trustworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We note, however, that the circuit court\u2019s comments suggest that it found James Brooks\u2019 statement to be suspect, indicating that the statement did not warrant much weight because it was \u201cat best, equivocal.\u201d In that regard, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">The problem with the Petitioners\u2019 assertion [that James Brooks\u2019 statement was reliable] is that stabbing Mrs. Wilford and leaving her dead is contradicted by the forensic evidence that was adduced at trial. She must have come in the house and placed her groceries on the table before being confronted by her assailants. The evidence revealed that she had been stabbed repeatedly. There were broken knife blades on the floor around her body. Further, the knife wounds indicated that she was in a defensive posture and, therefore, there appeared to have been something of a struggle between Mrs. Wilford and her assailant(s). Also, the most compelling image of Mrs. Wilford is that she was lying on her back with a knife jammed into her cheek. None of this evidence suggests the possibility that she could have been stabbed in the back and left for dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">Although [James] Brooks did not recant his statement that Boozie Thomas had told him that he had killed Mrs. Wilford, the court finds his testimony as being, at best, equivocal. He said that he was on drugs and that he had been high for several days and that Boozie Thomas and he were high at the time that he made the alleged statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>He also testified that when he was a drug addict he did some bad things and now wanted to set things right. He told this story because he believed that he could get reward money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">On remand, if appellant seeks to pursue this evidentiary issue, the court can clarify whether James Brooks\u2019 statement warrants any weight in the analysis whether the newly discovered evidence creates a substantial or significant possibility of a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Motion to Reopen Post-Conviction Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">After the circuit court concluded that it would not grant appellant\u2019s petition for writ of actual innocence, the court turned to appellant\u2019s motion to reopen his post-conviction proceeding. In that context, it addressed only the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes, and it found that the discovery of these tapes did not warrant reopening post-conviction proceedings because \u201c[a]dditional impeaching evidence against Ms. Hadda-way does not necessarily mean that the testimony of the other witnesses becomes less credible.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court noted that the \u201carrangement regarding Landon Janda does not contradict any other evidence presented,\u201d and it was not a precondition to Ms. Haddaway providing information that led to the arrest of appellant. Accordingly, the court stated that it did \u201cnot believe that it would advance the interests of justice to reopen the post-conviction proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cerred in denying [his] motion to reopen and by not granting postconviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>relief.\u201d He argues that the court \u201cabused its discretion because it ignored nearly all of the evidence and claims [appellant] presented in his motion to reopen, exclusively addressing the suppression of the Haddaway Tapes.\u201d Appellant asserts that the tapes were \u201conly a single facet\u201d of the \u201ccascade of innocence evidence and the indisputable proof of serious constitutional violations that marred [his] trial proceedings,\u201d all of which demonstrate that it is in the interests of justice to grant his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The State does not dispute that the circuit court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion to reopen should be vacated, and it argues that the proceedings should be remanded to the circuit court for further consideration. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The circuit court \u201cmay reopen a postconviction proceeding that was previously concluded if the court determines that the action is in the interests of justice.\u201d CP \u00a7 7-104. The court must exercise discretion when ruling on a motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings, which \u201cprevents the court from acting arbitrarily.\u201d <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 382, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005). The record must reflect that the court\u2019s discretion \u201cwas in fact exercised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 879 A.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Here, the record does not indicate that the court properly exercised its discretion in deciding the motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings for several reasons. Initially, as noted by the State, the circuit court issued an order setting forth the schedule for the proceedings, which provided that the petitions for writ of actual innocence be addressed first, and separate from, the motions to reopen. Following this schedule, the court heard opening arguments, received evidence, and heard closing arguments on the petitions for writ of actual innocence. On the last day of this hearing, which the State asserts lasted more than 11 hours, the court advised that it would \u201ctake th[e] matter sub curia.\u201d Contrary to the ordered schedule, and without hearing additional evidence or separate argument on the motions to reopen, the court then decided both the petitions for writ of actual innocence and the motions to reopen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>without providing any explanation for the change in procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Moreover, the court\u2019s opinion indicates that it did not consider all of appellant\u2019s claims. Although a court is not required to explain its reasons for denying a motion to reopen, <em>see Gray, </em>388 Md. at 381, 879 A.2d 1064, the record reflects that the circuit court mischaracterized the basis of the motion as including only one ground. In its written memorandum, the court characterized the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes as \u201cthe basis\u201d for appellant\u2019s motion, where the motion actually encompassed several claims, including an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgments denying appellant\u2019s petition for writ of actual innocence and his motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TALBOT COUNTY VACATED.

No information is free from Beverly.\u201d Sergeant Bollinger stated that his colleagues\u2019 statements were simply \"their opinion,\u201d not \"part of [his] investigation.\" He asserted that, in his investigation, what Ms. Haddaway told him \"turned out to be accurate and true,\u201d noting that Ms. Haddaway had given him her account of what happened on January 5, 1987, multiple times, and she had always been consistent that she saw the three men on Black Dog Alley immediately after the time of the murder. He agreed that the veracity of Ms. Haddaway\u2019s statements was bolstered by (1) the fact that she came forward early in the investigation, and (2) the accuracy of her description of the events that day, such as her correct description of the order in which the police vehicles and the ambulance responded to the crime scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[23]\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\">23. Sergeant Bollinger testified that, when Ms. Haddaway referred to \u201call three of them,\u201d she was referring to appellant, Mr. Faulkner, and Mr. Andrews.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[24]\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\">24. Counsel asked Sergeant Bollinger whether he interpreted Ms. Hadd-away's statement as \"a threat.\" He stated that he did not, noting: \"I laughed at her then, I laughed listening to it again. I heard this a hundred times so no it was not a threat.\u201d Counsel asked him if Ms. Haddaway was lying when she made the statement, and he responded: \"Beverly just liked to blow off steam. ... You call it lying. I disagree with your reference on that. She wasn't lying to me. She\u2019d blow off steam, that\u2019s what she did.\u201d On cross-examination, he noted that there was \"no doubt she was going to testify no matter what.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\">. There was conflicting testimony from the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Talbot County regarding what led to the nol pros of the charges against Landon Janda. Mr. McDonald, who was assigned to prosecute the case, testified that Scott Patterson, the State\u2019s Attorney for Talbot County, ordered him to dismiss the charges, telling him that \u201cBeverly Haddaway was giving him trouble and ... in the great scheme of things the murder case was more important.\u201d Mr. Patterson, however, testified that he did not \u201crecall having a conversation with Sergeant Bollinger about Mrs. Haddaway in that time frame in any regard,\u201d and to the best of his recollection, he \"never spoke to Mr. McDonald about the Landon Janda case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\">. We did not find in the record any written letter detailing the agreement to nol pros the charges against Mr. Janda. Mr. McDonald stated that, although he was told to nol pros the case, he was not told to write a letter. There were, however, two letters, one signed by Sergeant Bollinger, and one with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s signature, providing that Ms. Haddaway was supplying valuable information in the homicide investigation, and no charges would be brought against her for information related to the investigation,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">,The parties below indicated that Ms. Haddaway passed away prior to the innocence hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\">. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\">. Appellant's argument on appeal relating to Ms. Haddaway primarily focuses on information found in the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes. He does, however, reference \"an array of additional exculpatory evidence,\u201d subsequently found \u201c[bjuried in MSP files,\u201d which he asserts \u201cdemonstrated, among other things, [Ms.] Haddaway\u2019s true character as a dishonest, scheming manipulator who was always motivated by self-interest in stark contrast to the image she presented to the jury.\u201d In that regard, he cites a police report revealing that, in 1994, Ms. Haddaway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>sought to have criminal charges against her son dropped in exchange for information about the Wilford murder, handwritten notes regarding negative opinions of other officers regarding Ms. Haddaway\u2019s character, and immunity agreements stating that no charges would be brought against her for information relating to the Wilford murder. Given that the focus of appellant\u2019s argument is on the tapes, and that was the basis for the circuit court\u2019s decision, we will confine our analysis in this regard to the Bollinger-Haddaway tapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\">. As Judge Moylan explained in <em>Yonga </em>v. <em>State, </em>221 Md.App. 45, 57-58, 62, 108 A.3d 448 (2015), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>446 Md. 183, 130 A.3d 486 (2016), the test that the newly discovered evidence \"creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different\u201d is \"simply the weight or level of persuasion that the newly discovered evidence of actual innocence must possess in order to justify the issuance of the writ.\u201d Putting forth a \"mere bald assertion of actual innocence or some highly speculative or unsupported claim of actual innocence is not enough to justify the granting of a writ. The claim must be substantial enough for the hearing judge to conclude that there may, indeed, be a plausible case of actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\">. Mr. Faulkner, in his separate appeal arising from the court\u2019s ruling, states that this \"paragraph was not even a 'needle in a haystack\u2019; it was the shaft of a needle without the eye,\u201d and even if counsel had focused on this paragraph, the critical detail of the date and time was missing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">. The circuit court\u2019s findings also indicate that it found Mr. Keene's statement that he observed a car at the Wilford residence to be unbelievable. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>[W]ere his testimony to be believed the car that he saw would have been obscured from his view because of the line of trees, the shape o[f] Mrs. Wilford\u2019s home and the direction that he was travelling until he reached her driveway. It would then appear that he would have had to have turned his head 90 degrees to see the front of the car as he passed Mrs. Wilford\u2019s driveway. The remainder of his description of the vehicle would have had to come from observing the car in his rearview mirror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">To the extent that the circuit court found the testimony incredible, a finding that was not clearly erroneous, this would be another basis to find that the Keene evidence did not justify a grant of a petition for writ of actual innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. <em>Hawes v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 105, 136-37, 85 A.3d 291 (2014), makes clear that a petitioner will not prevail on a petition for writ of actual innocence if he was <em>actually aware </em>of the \u2018\u2018newly discovered\u201d evidence, by knowledge gained through a MPIA request or otherwise, in time to move for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. The State refers to Sergeant Metzger\u2019s testimony at the innocence hearing as support for its argument that defense counsel looked at the boxes. Sergeant Metzger however, did not become involved with the Wilford murder investigation until 2014. Her testimony, therefore, did not address what defense counsel looked at prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[35]\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">35. The court earlier noted that the MSP investigative file, which was available to defense counsel, contained a document referencing a statement made by James Brooks to Trooper Wiley, stating that Mr. Thomas told James Brooks that Mr. Thomas and Ty Brooks went to the victim\u2019s house to rob it, Ms. Wilford came home, and Mr. Thomas stabbed her. The court indicated that, based on this statement, appellant \u201ccould have availed [himself] of Rule 4-264 to get the fingerprints of [Mr.] Thomas and Ty Brooks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[36]\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">36. In an earlier part of the opinion, the court stated that, based on Mr. Mankevich\u2019s testimony regarding distortion on the latent print found on the window that resulted from rain, the palm print appeared to tie Ty Brooks to Ms. Wilford\u2019s house on a day prior to the murder. Appellant strenuously argues that the court misconstrued Mr. Mankevich\u2019s testimony, and the court\u2019s factual findings in this regard are clearly erroneous. The record appears to support this contention, and we suggest that the circuit court revisit this issue on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. Other suspects who had not had their palm prints taken, pursuant to the suspect list in the State\u2019s files, included: a \"prison escapee\u201d who was reported by a neighbor of the victim as a possible suspect; the minister of Ms. Wilford\u2019s church who had \"scratches on his face on the day following the homicide\u201d and who allegedly was \"extremely upset over the victim's death even though he hardly knew her\u201d; a man who allegedly told his employer that his sister\u2019s boyfriend and the boyfriend's brother had committed the homicide but \"denied making such statement\u201d when questioned by the police; a man implicated via \u201canonymous letter\u201d; a confidential source who later became a suspect when it was discovered that he was \"very paranoid,\u201d allegedly \"stab[bed] ... walls and counter tops\u201d with a knife to frighten his estranged wife, and attempted to \"burn [his wife\u2019s] house down while she was still inside\u201d; a \u201cformer bo[a]rder\u201d of Ms. Wilford who was implicated by a confidential source; and a man who allegedly told a cellmate that \"he was a hired killer and had just completed a job on the \u2018Shore\u2019 for ten thousand dollars,\u201d which involved killing a woman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">. The circuit court found that Mr. Thomas' statement to the police was made available to the defense at trial, and therefore, it was not newly discovered evidence. This contention has not been challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. Appellant also claims that the court erred in precluding him from playing a portion of Ty Brooks\u2019 2015 recorded police interview in which he stated that he \"terrorized Easton,\u201d admitting that he committed numerous robberies and burglaries in the area. He stated, however, that he did not remember Ms. Wilford's house, that murder was not his \"MO.\u201d Defense counsel argued that these statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, \"but for the opposite of the truth\u2014 as false denials demonstrating his consciousness of guilt\u2014and they were admissible as nonhearsay.\u201d Although it is not clear to us how these statements showed consciousness of guilt, that will be an issue for the circuit court to address on remand if appellant seeks again to introduce it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. In that regard, the court earlier in its opinion noted that Ms, Haddaway\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Mr. Andrews and appellant\u2019s three separate confessions, to Sergeant Bollinger, Ms. Haddaway, and Mr. Snow, We also note that, in his confession to Sergeant Bollinger, appellant accurately stated that Ms. Wilford was wearing a blue coat and had glasses on a chain around her neck, and Sergeant McCauley testified that he had reviewed various newspaper articles from 1987 through 1999, and none of these articles contained a description of what Ms. Wilford was wearing when she was killed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
