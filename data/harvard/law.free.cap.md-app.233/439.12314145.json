When, on the scheduled date of his District Court trial, Graham demanded a jury trial, his case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">On the date that his trial was to commence in the circuit court, Graham\u2019s counsel informed that court that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>had not provided the information requested by the defense, in the District Court and, on those grounds, moved to dismiss the case. The State responded that it had only learned of the request the preceding Friday (that is, the last business day before trial) and that it would be \u201cmore than happy\u201d to provide him with the information requested. Then, without explanation or even further inquiry, the circuit court granted the defense\u2019s motion and dismissed the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Appealing that decision, the State contends that the circuit court erred in granting Graham\u2019s motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him because of the State\u2019s failure to provide, before trial, the discovery requested by the defense. In support of that contention, the State makes three claims: first, that its failure to provide the discovery that had been requested by Graham was not a discovery violation under Maryland Rule 4-262, which both sides agree is the rule that governs the present dispute;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> second, that even if its failure to provide that discovery did violate Rule 4-262, dismissal of the charges against Graham was not an available sanction under that rule; and, third, that, assuming that dismissal of the charges against Graham was a sanction available to the circuit court, the court abused its discretion in choosing that sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Because we conclude that the circuit court did have the discretion to impose a sanction for the State\u2019s discovery violation but abused that discretion in imposing the drastic sanction that it did, we vacate the judgments of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">On August 17, 2015, Baltimore City police saw Graham engage in what they believed to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction. As a uniformed police officer approached Graham, moments after that transaction, he observed Graham throw small items under a vehicle parked on the street. Then, from under that vehicle, the officer retrieved four zip lock baggies containing a \u201crock like substance[,]\u201d which he believed to be cocaine. Graham was thereafter arrested and charged with possession of cocaine and attempted distribution of that drug in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On October 13, 2015, Graham filed requests for discovery,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the District Court, demanding that the State, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-262(d)(2)(D)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>Cole v. State, </em>378 Md. 42, 835 A.2d 600 (2003), provide the following documents and records: \u201c[a] complete copy of the Baltimore City Crime Lab case file including but not limited to ... results from any preliminary [drug] screening tests, gas chromatography (\u201cGC\u201d), gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis (\u201cGC/MS\u201d), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (\u201cFTIR\u201d), as well as ... any reference standards and controls, and the results of any re-examinations conducted on any samples\u201d; \u201c[documents relat[ed] to [his] case ... regularly kept in a place other than the case file\u201d; \u201cany other informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tion,\u201d related to his case, \u201cthat the crime lab ha[d] in its possession [or] control\u201d; \u201call maintenance records pertaining to any GC or GC/MS machine used in [his] case\u201d that recorded maintenance conducted \u201cfor the relevant time period prior to the [drug testing that was] performed in [his] case\u201d; copies of \u201c[a]ny protocols[ ] and procedures\u201d related to the drug testing done in his case; \u201c[u]pdated curriculum vita [sic]\u201d of any analyst involved in testing the drugs that were seized; and, five years of \u201cproficiency tests ... for any analyst involved in [his] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">On October 29, 2015, the State filed, in the District Court, a document captioned: \u201cRequest for Discovery from Defendant and the State\u2019s Disclosure to the Defendant.\u201d In that document, the State asserted that, \u201c[u]pon request of the Defendant,\u201d it would, \u201cby appointment^]\u201d provide \u201c[t]he opportunity to review and copy all documents, including but not limited to[ ] training and operations manuals, calibration records, procedures and reference material pursuant to <em>[Cole v. State], </em>378 Md. 42, 835 A.2d 600 (2003), ... and Rule 4-262.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>On December 16, 2015, the date Graham\u2019s trial was to commence in the District Court, he requested a jury trial. His case was then transferred to the Baltimore City circuit court, where it was scheduled for trial on Tuesday, January 19, 2016. On the Friday before trial, which was the last business day before trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Graham\u2019s counsel called the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney assigned to Graham\u2019s case and informed her that he had not yet received the information or material he had requested in his supplemental discovery request, though he had received a form summarizing what the State intended to disclose. Then, on January 19, 2016, when Graham\u2019s case was called for trial, the following verbal exchange occurred, between court and counsel, regarding Graham\u2019s discovery demand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">[DEFENSE]: Your Honor, the preliminary matter the Defense is going to raise, and I did speak with [the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] about this on Friday, is that in any drugs case, as a matter of course, we now in [the] District Court request the supplemental discovery from the lab that tested the drugs under Cole and we filed a request for this on October 13th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">THE COURT: Requesting what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">[DEFENSE]: Request for the copy of the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">THE COURT: Chemical analysis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">[DEFENSE]: Well, not just the chemical analysis, Your Honor, but also the copy of the file, the testing and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">[STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">[DEFENSE]: \u2014we normally receive a summary. It goes through the gas chromatography\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">[DEFENSE]: \u2014spikes and, Your Honor, we still have received\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[STATE]: Sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">[DEFENSE]: \u2014we still haven\u2019t received anything and as of today. And so I raise that with the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">THE COURT: What\u2019s going on with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">[DEFENSE]: \u2014preliminarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">[STATE]: Your Honor, the State was not aware until [Graham\u2019s counsel] called me on Friday to let me know he had not received it. When this prayed, I didn\u2019t have any notes or did not know that they had not received any call and the request was made October 13th. Your Honor, this prayed on December 16th. There was no indication that any of [Graham\u2019s prior counsel before the District Court] indicated they didn\u2019t have Cole or, you know, we did give the LIMS, the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">[STATE]: \u2014normal LIMS.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">THE COURT: Okay. We\u2019ll need to discuss this when the Defendant comes up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">When Graham thereafter arrived in court, the discussion between the court and counsel, regarding Graham\u2019s discovery request, resumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">[DEFENSE]: Your Honor, what I had raised at the bench was that in this case a request for the supplemental discovery under Cole v. Maryland was filed on October the 13th and I have a time stamped copy of that that it was also delivered to the State\u2019s Attorney Office. As of this date today we have not received any of that discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ery. And as I explained at the bench, Your Honor, we do\u2014our office and I does [sic] file these requests routinely at [the] District Court in every drugs case, so it should not have come to a\u2014as a surprise to the State that the request was filed because we do it in every drugs case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">THE COURT: All right. State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">[STATE]: Your\u2014and, Your Honor, the State had indicated that the State at this level was not aware that there was a Cole issue until Friday when [Graham\u2019s counsel] called me. At District the\u2014I believe a Cole request was filed October 13th. However, Your Honor, this matter did pray on December 16th which was two months after. Made no indication to anyone in District that they were missing Cole and so prayed the case anyways, Your Honor. Therefore, the State is more than happy to get this discovery now that we know that the Defense\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t have it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">[STATE]: No, Your Honor. There was never a request made in District apparently and the\u2014I\u2014the State\u2019s not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">THE COURT: Doesn\u2019t matter if it was made in District as long as it was made in Circuit under this case, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">[STATE]: Yes, Your Honor, and the State did not know there was this request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">THE COURT: Hmm. They said it was hand delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">[DEFENSE]: It\u2019s time stamped as being\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">[STATE]: To us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">[DEFENSE]: \u2014delivered in District\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-15\">[STATE]: Oh, in District, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-16\">[DEFENSE]: \u2014in District Court, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-17\">THE COURT: Oh, in [the] District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-18\">[STATE]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-19\">THE COURT: Oh but it\u2019s all one\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-20\">[STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-21\">THE COURT: \u2014one office, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-22\">[STATE]: Yes, Your Honor. The\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>THE COURT: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">[STATE]: \u2014the State\u2019s just letting you know, Your Honor, I was made aware Friday and we\u2019ll be glad to get [Graham\u2019s counsel\u2019s] discovery [request] but the State does not have it in its possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">[DEFENSE]: And, Your Honor, at this juncture I would move to dismiss on those grounds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">THE COURT: Motion to dismiss is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"pAzM\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">In support of its contention that the circuit court erred in dismissing the charges against Graham under Rule 4-262 because of its failure to provide, before his circuit court trial, the information that Graham had previously demanded in his District Court discovery requests, the State first claims that its failure to provide that information was not a discovery violation under Rule 4-262(i). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">To be more precise, the State maintains that the circuit court erred in finding that it had violated Rule 4-262 because section (i) of that rule, which specifically addresses the procedure a trial court must follow to ensure that the parties have complied with their discovery obligations, does not impose a \u201chard deadline\u201d as to when discovery must be provided to the opposing party but merely states that discovery must be completed prior to trial \u201c[t]o the extent practicable.\u201d And, since there was no \u201cevidence in the record that it was practicable for the State to provide the drug testing discovery and that the prosecutor refused to do so,\u201d there was no basis upon which to find, reasons the State, that it had violated Rule 4-262.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Invoking the same section of Rule 4-262, section (i), which provides, as the State noted, that a court may grant a delay or continuance when compliance is impracticable, Graham claims that, in his ease, \u201c[t]here was no evidence or explanation offered by the prosecutor to suggest that it was impracticable for the State to provide the requested discovery prior to ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>calling the case on its trial date\u201d and that, absent such evidence, \u201cthe failure to provide the requested discovery was a discovery violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">As these competing claims of the parties require us to interpret Rule 4\u2014262(i), we note that, when we are asked to render such an interpretation, we employ \u201cthe same well-established canons of construction that we use when interpreting statutes.\u201d <em>Dove v. </em>State, 415 Md. 727, 738, 4 A.3d 976 (2010) (citation omitted). That is, \u201cwe look to [the] plain text\u201d of the rule, and, if \u201cthe words of the rule are plain and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule.\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 264-65, 757 A.2d 796 (2000) (citations omitted). But, if \u201cthe words of the rule are ambiguous,\u201d then we may turn to \u201cother sources to glean the intent of the rule.\u201d <em>Long v. State, </em>343 Md. 662, 667, 684 A.2d 445 (1996) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Specifically, section (i) of Rule 4-262 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">(i) Procedure. To the extent practicable, the discovery and inspection required or permitted by this Rule shall be completed before the hearing or trial, except that asserting a defense pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this Rule shall be made at least 10 days before the trial. If a request was made before the date of the hearing or trial and the request was refused or denied, or pretrial compliance was impracticable, the court may grant a delay or continuance in the hearing or trial to permit the inspection or discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The \u201cplain text\u201d of section (i) of Rule 4-262 clearly does not support the State\u2019s claim that, for a trial court to find a discovery violation, there must be evidence that a prosecutor intentionally refused to comply with a request for discovery or inspection permitted under the rule. Nothing in the plain language of that section, expressly or impliedly, suggests otherwise. In fact, for a discovery violation to occur, it need not even be intentional. <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 422, 440, 785 A.2d 865 (2001) (observing that \u201c[e]ven an unintentional failure to provide discoverable ... information may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>constitute a discovery violation\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 241, 792 A.2d 1178 (2002); <em>accord Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 177, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001) (noting that whether a discovery violation \u201cwas a result of willful aforethought or inadvertence is irrelevant\u201d) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We acknowledge, however, that it is unclear from the language of section (i) of Rule 4-262 whether, as the State claims, a trial court must make a predicate finding that it was \u201cpracticable\u201d for a party to have completed the discovery sought under Rule 4-262 before it may find that the party\u2019s failure to do so was a discovery violation, or whether, as Graham claims, the purpose of section (i) of the rule is merely to clarify that, when it is \u201cimpracticable\u201d for a party to comply with the rule\u2019s requirements prior to trial, the trial court has the discretion to grant a delay or continuance. Consequently, we shall turn to the history of the rule and the minutes of the Rules Committee to assist us in resolving this question. <em>Long, supra, </em>343 Md. at 667, 684 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Prior to 2009, the substance of section (i) of Rule 4-262 was set forth in section (b) of that rule. It read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5d-dedup-0\">The discovery and inspection required or permitted by this Rule shall be completed before the hearing or trial. A request for discovery and inspection and response need not be in writing and need not be filed with the court. If a request was made before the date of the hearing or trial and the request was refused or denied, the court may grant a delay or continuance in the hearing or trial to permit the inspection or discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Then, in 2009, the Criminal Rules Subcommittee presented to the Rules Committee the following changes to section (b) and relabeled it as \u201csection (i)\u201d of Rule 4-262:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">The discovery and inspection required or permitted by this Rule shall be completed before the hearing or trial to the extent practicable. A-request\u25a0 \u25a0 for discovery aneh-mspec-tion and-response- need \u25a0 not be in-writing-and need not be filed with the- court. If a request was made before the date of the hearing or trial and the request was refused or denied, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>pretrial compliance was impracticable, the court may grant a delay or continuance in the hearing or trial to permit the inspection or discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Rules Committee, minutes, p. 75-76 (October 2, 2009) (emphasis and strikethrough text in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The new language, proposed by the Subcommittee, was intended to ensure \u201cthe completion of discovery in a timely fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. Recognizing that, given the \u201cshorter timetable in District Court cases[,]\u201d it might not always be possible to request or provide written discovery prior to a hearing or trial, the amended rule, proposed by the Subcommittee, provided that parties must complete discovery and inspection required or permitted by the rule \u201cbefore the hearing or trial to the extent practicable\u201d and that, if discovery \u201ccannot be completed in a timely fashion, then the [trial] court in its discretion may allow a delay or continuance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The Rules Committee largely adopted the proposal of the Criminal Rules Subcommittee and submitted, as part of its One Hundred Sixty-Third Report to the Court of Appeals, the following draft of Rule 4\u2014262(i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\"><em>To the extent practicable, the </em>discovery and inspection required or permitted by this Rule shall be completed before the hearing or trial. [A request for discovery and inspection and response need not be in writing and need not be filed with the court.] If a request was made before the date of the hearing or trial and the request was refused or denied, <em>or pretrial compliance was impracticable, </em>the court may grant a delay or continuance in the hearing or trial to permit the inspection or discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">37 Md. Reg. 134, 158 (Jan. 29, 2010) (italicized text is new; bracketed text was struck from prior version). Thereafter, the Court of Appeals adopted, effective July 1, 2010, the amended Rule 4-262 \u201cin the form previously published,\u201d that is, as it appeared in the One Hundred Sixty-Third Report of the Rules Committee. 37 Md. Reg. 531 (Mar. 26, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Thus, the language in Rule 4\u2014262(i), upon which the State relies, namely, that it was required to complete the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>discovery specified under other sections of Rule 4-262 before the start of a hearing or trial \u201c[t]o the extent practicable,\u201d was added to the rule because, given the shorter time table for the disposition of cases in the District Court, circumstances might arise where there was insufficient time for a party to request or complete written discovery prior to trial. So it logically follows that, under such circumstances, the burden falls on the party seeking a delay or continuance to explain to the court why it was \u201cimpracticable\u201d to do so. In the absence of such an explanation, or at least manifest circumstances suggesting the impracticability of a pre-trial discovery or inspection, the court has no reason to believe that it was not practicable for the party, from whom discovery was requested, to timely produce the information, documents, or material requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Furthermore, even if the State\u2019s interpretation of Rule 4-262(i) were correct, the court did not err, we believe, in finding a discovery violation. In this case, Graham filed a discovery demand for the drug testing information, in the District Court, on October 13, 2015. More than three months later, on the very date Graham\u2019s trial was scheduled to commence in the circuit court, the State had still not provided the requested discovery. Given the length of time the State was on notice of its obligation to provide the drug testing discovery, the circuit court could reasonably have concluded, and certainly in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that it was practicable for the State to have provided the requested discovery material before the date of Graham\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The State next contends that, in the event of a party\u2019s violation of its discovery obligations under Rule 4-262, the \u201conly remedy available\u201d to the court, under that rule, is to \u201cdisqualify a witness [of the violating party] from testifying.\u201d In support of that claim, the State relies upon Maryland Rule 4-262(n), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(n) Failure to Comply With Discovery Obligation. The failure of a party to comply with a discovery obligation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>this Rule does not automatically disqualify a witness from testifying. If a motion is filed to disqualify the witness\u2019s testimony, disqualification is within the discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The State contrasts Rule 4-262(n) with the broader language of its circuit court counterpart, Rule 4-263(n),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which lists several sanctions that a court may impose upon finding a discovery violation, including the declaration of a mistrial or the entry of \u201cany other order appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d Because Rule 4-262(n) does not mention any other sanction besides disqualification of a witness\u2019s testimony, whereas Rule 4-263(n) expressly authorizes a court to select from a broad range of sanctions, the absence, in Rule 4-262(n), of Rule 4-263(n)\u2019s enumeration of available remedies indicates, according to the State, that a violation of Rule 4-262 may not be penalized with any sanction, other than disqualification of a witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Graham responds that Rule 4-262(n) merely \u201cclarif[ies] that one possible sanction\u2014witness disqualification\u2014is discretionary rather than automatic.\u201d He points out that that section does not \u201cpurport to set forth all available responses and sanctions that a court could impose\u201d and, consequently, absent such a \u201cremedy\u201d provision, the circuit court had the discretion to impose sanctions under Rule l-201(a), which provides that a court, faced with a party\u2019s violation of a mandatory<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>does not prescribe a consequence for its violation, \u201cmay compel compliance with the rule or may determine the consequences of the noncompliance in light of the totality of the circumstances and the purpose of the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Rule 4-262(n) states that, when a party has failed to \u201ccomply with a discovery obligation,\u201d that failure \u201cdoes not automatically disqualify\u201d a witness presented by that party from testifying. But \u201c[i]f a motion is filed to disqualify the witness\u2019s testimony, disqualification is within the discretion of the court.\u201d Although that rule addresses the imposition of a specific discovery sanction, namely, disqualification of a witness\u2019s testimony, it is silent as to whether that sanction is the only one available to the trial court, when a party fails to comply with a Rule 4-262 discovery obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">To resolve this ambiguity, we turn once more to the deliberations of the Rules Committee. In 2007, the Rules Committee proposed the addition of what was then subsection (a)(3) to Rule 4-262, which later became section (n) of Rule 4-262. The Committee\u2019s minutes include the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APj4\">Disqualification is not automatic; a motion to disqualify must be filed first, and then it is within the court\u2019s discretion to allow a continuance, or if there is an egregious violation, the court can do what it believes is appropriate under all the circumstances ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Rules Committee, minutes, p. 53-54 (May 11, 2007) (emphasis added). Thus, the Rules Committee minutes suggest that disqualification of a witness from testifying was a sanction that may only be imposed after a party has filed a motion to disqualify. There is no indication, however, that the new subsection was intended to circumscribe a trial court\u2019s broad discretion in fashioning other appropriate sanctions for discovery violations. In fact, it is stated in the Rules Committee\u2019s minutes that, pursuant to the new subsection, a trial court \u201ccan do what it believes is appropriate under all the circumstances,\u201d in addressing an \u201cegregious\u201d discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Nonetheless, the State claims that the court below lacked the discretion to dismiss the charges, as it is not mentioned as a potential remedy in Rule 4-262 but was included in that rule\u2019s circuit court counterpart, Rule 4-263.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Fortunately, the Rules Committee minutes also addressed this variance. Those minutes state, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">Rule 4-262 varies from the circuit court rule, which goes into a detailed listing of motions to compel and the sanctions that are available. The District Court has a time issue, with a 30-day turnaround between the time of arrest and the time of trial, in some cases. The Rule allows the court to exercise discretion if there is a failure to comply with the Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Rules Committee, minutes, p. 53-54 (May 11, 2007) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Thus, it is clear that, notwithstanding the omission of a list of available sanctions in Rule 4-262(n), it was intended that, under that rule, the trial court may exercise its discretion in choosing the appropriate sanction, in the event a party does not comply with Rule 4-262. Moreover, to conclude otherwise, as the State requests, would lead to an absurd result, as it would render a court powerless to impose any sanction what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>soever, where the violation did not involve the testimony of a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"AUW\">In sum, the Rules Committee minutes indicate that, notwithstanding the language in what is now Rule 4-262(n), a trial court possesses broad discretion, in responding to discovery violations, and that the variance in language between Rules 4-262 and 4-263 was not intended to suggest, in contrast to Rule 4-263(n), that the court has only one sanction available to it under Rule 4-262(n).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AG1\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"AHDd\">Finally, the State claims that the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing the charges against Graham as a discovery sanction because, according to the State, \u201cnone of the four considerations\u201d set forth in <em>Raynor v. State, </em>201 Md.App. 209, 29 A.3d 617 (2011), to guide a trial court, in imposing sanctions, \u201ccounselled] in favor of dismissal.\u201d The <em>Raynor </em>Court instructed that, \u201cin exercising its discretion regarding sanctions for cjiscovery violations, \u2018a trial court should consider: (1) the reasons why the disclosure was not made; (2) the existence and amount of any prejudice to the opposing party; (3) the feasibility of curing any prejudice with a continuance; and (4) any other relevant circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Raynor, </em>201 Md.App. at 228, 29 A.3d 617 (quoting <em>Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 570-71, 919 A.2d 49 (2007)) (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AtVi\">As for the first factor, \u201cthe reasons why the disclosure was not made,\u201d the State clearly failed in its duty to timely disclose the information at issue. On the other hand, there is no dispute that the State\u2019s failure to disclose was inadvertent and was the result, presumably, of poor communications between the District Court and circuit court divisions of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office. Moreover, at no time during the three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>month delay did Graham\u2019s attorney notify the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office that he had not received the information requested, even though he described that information, in his brief, as \u201ccritically important\u201d to his defense; nor did he even use the opportunity provided by his subsequent appearance in the District Court, on the scheduled date of his trial there, to raise that issue. Furthermore, Graham\u2019s counsel waited until the last business day before Graham\u2019s trial, in the circuit court, to inform the State that he had not received this \u201ccritically important\u201d information. And, finally, the State offered to rectify its error by providing the material requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The second factor, \u201cthe existence and amount of any prejudice to the opposing party,\u201d and the third factor, \u201cthe feasibility of curing any prejudice with a continuance,\u201d are interrelated, and we shall examine them together. As for the former, the Court of Appeals has said that, when a criminal discovery rule is violated, \u201ca defendant is prejudiced only when he is unduly surprised and lacks adequate opportunity to prepare a defense, or when the violation substantially influences the jury,\u201d and that \u201cthe prejudice that is contemplated is the harm resulting from the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 574, 919 A.2d 49. While the discovery Graham sought, and which the State failed to provide, was potentially, in his words, \u201ccritically important\u201d to his defense,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the State indicated its willingness to provide that information when Graham raised the issue before the commencement of his trial. Furthermore, Graham does not claim that a continuance to permit the State to transmit that information, and to allow his counsel time to review and evaluate it, would have resulted in any prejudice to the defense at the ensuing trial of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Moreover, although the State did not expressly request a postponement or continuance, it impliedly did so. When that issue was raised, at the outset of Graham\u2019s circuit court trial, the prosecutor assured the circuit court that the State would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>be \u201cmore than happy\u201d to provide the discovery Graham was seeking. But, the circuit court, without inquiring into how quickly the State would be able to provide that information or giving any indication as to why it chose to impose, not the least, but one of the most drastic sanctions at its disposal, did precisely that.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">This action was taken by the court, notwithstanding that the \u201cmost accepted view of discovery sanctions is that in fashioning a sanction, the court should impose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the discovery rules,\u201d <em>Raynor, </em>201 Md.App. at 228, 29 A.3d 617 (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 571, 919 A.2d 49) (citations omitted), which \u201cis to give a defendant the necessary time to prepare a full and adequate defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ross v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 275, 286, 552 A.2d 1345 (1989)). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is well-settled,\u201d the Court of Appeals has declared, \u201cthat the sanction of dismissal should be used sparingly, if at all,\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>395 Md. 240, 261, 909 A.2d 1035 (2006) (citations omitted), because, in the words of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>825 F.2d 314 (11th Cir. 1987), a federal appellate decision upon which our highest Court relied, in addressing the issue, the dismissal of charges \u201cfor prosecutorial misconduct is an extreme sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Moreover, the circuit court made no inquiry into \u201cthe feasibility of curing any prejudice,\u201d the non-disclosure may have caused Graham, by ordering a continuance. <em>Raynor, </em>201 Md.App. at 228, 29 A.3d 617. Given the State\u2019s professed willingness to promptly provide the requested discovery information, and the fact that the deadline, under Maryland Rule 4-271, for bringing the case to trial was nearly five months in the future,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a continuance was apparently a feasible remedy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>would have presumably cured any prejudice Graham suffered as a consequence of the State\u2019s non-disclosure, thereby furthering \u201cthe purpose of the discovery rules,\u201d which \u201cis to give a defendant the necessary time to prepare a full and adequate defense.\u201d <em>Raynor, </em>201 Md.App. at 228, 29 A.3d 617 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Finally, as to the fourth <em>Raynor </em>factor, \u201cany other relevant circumstances,\u201d the circuit court did not identify any other relevant circumstances that it considered in concluding that dismissal was the appropriate remedy for the State\u2019s failure to provide the discovery sought by Graham.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cWhen,\u201d as here, \u201cthe trial court exhibits a clear failure to consider the proper legal standard\u201d in exercising its discretion, it abuses that discretion. <em>Kusi v. State, </em>438 Md. 362, 385, 91 A.3d 1192 (2014) (citations and quotations omitted). Consequently, we hold that the circuit court, although vested with the authority to impose the sanction it did for the State\u2019s discovery violation, abused its discretion in dismissing the charges against Graham. We therefore vacate its judgments and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE GRANTED AS TO PAGES 4 THROUGH 8 OF THE STATE\u2019S APPENDIX.

When a case is transferred from the District Court to the circuit court, pursuant to a jury trial prayer, Rule 4-262, which is the discovery rule generally applicable in criminal actions in the District Court, also governs the action in the circuit courts, unless the jury trial prayer was made in writing and filed at least 15 days before the scheduled date of trial in the District Court, <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-301(b) &amp; (c). Because Graham\u2019s prayer for a jury trial was neither made in writing nor filed at least 15 days before his District Court trial but was orally made on the day of his District Court trial, it is undisputed that Rule 4-262 governed discovery in his case before both the District Court and the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">. Graham filed contemporaneously a \"Request for Discovery\u201d and a \"Supplemental Discovery Demand,\u201d seeking discovery related to the chemical analysis of the drug evidence at issue in this case; the latter set forth Graham\u2019s demand in greater detail, and we quote it in the discussion that follows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">.

In the appendix to its brief, the State included copies of both of Graham\u2019s discovery requests, the \"State's Request for Discovery from Defendant and the State's Disclosure to the Defendant,\u201d and a print-out from the Baltimore City Crime Lab summarizing the drug testing performed in Graham\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Challenging that addition to the State\u2019s appendix, Graham filed, during the pendency of the appeal before this Court, a motion to strike pages 3 through 8 (the latter two documents) of the State's appendix, contending that they were \"not part of the appellate record in this case\u201d and not appendix material permissible under Maryland Rule 8-504(b). Although conceding that the copies of his own discovery requests were likewise not permissible appendix material, Graham did not move to strike them because the parties referred to them during the hearing, which concluded with dismissal of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The State filed a response to that motion, conceding that the material was not permissible appendix material under Rule 8-504(b) and that, in its words, it \"cannot confirm that the [print-out summary from the Baltimore City Crime Lab] was filed in the District Court along with the request and disclosure form.\u201d It therefore did not oppose Graham\u2019s motion to strike pages 3 through 8 of its appendix. The State was, however, able to confirm that the \"State\u2019s Request for Discovery from Defendant and the State's Disclosure to the Defendant,\u201d that is, appendix page 3, had been filed with the District Court on October 29, 2015, and consequently filed an unopposed motion to correct the record by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>adding that document to it, To avoid confusion, we shall grant both Graham\u2019s motion to strike, but only as to pages 4 through 8 of the State\u2019s appendix, and the State\u2019s unopposed motion to correct the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b480-13\">.
