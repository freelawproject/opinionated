As part of that process, Laurel Racing reserved from Anne Arundel County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) the additional water and sewer capacity its new facilities would require. After reviewing the proposed plans, the County\u2019s Office of Planning and Zoning (\u201cOPZ\u201d) approved, in 2008, the allocation Laurel Racing requested, and Laurel Racing never appealed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Reserving water and sewer capacity isn\u2019t free, and when a substantial fee came due in 2013, Laurel Racing challenged the Department of Public Works\u2019s (\u201cDPW\u201d) method of calculating the capacity the project needed, arguing that the long-ago-approved figure had overstated its incremental water and sewer needs by failing to credit the racetrack\u2019s current usage. The parties exchanged data and studies, and DPW sent Laurel Racing a letter on February 25, 2014 offering to reduce the allocation. The question for us is whether this letter was an appealable agency action. It wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In 2006, Laurel Racing submitted to OPZ a Development Application that proposed a wholesale renovation of the racing complex. The application included a sketch plan that included demolition of the existing grandstand and renovations to the site that would reduce the seating capacity for horse racing (which had become less popular) in favor of commercial and retail space and space for the long-awaited arrival of \u201cvideo lottery terminals.\u201d The sketch plan also included a required water and sewer capacity calculation worksheet that concluded that the project would require 1,501 equivalent dwelling units <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>(\u201cEDU\u201d) of new water and sewer capacity. The EDU worksheet outlined future uses only because \u201c[a]t the time of submission, the project engineer was unaware of any County policy or procedure where a developer could seek to offset proposed EDU usage with existing usage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The Anne Arundel County Code (the \u201cAACC\u201d or the \u201cCode\u201d) provides that \u201c[f]or a property that is required to pass the test for adequate public water supply facilities or adequate public sewerage facilities, [DPW] shall make an allocation on the date of approval by [OPZ] for adequacy of public water supply facilities as provided in \u00a7 17-5-202 of this Code.\u201d AACC \u00a7 13-5-402(b) (2005). An allocation, a \u201creservation, for use by a particular property, of available capacity,\u201d AACC \u00a7 13-5-401, is required if, \u201cdue to development activity on the property, the property is required under Article 17 of th[e Code] to pass the test for adequate public water supply facilities or adequate public sewerage facilities; or the property is otherwise connecting to the County water or wastewater system,\u201d AACC \u00a7 13-5-402(a). DPW does not analyze on its own whether a subdivision proposal adds to or displaces existing water and sewer facilities\u2014it relies on the developer\u2019s engineer to determine the project\u2019s impact. In two letters dated November 21, 2008, OPZ approved Laurel Racing\u2019s sketch plan and allocated 1,501 EDUs of water and sewer for the project. Laurel Racing did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Water and sewer capacity are finite resources, and the Code imposes charges on developers to reserve EDUs for future development. \u201cFor property receiving an allocation in conjunction with approval by [OPZ] for adequacy of public water supply facilities ..., the owner of the property shall pay, for each equivalent dwelling unit: (1) an allocation reservation charge ... as computed by [DPW] ...; and (2) [a] capital facility connection charge .... \u201d AACC \u00a7 13-5-403(a). Allocation reservation charges were due immediately, and Laurel Racing paid them. The capital facility connection charge (\u201cCFCC\u201d) and deferral fees did not come due until the fifth anniversary of the allocation, and on November 1, 2013, DPW sent Laurel Racing Allocation Billing Statements due on No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>vember 30\u2014one for water EDUs totaling $19,974,600 and one for sewer EDUs totaling $4,328,640.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Sometime in 2013, though, Laurel Racing had learned that the County had, as the County\u2019s Board of Appeals later put it in a Memorandum Opinion we discuss below, a \u201cpolicy or procedure in effect at the time of the 2006 submission to provide EDU credits for existing facilities. That is, if a use had existing EDUs, the County requires that a developer reserve only the number of additional EDUs that would be required to serve the redevelopment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The then-DPW Director explained to the Board that these credits were meant to ensure \u201cthat an owner doesn\u2019t pay the [facility connection charge] for EDUs that they\u2019ve paid to the County in the past,\u201d and that DPW was responsible for calculating the new EDUs required. Accordingly, Laurel Racing \u201ccontacted the County about the concern that [it] w[as] being\u2014flows were being double counted, and they were not being adequately considered for what existing flows [it] already had in the system, what existing capacity [it] had in the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On December 12, 2013, Laurel Racing\u2019s representatives met with DPW to discuss the possible double-counting. Rather than requiring a new EDU worksheet, the County asked \u201cif [Laurel Racing\u2019s] consultant could come up with a way to analytically compare the existing use, dis-aggregate ... what\u2019s in the grandstand [a mix of retail and commercial space], to an existing use number so that [DPW could] compare it to what\u2019s proposed.\u201d DPW followed up on the meeting in a letter dated December 23, 2013:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">As discussed during the meeting, [DPW] has agreed to give your engineers through January 31, 2014, to provide information regarding existing uses that may have been part of the EDU calculation previously provided. [DPW] will thereafter review the information and make a revised EDU calculation, if appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">If the number of EDUs is revised, the original allocation date will still apply and all associated charges will be due in accordance [with] the County Code based on the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>allocation date of November 21, 2008. Therefore, the [CFCCs] and the capital facility deferral fee for the adjusted number of EDUs will be due no later than April 30, 2014, or the allocation will lapse....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">The County will stay the late interest on the outstanding [CFCCs] until February 28, 2014. This time was determined to be roughly 30 days for the new information to be provided to DPW and 30 days for review and final agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">DPW explained that \u201c[a]s th[e double counting issue] came to [its] attention after 2008, ... [DPW offered credits because it] was trying to reach a reasonable settlement of what the existing capacity in the system associated with Laurel [Racing] was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">On January 29, 2014, Laurel Racing\u2019s engineer sent a letter to DPW detailing its calculations: \u201cthe total existing flow equals 306,100 gallons, or 1,224 EDU\u2019s\u201d and the total proposed flow in accordance with this calculation is 261,030 gallons per day or 1,044 EDU\u2019s.\u201d As such, the engineer concluded that Laurel Racing\u2019s water flow would not increase as a result of the redevelopment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">[W]e suggest that the Laurel [Racing] proposed plan, in fact, will not generate an increase in flow, and therefore not require additional EDU\u2019s to be allocated and thereafter purchased. Had the existing uses been accounted for in the original computation from 2007, we believe this would have come to light, thereby avoiding the need to purchase additional capacity, paying the allocation reservation charges, and saving the owner significant expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In the engineer\u2019s view, the numbers \u201cbasically show[ed] that there already is more capacity vested than what [Laurel Racing] need[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">DPW and OPZ staff reviewed the analysis and found \u201ca lot of inconsistencies with how the comparison was done.\u201d According to DPW staff, Laurel Racing\u2019s EDU number resulted \u201c[f|rom a new proposed scheme development configuration that [it] couldn\u2019t corroborate.\u201d So DPW responded, in a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>from its Director dated February 25, 2014, that the EDU calculations in Laurel Racing\u2019s original application and the 2008 allocation of 1,501 EDUs did not account for Laurel Racing\u2019s <em>current </em>water and sewer usage. The Director acknowledged receipt of Laurel Racing\u2019s engineer\u2019s January 29, 2014 letter, but expressed concern with the calculation of current usage, and concluded that the redevelopment would <em>increase </em>capacity needs by 470 EDUs for water and 954 EDUs for sewer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter noted that although Laurel Racing may have modified the project, \u201cthe recalculated EDUs discussed in this letter can only be based on the proposal that has been approved by [OPZ]. If the project is to be revised again, the proposal would be considered by [OPZ] during the course of the normal review process.\u201d The Director concluded that OPZ would issue a revised allocation letter and that the revised capital facility connection and deferral fees would need to be paid by no later than May 5, 2014 to prevent the allocation from lapsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Laurel Racing received a revised Allocation Billing Statement on March 5, 2014 that reduced the total fees to $12,674,800. The new statement said that interest would be added to payments received after April 20, 2014, and that if the bill remained unpaid after May 5, 2014, the new allocation of 954 units of sewer and 470 units of water would lapse. Around this same time, Laurel Racing filed a Notice of Appeal with the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d) challenging DPW\u2019s calculation of the EDUs required for the project and the resulting charges and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Then, in response to OPZ\u2019s concern that its engineers had submitted the proposed EDU worksheets with its sketch plan \u201cand did not consider any flows/capacity of the existing development at the site,\u201d Laurel Racing sent a letter to OPZ on April 17, 2014 that contained new EDU computations by different engineers. The new calculations included both existing and proposed water and sewer usage, and determined that \u201cthe total existing flow equated to .,. 1,225 EDU\u2019s\u201d and \u201cthe total proposed flow equates to ... 1,044 EDU\u2019s.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Laurel Racing\u2019s engineers also asked OPZ and DPW to \u201cre-evaluate the EDU worksheets for this project and issue a new revised corrected allocation letter\u201d because, they argued, \u201c[biased on [their] analysis ... the proposed Laurel Park project will not generate an increase in flow, and therefore should not have required additional EDU\u2019s to be allocated and subsequently purchased/reserved. Had the existing uses and flows been accounted for in the original Sketch Plan and Allocation approvals in 2007, the track owners would have avoided the need to purchase additional capacity and pay for the reservation charges, saving the track a considerable unnecessary expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The County responded by letter on May 2, The letter acknowledged that OPZ \u201cha[d] reviewed the revised EDU worksheet, but a revised allocation based on that c[ould] not be issued without a formal Pinal Plan being resubmitted.\u201d It did, however, review archived records of Laurel Racing\u2019s actual usage back to 2001 that showed peak daily usage of 1,162 EDUs for water and 674 EDUs for sewer. As such, the County \u201coffer[ed] to revise the allocation set forth in the February 26, 2014 letter to 3S9 EDU\u2019s for water (1501 minus 1162) and 827 EDU\u2019s for sewer (1501 minus 674) based on the archived billing records.\u201d The letter cautioned as well that \u201c[t]his letter does not constitute a final, appealable decision; it is an offer to revise the EDU calculations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The County then moved in July 2014 to dismiss Laurel Racing\u2019s appeal on the grounds that the appeal of the February 25 letter was untimely and that the Board lacked jurisdiction. After \u201cmeet[ing] in closed session to consult with counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to obtain legal advice,\u201d the Board denied the motion, concluding that the February 25 letter constituted a modification of a prior approval. In August 2014, the County submitted a Motion to Reconsider its Motion to Dismiss and the Board denied that motion too.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">After seven evenings of hearings, the Board issued its decision in a Memorandum of Opinion on December 15, 2014. The Board found that the February 25 \u201cletter represented] an approval (albeit not in the full amount) of [Laurel RacingJ\u2019s request for EDU credits and contained] an \u2018operative event\u2019 from which a proper appeal may be noted to this Board,\u201d (citing <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cty., Md., </em>336 Md. 569, 583-84, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)), and thus that the appeal was timely. On the merits, the Board granted Laurel Racing (1) a credit for 1,501 EDUs improperly reserved, (2) a credit of $2,592,839.15 for improperly assessed Allocation Reservation Charges to be applied towards future usage and facility charges at the Laurel Park location, (3) a waiver of all pending Allocation Reservation Charges, (4) a credit for existing capacity of 1,225 EDUs, and (5) a determination that the Laurel Park redevelopment will require only 1,044 EDUs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The County sought judicial review in the circuit court and Laurel Racing cross-appealed. The parties submitted memo-randa and the court held a hearing on May 11, 2015. In an Order and Memorandum Opinion entered on January 8, 2016, the circuit court reversed and remanded to the Board with directions to grant the County\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. The circuit court addressed <em>sua sponte </em>the need for a final administrative order before a party may resort to judicial review, and determined that the February 25 letter was not a final administrative decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">[The February 25 letter wa]s at most a statement of intention that the County will modify and recalculate the EDUs, but only after pending actions such as, a \u201cFinal Plan\u201d was submitted, payments were made by Laurel Racing and an agreement was executed between the parties. The Director of DPW in his February 25, 2014, letter did not grant, deny, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>decide or approve anything. The required plan had not yet been submitted. The Director\u2019s letter simply explained the County\u2019s intention to review and recalculate EDUs per the request of Laurel Racing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Laurel Racing filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Laurel Racing raises the single issue of whether DPW\u2019s February 25, 2014 letter constituted an appealable decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It argues that the February 25 letter was a final approval and modification that left nothing further for OPZ to do beyond a \u201cmerely ministerial\u201d task, and that even if the February 25 letter was not final, it was still appealable as an \u201cinterlocutory administrative decision ha[ving] immediate legal consequences causing irreparable harm.\u201d (quoting <em>Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E. Church, </em>375 Md. 59, 75, 825 A.2d 388 (2003)). Ultimately, though, there is no getting around the fact that the February 25 letter was not a final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">When reviewing appeals from circuit court orders reviewing administrative agency actions, we review the decision of the agency, not the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">When we review the decision of an administrative agency or tribunal, \u201cwe [assume] the same posture as the circuit court ... and limit our review to the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Anderson v.

The circuit court\u2019s decision acts as a lens for review of the agency\u2019s decision, or in other words, \u201cwe look not <em>at </em>the circuit court decision but <em>through </em>it.\u201d Amps. <em>Ret.

Montgomery Cty. Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>315 Md. 390, 395-96, 554 A.2d 1197 (1989) (\u201cAs a general rule, an action for judicial review of an administrative order will lie only if the administrative order is final.\u201d (citing <em>Md.

BG &amp; E Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 459 A.2d 205 (1983))); <em>see also Dorsey, </em>375 Md. at 74-75, 825 A.2d 388 (citing cases regarding judicial review of a final administrative decision). \u201cGenerally, to be final, an administrative order must also \u2018leave nothing further for the agency to do.\u2019\u201d <em>Holiday Spas, </em>315 Md. at 396, 554 A.2d 1197 (quoting <em>BG &amp; E Co., </em>296 Md. at 56, 459 A.2d 205). The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>found that the February 25 letter from DPW to Laurel Racing qualified as an appealable decision of approval and that the resulting appeal was timely. The circuit court disagreed, and Laurel Racing argues <em>first </em>that the court erred by failing to recognize DPW\u2019s February 25 letter as an \u201capproval\u201d and \u201cmodification\u201d of OPZ\u2019s original allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">With all of the focus on the more recent administrative process, it can be easy to lose sight of the project\u2019s history. The starting point isn\u2019t the current dispute, but rather is the existing allocation, which was approved when OPZ approved Laurel Racing\u2019s sketch plan in 2008. Importantly, OPZ, not DPW, is the deciding agency: \u201c[f]or a property that is required to pass the test for adequate public water supply facilities or adequate public sewerage facilities, <em>[DPW] shall make an allocation on the date of approval by [OPZ] </em>for adequacy of public facilities as provided in \u00a7 17-5-202 of this Code.\u201d AACC \u00a7 13-5-402(b) (emphasis added). Although the DPW Director determines a property\u2019s EDU calculation, that calculation is not official until <em>OPZ </em>sends a letter approving the property\u2019s \u201cinitial application for approval of a sketch plan or preliminary plan, or during review of the application for final plan or site development plan approval.\u201d AACC \u00a7 17\u20145\u2014 202(a); <em>see also </em>AACC \u00a7 13-5-804(a) (\u201c[Wjhenever a charge is set based on [EDUs], the property owner shall provide all information required by the Director [of DPW] and the Director shall reasonably determine, based on that information and any other information that the Director deems appropriate, the number of [EDUs] for a property based on peak daily usage.\u201d); \u00a7 17-5-202(b) (\u201cApproval for adequacy of public facilities ... occurs on the date of a letter from [OPZ] approving a sketch plan.\u201d). Put another way, the ultimate decision is embodied in OPZ\u2019s approval of the sketch plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Laurel Racing did not appeal any element of the approved sketch plan. The <em>status quo, </em>then, is that five years after approval, November 1, 2013, Laurel Racing owed the balance of the deferred allocation fee, <em>ie., </em>$24,303,240, if it wished to maintain the allocation. Since that allocation became final long ago, Laurel Racing needs to effect a <em>post hoc </em>modification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that long-sinee-final decision in order to reduce the amount it owes or otherwise to maintain the allocation without making the full payment. The question for us is whether anything that has happened to date modified the <em>status quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">And to this point, there is no superseding decision from DPW. Laurel Racing argues <em>first, </em>though, that the February 25 letter constituted an \u201capproval\u201d and \u201cmodification\u201d of OPZ\u2019s original allocation. That letter stated the number of EDUs that \u201cthe project should have been allocated,\u201d that \u201c[a]t this point, however, the recalculated EDUs discussed in this letter can only be based on the proposal that has been approved by [OPZ],\u201d and that \u201c[OPZ] <em>will issue </em>a revised allocation letter setting forth the change in EDU calculations as described in this letter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But putting aside the fact that the letter merely states an intention to act, only OPZ, the body that approved the development in the first instance, can modify its earlier decision. DPW\u2019s revised allocation numbers might well ripen into the new allocation once OPZ approves a new final sketch plan. But that hasn\u2019t happened, and DPW\u2019s calculation is not embodied in an appeal-able agency decision until OPZ approves the final sketch plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The process here is distinguishable from a confirmatory statement, like the one in <em>United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>336 Md. at 584, 650 A.2d 226, or a reconsideration, like that in <em>National Institutes of Health Federal Credit Union v. Hawk, 47 </em>Md.App. 189, 196, 422 A.2d 55 (1980). In <em>United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>the Court of Appeals held that a confirmatory statement regarding a license or permit that was issued in the past was not an appealable event, and that the appealable event is \u201cthe issuance, renewal, revocation, etc. of the license or permit.\u201d 336 Md. at 584, 650 A.2d 226. Similarly, in <em>Hawk, </em>we held that \u201can administrative decision concerning reconsideration of zoning is not an appealable final order.\u201d 47 Md.App. at 196, 422 A.2d 55. In <em>Montgomery County v. Longo, </em>in which a decision \u201cbased on new factual information presented and submission of a revised building permit application\u201d was \u201cnot merely a reaffirmation of the prior issuance of a building permit,\u201d and thus was appealable. 187 Md.App. 25, 54-55, 975 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>A.2d 312 (2009). But again, there\u2019s a step missing here: the actual decision by OPZ to modify Laurel Racing\u2019s sketch plan with a new EDU allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">And that step awaits submission by Laurel Racing of a revised sketch plan. <em>See </em>AACC \u00a7 17-3-303 (stating the need for an applicant to submit a new application for sketch plan approval after receiving a report from OPZ providing the \u201cfindings, comments, and recommendations of the County through its reviewing agencies\u201d). According to the Board, a final sketch plan had not been approved as of December 2014, and Laurel Racing\u2019s most recent submission was made in May 2014. The February 25 letter from DPW is not an administrative action that \u201cleave[s] nothing further for the agency to do.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>375 Md. at 75, 825 A.2d 388 (quoting <em>BG &amp; E Co., </em>296 Md. at 56, 459 A.2d 205). By its own terms, the letter details additional steps required by the AACC, and we agree with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that there was no appealable agency action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Laurel Racing argues <em>next </em>that even if we determine that the February 25 letter was not final, as we have, it was appealable under an exception to the finality requirement in which \u201cparties need not \u2018await a final administrative decision before resorting to the courts\u2019 if the \u2018interlocutory administrative decision has immediate legal consequences causing irreparable harm.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>375 Md. at 75, 825 A.2d 388). We see no such irreparable harm here.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">It\u2019s true that an order may be deemed final if it inflicts \u201csufficient irreparable injury\u201d by affecting a party\u2019s business in ways that could not be remedied at a later date. <em>Holiday </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Spas, </em>315 Md. at 399, 554 A.2d 1197. Laurel Racing conflates its efforts to reduce its EDU obligation with circumstances that led the Laurel Park property to be advertised for a tax sale,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but even if money owed in error qualified as irreparable harm, these developments are only indirectly related. The tax sale proceeding flowed from Laurel Racing\u2019s failure to pay the deferred allocation fees due on anniversary of the allocation. The amount due had been determined in 2008 and was never appealed, and Laurel Racing didn\u2019t attempt to reduce the EDU allocation until after the fees came due. Had Laurel Racing paid the amount due, it would have received a credit for any amount it paid above any revised amount. And as we have already determined, Laurel Racing has not established, in the administrative arena or here, any right to relief from the original allocation fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\">. In calculating these numbers, the Director used \u201cthe proposed EDUs [of] 1,501 because ... that\u2019s what matched the sketched plan submittal that [DPW] had received at the time\u201d and the highest actual peaked usage numbers because \"it\u2019s more representative that [Laurel Racing] could have a peak use time .... It is high, but I thought it was representative of their usage in the system.\u201d Between 2009 and 2013, the highest water systems reading was 1,031 EDUs and the highest sewer system reading was 547 EDU. The incremental EDUs needed for the new project should equal the proposed 1,501 EDUs minus the highest actual usage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">. Laurel Racing phrased its sole Question Presented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">Did the Circuit Court err in holding that a County decision revising Laurel Racing's water and sewer allotment, and assessing almost $12 million in fees on Laurel Racing to be paid on a date certain, was not final or otherwise appealable\u2014even though the County attempted to collect the fees by selling Laurel Racing\u2019s property at a tax sale, and the Circuit Court itself enjoined that sale so that Laurel Racing could appeal the decision?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. For that reason, we need not consider the timeliness of Laurel Racing\u2019s appeal, which is governed by Rule 2-101 (a) in Appendix B of the Code (\"All appeals from orders or decisions from which an appeal is authorized by law shall be taken within 30 days of the date of such order or decision, except where a different period is proscribed by law or rule, by the filing of a notice of appeal with the County Board of Appeals.\u201d). Whether or not the appeal was timely, the Board should have granted the County\u2019s Motion to Dismiss because the letter appealed here was not a final appealable decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-5\">. <em>See </em>AACC \u00a7 1-9-101 (\"When an owner of property is responsible to the County for the payment of money, the amount shall be levied, collected, and enforced in the same manner as County real property taxes and have the same priority rights, bear the same interest and penalties, constitute a lien on the real property so assessed, and be treated the same as County real property taxes.\u201d). The County initiated the process of selling the property at a tax sale while the Board was conducting hearings. Laurel Racing brought an emergency action in the circuit court for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\u201d) to stop the tax sale. At the TRO hearing, the circuit court dismissed all defendants except the County, granted Laurel Racing\u2019s TRO, and stayed the tax sale because it found that \"immediate and irrepairable [sic] harm will occur.\u201d This immediate and irreparable harm, however, is separate from the calculation of EDUs at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
