But, the petition for rehearing filed in cause No. 90-4505 to vacate the imposition of sanctions against Mr. LaBrec is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">To justify imposition of sanctions against Mr. LaBrec for seeking attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party, the district court would have had to find that Mr. LaBrec knew or reasonably should have known at the time he filed Longview\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees that the plaintiff\u2019s suit was not frivolous or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">On reflection, we are persuaded that reasonable minds could differ about whether plaintiff\u2019s employment discrimination claim was frivolous. Although the district court found that racial bias and retaliation for First Amendment free speech played some role in plaintiff\u2019s nonrenewal, the evidence of her incompetence was overwhelming. We therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions on defendant\u2019s counsel, David J. LaBrec, for seeking attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order imposing Rule 11 sanctions on Mr. LaBrec is</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
