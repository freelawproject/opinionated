SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b469-25\">Defendant Vijay Parekh stands convicted for his role in the improper efforts of a savings and loan association\u2019s officials to meet minimum net worth requirements imposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). He asserts that insufficient evidence supports his convictions and that the prosecutor\u2019s purportedly improper comments mandate a new trial. Rejecting both of these claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-27\">In 1985, Lamar Savings Association (Lamar), a financial institution insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>poration, found it increasingly difficult to meet the minimum net worth requirements imposed by the FHLBB. As more of its borrowers failed to make loan payments, Lamar foreclosed on numerous real estate properties. When a financial institution such as Lamar repossesses such properties (labeled \u201cREO,\u201d for \u201creal estate owned\u201d), the net worth requirement for that institution increases. The FHLBB requires an institution to increase its net worth by twenty per cent of the value of each REO on the books.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Lamar had extended a loan to Roy Moran, enabling him to construct Remington House Apartments (Remington House) in Austin. When Moran failed to make payments on his indebtedness, Lamar foreclosed, thereby increasing its net worth requirement. Because Lamar was already experiencing difficulties in meeting the FHLBB\u2019s mandates, it sought to sell Remington House and other REO properties in order to avoid regulatory intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">At this time, Parekh owned Excel Properties but had worked for Lamar from 1976 to 1981, rising to the title of vice-president. He and Stanley Adams, the principal owner and chairman of Lamar, had been acquainted since college in the 1950\u2019s. There is evidence in the record that Parekh indicated that he would \u201cjust do anything to help Stanley Adams out as far as purchasing other REO property that [Lamar] had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Apparently acting on this inclination, Pa-rekh and two others offered to buy Remington House from Lamar. Under their proposal, they would have assumed some personal liability for the loan. Lamar never responded to this offer. However, Reuben Coleman, another Lamar senior official, later contacted Parekh and asked him whether he wanted to own Remington House. Coleman instructed Parekh to fly to Houston the next day for the closing. Parekh knew neither the purchase price of the property nor the amount of the loan as he left for Houston; he found out the terms of the agreement at the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Under those terms, Parekh had no personal obligation to repay the loan. According to the testimony of Merrick Leler, another former Lamar employee, Coleman calculated the sales price in such a way as to avoid a loss to Lamar (which would reduce its net worth). Lamar officials credited Lamar with a one-percent origination fee for the Remington House loan transaction, further increasing its net worth. Instead of recording this amount as a deferred gain, Lamar backdated it as a current gain for the third quarter of 1985. At the closing, Phoenix Venture Group, another of Parekh\u2019s companies, received a $78,750 payment. After initially asserting that that payment related to another debt, Parekh eventually admitted that the sum was an inducement to entering into the Remington House transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Parekh managed the Remington House property for less than a year. Remington House employees testified that Lamar did not participate in the daily operations of the property and that Parekh actively managed the complex. However, record evidence indicates that the accounting system in place was extremely poor. Furthermore, other witnesses contradicted the Remington House employees\u2019 testimony. When a large amount of interest came due on the loan, Parekh relinquished title to Remington House. Lamar negotiated directly with the buyer, Mounzer Hourani, without Parekh\u2019s participation. Coleman instructed Parekh to travel to Houston for the closing. Parekh did not know the identity of the buyer until he arrived. He received $331,000 from Remington House funds before relinquishing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Faced with the possibility of regulatory intervention, Lamar took other steps to reduce its net worth requirement. More specifically, it made similar arrangements with Sid Terry temporarily to hold title to two other real estate properties, Stone Creek Apartments and Parklane Apartments. Parekh apparently concedes that these agreements were shams designed to get REO property off of Lamar\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">A grand jury issued a four-count indictment accusing Parekh of a variety of offenses for his involvement in Lamar\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>scheme to reduce artificially its net worth requirement. Count one charged Parekh with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, alleging that Parekh and others conspired (1) to misapply the funds of a savings and loan association in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 657; (2) to make false entries into the records of a savings and loan in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006; and (3) to make false statements to the FHLBB in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Counts two, three, and four accused Parekh of aiding and abetting others in their violations of the same three statutory provisions, respectively, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. A jury convicted Parekh on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Parekh alleges that the evidence does not sufficiently support either the conspiracy or aiding and abetting convictions. A defendant seeking reversal of his convictions on sufficiency of the evidence grounds faces an imposing standard of review: \u201c[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction must be ... to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (footnote omitted). The Court continued, \u201c[T]his inquiry does not require a court to \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2788-89 (quoting <em>Woodby v. INS, </em>385 U.S. 276, 282, 87 S.Ct. 483, 486, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966) (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could have found Parekh guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The indictment charged Parekh with conspiring<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with others to (1) misapply Lamar\u2019s funds<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (2) make false entries in Lamar\u2019s records<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; and (3) make false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>statements to the FHLBB.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To establish that Parekh is guilty of conspiracy, the government was required to prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201c(1) that two or more people agreed to pursue an unlawful objective together; (2)that the defendant voluntarily agreed to join the conspiracy; and (3) that one of the members of the conspiracy performed an overt act to further the objectives of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Tullos, </em>868 F.2d 689, 693 (6th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>810 F.2d 474, 476-77 (5th Cir.1987)), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1112, 109 S.Ct. 3171, 104 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The indictment also charged Parekh with aiding and abetting the commission of the three offenses listed above.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To convict a defendant for aiding and abetting the commission of a crime, the government must prove that the defendant \u201c \u2018associated with a criminal venture, participated in the venture, and sought by his action to make the venture succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Manotas-Mejia, </em>824 F.2d 360, 367 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Holcomb, </em>797 F.2d 1320, 1328 (5th Cir.1986)), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 957, 108 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed.2d 379 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Parekh correctly observes that the propriety of these convictions depends upon whether there was evidence sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude that Lamar\u2019s loan to him was a \u201csham.\u201d We conclude that the government did present sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Parekh\u2019s utter lack of knowledge of the terms of either the initial sale to him of Remington House or the subsequent sale to Hourani provided the jury a basis for determining that the sale and accompanying loan were designed for the sole purpose of artificially reducing Lamar\u2019s net worth requirements. Parekh\u2019s stated desire to help Adams remove REO property from Lamar\u2019s books adds credence to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Lamar officials\u2019 references to their arrangement with Parekh as a \u201ctemporary deal\u201d or \u201ctemporary fix\u201d further supports an inference that the loan was a sham, as does Parekh\u2019s statement to Charles Chea-ney (one of Hourani\u2019s employees) that Pa-rekh was merely a \u201ccaretaker\u201d for Remington House. Phoenix Venture Group\u2019s receipt of $78,750 at the first closing also constitutes evidence that the loan to Pa-rekh was less than legitimate; Parekh\u2019s contradictory statements concerning the money he received corroborates that inference. Lamar\u2019s similar treatment of the Stone Creek and Parklane properties provided the jury with an additional foundation for its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">Evidence tending to show that the loan was legitimate is insufficient to require a reversal. Under the governing standard of review, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). More specifically, the fact that Parekh may have participated actively in the management of Remington House does not render unreasonable the jury\u2019s conclusion that the loan nonetheless was a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">Citing <em>United States v. Gens, </em>493 F.2d 216 (1st Cir.1974), Parekh further argues that the fact that he had the financial ability to repay the loan is conclusive proof that the loan was not a sham. <em>Gens </em>does not support this proposition. In discussing the meaning of the term \u201cmisapplication,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>court identified three types of cases in which a third party, rather than the named debtor, is responsible for the debt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After listing those three, the court concluded, \u201c[i]n the three situations described above, the loans formally being made could be characterized as \u2018sham\u2019 or \u2018dummy\u2019 loans, because there was little likelihood or expectation that the named debtor would repay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Parekh incorrectly derives from this language the proposition that because he possessed the financial ability to repay the loan, the loan was not a sham. The <em>Gens </em>court does not speak solely in terms of financial ability to repay the loan; it instead focuses upon the \u201clikelihood or expectation\u201d that the debtor would repay the loan. A debtor\u2019s inability to repay the loan constitutes <em>one </em>of the reasons he might not be expected to repay. If it were the <em>sole </em>reason, as Parekh seems to contend, then his corollary inference that his financial ability to repay rendered the loan legitimate would be correct. However, it is not the sole reason: Under the <em>Gens </em>articulation, a loan is a sham if \u201cthere was little likelihood or expectation that the named debtor would repay.\u201d That conclusion accurately describes the instant case: The evidence plainly indicates that no one expected Parekh to make payments on the Remington House loan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Parekh also asserts that \u201c[t]he Government has wholly failed to show an intent to injure or defraud Lamar Savings, necessary for a 18 U.S.C. Section 656 [sic] conviction.\u201d Parekh correctly states that an intent to injure or defraud the institution is an element of the section 657 crime. <em>See United States v. Stovall, </em>825 F.2d 817, 823 (5th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>833 F.2d 526 (5th Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">However, insofar as Parekh suggests that the government was required to show that Parekh himself intended to injure or defraud Lamar, he is incorrect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The indictment charged him with aiding and abetting misapplication, not with misapplication itself. To prove up accomplice liability, the government needed only to demonstrate that the defendant \u201c \u2018associated with a criminal venture, participated in the venture, and sought by his action to make the venture succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>ManotasMejia, </em>824 F.2d at 367 (quoting <em>Holcomb, </em>797 F.2d at 1328); <em>see also </em>W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 6.7, at 576 (2d ed. 1986).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">At the same time, the government is not relieved of its obligation to provide suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>cient evidence of .the principal\u2019s guilt. <em>United States v. Blankenship, </em>746 F.2d 233, 240 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>Smith v. Estelle, </em>569 F.2d 944, 945 (5th Cir.1978); W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.8(c), at 592 (\u201cthe guilt of the principal must be established at the trial of the accomplice as a part of the proof on the charge against the accomplice\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The critical question, then, is whether the government presented enough evidence from which a rational jury could infer that a principal intended to injure or defraud Lamar in making the sham loan to Parekh.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>916 F.2d 207 (5th Cir.1990), we held that \u201c[s]uch intent \u2018is proven by showing a knowing, voluntary act by the defendant, the natural tendency of which may have been to injure the bank even though such may not have been his motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215 (quoting <em>United States v. Southers, </em>583 F.2d 1302, 1305 (5th Cir.1978)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the sham loan to Parekh would naturally tend to injure Lamar and thus that the government provided enough evidence of a principal\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">First, exposing Lamar and its officials to potential governmental sanction for the circumvention of regulatory requirements is in itself a harm. Second, the regulatory requirements are designed to promote the healthy operation of a financial institution; avoidance of these regulations accordingly poses a potential harm to it. Third, utilization of funds for the sham loan prevented their use for profitable lending. <em>See Hopkins, </em>916 F.2d at 215 (\u201cthe misapplication of funds reduced the amount of money available for lawful investment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In short, we reject Parekh\u2019s attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence. First, the propriety of the convictions rests primarily upon the legitimacy of the Remington House loan, and we conclude that there was enough evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that the loan was a sham. Second, Parekh\u2019s alleged financial ability to repay the loan does not preclude a finding of guilt. Third, the government provided sufficient evidence of the principal\u2019s state of mind, thus allowing conviction of the accomplice, Parekh.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">During his closing argument, the prosecutor, recalling the presence of Stanley Adams\u2019s lawyer in the courtroom, suggested that \u201cthe conspiracy continues right up to this day.\u201d Parekh did not object to this comment at the time but now asserts that it is plain error meriting reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">As we said in <em>United States v. Iredia, </em>866 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3250, 106 L.Ed.2d 596 (1989), \u201c[t]he determinative question is whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117 (citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>839 F.2d 1041, 1049 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1024, 108 S.Ct. 1999, 100 L.Ed.2d 230 (1988)). Assuming, without deciding, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, we cannot say that such remarks \u201ccast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Another test of whether an error is plain centers upon whether a cautionary instruction could have cured it. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>831 F.2d 63, 66 (5th Cir.1987). In the instant case, Parekh\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>sel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comment, and thus the court did not have an opportunity to render a curative instruction. However, the court did instruct the jury that comments of the lawyers during closing argument are not evidence. We have held that this particular instruction can cure certain prejudicial statements that might be made during closing argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Livingston, </em>816 F.2d 184, 196 (5th Cir.1987). As the allegedly improper comment in this case is just such a statement, we will not order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\">. In his brief, Parekh offers a slightly different articulation of the standard of review, stating that \"[t]he Court of Appeals should reverse a conviction based on factual insufficiency of the evidence only if a reasonably minded jury necessarily must have entertained a reasonable doubt of the Defendant\u2019s guilt\" (citing <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983)); <em>United States v. Vergara, </em>687 F.2d 57, 60 (5th Cir.1982). There is no substantive difference between these two articulations of the standard of review. The phrasing quoted in the text implies that the conviction should be affirmed even if <em>some </em>rational triers of fact might not have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, it is not necessary that <em>all </em>rational triers of fact would have found the elements of the offense. The <em>Vergara </em>phrasing implies that we reverse a conviction only if <em>all </em>reasonably minded juries would not have found all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ver-gara </em>does not stand for the proposition that we must reverse if <em>any </em>reasonable trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Vergara </em>presents simply a different way of saying the same thing, i.e., that we will affirm a conviction if a rational trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">.

By differentiating between the respective requisite intents of the accomplice and the principal, we do not mean to undermine those cases stating that the accomplice must \"share[ ] in the criminal intent of the principal.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Colwell, </em>764 F.2d 1070, 1072 (5th Cir.1985) (\"shared in the criminal intent of the principal\u201d); <em>United States v.

Those cases are simply different articulations of the usual requirement that the defendant \u201c 'associated with a criminal venture ... and sought by his action to make the venture succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manotas-Mejia, </em>824 F.2d at 367 (citation omitted). They do not compel us to conclude that the government needed to prove that Parekh intended to injure or defraud Lamar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b473-15\">.For these reasons, Parekh\u2019s complaint on appeal that he did not \"participate] ] in any meetings where \u2018getting the REO\u2019s off the books\u2019 was discussed, where officials of Lamar discussed \u2018temporary fixes,\u2019 or where the rebooking of the deferred gain to current gain was discussed\u201d is to no avail.
