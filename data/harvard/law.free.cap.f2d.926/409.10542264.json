The district court sentenced him, under the law as it existed prior to the Sentencing Guidelines, to twenty-four months imprisonment, and ordered him to make restitution in the amount of $52,-782.91, plus four percent interest per an-num, pursuant to the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA). Aguirre challenges the restitution order on five separate grounds. None of Aguirre\u2019s arguments need be considered, however, for the Government confesses error on a fundamental issue that Aguirre does not raise: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the district court lacked the authority in this case to order restitution under the VWPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We accept the Government\u2019s confession of error. The VWPA authorizes the district court to order restitution only when \u201csentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under this title [Title 18]\u201d or under certain sections of Title 49.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It does not authorize the district court to order a defendant convicted and sentenced solely under Title 12 to make restitution, and Title 12 does not itself prescribe restitution as a criminal sanction. There being no other basis in the record for invoking the district court\u2019s power under the Act, the order of restitution against Aguirre cannot stand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">There remains the question of the appropriate disposition of this case. We have in the past, in a case not dissimilar to this one, simply vacated the order of restitution and allowed the remainder of the defendant\u2019s sentence to stand undisturbed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, however, the restitution order was imposed by the district court after the original sentencing proceedings, and played no part in formulating the original sentencing package.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In contrast, the district court in this case chose not to fine Aguirre specifically because of \u201cthe large amount of restitution\u201d ordered, and \u201cthe defendant\u2019s inability to pay.\u201d To vacate the restitution order and allow the remainder of the sentence to stand might undermine the deterrent and punitive effect that the original, albeit illegal, sentence was intended to achieve. The proper remedy, therefore, is to vacate the entire sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The sentence imposed by the district court is therefore VACATED and the case REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3579 (1988) (renumbered \u00a7 3663).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\">. <em>United States v.
