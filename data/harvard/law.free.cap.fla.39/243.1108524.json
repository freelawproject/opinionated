The chancellor granted leave to file a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, and thereupon appellee filed a bill containing the following allegations, <em>viz: </em>\u201cComplaining showeth unto .your honor, your orator the Florida Central &amp; Peninsular Railroad Company, a' corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">That on or about the 2d day of November, A. L.. 1892, your orator exhibited its original bill of complaint in this honorable court against William D. Bloxham as Comptroller of Florida and John A.. Pearce as Sheriff of Leon County aforesaid, the defendants hereinafter named as defendants thereto, thereby to have it decreed that the exemption from taxation-under the 18th section of the Internal Improvement Act was a continuing exemption for thirty-five years-after the completion of the several lines of railroad constructed on the routes in said act designated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that said exemption attached to the <em>rem </em>following the the property into the hands of this complainant; (2) to have a decree for the recovery by the complainant, as successor to the rights therein of the Florida Railway and Navigation Company of .$'140,812.47 paid by said last named company in 1885 for taxes of 18S2, 1883 and 1884 to the State of Florida, alleged to have been illegally assessed and to have been paid under duress and upon protest, and (3) to enjoin the collection by these defendants of taxes assessed in 1885 against property now owned by the complainant for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881 which were sought tobe collected under the provisions of the statutes, Chapters 3558 and 4073 laws of Florida.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">That in said bill of complaint it was stated that your orator became possessed of the railway property upon which has been assessed the tax complained of on the 1st day of May, 1889, and that your orator was then organized as a corporation for the purposes of operating and owning such railroad, by William Bayard Cutting and associates, who had been owners and holders of certain bonds and other evidences of indebtedness of the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, a company that before and until then owned and operated such lines of railway and that being such creditors of said company, and having no other interest therein, than as such creditors, they had been obliged to buy the railroads aforesaid at a jucficial sale made and had in the enforcement of the liens for the security of such bonded indebtedness. That the said Florida Railway and Navigation Company, was a corporation under the laws of Florida created by the consolidation of certain separate lines of the railways here involved, towit: of the Florida Central and West<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>ern Railroad and the Transit and Peninsul\u00e1r Railroad and other companies, the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad Company and the Leesburg and Indian River Railroad Company, on the 29th day of February, A. D. 1884, and that such consolidation was made by radical changes in the holdings of the capital stock of said company, and with the result that more than one-half in value of the holdings in such Florida Railway and Navigation Company was by the acquirement of the interest of new holders therein not before interested in the one and the other of said constituent companies. That the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company was a corporation under the Laws of Florida, organized thereunder by Edward J. Reed and his associates, who by deed from the said Reed became invested with the property in that line of such railroad as lies between Jacksonville and Chattahoochee river, which said last named line of railroad in said bill was alleged to have been sold under decrees of foreclosure under the lien of the statutory mortgage created by chapter 1716 of the laws of Florida to the said Edward J. Reed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">And it was further stated in said bill that the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad Company was created as a corporation under the laws of Florida by the consolidation on the 22d day of December, A. D. 1882, of certain railroad corporations under the laws of Florida, to-wit: The Atlantic, Gfulf and West India Transit Company, the Peninsular Railroad Company and the Tropical Florida Railroad Company. That before these several consolidations each of the afore named constituent railroad companies were entirely independent corporations, each with their separate organizations and capital stock and owners of sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>rate and distinct parts of said line of railroad, viz: The Florida Central and Western Company of the line from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee and branches to Monticello and St. Marks, with its distinct debts and liabilities as stated in said original bill; the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad Company of the lines from Fernandina to Cedar Keys, and the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad Company, with its line from Hart\u2019s Road to Jacksonville, both of which had also their separate and distinct bonded indebtedness and liabilities, as also set forth in said bill, and the Leesburg and Indian River Company, with its line from Wildwood to Leesburg; and the effect of the consolidations, as to the changes in interest and ownership, was in each case as hereinbefore stated. The said original bill also charged that the name of the West India Transit Railroad Company was formed by certain parties who purchased the same at a sale made by a master under a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States, but at the time of said sale was not stated in said bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">That the defendants were duly served with process in said original cause, and made answer thereto in the nature of plea, demurrer and answer, admitting the statutory exemption, but contending that the same did not exist in favor of your orators, or of the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, but that such was for the benefit only of the company constructing the particular part of railroad on the above indicated routes; that for like reason complainant was not entitled to recover the money paid on account of the taxes for the years 1882, 1883 and 1884, and to the effect that notwithstanding the changes of ownership of the taxed property between the years of 1879, 1880 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>1881 for the taxes on which it was assessed and the 18th day of October, 1885, when it was actually and for the first time assessed or attempted to be collected, that it was lawful and proper to levy the tax as it was done on the property for such years notwithstanding the changes of ownership. Replication was filed, and before further proceedings the case was heard before your honor in November, 1893, on application for injunction <em>pendente lite. </em>At this hearing no contention was made by the defendants that the company that was assessed in 1885 was the owner of the property, or had any interest therein in the years 1879, 1880 or 1881, or either of them, but the issue was fully and unequivocally made that it was competent to tax the property for the taxed years in the hands of strangers in the years when assessed. And upon these issues it was stipulated that the decree to be made should be a. final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">Later, and in said month of November, it was decreed that the complainant was not entitled to the exemption from taxation as claimed and was not entitled to the return of the money paid for taxes and enjoined the collection by the defendants of the taxes assessed for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">The parties each appealed from the decree of this honorable court, the defendants here, there assigning as error the decree of this honorable court as last above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">That afterwards and on the 19th day of March 1895 the Honorable Supreme Court of Florida passed its judgment on said appeal, and affirmed the decree of this court on the two first propositions in said decree- and on the thii\u2019d pi\u2019oposition thex\u2019eof affirmed it in part and revex\u2019sed, ixx part, deciding in effect that while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>State did not have the power to follow this property for the taxes of 1879, 1880 and 1881 by assessment in 18So if it had in the interval gone into the hands of innocent purchasers for value, the Florida Railway and Navigation Company was found not to be such innocent purchasers, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">And your orator further showeth by way of supplement, that it has since discovered, and the fact is that the line of railroad between Lake City and Chattahoochee River was wholly owned by a railroad corporation known as the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad Company during the entire years of 1879,, 1880 and 1881, and until the first day of January, A. D. 1882. That it was wholly in the possession of said last named company, or in that of receivers appointed by the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Florida in suits for the enforcements of liens to secure the payments ofv the bonds of the State of Florida, issued under chapter 1716, laws of Florida, and that while it is true that there was a sale of said line of railroad under a decree in said cause made in September, 1879, it is not true as alleged in said bill that the said E. J. Reed was the purchaser but the-purchasers were Henry R. Jackson, Charles H. Simon-ton and Adolph Engler. And it is not true that Reed or these purchasers went into the possession of said line of railroad at that time, but the facts are, as your orator has lately discovered, that there was an appeal from the decree in said cause to the Supreme Court of the United States, and supersedeas thereunder, and although there was confirmation of said decree by the Supreme Court of the United States at the term thereof in 1880-1881, the aforesaid sale was not confirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>until after the first day of September, A. D. 1881, and the purchasers at such sale never perfected their purchase, and never paid the purchase price, and never received any deeds to the property, and were never admitted into the possession of said property, nor to the receipt of its revenues, and never had any ownership therein until after the date of said confirmation and on or after, to-wit: The first day of January, A. I). 1882. and that as to the line of railroad between Lake City and Jacksonville the same was held, owned and operated by a company known as the Florida -Central Railroad Company during all the years of 1879, 1880 and 1881, and the Edward J. Reed who bought the said line at judicial sale under the decree in like enforcement of said statutory liens at a sale made on January 6, 1882, -was himself and his associates an entire stranger to said property always until on or about the 20th day of December, A. D. 1881, when he purchased from E. M. L\u2019Engle and others a majority of the capital stock of said Florida Central Railroad Company, and that never until after the expiration of the year 1881 was the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company or any of its organizers or promoters in ownership, possession or control of the said line of railroad from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee River or of any part of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">And your orator further says that there was not in 1885 any one a <em>bona fide </em>holder of stock in the Florida Railway and Navigation Company who was directly or indirectly a stockholder of any company which owned during any part of the years 1879, 1880 or 1881 either of the lines of railroad which was taxed as here complained of, but that such company and holders of stock thereon, to-wit: in the Florida Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Avay and Navigation Company, Avere parties who purchased the same for value, innocent of any knowledge of any claim for the taxes of this assessment and with no means of ascertaining in any way the intention of such a claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">Your orator says again, that it was a stranger to all of the events of the several alienations here set up, and an unwilling purchaser of the properties; that it did not have the means of ascertaining the history of such changes and alienations, as the official records of the several decrees and sales and confirmations are all long since and prior to this suit destroyed, and the head and controlling spirits of the intervening corporations are either dead, in foreign lands, or, as is almost always true when creditors are forced to buy mortgaged railroads for defaults, hostile to the new owners and unwilling to impart correct information.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">And your orator further charges that it was wholly misled as to the importance attached in the Supreme Court to the statements of the several alienations, particularly with reference to the times thereof, since the same were made largely as introductory to the material allegation, that there was such change in ownership between the years for which the levy was made and the date of the assessment, as that there was a total change for value of the entire ownership, and this was not denied by defendants. That the only issue upon this point made at the preliminary hearing was one of law, as hereinbefore stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">Wherefore, in as much as your orator was an entire stranger as aforesaid to all of the history of the ownerships of the several and separate parts of the lines of railroad so taxed under the assessment in 1885 during the years of 1879, 1880 and 1881, for which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>was taxed and has therein impleaded the defendants upon this particular point upon an issue of law as to whether when the time for the assessment and collection of taxes has passed and the taxing statute has affixed no lien to the railroad property which is real estate and the State has made no assessment nor taken any other \u2022steps to collect the same, such real estate can be pursued for such back taxes when it has gone into the hands of innocent purchasers for value and had not submitted or intended to submit the question whether the Florida Railway and Navigation Company was \u2022such innocent purchaser for value, which complainant again respectfully but earnestly insists was not raised by the pleadings, and if raised, was not supported by the facts in the case. Your orator is advised that it is matei\u2019ial and necessary to bring the question of fact whether the said railroad company was such innocent purchasers of the railroad under the circumstances \u25a0stated above at the time of such assessment, never before put in issue in order that it may 'be determined .and passed upon by this honorable court, and that the law may prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">To the end, therefore, that the defendants may, if they can show why your orator should not have the relief hereby prayed and may upon their several corporate oaths full, true, direct and perfect answer make to all and singular the matters aforesaid as fully and \u2022\u2022explicitly as if especially thereto interrogated, and .more especially that they may answer and set forth <em>the </em>'best and utmost of their knowledge, remembrance, information and belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">(1) Whether your orator exhibited his original bill against these defendants, when and for the purposes herein stated or otherwise, and if so, how otherwise?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(2) Whether such proceedings were not had in said \u25a0cause, as hereinbefore stated, or how otherwise?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">(3) Whether your orator has not at the time stated or at other and what time discovered, and is it not a fact, that the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company first owned and possessed the line of railroad when and as herein stated, or how otherwise. And is it not a fact that before such purchase it was owned and possessed as in this bill stated, or how otherwise. And whether it is a fact, as stated herein, that no party in interest in the several lines of railroad herein named and taxed for and during the years 1S79, 1880 and 1881, or either of said years, did not own any interest in the said properties in 1885 as stated, or how otherwise?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">(4) Whether the issue on the point of such ownership was in issue as stated in this bill, and is it not a fact that it was heard by the court on such point, as stated in this bill, or how otherwise?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\"><em>(5) </em>Whether your orator has not first been informed and is it not a fact, as stated in this bill, that it did not know the history of such changes in such sale and was not advised that the question of fact was in issue in said bill stated, or how otherwise?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-8\">And that your orator may have the same relief against the said defendants as it might have had if the facts hereinbefore stated and charged by supplement had been, as here, stated in its original bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-9\">And in case the defendants shall persist in collecting or attempting to collect the aforesaid tax from your orator by levy and sale of its railroad property or by other proceedings, that they may be enjoined therefrom, and that your orator may have such other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and further relief in the premises as the circumstances-of its case require and to your honor shall seem meet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AS\">The sworn petition accompanying the bill reads as follows: The petition of - the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad Company, the above named complainant, respectfully showeth that on or about the 2d day of November, A. D. 1892, your petitioner filed its bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of Leon county aforesaid against William D. Bloxham, as Comptroller, and John A. Pearce, as sheriff of Leon county, Florida, to establish the claim of the petitioner to the exemption of its railroad property in the State of Florida from taxation for State, county and municipal purposes, based upon the statute laws of said State, and especially upon the legislative act thereof, approved January 6, 1855, and generally known as the \u201cInternal Improvement Act,\u201d and for the recovery of a sum of money, to-wit: Of one hundred and forty thousand eight hundred and twelve and <em>.47 </em>dollars ($140,812.47), therein alleged to have been illegally collected from a railroad company preceding the petitioner in 'the ownership of its present property, to whose rights thereto petitioner succeeded, for the State- of Florida by duress and over the protest of said predecessor company, and to enjoin the collection of a further sum of ninety-six thousand one hundred and eighty-one and .69 dollars ($96,181.69) or thereabout, upon an alleged and void assessment made by the Comptroller of Florida on the 18th day of October, 1885, against the Florida Railway and Navigation Company upon the railroad property, now of petitioner, then of the said Florida Railway and Navigation Company, for the taxes for State and county purposes for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881 therein alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>to be due upon warrant of Bloxham, Comptroller, and' by levy thereunder by Pearce, as Sheriff, attempted to-be had and done by the unlawful seizure and sale of the railroad of petitioner and praying that it be decreed-that the exemption to the petitioner of its railroad property from taxation for State, county and municipal purposes for a then and now unexpired period toured to and continued to exist in favor of petitioner,, and that the defendant, Bloxham, be decreed to refund, to petitioner the aforesaid sum of \u00a7140,812.47 illegally-demanded of and collected from the owners of the-aforesaid railroad property, with interest thereon from; the date of such collection and that the defendants,. Bloxham and Pearce, Comptroller and Sheriff as aforesaid, and each of them, be enjoined by the court from-the collection of the said sum of $96,181.69, or any part thereof, by seizure and sale of the railroad of defendant, otherwise, for and on account of the claim; for taxes thereon for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881. And your petitioner further shows that defendants,. Bloxham and Pearce aforesaid, being served with process of subpoena, appeared to said bill, filed plea, demurrer and answer thereto, and upon ruling upon exceptions to such answer, filed amended plea, demurrer and answer thereto, admitting the- existence of the-statutory exemption upon certain of the lines of the petitioner\u2019s railroad originally and contending that same was lost by alienation of property by company building the particular part of said road, <em>i. e., </em>that the same was exemption only to the original company and. not to the property itself. That petitioner was not entitled to recover the money sued for, as same was due- and lawfully collected and that petitioner\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>was liable to the assessment made upon it for the taxes \u2022of 1879, 1880 and 1881, and assessed against the F. R. *&amp; N. Co. in 1885, when it owned the property without regard to the ownership of same in the years of 1879, \u25a01880 and 1881. That hearing was had upon said bill \u2022and answer, before your honor, on application for the injunction hereinbefore prayed for; wherein it was on hearing argued by the parties that the properties of \u00a1petitioner, to-wit: The railroad, <em>etc., </em>which was assessed as aforesaid in 1885, against the Florida Railway and Navigation Company for the taxes of 1879, 1880 and 1881 did not belong to the last named company in either of the years for which said tax was assessed. and contended by yietitioner that the Florida Railway and Navigation Company which was assessed in .1885 for the taxes of 1879,1880 and 1881 was not the owner of any of such property in 1879, 1880 and 1881, and that the property in the hands of petitioner was not \u00a1subject to such tax; and by counsel for defendants, that it was under the law liable thereto, without regard to the \u2022 ownershiy) thereof during the time of the taxed period. Whereupon, by agreement, after hearing as aforesaid, the case was submitted, and it was decided by decree denying to petitioner its exemption from taxation as claimed, denying its right to recover the money ypaid by the Florida Railway and Navigation Company and allowing to it an injunction restraining the Comptroller and sheriff from the collection of the taxes for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881 as not having been prop- \u2022 erly assessed in 1885 against the Florida Railway and Navigation Company. The parties each appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida from such decree, the \u2022defendants assigning as error in effect that the court \u25a0.improperly held that the assessment for the taxes on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the said railroad in 1885, for the taxes of 1879, 1880 and 1881, was not properly made against the Florida Railway and Navigation Company. And that after-wards, on the 19th day of March, 1895, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the judgment of this honorable court in the first and second points of the aforesaid decree, and as to the third point of said decree it affirmed in part and reversed it in part, and by mandate returned the cause to this court. The Supreme Court decided in effect that the State did not have the power to follow this property for the taxes of 1879, 1880 and 1881 by assessment in 1885, if it had ceased to be in the possession or ownership of the persons to whom it belonged during the time for which such assessment was made, into the hands at time of assessment of innocent purchasers for value, and reached its conclusion that any portion of this property was in 1885 in the same possession as in 1879, 1880 and 1881, or in that of their privies, by a wholly mistaken view of facts not in issue in the case as submitted, and upon an interpretation of the statements of the bill that is entirely at variance with the facts as they existed and the understanding and purport of such statements at hearing below. By which the court above found that a portion of said property, to-wit: the railroad from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee river, with branches, was owned and operated by Edward J. Reed and associates from September, 1879, to February 8, 1882, when they organized a company known as the Florida \u2022Central and Western Railroad Company; whereas, the truth and facts are that during all these years, covering the whole of the period for which these taxes \u25a0 are -assessed, and for the entire time between September, 1879, and January 6, 1882, a company known as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Bailroaii Company owned that part of the aforesaid line of railroad between Lake City and Chattahoochee, and it was possessed, used and operated by receivers of the United\u2019 States Court, <em>viz: </em>Sherman Conant and A. B. Hawkins, who retained the possession of said road and received and retained the tolls and revenue thereof from September, 1879, the date of the sale, as alleged in the original bill, until after the said sale was confirmed in January, 1882, when, and not before, H. E. Jackson, Chas. H. Simonton and Adolph Engler, as purchasers-at the sale of 1879, were admitted to the possession and ownership of said railroad in January, 1882, before which last named date Eeed and his associates were not owners of and were not possessed of said property, or in any way interested therein. As to such parts of the railroad of petitioner as lies between Lake City and Jacksonville, the same was held, owned, possessed and enjoyed by the Florida Central Bail-road Company, its owner, for many years until the judicial sale thereof on the 6th day of January, A. D. 1882, when it was purchased by Edward J. Eeed, who for the first time became possessed of the said line of railroad, after the confirmation of such sale occurring thence after in less than ten days from the date of sale aforesaid. And in like manner as to the lines of railroad from Fernandina to Cedar Keys and Waldo to Ocala, for the lack of direct information, and because of petitioner\u2019s being as aforesaid an entire stranger to the transactions and changes of title preceding the creation of the Florida Bail way and Navigation Company and its investiture of the possession of the railroad projjerty, coupled with the fact that all records of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>judicial proceedings and sale thereunder and herein anywhere referred to had been destroyed by fire. Your petitioner says that it was not pretended authoritatively to allege in said original bill the chain of title to such parts of road into the F. R. &amp; N. Co., but that the averments made were introductory to and subordinate to the allegation in the answer not denied, that there was such change in ownership between the dates for which levy was made and the date of assessment, \u25a0as that there was an entire change of ownership of the properties, and that, too for value. And that the allegations of the bill as made originally were made by the petitioners, who is a corporation that had no existence, at the time of the transactions referred to, \u2022and was not even created at the time of the making of the assessments complained of, but was formed after-wards to own and operate the said railroad properties that had been purchased by people at a judicial sale in 1887, who were unfortunate creditors of the previous owner, and who were entire strangers to the property prior to their purchase, so that petitioner was not informed of the real facts, as here stated, and was not \u2022advised of their materiality, nor put upon notice of the importance in value of a statement thereof as a deraignment of title by any issue raised in the pleadings since the narrative of title in petitioner\u2019s original bill was only in explanation of the situation at time of assessment, which justified the allegation in the bill of an entire change of ownership for value after the first of January, 1881, of the entire properties, and before the date of the assessments, to which averments issue was made by the amended answer of defendant by admission of the alleged mesne conveyances and by a denial, as upon demurrer to the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that such holders (iu 1885) acquired any immunities-, from taxation on said railroad, <em>etc. </em>And petitioner further alleges that it now knows that no party in interest in the lines of railroad from Fernandina to Cedar Keys, and Waldo to Ocala, in 1885, at the date and time of the assessment, or in the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, that at such day held and owned the whole line of petitioner\u2019s railroad then in existence, had one dollar in value or any interest of any kind in the said lines of railroad, or either of them, in the years 1879, 1880 or 1881. Wherefore, inasmuch as petitioner was an entire stranger as aforesaid to all of the history of the ownership of the separate and several parts of the lines of the railroad taxed as aforesaid for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881, for and during the years it was taxed as complained of, and as herein impleaded, the defendants upon an issue of law as to whether when the time for the assessment and collection of taxes has passed and the taxing-statute affixed no lien to the railroad property which is real estate, and the State has made no assessment, nor taken anj'- other step to collect the same, such real estate could not be pursued for such back taxes, when it had gone into the hands of innocent purchasers for value, which as to this particular portion of said original bill was a particular issue made by the pleadings, your petitioner is advised that it is necessary to bring-the question of fact as to whether the Florida Railway and Navigation Company was such innocent purchaser of such railroad at the time of such assessment, never-before put in issue, in order that it may be determined 'and passed upon, and that the law and the right may prevail. Your petitioner prays that leave be granted tojt to file a supplemental bill, or such other pleading or-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>amendment thereof, against said William I). Bloxham,. as Comptroller, and John A.

It is alleged in the original bill that all that portion of plaintiff\u2019s line of railroad between Jacksonville and Chattahoochee, with branches to Monticello and St. Marks, was on the 25th day of September, 1879,-sold under a decree of foreclosure to Edward J. Reed, who, together with his associates, originated a company under the general laws of the State of Florida known as the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company, which latter company was by deed of the said Reed, dated 28th of February, 1882, invested with all the rights, privileges and immunities covered by said -mortgage, etc. This allegation contains an important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>link in the chain of title which the plaintiff sets np to this railroad in the original bill. Yet it is alleged in the supplemental bill that this allegation is untrue, and that Edward J. Reed did not purchase this line of railroad at said sale, as stated in the original bill, but that Henry R. Jackson, Charles II. Simonton and Adolph Engler purchased thereat that part of said railroad from Lake City to Chattahoochee, with branches to Monticello and St. Marks, and that subsequently Edward J. Reed purchased that part of it from Jacksonville to Lake City at a judicial sale under a decree of foreclosure on the 6th of January, 1882. What disposition Henry R. Jackson, Charles H. Simonton and Adolph Engler made of the part of the railroad which is alleged to have been purchased by them is not disclosed by the supplemental bill, but we are left to infer that the appellee in some manner derived title thereto through them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">Therefore the appellee claims title to this part of said railroad from Edward J. Reed, in its original bill, and from Henry R. Jackson, Charles II. Simonton and Adolph Engler, in his supplemental bill. Thus the claims of appellee to this part of said railroad is founded upon title totally distinct and inconsistent and for that reason the supplemental bill is demurrable. Story Eq. Pl.

Reed and associates to the line of railroad from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee with branches to Monti cello and St. Marks was acquired at a sale on foreclosure of a statutory lien on behalf of the State against the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad Company in September 1879. The property was owned and operated by said Reed and his associates until February 8, 1882. On this date Reed and his associates organized a corporation under the general laws of the State of Florida under the nam^of the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company and on the 28th of February 1882, conveyed the property to the said corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">This corporation in February 1884 with other corporations consolidated into the Florida Railway and Navigation Company. This latter corporation owned the-property until May 1889, and during the time the assessments complained of were made. The complainant acquired title through a purchase by one W. B.

This decision, we contend, becomes the law of the case, and <em>as to tibe facts found, res adjudicata, and there is no mode of reversing it. </em>It is conclusive upon the parties to the suit, and the \u2022Circuit Court is powerless to change it or to proceed \u25a0contrary to it.

Reed purchased a majority of the stock of the Florida Central Railroad Company on the 20th of December, 1881, and afterwards on the 6th of January, 1882, purchased its line of railroad from Jacksonville to Lake City at a judicial sale under a decree of foreclosure. This railro\u00e1d was liable to the assessments complained of when Edward J. Reed became the owner of a majority of the stock of the Florida Central Railroad Company and as such stockholder he was bound to take notice of such liability. And his subsequent purchase of this railroad at the judicial sale can not relieve him from the legal consequences of such notice and convert him into an innocent purchaser, for value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">We have treated this bill as a supplemental bill; but if it should be contended that it is a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, then the question suggests itself, what decree is it intended to modify or reverse. It can not affect the decree of the Circuit Court because that decree has already been reversed, by this Honorable Court, and is no longer operative. And likewise it can not affect the decree of this Honorable Court because a bill of review will not lie to reverse the decree of this court. 20 Am.

But this amended pleading disr tinctly says that such was not the case, and says that the owners in 1885, were neither the owners in 1879-81 nor their privies. And in support of this statement, and in explanation, not in excuse, of previous \u25a0statements made in original pleading, it says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">That the original case was not heard and decided upon an issue which embraced any such assumption or contention, but upon the expressed admission of different ownership, and contention by the State\u2019s \u25a0counsel that the tax was properly to be collected out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of the property notwithstanding such change of ownership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">Record page 3 for statement in bill, and the admission of appellants by demurrer, p. 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">And the reason for not bringing to the attention of this court the history of the ownership for the years 1879, \u201980 and \u201981 in the original bill as stated and done in the supplemental pleadings, is admittedly accounted for upon the facts stated in the latter, that when made in the former they were made by a stranger, without knowledge and with no correct information available to it nor accessible by reasonable dilligence; that such statements by the very nature of the contentions on behalf of the State were immaterial, i. e., were not responsive to the issue on which the-case was tried, and that it was not until the decision in the former cause by this court that appellee was put upon notice of the materiality of the statements, nor on enquiry of the actual facts of ownership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">It was competent for the court to allow the supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review to be filed, because no final decree has yet been entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">A decree is final only which finally adjudicates upon all the merits of the controversy and leaves nothing further to be done but the execution of it.

He says that the allegation, imperfect in itself, and necessarily so because \u2022of the lack of knowledge of the 'pleader, contained <em>\u201can important link in the chain of </em>title, etc.,\u201d and then using the allegation of the supplemental bill, which shows that, notwithstanding the sale as stated, the purchasers, who are correctly stated in the latter and who might inferentially be called the privies in interest with the owner of the property in 1885, were not admitted to the ownership of the property until December, 1881. He argues that the supplemental bill was demurrable in that appellee\u2019s claim as to this part of the road is founded upon title totally distinct and inconsistent.

C. &amp; P. R. R. Co., 35 Fla. 625, 17 South. Rep. 902), no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u2022decree was entered by the Circuit Court under the \u25a0mandate sent down, but leave was granted by that -court and a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review was filed by appellee, the complainant in the \u25a0original proceedings. It becomes necessary that we now determine whether such a bill was permissible, in the then status of the case, under the rules of practice in courts of chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">A supplemental bill, says Story (Eq. Pl. sec. 332), is '\u2018merely an addition to the original bill, in order to supply some defect in its original frame or structure. In many cases, an imperfection in the frame of the \u25a0original bill, may be remedied by an amendment. \u25a0Generally, a mistake in the bill in the statement of a fact should be corrected by an amendment, and not by \u2022a right statement of the fact in a supplemental bill. But the imperfection of a bill may remain undiscovered, while the proceedings are in such a state, that .an amendment can be permitted according to the practice of the court; or it may be of such a nature, having occurred after the suit is brought, as may not properly be the subject of an amendment. By the practice of the court, no amendment is generally allowable, after the parties are at issue upon the points of the original bill, and witnesses have been examined. Nor is it generally allowable to introduce into the bill, by amendment, any matter which has happened since the filing of the bill. In such cases, a supplemental bill is the appropriate remedy. And such a supplemental bill may not only be for the purpose of putting-in issue nevr matter, which may vary the relief prayed in the original bill; but also for the purpose of putting in issue matter which may prove the plaintiff\u2019s Tight to the relief originally prayed. Whenever a sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>plemental bill is not <em>a </em>supplemental suit, but only introduces supplementary matter, tile whole record constitutes but one cause; and one replication and one cause are to be set down for the hearing.\u201d Stafford vs. Howlett, 1 Paige 200; Straughan vs. Hallwood, 30 West Va. 274, 4 S. E. Rep. 394; Ledwith vs. City of Jacksonville, 32 Fla. 1, 13 South. Rep. 454. As to bills of review this court has approvingly quoted the statement of the rule in 2 Daniell\u2019s Cir. Pl. &amp; Pr., 1575, as follows: \u201cThe object of a bill of review, and of a bill in the nature of a bill of review, is to procure the reversal, alteration or explanation of a decree made in a former suit. If the decree has been signed and enrolled a bill of review must be hied; if not, a bill in the nature of a bill of review.\u201d \u201cA bill of this character can only be brought upon error in law appearing on the face of the decree without further examination of matters of fact, or upon some new matter which has-been discovered after the decree, and which could not pos'sibly have been used when the decree was made. If the bill is filed on the ground of error the decree complained of must be contrary to some statutory enactment, or some principle or rule of law or equity, recognized and acknowledged, or settled by decision, or be at variance with the forms and practice of the court, but the bill can not be maintained where the-error is in mere matter of form, or the propriety of the decree is questioned.\u201d Mattair vs. Card, 19 Fla. 455. The note to the case of Brewer vs. Bowman, 20 Am. Dec. 158 (3 J. J. Marsh. 492), contains a discussion and review of authorities as to bills of review, their nature and scope. In the case of Putnam vs. Lewis and wife, 1 Fla. 455, an application was made to file a bill to review a decree in a partition suit as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>certaining the interests of the respective parties, and' appointing commissioners to make the partition, and' alleged to have been dnly signed and recorded. A ground of the application was newly discovered evidence since the rendition of the decree. It was conceded that a bill of review lies only after a final decree, and it was held that the decree sought to be reviewed in the case was interlocutory and not final. The court said that the decree in this case, being interlocutory, a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review would seem to be the appropriate remedy.\u201d Citing <em>2 </em>Johns. Ch. 490; 2 Atk. 40, 534; 2 Vesey Sr. 598; Mit. Pl. 71; 17 Vesey, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The decision in Owens vs. Love and Bruce, Admrs., 9 Fla. 325, announces the rule that a bill of review lies-only after final decree, and not upon an interlocutory decree. It was there held that after an interlocutory decree has been enrolled the court will grant leave to file a supplemental bill, to bring forward newly discovered evidence, and grant a rehearing, upon the same-if the evidence is of such a nature, as were it a bill of review, would entitle the party to relief. The court said, \u201cHad the application in this petition been but-for a review reversal, and setting aside said decree-(being interlocutory), then the case of Pitman vs. Lewis and wife would be applicable, which decided, that a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review would seem to be the approjjriate remedy.\u201d The-view taken in the opinion that a bill in the nature of a bill of review is not of use in this State has been disapproved. Finlayson vs. Lipscomb, 15 Fla. 558.. Supplemental bills and bills of review, the nature and scope of which are discussed by the authorities cited,, have an admitted application, under a proper state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>facts, to cases in the lower court, and where a case is pending or disposed of by a chancellor there is no obstacle in the way of his permitting the nse of such bills, in proper cases, to affect his own decrees. But \u2022other considerations are involved where such bills are resorted to after the decree of the chancellor has been passed upon by the appellate court. We do not find any direct adjudication on this point in this State. In the cases of Putnam vs. Lewis and wife and Owens vs. Love and Bruce, Admrs., the decrees sought to be modified had not been before the \u25a0appellate court. Finlayson vs. Lipscomb, 16 Fla. 751, presents a case where a supplemental bill in the nature \u2022of a bill of review was permitted to be filed by the chancellor after the reversal by this court of an order granting a rehearing upon the rendition of the decree, and before enrollment, but we find in the opinion upon the reversal that it was pointed out that the proper remedy, if any existed, was by supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, and the reversal was without prejudice to an application for other appropriate proceedings. Finlayson vs. Lipscomb, 15 Fla. 558. There is no difficulty where the appellate court expressly authorizes such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">When the bill was filed in the case of Mattair vs. Card, 19 Fla. 455, a former decree between the same parties relating to the same subject-matter had been affirmed-on appeal \u2014 18 Fla. 761 \u2014 and while the professed object of the second bill was to annul and set -aside the former decree, it proceeded, in total disregard of the rules applicable to bills of review to re-lit - igate matters supposed not to have been involved in the first suit. The court decided that a bill to procure the reversal, alteration or explanation of a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>made in a former suit, except for fraud in obtaining it, was by bill of review, and no such fraud being shown, it was determined that all the grounds of relief set up in the second bill were involved, and necessarily submitted for consideration, in the first suit. In speaking of one ground of the defense the court say \u201cthe question whether the mortgage was valid to create a lien upon the property because of the omission of words of grant or conveyance by S. R. Mattair in the body of the instrument was necessarily submitted to the court at the hearing before the chancellor, and determined, whether it was made a ground of objection at the time or not. The decree necessarily determined that the paper was a valid mortgage, and directed its enforcement as such. The decree was affirmed on appeal, and though the question of its, sufficiency was not raised upon the appeal, the affirming of the decree places the question beyond the reach of review here.\u201d The opinion does point out defects in the bill viewed as one of review; but the question as to whether the lower court can permit, under any circumstances, a bill of review, or bill in the nature of a bill of review, to be filed to modify a decree affirmed or directed to be entered by the appellate court, either on questions of law or facts, was not considered by the court, and evidently not designed to be decided. We are of the opinion that when the Supreme Court on appeal affirms the decree of the Circuit Court, or when such a decree is modified on appeal either as to questions of law or fact necessarily involved, with directions for further proceedings consistent with the opinion, the Circuit Court has no authority to open the case for a new trial, or to enter any other judgment than that directed to be entered, unless authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u2022do so is expressly given by the appellate court. Any \u2022other rule than this seems to us to be entirely inadmissible. Sections 1277 and 1278 Rev. Stat. provide \u2022as follows, <em>viz: </em>\u201cIt shall be the duty of the court on an appeal or writ of error to examine the record, to reverse or affirm the judgment, sentence or decree of the \u2022court below, or to give such judgment, sentence or decree as the court below ought to have given, or as to it may appear according to law.\u201d \u201cThe appellate \u25a0court may order the record of the judgment appealed from, with its decisi\u00f3n and determination thereon in writing duly certified, to be remitted to the court from which the writ of error \u00a1shall have been taken, and the said decision and determination shall be carried into execution by the officers of said court, <em>a (quo, </em>or the appellate court \u25a0may award executions to carry into effect its decision and determination.\u201d Under this authority, and as to chancery causes it may be independent of such legislation, when the appellate court has examined the record of a cause and affirmed the decree appealed from, or has modified or reversed such decree with directions as to the decree to be entered, whether the decision was on questions of law or fact it is not the province of the court, <em>a </em>quo, to allow further proceedings, but the judgment and mandate of the Superior -Court must be obeyed. We confine ourselves at present to the case of an affirmance, or reversal or modification of the decree with directions for further proceedings consistent with the opinion, as it is not nec\u2022essary to say what would be the effect of a mere reversal without further directions. This conclusion is \u00a1sustained by the views of Chancellor Walworth in the case of Stafford vs. Bryan, 2 Paige. 45, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>he took the view that a court of chancery can not entertain a bill in the nature of a bill of review upon the ground of newly discovered facts, to review a decree which had been affirmed in the court for correction of errors, unless such right has been expressly reserved. <em>Vide </em>also Lyon vs. Herritt, 6 Paige, 473. 'The same view was entertained by Wright, J., in Kinsell vs. Fieldman, 28 Iowa, 497. The doctrine of the Supreme Court of the United States is in favor of the same view. The point was directly decided in the \u25a0case of Southard vs. Russell, 16 How. 547. The court said \"as already stated,' the decree sought to be set aside by this bill of review in the court below was entered in pursuance of the mandate of this court on appeal in the original suit. It is therefore the decree of this court, and not that primarily entered by the court below, that is sought to be interfered with. The better opinion is, that a bill of review will not lie at all for errors of law alleged on the face of the decree after the judgment of the appellate court. These may be corrected by a direct application to that court, which would amend, as matter of course, any error of the kind that might have occurred in entering the decree. Nor will a bill of review lie in the case\u2019of newly discovered evidence after the publication of decree belowg where a decision has taken place on an appeal, unless the right is reserved in the decree of the appellate court, or permission be given on an application to that court directly.for the purpose. This appears to be the practice of the Court of Chancery and House \u25a0of Lords, in England, and we think it founded in principles essential to the proper administration of the law, and to a reasonable termination of litigation between parties in chancery suits.\u201d That court has acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>on the same rule in other cases. Tyler vs. Magwire, 17 Wall. 253; Mackall vs. Richards, 116 U. S. 45, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 234; Skillern\u2019s Executors vs. May\u2019s Executors, 6 Cranch, 267. Some text writers state that it would seem from the decision in Barbon vs. Searle, 1 Vernon, 416, that for matter newly discovered after decree affirmed in the House of Lords, a bill of review might be allowed. We have examined the case and do not see that it sustains the inference drawn. After a decree dismissing a bill had been affirmed in the House of Lords, a bill was filed for discovery, and after the discovery that plaintiff might apply -to the House for leave to proceed. An answer -was required, but it was distinctly recognized that the decree of the-Lords could not be interfered with unless they permitted the suit for that purpose, and any further proceedings than the discovery were suspended until leave was obtained. Decisions in the States of South and North Carolina and Missouri, also fully sustain our conclusion. <em>Ex parte </em>Knox, <em>In re </em>Cothran vs. Knox, 17 S. C. 207; Ibid 13 S. C. 496; N. C. R. R. Co. vs. Swepson, 73 N. C. 316; Hurck vs. Erskine, 50 Mo. 116; Chouteau vs. Allen, 74 Mo. 56. It is said in Greer vs. Turner, 36 Ark. 17, that \u201cthe usual directions on remanding a cause, when this court deems it advisable to remand at all, are for further proceedings consistent with the law declared, and facts found, by the written opinion. This becomes the law of the case, and as to facts found, <em>res judicata. </em>\u2022 Consistently with these it is not generally intended to trammel the proper courts of original jurisdiction, by precluding them from any steps which may be within the proper scope of the suit, and necessary to complete justice between the parties in reference to its subject-matter.\u201d Out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>side of the matters directly adjudicated, it seems in that State, a plaintiff' may by supplemental bill, after the return of the, cause to the lower court, bring forward new matter occurring since the final submission, of the cause in the Circuit Court. It should be conceded, we think, that decisions in Virginia, Kentucky,. New Jersey and Georgia go to the extent of sustaining the authority of the lower court to permit a bill! of review on the ground of newly discovered facts-without leave from the appellate court, after the case-has been decided in the latter court, but the preponderance of authority is, we think, clearly the other-way. In our opinion the Circuit Judge should have-entered a decree under the mandate sent down and n ot permitted the case to be opened by the supplemental, bill allowed to be filed. A mandate of this court should be construed with reference to the opinion delivered in the case, and from the opinion filed it will be seen that the decree was affirmed in part with modifications, reversed in part with directions in the mandate for further proceedings according to right, justice, the judgment of this court, and the laws of the State of Florida. This mandate stated the particulars-in which the former decree was changed, and clearly contemplated that a new and different decree should be entered than that rendered by the Circuit Court. We quote from the opinion in <em>Ex parte </em>Knox, in Cothran vs. Knox, <em>stopra, </em>as follows on this point: \u201cWhen the judgment of the Circuit Court is simply affirmed, it may seem that the judgment in the cause in which it is rendered is only a judgment of the Circuit Court unrevoked; to reverse a judgment of the Circuit Court may perhaps mean something more than. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u2022 \u00a1merely to annul or set it aside; but when a judgment \u25a0 of the Circuit Court is modified by the Supreme Court vit is certainly a new judgment with ^different provisions from the Circuit Court judgment. While such a judgment is the final judgment in the case, it is difficult to see how it is merely the judgment of the Cir\u25a0\u2022cuit Court. It is made, as in the case now under \u2022consideration, in the Supreme Court, and is made by ran authority paramount to and which overrides the 'Circuit Court. This judgment of the Supreme 'Courtis remitted, not to be reheard in, but to be enforced by the\u2019Circuit Court according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">An appeal might have been taken from the order of \u2022the court granting leave to file the supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, instead of entering \u25a0judgment under the mandate as should have been \u25a0done, but as the supplemental bill alleges the proceedings in the former suit, including the appeal to this court, the decision and mandate issued, it may be disposed of on demurrer, and the court should not have \u2022 overruled it. W e can not sanction spell a departure from precedent as was allowed by the Circuit Judge. \u25a0This conclusion removes from consideration the merits \u2022of the bill, if it had been properly filed, <em>and </em>other \u25a0matters discussed in the brief's.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The petition for leave to file a supplemental bill in \u25a0the nature of a bill of review, considered in connection -with the bill permitted to be filed in the lower court, \u2022 can not be regarded as affording any sufficient ground for reviewing the judgment directed to be entered by \u25a0 this court under its mandate, if it had been entered, \u25a0beyond the exemption of taxation in question of the dine of railroad from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee. ' The view announced in the former opinion in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>was that when the time tor the assessment and collection of taxes has passed, and the taxing statute affixes no lien on the proxierty, and the State has made no assessment, or taken any other steps to collect the same, real estate can not be pursued for back taxes when it has gone into the hands of an innocent x&gt;tir- \u2022 chaser for value. If, as a matter of fact, as claimed in the petition filed in the lower court for leave to file the snpxilemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, and in the bill filed, the line of road from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee went into the hands of an innocent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser before the State proceeded to collect taxes for years ynior to such purchase, it would be inequitable and unjust to demand them. Whether' appellee. or its predecessor, was such purchaser, or, if so, whether it can now avail itself of such defense, we do not now decide, as the Circuit Court had no authority to x&gt;ermit to be filed or to consider any supx&gt;lemental bill in the nature of a bill of review. This court has the ymwer in awarding a judgment on ax&gt; peal, whether of affirmance or reversal, to authorize a bill of review to be filed in the lower court, and this was done in the case of Finlayson vs. Lipscomb, 15 Fla. 558, without any direct apx&gt;lication for that purpose. Prom the consideration of that case, then on .ax^peal, it appeared to the court that appellant had mistaken his remedy, if he had any, and the court reversed the decree without prejudice to resort to another course, which was x&gt;ointed out to be a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review. In our opinion this court also has the power on an independent petition tiled for that purpose, after a mandate on a former ax^peal has been issued, and lodged in the lower court and a judgment entered to grant leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>file a bill of review of the judgment entered. <em>In re </em>Gamewell Fire Alarm Tel. Co. <em>et </em>al., 73 Fed. Rep. 908, 20 C. C. A. 111. In neither case should leave be-granted to file a bill of review as a matter of course, but the power of this court should be exerted in this-direction only when, in the exercise of a sound legal discretion, it appears that good and sufficient grounds-exist for filing such a bill. Where the application is-made on the ground of newly discovered matter the-questions of the materiality of the alleged new matter and laches both will arise, and this court must be satisfied that a sufficient ground exists before leave will be granted to file a bill of review of a judgment directed by it to be entered. In the present case no judgment has yet been entered under the mandate sent down in the former appeal, and the case is now befoi-e us for further directions. It is clear from the record that appellee is seeking to l\u2019eview the former decision made in this case on the ground of newly discovered matter since the decision, and it is also evident from what has been said that a mistake has been made as to the proper course in accomplishing this object.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We are satisfied from the entire record before us that there is sufficient shown to authorize this court to grant leave to appellee to be heard on an application in the Circuit Court to file a bill of review of the judgment when entered, to the extent of the line of railroad and branches from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee, formerly known as the Florida, Central and Western Railroad Company, and, after a careful examination of all that has been disclosed, we are of opinion that justice, requires that an order be made in this court granting permission to appellee to be fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ther heard in the Circuit Court to the extent mentioned on account of the alleged newly discovered matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The decree overruling the demurrer will be reversed and the cause remanded with further directions that the Circuit Court dismiss the supplental bill in the nature of a bill of review and enter a final decree in accordance with the former judgment of this court upon which a mandate will again issue, and an order will be entered here permitting appellee, within ninety days after the decree is entered, to apply to the Circuit Court for leave to file a bill of review to the extent of the line of railroad mentioned in the decree from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee and branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b309-7\">Carter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUm\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">I regret that I find myself unable to agree with the majority of the court in that portion of the opinion which directs the entry of an order here permitting appellee to apply to the court below for leave to file a bill of review as to certain lines of railroad in the opinion mentioned. I concur fully with the views an nounced in the opinion, that no bill of review or bill in the nature of such can be filed in the lower court, to charge or modify a final decree which has been .affirmed, or directed to be entered by this court, without leave of this court first obtained. And it follows that if a bill of this character can not be filed without such leave, that the leave should not be granted as a matter of course. The rule requiring leave is not founded upon an imperative statute or rule of court, but it springs from the inherent authority and dignity attaching to judgments of an appellate court, to prevent conflicts in jurisdiction between appellate and inferior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>courts and from that principle of jurisprudence which-requires that somewhere, within reasonable limits, litigation shall end. Southard vs. Russell, 16 How. 547. The decision of the highest appellate court, affirming a judgment, or directing the entry of a certain judgment, is presumptively the end of litigation in that particular case; and before granting leave to continue-the litigation in the court below by a bill of review, this court should require the party applying for leave to- show, <em>prima </em>facie, at least, a right to have the decree reviewed. I do not regard the case of Finlayson vs. Lipscomb, 15 Fla. 558, as authority for the position that this court should give jDermission to lile a bill of review, in awarding judgment on appeal, without a direct application for such leave, or as holding that it has the power to do so. In that case, which was an appeal from an order granting a rehearing only, the-court reversed the decree \u201cwithout prejudice to an application, if deemed advisable by the parties, for other-appropriate proceedings.\u201d This expression, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d simply had the effect of divesting the judgment of the quality of <em>res judicata. 2 </em>Daniell\u2019s Chy. Pl. &amp; Pr. 994. It meant that the position of the losing party was not to be unfavorably affected by the judgment, but that his rights were to remain as they then stood. Creighton vs. Kerr, 20 Wall. 8. It simply left the parties in the same situation as if the petition for rehearing had not been filed. Epstein &amp; Bro. vs. Ferst <em>&amp; </em>Co., 35 Fla. 498, 17 South. Rep. 414. It did not undertake to grant the parties leave to file-a bill to review any judgment that had been affirmed or modified <em>by this </em>court, for the case had never been to this court before. It is useless to discuss this question, however, for the majority of the court do not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>grant the leave simply because they have the power:.* they expressly state that it should Dot be granted as a matter of course, but in this case because \u201cin the exercise of a sound legal discretion, it appears that good and sufficient grounds exist for filing such bill.\u201d It is \u00a1 further held that where the application is made on the \u25a0 ground of newly discovered matter, the questions of' the <em>materiality </em>of the alleged new matter and <em>laches </em>both will arise, and this court must be satisfied that a, sufficient ground exists before leave will be granted,. and that there is sufficient in the entire record in this, case to so satisfy the court. In discussing this question I shall confine myself entirely to cases of review for newly discovered evidence, or matter, as that is the only question involved. This court has held that \u201cto entitle a party to relief in such cases the newly discovered! evidence must be relevant and material, and such as-might probably have produced a different determinat-ion. The new matter must have <em>first </em>come to the-knowledge of the party <em>after </em>the decree. The matter \u25a0 must not only be new, but it must be such-, as the-party, by the use of <em>reasonable diligence, </em>could not have known. It must not be merely cumulative,, nor-merely corroborative or auxiliary to what is already in the case; but must establish a new fact of itself decisive of the merits of the cause.\u201d Owens vs. Forbes, 9 Fla. 326; Finlayson vs. Lipscomb, 16 Fla. 751. In the latter case a doubt is expressed whether mere verbal testimony is new matter within the meaning, of the-authorities; and as to that point I now express no. opinion, but will consider the case upon the theory that\" such testimony may constitute new matter. And the-rule is universal that upon application to file a bill of.' review of this nature the application must show thafc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the new matter has come to the knowledge of the applicant and his agents for the <em>first </em>time <em>since </em>the period ;at which he could have made use of it in the suit, and that it <em>could not with reasonable </em>diligence, have been \u25a0discovered sooner, and that it is of such a character 'that- if it had been brought forward in the suit, it probably would have altered the judgment; 2 Daniell\u2019s Chy. Pl. &amp; Pr. page 1578; 2 Beach Modern Equity Practice, secs 860, 862 and 868; 3 Ency. Pl. &amp; Pr., 587; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. sec. 412 <em>et seq.; </em>and the same authorities are equally unanimous in requiring an affi\u2022davit to these matters, upon the application for such leave. This being true, I do not think this court can \u2022consider the matters alleged in the supplemental bill found in the record; becauseitis not sworn to; neither 'does the petition to the court below for leave to file the bill contain any statement that the matters alleged in the supplemental bill are. true. I state this, be\u00abcause there are many important allegations in the supplemental bill, which do not appear in the petition \u25a0and such matters are improper to be considered. Buckingham vs. Corning, 29 N. J. Eq. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In order to a full understanding of the case before this court, it will be necessary to refer briefly to the \u2022original bill and proceedings thereon. The original 'bill filed November 2, 1892, was sworn to by Col. John A. Henderson, Vice-President of, and attorney for, \u25a0the complainant corporation, the affidavit stating that \u201che has read the foregoing bill of complaint and .-knows the contents thereof; that the same is true as to all matters stated therein upon knowledge, and that \u2022as to all statements on information and belief therein made, he believes them to be true.\u201d No allegations in \u2022the bill puiport to be made upon information and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>lief, except that the sheriff will sell the property of complainant levied upon by him unless enjoined by the court. According to the sworn allegations of the bill, as found by this court on the former appeal, the line of railroad from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee, with branches, was acquired by Edward J. Reed and associates in September, 1879, at a foreclosure sale in behalf of the State against the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad Co., and Reed and associates owned and operated the property until February 8, 1882, when they organized a corporation under the name of Florida, Central and Western Railroad Co., and conveyed the property to that corporation on February 28, 1882 (85 Fla., text page 722). In the original bill of complaint the distinct claim was made that the complainant was an innocent purchaser of this particular property for value; and also that it succeeded to the rights of exemption from taxation, supposed to have been granted to the original owners of the railroad then owned by complainant, and in order to sustain these claims, the bill undertook to trace the titles direct from the original owners, through successive ones, to the complainant. The original answer of the defendants was excepted to by complainant in February, 1898, becaus# the defendants had not answered to the best of their knowledge, among other things, whether the several conveyances and transfers of this particular branch of complainant\u2019s road were not as alleged in the bill; and such exceptions being-sustained the defendants on information and belief admitted the allegations of the bill to be correct. An agreement was made November 18, 1898, between the counsel for the respective parties, that if the court below should refuse the application of complainant for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>in junction that day made against a sale for the taxes of 1879, 1880 and 1881, that thereupon a decree should be rendered dismissing the bill, \u201cthis without prejudice-as to the exercise of the full discretion of the court; and a final decree upon the merits may also be entered herein in accordance with its findings.\u201d The effect of this agreement was to submit the case upon bill and answer. On November 25, 1893, the decree was entered in the court below, and the decree was in favor of complainant as to the taxes of 1879, 1880 and 1881. On March 19, 1895, this court filed an opinion reversing the decree as this particular matter, which is reported in 35 Fla. 625, 17 South. Rep. 902. In May, 1895, a petition for rehearing was filed, signed by the same solicitor for complainant, in which it is said that the court erred in its conclusion as to the facts of the-history of the railroads and their changes of ownership; that while it is true as alleged in the bill that the sale of the roads from Jacksonville to Chattahoochee was made in 1879, and the property deeded to the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company, in 1882, <em>'\u25a0Hf it had been anticipated </em>that the articles of association of the Florida Central and Western Railroad Co., (not in the record) would have been considered in <em>either court </em>for the .Ipurpose of showing the connection of the purchasers with the taxed property for the years 1879 to 1881, <em>the facts would hare been made to appear </em>that the sale of 1879 was not confirmed until 18c82, and that the <em>purchasers </em>at such sale were <em>not let into the possession </em>of the property before confirmation.\u201d It is difficult for me to see how these matters could have been made to appear <em>in the Circuit </em>Court, if they have only been discovered <em>since </em>the decree was rendered. By reference to the articles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>incorporation of the Florida Central and Peninsular-Railroad Co. it will be seen that Col. Henderson was--, one of the incorporators of, and a director in, the company; and he is now vice-president of, and attorney for, the company in this case, and it needs no citation-of authority to show that if he knew, or could by reasonable diligence have known, of these facts before-the decree was pronounced, the company would nof be allowed to file a bill of review. Furthermore, in. his brief filed in this court July 17, 1894, Col. Henderson shows a thorough knowledge, not only of every act of the Legislature touching the ownership, or taxation of the railroads now owned by his company, but of every decision of this court and of the United States-Courts, affecting the title to, or right of exemption from taxation of such railroads, therein referring to-the case of Schutte <em>et al. </em>vs. The Florida Central, and Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroads as being pending continuously from a certain period to May 31, 1879, when it is stated by him that a decree was-entered, which passed to a judicial sale <em>January JO,. 1880, </em>and the property purchased by Sir Edward J. Reed for associates who organized the Florida Central and Western Railroad. The case referred to by him was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United-States and the decrees affirmed. 103 U. S. 118. Again on page 14 of his brief he says \u201cand the lines of railroad from Jacksonville to River Junction, with-branches from Drifton to Monticello, and from Tallahassee to St. Marks, upon which the taxes, as a part of the assessments were made in 1885 for the years 1879,.. 1880 and 1881, <em>were for those years </em>and until January <em>10, 1881, </em>the property of a railroad company known as-the J. P. &amp; M. R. R. Co., on which last named day the* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>said <em>lines of railroad </em>were sold at judicial sale, under foreclosure proceedings and were bought by Sir Edward J. Reed, who organized a corporation * * which afterwards and until the consolidation of 1884, continued to own and hold such lines of railroad.\u201d There is nowhere in this record any affidavit from Col. Henderson that he did not know of the matters set forth in the petition found in the record prior to the rendition of the decree in the lower \u25a0court. This petition, it will be observed, is sworn to by Mr. H. R. Duval, the company\u2019s president from the time of its organization. In this petition it is \u25a0stated that the Supreme Court \u201creached its conclusion that any portion of this property was in 1885 in the same possession as in 1879,1880 and 1881, or in that of their privies, by a wholly mistaken view of facts not in issue in the case as submitted, and upon an interpretation of the statements of the bill that is entirely \u2022\u2022at variance with the facts as they existed and the understanding and purport of such statements at the hearing below, by which the court above found that a \u25a0portion of said property, to-wit: the railroad from -Jacksonville to the Chattahoochee river, with branches, was owned and operated by Edward J. Reed and associates from September, 1879, to February 8, 1882, when they organized a company known as the Florida Central and Western Railroad Company; whereas, the truth and facts are \u201cin substance that from September, 1879, to January 6, 1882, all that portion of complainant\u2019s railroad between Lake City and Chattahoochee was owned by the J. P. &amp; M. R. R. Co., and was cperated by Sherman Conant and A. B. Hawkins, receivers of the United States Court, who retained possession and received the profits until January, 1882, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>when H. R. Jackson, Charles H. Simonton and Adolph Engler, as purchasers at the sale of 1879, were admitted to the ownership of the road; and that Edward J. Reed and his associates were not owners or possessed of the property or in any manner interested therein until after January, 1882; and also that portion of the-road lying between Lake City and Jacksonville was. owned and possessed by the F. C. R. R. Co. up to-January 6, 18S2, when it was purchased by Edward J. Reed, who, for the first time, became possessed of the line of road after the confirmation of such sale.\u201d And the petition then proceeds: \u201cAnd in like manner as. to the lines of railroad from Fernandina to Cedar Key, and Waldo to Ocala, for the lack of direct information, and because of petitioner\u2019s being, as aforesaid, an entire stranger to the transactions and changes of title preceding the creation of the Florida Railway and Navigation Company and its investiture of the possession of the railroad property, coupled with the fact-that all records of the judicial proceedings and sale thereunder and herein anywhere referred to had been destroyed by fire.\u201d From these extracts it can be readily seen that the principal complaint of the petitioner was that <em>this court had erred in its decision </em>by taking \u201ca wholly mistaken view\u201d <em>of facts not in issue </em>in the case submitted, and by giving an <em>erroneous interpretation to the statements of the bill </em>that is. entirely at variance with the <em>true </em>facts and entirely at variance with the <em>understanding piorport </em>of such, statements of the bill at the <em>hearing below. </em>It is perfectly clear that a bill of review will not lie to correct errors of this character, because such errors \u00e1re only-remediable upon a petition for rehearing in this court. Such a petition has been filed and denied, and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u2022now beyond our power to authorize the correction of this error, if it exists, by bill of review. Contee vs. Lyons, 19 D. C. (8 Mackey) 207. I know of no power in an inferior court to correct mere errors of law and fact committed by an appellate court by a bill of review. It is also alleged that this court arrived at its \u2022 conclusion of fact by giving an erroneous interpreration to the <em>statements of the </em>bill, wholly at variance with the <em>understanding </em>and <em>purport </em>of such statements at <em>the hearing below. </em>If the petitioner .at the hearing below understood the statements of the bill to mean that the Jacksonville, Pensacola &amp; Mobile Railroad Co. were in possession of the \u2022line of road from Jacksonville to Chattanoochee up to 1882, as is implied in this statement, then it must have known this fact prior to the hearing and at the time of preparing its bill, and the matter is not, therefore, newly discovered, within the meaning of the rule. \u2022Something is also said about a \u201clack of direct information\u201d and because petitioner was \u201can entire stranger to the transactions and titles preceding the creation of the F. R. &amp; N. Co.,\u201d and that all records of the judicial proceedings and sale thereunder had been \u2022destroyed by fire; but it is nowhere alleged that these matters existed prior to the hearing below, or that they contributed in the slightest degree to prevent the \u2022appellant from acquiring a knowledge of the facts prior to the hearing. The entire statement is incoherent and incomplete. The petitioner may have been ..an entire stranger to the transactions and the records may all have been destroyed, and yet the petitioner may have had notice of the contents of the records, and \u25a0may have been advised of the transactions and titles \u00a1preceding .the-creation of the Florida Railway <em>&amp; </em>Nav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>igation Co., <em>before the hearing </em>of the case below; and if so, it could not maintain this bill. It may not have had <em>clisrect </em>information, and yet sufficient <em>indirect </em>information to lead it by the exercise of reasonable diligence to have obtained direct information before the hearing. It was further stated that the allegations of the bill as made <em>originally </em>(November, 1892) were made by petitioner a corporation, who had no existence at the time of the transaction referred to. nor at the time of making the assessments complained of but was formed to own and operate the railroad properties that had been purchased by people at a judicial sale in 1887, who were unfortunate creditors of the previous owner, and who were entire strangers to the property prior to their purchase, so that petitioner was not informed of the real facts as stated in the petition, was not advised of their materiality, nor put upon notice of the importance in value of a statement thereof as a deraignment of title by any issue raised in the pleadings. All these facts may be true, and yet petitioner may have known the true facts before the <em>hearing. </em>The statement that the allegations of the bill as originally made were made by a corporation who had no existence during the transactions referred to; nor when the assessment was made; or that petitioner was formed to operate railroad properties which had been purchased by unfortunate creditors, who were strangers to the property prior to such purchase, are not equivalent to an allegation that petitioner did not know of the matters set up in the petition prior to the hearing; neither would an allegation that such matters were unknown to petitioner when the <em>original bill was fled, </em>if such fact was alleged, be \u25a0\u25a0equivalent to an allegation that at the <em>time of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>hearing </em>it did not know of such fact. It was further-alleged that petitioner <em>now </em>knows that no party in interest in the Florida Railway and Navigation Co. that, in 1885 at the date and time of the assessment, held and owned the whole of petitioner\u2019s railroad then in existence, had one dollar in value, or any interest of any kind, in the lines of railroad in 1879, 1880 or 1881; but it is nowhere alleged that petitioner did now know the same facts <em>prior </em>to the hearing, or that it has discovered same since the hearing. There is nowhere in this petition an allegation that the new matter has come to the knowledge of the petitioner and its agents for the <em>first </em>time since the period at which it could have made use of it in the suit, nor that the matters could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered sooner. The date of its first knowledge on the subject is not given; nor the date of the fire which destroyed the records referred to. It gives the names of the receivers of the U. S. Court, Sherman Conant and A. B. Hawkins, but no affidavit is offered from them. It gives the names of the purchasers, Henry R. Jackson, Charles H. Simonton and Adolph Engler, but it-presents no affidavits from them. It does not show that any diligence was exercised to procure information from any of these persons, nor show an excuse for failing to do so. Mr. Engler was one of the purchasers at the sale of 1879, must have known that he did not take possession of the road until 1882, and yet he was one of the original charter members of petitioner corporation and a director therein, as shown by the articles of incorporation on file in the office of the Secretary of State. It is nowhere disclosed how the petitioner or its predecessors secured the property from Edward J. Reed and associates, or how he secured ti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tie, notwithstanding the statement; in the original bill that he purchased at the sale of 1879 which is denied by the petition. It is not shown that any inquiries were even made of petitioner\u2019s predecessors, or any effort made to ascertain the facts in any manner. My conclusions herein I think are fully sustained by the authorities. Ryerson vs. Eldred, 23 Mich. 537; Greer vs. Turner, 47 Ark. 17, 14 S. W. Rep. 383; Kern vs. Wyatt, 89 Va. 885, 17 S. E.
