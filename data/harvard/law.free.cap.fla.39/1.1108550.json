The owner or agent of any land within the corporate limits of the city of Jacksonville shall, within twenty-four hours after being notified by the-board of public works, the city marshal, or any member of the police force, remove or repair any sidewalks, fence, or other structure in any street or lane abutting on or upon said land, which may be considered dangerous or detrimental to the citizens.

That appellant failed to have, keep and maintain in repair a good and sufficient sidewalk or foot pavement, as required by said ordinance, and an order of the board of public works of the city so to do was duly made, and notice thereof was duly served upion appellant by verbal notice communicated to him by the city engineer on the 16th of March, 1890, and also, on the same date, by mailing to him postpaid, and addressed to him at his address in said city, a notice, a copy of which was attached to the bill as an exhibit. That A. E. Huff, named in the notice, was the wife of appellant, and that he failed to comply with the said order of the board of public works within ten days after notice had been served upon him. That appellant having failed to comply with the provisions of said ordinance within the time prescribed thereby, and having failed to comply with the said order of the board of public works, as aforesaid, the said board contracted for the construction of, and caused to be constructed, a sidewalk or foot pavement along the whole length of said lot as the same fronts and abuts on Main street, for the sum of $67.25, which amount the city of Jacksonville had paid, and a lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>for the amount was claimed on said lot. It is alleged that the sidewalk constructed was of the material and in the manner prescribed by the ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\">A general demurrer for want of equity was tiled by appellant and overruled by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\">The answer filed admits that appellant was the owner of the lot described in the bill, and it is alleged that he occupied the premises on said lot with his family as a homestead under the Constitution and laws of the State of Florida, and that there was a good and sufficient sidewalk running along the full width of the same at the time of the passage of said ordinance, and up to the .date or time when the city caused the same-to be torn up and removed, and that he did not need any further time to comply with the provisions of said ordinance. The further pertinent parts of the answer may be condensed into a statement of a denial of the-allegations of the bill as to a failure on the part of the-appellant to have and maintain a sidewalk as required by said ordinance in front of his lot on Main street, and as to the notice of the order of the board of public works alleged to have been served on him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">On the proofs the chancellor decreed in favor of the-city that the cost of the construction of the sidewalk was a lien on appellant\u2019s lot, and he appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">The other facts in the case are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-9\"><em>M. Q. </em>Jordan, for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-10\"><em>Stephen E. </em>Foster, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Mabry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Counsel for appellant makes no contention here that the city of Jacksonville had. no power under its constituent act of 1887, chapter 377\u00f1 laws of Florida, to pass the ordinance of 1889, the one under which the lien is asserted in this case, nor is it insisted here that the ordinance is invalid for any reason. It is admitted in the proof that the city passed the ordinance and duly published it, and the bill was filed in 1891 after the time for the publication of the ordinance had expired. We assume, as counsel has done here, that the ordinance is valid, and after an examination of the-case have come to the conclusion that the decree appealed from is correct. No attention should be paid to the allegation in the answer of appellant, that he occupied the premises on the lot with his family as a homestead under the Constitution and laws of this State. The Constitution does not secure the homestead exemptions from sale for taxes or assessments, and if it did, there is no proof in the record that appellant was the head of a family residing on the lot in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The allegations of the bill place the sidewalk constructed by the city, and for the cost of which a lien is claimed, in front of lot 4, block 23, on Main street, between the St. Johns river and Orange street, and this is admitted by the answer. Under the requirements and specifications of section 2 of the ordinance the sidewalks on Main street, from the river to Orange street, must be of stone, hard brick, or artificial stone, laid smooth, not less than eight feet in width. The testimony clearly shows that appellant did not comply with this provision of the ordinance within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>1&gt;ime thereby required \u2014 within sixty days after its approval and publication \u2014 as he never pretended to have \u2022or maintain on the street mentioned a sidewalk of stone, hard brick, or artificial stone. His testimony shows that he had a plank sidewalk, which, of course, \u2022did not meet the requirement of the ordinance. Under the structure of the bill and proofs we need not 'Consider the question of the sufficiency of the notice given by the board of public works, as the appellant \u2022did not construct, have or maintain, within the time required by the ordinance, such a sidewalk, on the street mentioned, as he was required to have, and under the provisions of the ordinance the city had the \u2022right, without any notice at all, to construct the sidewalk, upon the failure of appellant to do so within the -sixty days after the approval and publication of the \u2022ordinance. The ordinance gives the city a lien for the \u25a0cost of the construction of the sidewalk, and the proof \u2022shows that it was constructed, after the time mentioned, in compliance with the ordinance under a con-firact by the board of public works, and was paid for ibjr the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">An order will be entered affirming the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
