It does not appear by the said declaration that the term \u201cline,\u201d as used in the telephone business, is the same as when used in the law of the State of Florida, imposing said license tax. 2d. It does not appear by the said declaration that there are less than twenty-five miles of telephone line, within the meaning of the law, within the city of Pensacola. 3d. It does not appear by the said declaration that there are less than twenty-five miles of telephone line in the county of Escambia, within the meaning of the law. 4th. It appears by the allegations in the said declaration that plaintiff\u2019 s telephone lines within the city of Pensacola are more than twenty-five miles in length. 5th.

Had \u201cwire\u201d been intended by the Legislature, that word could have been used, and all ambiguity avoided; while if the broader meaning was intended, the language employed was that which a telephone man would use to express it-, and the only one which will do so without circumlocution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-8\">In case of doubt as to the construction to be placed upon a statute imposing a charge upon a subject, as \u2022do tax laws, that meaning will be adopted which most favors the subject: Cooley on Tax, 266-9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-9\">BRIEF OB .\u00a1OHM K. IIARTRIIX\u00cdE.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-10\">So far as our personal range of investigation has extended no cases have been found that decide in terms the meaning of the word \u201cline\u201d as used in relation to telephone companies. Cases do exist, however, in. which, where other points have been raised, the courts in their decisions have spoken of telephone lines, and In these cases they speak of them on the theory of all of their component parts malting the line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-11\">In the case of Central Pennsylvania Telephone &amp; Supply Company vs. Wilkes Barre &amp; W. S. R'y Co., 11 Pa. Co. Ct. R. 417, they speak of its being the duty of a telephone company using a highway for its poles and wires to maintain its line, etc., thus show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ing that neither the wire nor the poles separately constitute the line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">So in the case of People vs. Dolan (N. Y.), 27th N. E. Rep. 269, and People vs. Kierney, Id., it was held that the interests in the land on which the poles stood, the right of license to erect such poles on the land, and all poles, arms, insulators, wires, apparatus, instrument, or other thing connected with or used, constituted the line. This was a telegraph case, but it gives emphasis to the contention here, that the poles show the distance of the line. Otherwise, if we take the length of the w-ire around the poles and on its. arms and in all respects used in connection with the line, we would make a distance between two cities from and to which a telephone line extended much greater than the poles, and yet the distance of the transmission of a message would only be that covered by the poles. This, it seems to us, would show the fallacy of taking the wire as a criterion of length.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">The electric street railway cogently illustrates the soundness of our contention. The rails of an electric railway covering the distance of ten miles would require the use of a length of wire \u2019much greater than ten miles to operate it. Yo one, however, would think of calling the road a \u00f1fteen-mile road simply because the wires in use extended in a direct line \u2022would cover the latter distance. The distance to which passengers and freights are transported, being: the length of the rail, forms the crucial test of measurement, and not the wires strung upon the poles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-7\">If a telephone line were bonded on its mileage, does any one for a moment think that the length of' the wires in use taken as an entirety would form the basis upon which securities would be issued? The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>most guileless lamb ever fleeced in Wall Street would recognize the absurdity of such a proposition. The logical sequence of every chain of thought germinated in regard to the proper meaning of the word \u201cline\"\u2019 in the statute, we earnestly insist, points out the fallacy of che tax collector's position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">The second contention of this case, that the levy made by the collector was taking property without due process of law, we think well founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">In the case of Johnson, Tax Collector, vs. Armour et al., decided April 19th, 1893, Supreme Court of Florida, the decision in the lower cou&gt;\u2019t was based on the ground that the tax was illegal for the reason that the act gives no opportunity to a dealer for a hearing as to the value of his business. The Supreme Court, while putting their decision upon another ground, did not gainsay the soundness of the ground upon which tile- decision was based in the lower court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">- In that case, it being the same ninth section of the /act of 1891. under consideration in this case, the section complained of provides \u201cthat all dealers in dressed meats doing a business of $2\u00bb,000.00 or more per annum shall pay a license of $500.00.\u201d No method is provided in the act for ascertaining the amount of business done by dealers in dressed meats. To seize the property of a tax payer for refusing to pay was the arrogation to himself by the collector of the power to determine who were within the class of dealers who did a business of $25,000.00 or over per year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">In the case at bar it is necessary for the tax collector to decide what constitutes a line of telephone in order to establish its mileage. If he decides that the poles on which the wires are strung constitute the dis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>4an.ce of the line the license will be one amount, while if he decides that the sum of the length of all the wires in use constitute the line the license tax will be a larger amount. The fact that a question of this character is left to the decision of the tax collector and no method provided in the act for the establishment of the meaning of the word \u201cline\u201d ns used in the act, \u25a0makes the tax illegal, or at all events, makes the effort to collect by seizure without a defendant first having had. the opportunity of being heard illegal and unconstitutional. The fact that this case is before the court today on this question gives emphasis to this contention. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-6\">If this argument is not sound, then we would be placed in the attitude. of the collector of one county giving one construction to the word \u201cline,\u201d and in another county a different definition being given, the'telephone companies would pay a different license in different counties on similar mileages. This lack of liar^ monv can only be prevented and the act uniformly en-\u25a0 forced as to amounts collected, by the statute giving the word a definite construction, or the collectors resorting to the courts to compel payment of the tax by .-suit and obtaining an adjudication of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-7\">We do not mean to say that in all instances the tax \u25a0assessor is robbed of the exercise of his judgment. For instance, he has the right to place valuations upon properties, and this is an exercise of his judgment, and a constitutional one. But the very act of the Legislature which gives him this authority at the same time provides a method for reviewing the assessments he may make and have determined the valuations where \u25a0error is complained of. No such opportunity is given <em>to </em>the telephone companies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We do not. contend that summary process for the collection of taxes is obnoxious to the constitutional provision regarding due process of law. But the tax payer must have a remedy afforded him by notice and an opportunity to be heard. Any legislative act which seeks to take his property under the guise of tax dues or license dues to the State, and which leaves the mat - ter to the judgment of the tax officer without providing any method for the tax payer to be heard, is taking his property without due process of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">\u2018Tf any question of fact or liability under any legislative, enactment is conclusively presumed against the tax payer, it is not due process of law.\u201d Ziegler vs. S. <em>&amp; </em>N. A. R. Co., 58th Ala. 594; Wilburn vs. McCalley, 63d Ala. 436.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">Section 10 of the act makes failure to pay a misdemeanor and provides for the punishment of the delinquent. Criminal statutes must be strictly construed. We are placed here by this act at the mercy of the tax collector, both as to our property and our liberty. If this is a constitutional method of deciding. what constitutes a line of telephone of <em>25 </em>miles or more, then the tax collector can, without any hearing upon the part of defendant, seize his property and have him arrested and prosecuted for a misdemeanor. Before such dire consequence should come to a citizen\u2019s property or his person, there should be some constitutional method of determining his rights. The absence of a provision as a condition precedent to the enforcement of the act by the tax collector\u2019s adjudication of what \u2022 does or does not constitute a line of telephone, renders it illegal and the tax only collectible by a suit at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">We contend that in this case the only manner in \u25a0which the license tax could be collected would be by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>a suit at law bringing the delinquent into court and having his rights heard and determined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>John U.

The office of a proviso is to restrain the enacting clause; to except something which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>otherwise be within it, or in some manner to modify it, and where it follows and restricts an enacting-clause general in its scope and language it is to be construed strictly and limited to objects fairly within its terms. United States vs. Dickson, 15 Peters, 141; McRae vs. Holcomb, 46 Ark. 306; Bragg vs. Clark, 50 Ala. 363; Epps vs. Epps, 17 Ill. App. 196; State <em>ex rel. </em>McQuaid vs. Commissioners of Duval County, 23 Fla. 483, 3 South. Rep. 193. Rearing in mind these elementary rules of construction, we have no hesitancy in holding that upon the allegations of plaintiff's declaration its telephone plant was subject to the license tax imposed by the enacting clause of the statute quoted; and that as to its plant the exception created by the proviso did not apply. The purpose of the statute was to require a license tax of $100 from every telephone company operating a plant in the State, except plants having a line of less than twenty-five miles in length, which were to be taxed $25 only. The proviso was inserted in the statutes for the benefit of \u25a0companies owning small plants, from the operation of which the profits derived would not justify the payment of so large a license as $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A <em>line </em>is defined by Webster\u2019s International Dictionary as \u201ca wire connecting one telegraphic station with another, or the whole of a system of telegraph wires under one management and name;\u201d and by the Century Dictionary as \u201ca telegraph wire between stations, forming with them the circuit.\u201d A <em>plant </em>is defined by the Century Dictionary as \u201cthe fixtures, machinery, tools, apparatus, appliances, <em>etc., </em>necessary' to carry on any trade or mechanical business, or any mechanical operation or process.\u201d The plaintiff admits that its wires ran from the central office to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>individual subscribe!\u2019, a separate wire and instrument for each subscriber, and that by means of a call wire-in .the central office the wires leading to any two subscribers could be connected together, and it is not denied by the declaration that if the word <em>line </em>was used by the Legislature in its popular sense, the plaintiff\u2019s line would exceed twenty five miles in length. We-think the Legislature used the word in its popular-sense, and not technically as defined in the declaration. If we adopt such technical meaning, we have the unfair result of taxing a telephone plant $25 only which owns many lines of posts a few miles long, supporting-independent wires connected at the central office only, and supplying perhaps several hundred subscriber in a populous community, while another plant in a less populous community, owning a few lines of posts several miles in length, supplying perhaps a tenth as-many subscribers, is required to pay a license tax of $100. The Legislature could have intended no such result. A line though supported by posts supporting-other lines is none the less a line. If the length of two lines running parallel within a few feet of each other, supported by separate posts, supplying separate-customers on the same street are to be added in estimating the length of telephone lines, as is not denied by the plaintiff, we are unable to see why a different rule should prevail where the same conditions exist except that the same posts are used to support both-lines. Ey giving to the statute the construction <em>we </em>adopt, we are carrying out the intention of the Legislature to reduce the license tax to be paid - by companies deriving small profit from their investment, while-by adopting the construction contended for by plaintiff, this intention would not only be disregarded, but-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>entirely frustrated. While it is true, as a general rule, that popular words are to be construed in the popular sense, and technical words in a technical sense, when used in a statute, yet when a word has both a popular and a technical meaning, the court will give it effect according to the popular signification if it was so used by the Legislatui\u2019e, and the context may be referred to in ascertaining the, sense in which it was used. Green vs. Weller, 32 Miss. 650; Cummings vs. Coleman, 7 Rich. Eq. 509, S. C. 62 Am. Dec. 402; People vs. Tighe, 5 Hun. 25; State <em>ex rel. </em>Owens, vs. Barnes, 24 Fla. 153, 4 South. Rep. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The plaintiff also contends that the seizure of its property by the collector under subdivision 16 of section 9 of the act referred to, for failure of the plaintiff to pay the license tax of $100 demanded by defendant, was \u201can arrogation of judicial power.\u201d and constituted the taking of plaintiff\u2019s property without due process of law; and that plaintiff was entitled to recover upon that theory. As to this contention it is sufficient to say that the declaration does not claim damages for any illegal act of the defendant or trespass committed by him against the plaintiff\u2019s property. It specifically seeks to recover only .the difference between the amount of money paid by plaintiff to defendant and the 1 Icense tax legally due for a telephone line of less than twenty-five miles in length, because, as it alleges, this difference was not justly chargeable to plaintiff, and was paid by it under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We find no error in the record, and, therefore, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
