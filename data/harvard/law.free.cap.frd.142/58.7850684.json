Kane (but previously litigated in California), and the details of individual claims require resolution. The attorneys representing the parties have the requisite skill and experience to negotiate a fair settlement without further trials. These cases can and should be settled now on terms fair to both the plaintiffs and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Individual trials of the hundreds of pending DES cases would require more than fifty judge-years and thousands of jurors. Delays would adversely affect plaintiffs who have not had speedy dispositions of their claims; add to the costs of defendants, both in heavy jury verdicts and unnecessary transactional costs in discovery, trials and appeals; unnecessarily burden jurors, witnesses and parties; and require large expenditures of court resources which are in short supply and are required for other purposes, including criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Accordingly, the Supreme Court of the State of New York and the United States District Court jointly appoint Kenneth R. Feinberg, Esq., as Referee and Special Master for DES cases. His appointment as a Referee is made pursuant to sections 4301 <em>et seq. </em>of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and as Special Master pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The powers of Settlement Master and Referee are for relevant purposes equivalent. The shared problems of the two court systems and the litigants requires a joint appointment and close cooperation between the state and federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Mr. Feinberg has special expertise, competence, and experience as a Special Master and Referee. He will assist the parties and the courts in promptly settling these cases subject to further orders of the courts. Fees will be based upon rates and procedures approved in <em>In re Joint Eastern &amp; Southern Dists. Asbestos Litig., In re New York City Asbestos Litig., </em>129 F.R.D. 434, 435 (E.D.N.Y.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The parties are directed to meet forthwith with Mr. Feinberg. They will assist him and each other in the prompt disposition of these cases without trial. The courts reserve the power to take such further steps as may appear to be desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
