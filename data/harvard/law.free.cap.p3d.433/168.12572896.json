We reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The parties were never married but have one child together who was born in 2004. A Georgia court entered a final order in 2011 and a modified parenting plan in 2012 concerning the child. In 2014, mother and the child relocated to Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2016, father petitioned to register the 2012 Georgia parenting plan in Colorado under section 14-13-305, C.R.S. 2018. Mother responded, arguing that both the parenting plan\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   2011 final order from Georgia needed to be registered in Colorado and co-petitioning to register both orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Father then filed a verified motion under section 14-10-129.5, C.R.S. 2018, alleging that mother was not permitting him to exercise his parenting time or contact the child. He requested a hearing and that the district court order additional terms to the parenting plan to ensure mother's compliance and that she pay his costs and attorney fees incurred in bringing the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mother opposed father's motion and moved to modify parenting time, arguing that the parties' circumstances had changed such that the Georgia parenting plan no longer served the child's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 At the final orders hearing, the district court entered an order registering the Georgia orders in Colorado and adopted the parties' stipulations for future parenting time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further found that it lacked jurisdiction to grant father the enforcement remedies he sought and denied his section 14-10-129.5 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Father's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction to Enforce the Georgia Orders\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Father contends that the district court erred in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and therefore denying his section 14-10-129.5 motion. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Legal Standards\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 We review de novo whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under the Uniform Child-custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) to enforce the Georgia parenting time orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brandt v.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1. Mootness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 Initially, we reject mother's argument that father's appeal of the denial of his enforcement motion is moot because the district court adopted the parties' stipulations to modify the Georgia parenting time orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 \"An issue is moot when a judgment, if rendered, would have no practical legal effect upon the existing controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Salby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993648\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/291/#p301\">\n    126 P.3d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (Colo. App. 2005). We will not render an opinion on the merits of an appeal that has become moot because of subsequent events.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993648\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/291/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding original parenting time orders moot because they were superseded by later\n   modifying orders such that an appellate decision on the original orders would have no practical legal effect).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 Father moved for specific remedies under section 14-10-129.5 after petitioning to register the Georgia orders in Colorado. He asked for make-up parenting time to account for the time he allegedly missed due to mother's actions, that mother attend a parental education program, that she post a bond to ensure her future compliance with parenting time, and that she pay his costs and attorney fees. His requests are not mooted by the modification order. Rather, they remain undecided and could have been ordered in addition to modification. Indeed, the statute contemplates modification as one potential remedy for a parenting time violation\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   other remedies, some of which father requested here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(b), (b.3), (c), (d) &amp; (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 Because father did not bring an independent action against mother for tortious interference with his parenting time, mother's additional mootness argument that a two-year statute of limitations would apply to such a claim is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2. Order Denying Father's Section 14-10-129.5 Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 On registering the Georgia orders, the district court was empowered to grant any enforcement relief normally available under Colorado law as to those orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-13-306(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-13-303(2). This includes section 14-10-129.5 remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18 Although, as mother argues, section 14-13-306 refers to the court's enforcement of \"a registered child-custody determination\" from another state,\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-13-305(3)(a), nothing in the statute prevents the court from registering the Georgia orders and then simultaneously beginning proceedings to enforce them. To the contrary, the UCCJEA contemplates \"a simultaneous request for enforcement\" when a parental responsibilities order from another state is registered in Colorado. \u00a7 14-13-305(1). Accordingly, father's enforcement request was not \"premature,\" nor was it \"a 'zombie' pleading that was filed but not legally recognized,\" as mother argues. Rather, after registering the Georgia parenting time orders, to which mother did not object, the district court was then required to evaluate father's concomitant enforcement motion, determine whether his allegations were adequate, and, if so, conduct a hearing and rule on his request for remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-10-129.5(1) - (2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 14-13-303, - 306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 19 Contrary to mother's argument, the district court did not\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   dismiss father's enforcement motion and\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   register the two Georgia orders. Rather, the court's written order and oral rulings reflect the opposite chronology-the court registered the orders before mistakenly concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to address father's section 14-10-129.5 motion. Thus, father was not required to renew his motion after registration as mother suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 20 The court's rationale for concluding that it lacked jurisdiction was that it could not consider a parenting time enforcement request related to events that happened before the parties even sought to register the Georgia orders in Colorado. The court contrasted this circumstance with child support where accumulated arrears from prior years can always be enforced even if they accumulated in another state. It found that when dealing with parenting time, \"[it] can't turn back time\" and \"create [a] forum during a time that [it] didn't have jurisdiction\" to enforce a denial of parenting time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 However, looking back to determine whether a parent failed to comply with parenting time and then imposing appropriate sanctions to redress the violation is precisely the remedy that section 14-10-129.5 provides for an aggrieved parent. On registration of the Georgia orders, father was entitled to seek the same remedies\n   <em>\n    as if those orders had been entered in Colorado\n   </em>\n   , including section 14-10-129.5 's backward-looking remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-13-306(1) &amp; official cmt. Accordingly, the court erred in denying his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 Mother's argument that such immediate enforcement of an order from another state is only allowed in emergency situations pursuant to section 14-13-308, C.R.S. 2018, is unpersuasive. That statute allows for an immediate\n   hearing and expedited enforcement of another state's order-\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   registration of the order-if necessary to ensure a child's safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993648\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/291/#p301\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Colorado courts still have a duty to enforce another state's orders, and the UCCJEA permits courts, on registering such orders, to enforce them through any remedy available under Colorado law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 14-13-303, - 305(1), (3)(a), - 306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23 We also reject mother's contention that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because section 14-13-305(3)(a) provides that \"a registered determination is enforceable as of the date of the registration in the same manner as a determination issued by a court of this state.\" If this provision were interpreted as mother suggests, it would eviscerate the meaning of section 14-13-306(1), discussed above, which provides that a Colorado court \"may grant any relief normally available under [Colorado law] to enforce a registered child-custody determination made by a court of another state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 24 The order is reversed, and the case is remanded for the district court to address father's section 14-10-129.5 motion and, if appropriate, set a hearing to determine his request for sanctions, including attorney fees and costs under section 14-10-129.5(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 25 The provisions of the court's order adopting the parties' stipulations to modify parenting time were not appealed and thus remain undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   JUDGE TERRY and JUDGE FOX concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The parties stipulated that the district court had jurisdiction to register the Georgia orders in Colorado. However, they disagreed as to whether the Colorado court had jurisdiction to enforce the prior Georgia orders.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
