Waltz Healing Center, Inc. applied for a certificate then but did not receive one. The Department later determined it could issue 31 more certificates and opened another application process in July 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Under the law, dispensary certificate applications must contain certain information, including the physical address of the proposed dispensary, and:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [i]f the city, town or county in which the nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary would be located has enacted zoning restrictions, a sworn statement certifying that the registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary is in compliance with the restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804(B)(1)(d).

With its application, Waltz submitted a letter dated May 8, 2012, from a senior planner in the Tempe Community Development Department, Planning Division. The letter, which was on City letterhead, stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   For the purpose of zoning clearance, the City of Tempe ... has determined the site ... is in compliance with the Zoning and Development Code ... for a medical marijuana dispensary only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   This determination is contingent on compliance with the following conditions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1.

An expiration of the State's application process will result in expiration of this determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 19, 2016, the Department emailed Waltz a formal request for information, saying \"some items need to be corrected or are missing\" from its application. The email identified 17 missing or incorrect items in the Waltz application packet,\n   including three deficiencies concerning zoning documentation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   8. The local jurisdiction zoning documentation of the dispensary's proposed physical address does not appear to be from the local jurisdiction (i.e., no letterhead, no contact information, no signature, etc).

The local jurisdiction zoning documentation of the dispensary's proposed physical address does not include one of the following statements: \"There are no local zoning restrictions for the dispensary's location\" or \"The dispensary's location is in compliance with any local zoning restrictions.\" R9-17-304(C)(6)(a) and (b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   10. The local jurisdiction zoning documentation of the dispensary's proposed physical address does not include the dispensary's proposed physical address. R9-17-304(C)(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 6 On October 3, 2016, the last day to respond to the Department's request, Waltz responded to items 8-10 above simply by referring to the 2012 letter from the City of Tempe and provided the Department with another copy of the letter. At 11:36 a.m. the following day, the Department emailed Waltz that \"[t]he information [Waltz] provided does not satisfy\" the three deficiencies. The email further directed Waltz to \"submit current local zoning\" by 5 p.m. Waltz did not submit any other information to the Department, nor did it attempt to contact the City of Tempe or the Department to resolve the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Department allocated the new certificates among the successful applicants a few days later. In a subsequent letter to Waltz, the Department stated it denied Waltz's application because Waltz did not fully respond to the Department's September 19 request for information. In particular, the Department identified Waltz's failure to provide the information identified in item 9 above, documentation from the local jurisdiction addressing zoning restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 8 Waltz sought administrative review of the denial of its application. After an evidentiary hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") recommended affirming the denial. The Director of the Department then adopted the recommendation, with certain modifications, and affirmed the denial of the application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Waltz appealed the decision by filing a complaint in the superior court, which affirmed the decision. Waltz timely appealed.

Sufficiency of the 2012 Letter.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 10 The Department denied Waltz's application because it concluded Waltz failed to comply with the mandate of \u00a7 36-2804(B)(1)(d) and R9-17-304(C)(6) to provide documentation that the dispensary would comply with local zoning requirements. Waltz argues the Department's denial of its application was arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion because the 2012 Tempe letter satisfied the requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 11 As the Department points out in its answering brief, the letter from the City of\n   Tempe stated that its \"determination\" of zoning compliance would expire (1) if Waltz did not submit a dispensary application to the Department within 60 days after the date of the letter and, in any event, (2) upon expiration of the Department's application process. Waltz argues the letter did not expire because Waltz in fact submitted an application for a dispensary certificate within 60 days of the date of the letter, as the letter required. The Department does not dispute that Waltz applied for a dispensary certificate in 2012. It argues, however, that the letter's determination expired due to the termination of the 2012 application process, which, according to the record, ended on August 7, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Department did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily or capriciously by concluding that the letter Waltz submitted had expired by 2016. The letter plainly stated that \"expiration of the State's application process will result in expiration of this determination.\" The \"application process\" then ongoing was the process for which Waltz originally had obtained the letter, namely, the Department's allocation of dispensary registration certificates in 2012. Waltz does not argue otherwise. Because the letter had expired by its own terms long before 2016, it failed to comply with the zoning-determination requirement of A.A.C. R9-17-304(C)(6).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tucson Title Ins. Co. v.

The Department adopted the ALJ's conclusion that \"[t]he sensible (and plain) reading of R9-17-304(C)(6) is that the applicant must show that the dispensary's location complies with any local zoning requirements at the time the application is submitted to the Department (i.e., that the location is currently in compliance).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 14 Waltz argues on appeal that the Tempe letter specifically stated that Waltz \"is in compliance\" with local zoning requirements, which is all the law requires. The Department responds in its answering brief by pointing out that Tempe zoning regulations changed between 2012 and 2016, and argues the 2012 letter therefore said nothing about whether the Waltz dispensary location was in compliance with zoning in 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C.

The dated nature of the letter-it was more than four years old when Waltz submitted it in 2016-by itself calls into question whether the letter gave satisfactory assurances that the proposed dispensary would comply with Tempe zoning restrictions in 2016. More than that, however, Steve White, an attorney who helped prepare Waltz's 2016 application, acknowledged during the administrative hearing that Tempe amended its zoning restrictions applicable to medical marijuana dispensaries after the 2012 letter was issued. The fact that the zoning changed after the letter was written in 2012 further supports the Department's conclusion that the letter did not satisfy the requirement to show that the proposed dispensary location would comply with current zoning requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. October 4, 2016 Email.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 18 Waltz further argues it lacked adequate notice of the Department's view that the 2012 letter would not comply with the local-zoning requirement. Waltz contends the Department's formal request for information, sent on September 19, 2016, did not explicitly reject the letter or state that it had expired. According to Waltz, when Waltz resubmitted the 2012 letter in response to the September 19 request, Waltz believed it had resolved the Department's concerns. Waltz argues the Department did not demand \"current\" zoning documentation from Waltz until the email late the morning of October 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 19 The September 19 request for information listed three issues concerning the letter from the City of Tempe. The Department did not specify that the 2012 letter was deficient because it had expired or because it did not provide assurances that the proposed location would comply with zoning restrictions in effect in 2016. Although more specificity would have been helpful, the Department's September 19 request stated clearly that Waltz had not satisfied the requirement of R9-17-304(C)(6) to provide \"local jurisdiction zoning documentation.\" Thereby on notice that the Department had found the 2012 Tempe letter wanting, Waltz did not follow up with the Department for specifics, ask for an explanation or ask how it might solve the problem. Instead, just before the deadline to respond to the Department's request, Waltz simply resubmitted the same letter that the Department had rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 20 As stated above, by its own terms, the letter from the City had expired, and due to the passage of time, it did not satisfy the requirement to provide assurances that a dispensary location would comply with then-current zoning restrictions. These defects should have been obvious to Waltz, but if Waltz did not understand why the Department was questioning the letter on September 19, it should have inquired. Having failed to do so, Waltz cannot complain of lack of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 21 Waltz also argues the October 4 email, which gave Waltz until the end of the day to respond, was a supplemental request for information to which Waltz was entitled an additional ten days to respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R9-17-107(E)(2) (when Department issues \"supplemental request for information,\" applicant's response is due within ten working days). The Department, on the other hand, contends the communication was a \"courtesy\" email that did not trigger a mandatory ten-day response period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22 Under A.A.C. R9-17-107(D)(3), the Department \"[m]ay make one written comprehensive request for more information, unless the Department and the applicant agree in writing to allow the Department to submit supplemental requests for information.\" Here, Waltz checked a box on its application\n   agreeing to allow the Department to submit supplemental requests for information. As the Director noted in amending the ALJ's findings of fact, \"The Department emails RFIs [requests for information] using a distinct computer-generated form that is titled 'Request for Information.' \" The October 4 email was not that, but instead was a brief stand-alone email sent to Waltz's attorney, the subject line of which was \"Waltz Healing Center, Inc./Application ... / Response to Request for Information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23 We conclude the October 4 email did not constitute a supplemental request for information under the regulation because it merely restated-albeit more clearly-that the Tempe letter Waltz had submitted did not satisfy R9-17-304(C)(6). In any event, Waltz has failed to present any evidence that it would have been able to comply with R9-17-304(C)(6) within ten days after the email. At the hearing, White testified that if the Department had made it clear to Waltz on September 19 that the 2012 letter was insufficient, Waltz would have tried to obtain another letter from the City of Tempe. As to whether the City would have provided Waltz with documentation of current zoning compliance, however, White responded, \"I don't know for sure if they would've, ... I don't know what they would've said.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In any event, even if we were inclined to address Waltz's equal-protection argument, the record contains insufficient evidence to support Waltz's contention that, by declining to accept the 2012 letter, the Department treated Waltz differently than other similarly situated applicants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3237667\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/212/308/#p313\">\n    212 Ariz. at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3237667\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/212/308/#p313\">\n    131 P.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 Waltz argues that the Department has \"accepted zoning documentation from other applicants that did not reflect 'current' zoning compliance when the dispensary registration certificates were issued.\" In support of that proposition, Waltz cites White's testimony that the Department accepted applications he had prepared for other clients using zoning letters from 2012. Waltz did not offer any corroborating evidence or further detail in support of that assertion, however, and a Department employee testified that the Department does not accept \"expired\" zoning letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 Waltz also cites evidence that a Department employee telephoned the City of Tempe about the Waltz application during the application process, and contends that, in other application contests, the Department has stated it \"does not check to see if the proposed dispensary location actually complies with local zoning restrictions.\" The record does not support Waltz's assertion that the Department violated its equal-protection rights by contacting the City of Tempe. To\n   begin with, Waltz does not argue that the Department is not allowed to confirm the reliability of an applicant's document when it doubts the document's pertinence. In fact, White testified that he had facilitated direct contact between the City of Tempe and the Department to resolve documentation issues with other applications. In any event, a Department employee testified he called the City to find out whether the 2012 letter was still current and about its \"expiration date,\" but did not ask whether Waltz's proposed site complied with then-current zoning restrictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 To support its argument that the Department acted contrary to the position it has publicly taken in other cases, Waltz cites a motion the Department filed in an unrelated lawsuit brought by another unsuccessful applicant. Waltz contends that in that case, the Department argued that it \"need only ensure that successful applicants for dispensary registration certificates ... provide an enumerated set of documents and information,\" and at the application stage, \"applicants are not required to demonstrate they currently meet the requirements to obtain approval to operate (i.e., that they have already obtained a special use permit or conditional use permit); they are required to demonstrate only that their location falls within a zoning classification that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   allow a dispensary to operate there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 The quoted statement is not inconsistent with the Department's position here that it checks an application to ensure an applicant has provided local zoning documentation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R9-17-304(C)(6), but does not check for additional documentation, such as a use permit or occupancy permit, that would be required before the applicant actually would be allowed to operate a dispensary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R9-17-305(A)(2). Here, the Department rejected Waltz's application because it failed to provide adequate zoning documentation in compliance with R9-17-304(C)(6) and not because Waltz could not currently prove that it could operate a dispensary under R9-17-305(A)(2).
