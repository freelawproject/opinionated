We conclude he is not. We further conclude that, because he is not eligible to file a petition under the Exoneration Statute, we need not address whether the court deprived him of his right to a jury trial under the statute. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's order granting the State's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 A jury convicted Abu-Nantambu-El (formerly known as Paul Delano McKnight, Jr.) of first degree sexual assault (a class 3 felony), second degree kidnapping (a class 2 felony), and third degree assault (a class 1 misdemeanor) in the same case, all arising out of an incident in which the victim claimed that Abu-Nantambu-El had raped her. His convictions were affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    People v. McKnight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10369132,10369247\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/813/331/\">\n    813 P.2d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Abu-Nantambu-El then filed a pro se Crim. P. 35(c) motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. He presented evidence that scientific testing was available during his trial and that his attorney never requested it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the postconviction proceedings, a scientific test was conducted and it ruled out Abu-Nantambu-El as the contributor of the semen sample found in the victim's underwear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The district court found that Abu-Nantambu-El's counsel provided ineffective assistance and that, but for the ineffective assistance, Abu-Nantambu-El would probably not have been convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault charges. The court vacated these two felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 However, the court also found that counsel's ineffective assistance had not affected Abu-Nantambu-El's third degree assault conviction, and it denied his Crim. P. 35(c) motion as to that conviction. The court's order was affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. McKnight\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 12 (Colo. App. No. 97CA1638, Jan. 14, 1999) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(f) ). The prosecution elected not to retry the felony counts, but Abu-Nantambu-El remains convicted of the misdemeanor in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Based on the order vacating his felony convictions, Abu-Nantambu-El filed a petition for compensation pursuant to the Exoneration Statute. The State filed a C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5) motion to dismiss, contending that Abu-Nantambu-El was not eligible to seek relief because (1) the order vacating the kidnapping and sexual assault convictions was based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, a ground \"unrelated to the petitioner's actual innocence\"; and (2) Abu-Nantambu-El remained convicted of third degree assault, and therefore he did not satisfy the portion of the statute requiring that \"all convictions in the case\" be vacated or reversed. The district court rejected the State's first argument, but agreed with its second argument and granted the motion to dismiss. The State did not cross-appeal the court's \"actual innocence\" finding, so the only issue we consider is the eligibility requirements for filing a petition for compensation under the Exoneration Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Abu-Nantambu-El contends that the district court erred when it concluded that his misdemeanor conviction precluded him from filing a petition under section 13-65-102(2)(a), C.R.S. 2017, because it was never vacated or reversed and remains on his record. He also contends that the court erred by rejecting his request for a jury trial under section 13-65-102(6)(b). We reject his first contention and therefore do not consider his second contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.

Eligibility Requirements for Filing a Petition for Compensation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 We begin by agreeing with Abu-Nantambu-El that the Exoneration Statute is aimed at compensating persons wrongfully convicted of and incarcerated for felonies. Indeed, section 13-65-102(1)(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of article 10 of title 24, C.R.S., a person who has been convicted of a felony in this state and sentenced to a term of incarceration as a result of that conviction and has served all or part of such sentence, or an immediate family member of such person, may be eligible for compensation as set forth in this article upon a finding that the person was actually innocent of the crime for which he or she was convicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thus, a person who is wrongfully convicted of a misdemeanor may not seek relief under section 13-65-102(1). However, it does not necessarily follow that when a person is convicted of both a felony and a misdemeanor, in the same case, the court should only consider the felony and disregard the misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 Section 13-65-102(2) sets forth the prerequisites for filing a petition for compensation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A petition may be filed pursuant to this section only:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) When no further criminal prosecution of the petitioner for the crimes charged, or for crimes arising from the same criminal episode in the case that is the subject of the petition, has been initiated by the district attorney or the attorney general and subsequent to one of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (I) A court vacating or reversing\n   <em>\n    all convictions in the case\n   </em>\n   based on reasons other than legal insufficiency of evidence or legal error unrelated to the petitioner's actual innocence and following an order of dismissal of all charges; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (II) A court vacating or reversing\n   <em>\n    all convictions in the case\n   </em>\n   based on reasons other than legal insufficiency of evidence or legal error unrelated to the petitioner's actual innocence and following an acquittal of all charges after retrial; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (b) Either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (I) If the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this subsection (2) are met on or after June 5, 2013, not more than two years after said conditions are met; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (II) If the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this subsection (2) are met before June 5, 2013, not more than two years after June 5, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 14 After satisfying these threshold eligibility requirements to file a petition, a petitioner must then satisfy additional requirements to be eligible for compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-65-102(4)(a)(I) (a person who does not meet the definition of actual innocence is\n   ineligible for compensation); \u00a7 13-65-102(4)(a)(II) (A person is ineligible if \"[h]e or she committed or suborned perjury during any proceedings related to the case that is the subject of the claim.\"); \u00a7 13-65-102(4)(a)(III) (A person is ineligible if, \"[t]o avoid prosecution in another case for which the petitioner has not been determined to be actually innocent, he or she pled guilty in the case that served as the basis for the conviction and incarceration that is the subject of the petition.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 15 The petition constitutes a civil claim for relief, \u00a7 13-65-102(1)(b), subject to the Colorado rules of civil procedure. \u00a7 13-65-102(5)(g). Upon receipt of a petition, the State may contest either the petitioner's actual innocence or the petitioner's eligibility for compensation. \u00a7 13-65-102(5)(d)(II). If the petition is contested, \"the district court shall set the matter for a trial to the district court or, at the written election of either party, to a trial to a jury of six.\" \u00a7 13-65-102(6)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 16 The only portion of the statute at issue here is the meaning of \"all convictions\" in section 13-65-102(2)(a)(I) and (II), because no one disputes that Abu-Nantambu-El remains convicted of third degree assault in the case at issue. Abu-Nantambu-El urges us to interpret \"all convictions\" to mean felony convictions. He reasons that because the Exoneration Statute addresses only wrongly convicted felons, the legislature could not have meant to include misdemeanor convictions within its parameters. His argument might have some force were we to consider this language in isolation, because he is correct that the Exoneration Statute was enacted to compensate wrongfully convicted felons. However, we must view the statute as a whole, and in doing so, we reject his interpretation for four reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 17 First, the legislature's use of the word \"felony\" in section 13-65-102(1)(a) convinces us that its use of \"all convictions\" in section 13-65-102(2)(a) is intended to be broader than merely felony convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Grand Junction v.

Like the \"all convictions\" language, \"crimes charged\" and \"crimes arising from the same criminal episode\" plainly encompass more than simply the felonies charged. If the filing requirements were limited to felony charges, the legislature would have so stated. Its choice of broader language evidences its intent to restrict the eligibility requirements for filing petitions for compensation to those cases in which a petitioner has been exonerated of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   charges, not just the felony charges.\n   <em>\n    Turbyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8332975\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/151/563/#p567\">\n    151 P.3d at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e cannot supply the missing language and must respect the legislature's choice of language.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 19 Third, we are not persuaded by Abu-Nantambu-El's contention that the word \"incarceration\" in section 13-65-102(1)(a) restricts\n   the language of subsection (2)(a) to felony convictions. This assertion is inconsistent with the definition of incarceration found in section 13-65-101(5), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Incarceration\" means a person's custody in a county jail or a correctional facility while he or she serves a sentence issued pursuant to a felony conviction in this state or pursuant to the person's adjudication as a juvenile delinquent for the commission of one or more offenses that would be felonies if committed by a person eighteen years of age or older. For the purposes of this section, \"incarceration\" includes placement as a juvenile to the custody of the state department of human services or a county department of social services pursuant to such an adjudication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 20 In our view, this definition recognizes that a person charged with a felony may remain incarcerated in a county jail pending a conviction and sentence. Our view is supported by the language of section 13-65-103(3)(a) entitling an exonerated person to receive compensation in the amount of \"seventy thousand dollars for each year that he or she was incarcerated for the felony of which he or she has been exonerated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 21 As Abu-Nantambu-El concedes, the purpose of the statute is to compensate those who are actually innocent for the time they spent wrongfully incarcerated. Abu-Nantambu-El's interpretation of \"incarceration\" would lead to the absurd result of compensating a wrongfully convicted person for the time he or she spent in the custody of the Department of Corrections but not for the time he or she spent awaiting that wrongful conviction in a county jail. Indeed, a person sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections is entitled, as a matter of law, to receive credit against the sentence for pretrial confinement in a county jail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18-1.3-405, C.R.S. 2017 (\"A person who is confined for an offense prior to the imposition of sentence for said offense is entitled to credit against the term of his or her sentence for the entire period of such confinement.\"). And we may not interpret a statute in a way that leads to absurd results.\n   <em>\n    Pineda-Liberato v. People\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12344099\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/403/160/\">\n    2017 CO 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12344099\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/403/160/\">\n    403 P.3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22 Fourth, Abu-Nantambu-El's contention is further undermined by the specific language of section 13-65-103 pertaining to the amount of compensation a qualified person may be awarded. In particular, section 13-65-103(3)(a) specifies annual compensation amounts for \"the felony of which he or she has been exonerated.\" The legislature's choice of the word \"felony\" in this provision supports our conclusion that its decision to use \"all convictions\" in the eligibility requirements provision encompasses more than felony convictions.\n   <em>\n    Pineda-Liberato\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22 (\"We also read the statutory scheme as a whole, giving consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all of its parts....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23 Reading the Exoneration Statute as a whole, we conclude that the General Assembly intended to require that \"all convictions in the case\" be vacated or reversed, including any misdemeanor convictions, in order for a petition for compensation to qualify for a district court's further consideration. Because we find the language unambiguous, we necessarily reject Abu-Nantambu-El's invitation to consider the statute's legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9320774\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/58/1013/#p1015\">\n    58 P.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24 Abu-Nantambu-El finally contends that he qualifies to file a petition under the Exoneration Statute because the misdemeanor conviction was factually unrelated to the felony conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25 First, Abu-Nantambu-El did not provide the record from his postconviction hearing as part of this appeal, and the burden is on an appellant to provide a record justifying reversal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-65-102(5)(f)(I) ; C.A.R. 10. Absent this record, we must assume that the district court's finding that all of the convictions arose out of the same incident is correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Gallegos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4645801\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/179/211/#p213\">\n    179 Colo. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4645801\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/179/211/#p213\">\n    499 P.2d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316 (1972) (\"No transcript of the evidence considered by the lower court was made a part of the record by appellant, and in the absence of any showing to the contrary we must presume that the findings are supported by the evidence presented to and considered by the court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 26 Second, the plain language of the petition eligibility provision, \u00a7 13-65-102(2)(a), does not distinguish between convictions arising from factually related and unrelated counts. Instead, the statute requires that \"all convictions\n   <em>\n    in the case\n   </em>\n   \" must have been vacated or reversed, not just those convictions factually related to the felony. \u00a7 13-65-102(2)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 27 Accordingly, we conclude that because Abu-Nantambu-El failed to satisfy the petition eligibility requirements set forth in section 13-65-102(2)(a), his petition did not state a plausible claim for relief. We therefore affirm the district court's ruling granting the State's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C. Right to Trial Under Section 13-65-102(6)(b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 Because we have concluded that Abu-Nantambu-El's petition did not meet the threshold requirements for a district court's further consideration, we reject his contention that the court erred in denying him a trial on the petition under section 13-65-102(6)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 29 The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   JUDGE BERNARD and JUDGE BERGER concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Between the district court's ruling and the appellate briefing, the United States Supreme Court held that the Exoneration Statute's requirement that a defendant prove his or her innocence by clear and convincing evidence to obtain a refund of costs, fees, and restitution paid pursuant to an invalid conviction does not comport with the defendant's right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    <em>\n     Nelson v.
