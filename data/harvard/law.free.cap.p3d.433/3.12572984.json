(\"Mother\") challenges the juvenile court's order denying her petition to\n   terminate the parental rights of Justin G. (\"Father\") to their son, J.G. Mother argues the court erroneously placed the burden on her to demonstrate that she personally made reasonable efforts to help Father overcome his alcohol abuse and reunify him with J.G. We hold that Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 8-533(B) does not require a private party seeking to terminate another's parental relationship to make affirmative efforts to reunify that parent, but only to show that necessary rehabilitative services were made available to the parent or it would have been futile.

After finding that \"Father's unawareness of his substance abuse issues ... shows that any attempts at [persuading him to seek help for his substance abuse issues] would likely have been futile,\" the court nonetheless declined to sever Father's parental rights because Mother failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family or show, notwithstanding its own earlier finding of likely futility, that such efforts would have been futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Mother filed a timely notice of appeal.

When a Private Party Petitions to Terminate Parental Rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Severance proceedings implicate the same fundamental constitutional liberty interests of a parent, whether commenced by DCS or a private party, because the object of the proceedings is the same-namely, a court-ordered permanent loss of the parent's relationship with the child. \"The combined effect of the fundamental character of a parent's right to his child and the severity and permanence of termination dictates that the court sever the parent-child relationship only in the most extraordinary circumstances, when all other efforts to preserve the relationship have failed.\"\n   <em>\n    Maricopa Cty.

But the question here is whether private parties seeking a severance must meet the same requirements as the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Mother sought severance based on A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(3), arguing that Father was \"unable to discharge parental responsibilities because of ... chronic abuse of ... alcohol.\" We conclude a private party seeking severance on that ground must show that the parent was offered reunification services or that such services would have been futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 To be clear, although the statute does not explicitly require private parties to prove that reasonable efforts at family reunification\n   have been made when seeking severance of parental rights on the basis of chronic substance abuse, we hold that in such a case, severance requires proof\n   <em>\n    that services were offered\n   </em>\n   , but the parent's alcohol abuse was not amenable to rehabilitative services, or that providing such services would be pointless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 We do not hold, however, that a private party seeking severance on grounds of alcohol abuse must herself have offered or provided those \"appropriate reunification services\" to the parent. As noted, A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B) expressly imposes that requirement on the State in certain situations, but the statute does not impose the same duty on a private party seeking severance. Accordingly, the private party need not necessarily attempt to persuade the parent to seek treatment, or seek treatment referrals for the parent, or attempt to coax the parent into services by offering some incentive in the hope rehabilitation will somehow materialize. We recognize that, unlike a government agency, private parties may not be in a position to make available to the parent the \"type of therapy [that] offer[s] the most hope for enabling the [parent] to carry out [their] parental responsibilities[,]\" nor can most private parties engage in the type of \"prolonged,\" painstaking efforts readily available to the State.\n   <em>\n    Maricopa Cty. Juv. Action No. JS-5209 &amp; JS-4963\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745122\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/178/#p189\">\n    143 Ariz. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745122\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/178/#p189\">\n    692 P.2d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 1984). Neither are private parties usually able to engage in the follow up necessary to sufficiently secure a service provider's medical or therapeutic records to adequately monitor the parent's progress, or lack thereof; nor should they be required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 Instead, the private party need only show that the parent whose rights are to be severed has either already received or been offered the necessary rehabilitative services from some provider to no avail or that engaging the parent in rehabilitative services would be futile. Evidence of efforts by the private party to encourage or induce the parent to participate in services may be offered by the private party seeking severance, but it is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III. Mother's Burden in This Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The juvenile court found \"Mother failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that she made reasonable efforts to reunify the family or that such efforts would have been futile,\" but also found \"Father's unawareness of his substance abuse issues, even today, shows that\n   <em>\n    any attempts at persuasion would likely have been futile\n   </em>\n   .\" We look to the record to resolve these inconsistent findings.

Mother has no authority to control Father because he is an adult and can make his own decision. She could not have forced Father to go to outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, alcoholics anonymous, or some other support group. For this reason,\n   <em>\n    the main efforts that Mother could have made would have been to try to persuade him\n   </em>\n   to seek treatment for his substance abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The court also found that, although Mother testified she talked to Father about his drinking and told him to get help and \"Father agreed that Mother and Father had spoken about Father's drinking, and that Mother told him he should not drink after work,\" that nonetheless Mother enabled Father's drinking when she assisted him in driving impaired by blowing into the breathalyzer machine installed on his vehicle and that \"she never requested that Father be ordered, [in the family court case,] to treatment or counseling.\" Therefore, it found \"Mother did not take reasonable efforts to help Father address his alcohol abuse issues, and thereby reunify the family (Father and [J.G.] ).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 In determining whether efforts to assist Father would have been futile, the court stated there was \"no evidence to suggest that\n   it would have been futile for Mother to have offered Father unsupervised parenting time if he successfully an [sic] completed alcohol abuse treatment[,]\" and that there was \"no evidence that asking the Court to condition parenting time on providing clean alcohol tests and obtaining alcohol abuse treatment would not have been futile.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Contrary to the court's findings at \u00b6 18\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   the record contains ample evidence to suggest Father's parenting time had already been adversely affected by his substance abuse. The frequency, location and supervised nature of his parenting time were the result of his alcohol abuse, and yet, those limitations did not cause him to address his alcohol abuse issues. Also, Mother testified that in the parties' family court case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother asked the court to deny Father parenting time because his chronic alcohol abuse made him unfit to parent. Further, as her petition alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Domestic violence has occurred between the parties. He drinks almost every night and can become violent when he drinks. He will come home drinking after leaving the gym. He does not spend time with our son or attempt to have a parent/child relationship. He has a breathalyzer installed in his vehicle. He has an interest in different women, and not having the parent/child relationship has ended the relationship. I feel our son deserves better.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 In that contested proceeding Mother was awarded sole legal decision-making authority over J.G. and Father was granted parenting time, but only when supervised by a third party as approved by Mother. The juvenile court heard testimony from J.G.'s maternal grandfather and his wife. The two grandparents relocated to Lake Havasu to serve as third party supervisors of Father's parenting time with J.G. They both testified to the need for their relocation to assist with parenting time supervision, that during a visit Father arrived smelling of alcohol, \"that he just sat there on the bench ... was just all sprawled over, had [an] energy drink in his hand, eyes bloodshot, just ... he wasn't interacting at all.\" Given the previous family court proceedings, Father was well aware that his chronic alcohol consumption affected his parenting time and was the reason for the supervised nature of the visits. The findings that there was \"no evidence to suggest that it would have been futile for Mother to have offered Father unsupervised parenting time, if he successfully an [sic] completed alcohol abuse treatment,\" and that there was \"no evidence that asking the Court to condition parenting time on providing clean alcohol tests and obtaining alcohol abuse treatment would not have been futile\" are not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 In contrast, the record most assuredly supports the juvenile court's finding that \"Father's unawareness of his substance abuse issues, even today, shows that any attempts at persuasion would likely have been futile.\" As previously stated at \u00b6 7,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in this case Mother was required to prove all elements of A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(3), and she was also separately required to establish the futility of making attempts at reunification. The court found that all of the elements of A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(3) were established when it found that Father has a \"history of alcohol abuse,\" that his \"alcohol abuse causes him to be unable to discharge parental responsibilities,\" and that \"there is a reasonable belief that the chronic alcohol abuse will continue.\" In light of our holding that Mother did, in fact, establish the futility of making reunification attempts, the result is that the statutory ground alleged is now proven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV.
