Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7\u00a7 36-751 (2018), -752 (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature has granted the Department broad authority to \"[d]efine and describe ... the duties and limitations of the practice of midwifery [and] [a]dopt standards with respect to the practice of midwifery designed to safeguard the health and safety of the mother and child.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-755(B) (2018). In 1994, the Department issued detailed rules for the licensing of midwives, circumscribing the services a midwife may perform and imposing requirements for documenting and reporting patient information.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Admin. Code (\"A.A.C.\") R9-16-101 to - 117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In 2012, after lobbying by the Arizona Association of Midwives, the legislature passed and the governor signed House Bill (\"H.B.\") 2247, which, in relevant part, provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   A. On or before July 1, 2013, the [Department] shall consider adopting rules regarding midwifery that concern the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Reducing the regulatory burden on midwives who are licensed [by the Department] ... and streamlining the regulation process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.

Any party that is interested in increasing the scope of practice of midwifery must submit a report to the director of the [Department] that contains the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. A definition of the problem and why an increase in the scope of practice is necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2.

The extent to which an increase in the scope of practice may harm the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   C. On receipt of the report prescribed in subsection B of this section, the director shall appoint a midwifery scope of practice advisory committee to assist the director in adopting and amending rules related to midwifery scope of practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   H.B. 2247, 2012 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 93, \u00a7 1 (2d Reg. Sess.). The measure also provided that, upon receipt of a report proposing an increase in the scope of practice, the \"scope of practice advisory committee\" must hold a public meeting to receive comments and thereafter must make recommendations concerning \"proposed rules relating to a change in the scope of practice.\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(C) &amp; (E). Finally, upon receipt of the advisory committee's recommendations, the Department \"shall conduct a public meeting to receive comment on the final draft of the proposed rules.\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b64 After receiving two reports urging expansion of the midwifery scope of practice, the Department created an advisory committee and ultimately issued revised regulations in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 Ariz.

The Department, on the other hand, argues the word \"revise\" in \u00a7 1(A)(2) granted it broad authority to change the rules and that subsections B, C and D merely described the process it would need to follow if someone proposed an increase in the scope of the practice of midwifery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b611 We begin with the first sentence of the measure, which directed the Department to \"consider adopting rules regarding midwifery that concern ... revising the midwifery scope of practice pursuant to subsections B, C and D of this section.\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(A)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, the measure did not require the Department to issue\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   new or amended rules, but only to \"consider adopting\" rules. Moreover, contrary to Cleckner's contention, nothing in that mandate specified that the Department must\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   \"the midwifery scope of practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612 Cleckner's argument is anchored in \u00a7 1(A)(2)'s reference to \u00a7 1(B), which she contends reflected the legislature's intent that the Department adopt rules that would expand the permissible scope of midwifery practice, not restrict it. Section 1(B) stated that \"[a]ny party that is interested in increasing the scope of practice of midwifery must submit a report\" to the Department that identifies \"the problem and why an increase in the scope of practice is necessary,\" including how it would benefit consumers and the \"extent to which an increase in the scope of practice may harm the public.\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(B)(1), (3). Upon submission of such a\n   report, \u00a7 1(C) required the Department to \"appoint a midwifery scope of practice advisory committee to assist the director in adopting and amending rules related to midwifery scope of practice.\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(C). And \u00a7 1(D) provided that advisory committee members would not be compensated. H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b613 As shown, subsections B, C and D only imposed procedural requirements on the Department's rulemaking; they did not limit its discretion in determining the substance of any new or amended rules. Cleckner relies on the use of the word \"increase\" in \u00a7 1(B), but that provision merely ensured that advocates of expanding midwifery services would have a voice in the rulemaking process the measure contemplated. H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(B). Cleckner's argument is further undermined by \u00a7 1(E), which provided that the advisory committee would recommend proposed rules \"relating to a change in the scope of practice\" without specifying the nature of that change. H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(E). In other words, contrary to Cleckner's contention, the measure did not direct the Department to expand the midwifery scope of practice, but instead allowed the Department to exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the scope of practice within the limits imposed by other law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b614 Cleckner, however, asserts the legislature made plain that it intended the Department to expand the scope of midwifery when lawmakers set out the procedures (report, advisory committee, hearing) the Department must follow when it received a request to increase the scope of practice. We do not construe those provisions in H.B. 2247 as a legislative mandate to expand the scope of midwifery. To the contrary, when midwives and their supporters lobbied for an expanded scope of practice, the legislature responded by establishing a process by which the Department would apply its particular skill and expertise in considering the issues the midwives raised.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sec. &amp; Exch.

R9-16-101(20) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    AA.C. R9-16-108(I). Cleckner also alleged other changes in A.A.C. R9-16-108(B), (D)(2) and (J)(4) reduce the scope of practice by imposing new certification requirements for a midwife to attend a breech birth and by requiring cervical exams at specified intervals during labor. The Department argued in the superior court that the regulations do not narrow the permissible scope of the midwifery practice, but we will assume the truth of Cleckner's contrary allegations without deciding them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cullen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425201\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/417/#p419\">\n     218 Ariz. at 419, \u00b6 7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425201\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/417/#p419\">\n     189 P.3d at 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The measure also directed the Department to consider adopting rules \"[r]educing the regulatory burden\" on licensed midwives and \"streamlining the regulation process,\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(A)(1). It further directed the Department to consider \"adopting national licensure testing standards,\" H.B. 2247 \u00a7 1(A)(3). On appeal, Cleckner makes no argument concerning those provisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
