The respondent timely filed an answer to the complaint on April 24, 2018. Stipulations signed by respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator were filed June 4, 2018. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on June 5, 2018, where the respondent was personally present and was represented by counsel. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

Lawyers must provide competent representation to their clients. KRPC 1.1. 'Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.' The respondent did not provide competent representation to N.H. when he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for the first time on appeal without first having requested a\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   hearing. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \" KRPC 1.3\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"36.

The respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent N.H. when he failed to request a\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   hearing and when he failed to timely notify N.H. of the Court of Appeals' decision. The respondent's failure to timely notify N.H. of the Court of Appeals' decision left little time to take action. Because the respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his client, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \" KRPC 1.4\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"37. KRPC 1.4(a) provides that '[a] lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.' In this case, the respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) when he\n   failed to respond to N.H.'s letters. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.4(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \" KRPC 1.5\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"38. KRPC 1.5 provides that '[a] lawyer's fee shall be reasonable.' It is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable for the respondent to take\n   $45,000 in attorney's fees from an estate without prior court approval. The hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \" KRPC 1.15\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"39. Lawyers must keep the property of their clients safe. See KRPC 1.15. In this case, the respondent failed to properly safeguard his client's property when he took $45,000 from the estate without the permission of the court.

The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   In this case, the respondent violated KRPC 1.16(d) when he abandoned his representation of N.H. He took no action to protect N.H.'s interests after the Court of Appeals' decision and he did not notify N.H. that he was no longer providing any representation. The hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.16(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \" KRPC 3.3(a)(1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"41. 'A lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer.'

In this case, the respondent filed accountings in the estate case but failed to include entries that detailed the eight checks he wrote himself which totaled $45,000 and the repayment of the $45,000 from his attorney trust account. By filing pleadings with the court which contained false information, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent knowingly made false statements of fact to the court in violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"Rule 8.4(b)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"42.

In reaching its recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel, in this case, found the following mitigating circumstances present:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Personal or Emotional Problems if Such Misfortunes Have Contributed to Violation of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct\n   </em>\n   . The respondent suffers from depression. Additionally during the relevant time period, the respondent's son had a serious accident, the respondent's father was gravely ill, and the respondent's father passed away. It is clear that the respondent's personal problems contributed to his misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Timely Good Faith Effort to Make Restitution or to Rectify Consequences of Misconduct\n   </em>\n   .

The respondent is an active and productive member of the bar of Southeast Kansas. The respondent also enjoys the respect of his peers and generally possesses a good character and reputation as evidenced by the testimony of Sara Beezley and the many letters received and reviewed by the hearing panel. The attorneys who testified and wrote letters on behalf of the respondent universally indicated that the respondent's conduct in this case was out-of-character.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Remorse\n   </em>\n   .

Respondent was also given adequate notice of the hearing before the panel and the hearing before this court. He filed no exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing report. With no exceptions before us, the panel's findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255). Furthermore, the facts before the hearing panel establish by clear and convincing evidence the charged misconduct in violation of KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.15 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation); 3.3(a)(1) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 344) (candor toward tribunal); 8.4(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer); 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). The evidence also supports the panel's conclusions of law. We therefore adopt the panel's findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. The hearing panel majority recommended that respondent be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law. A minority recommended a two-year suspension followed by a Rule 219 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264) reinstatement hearing. At the hearing before this court, at which the respondent appeared, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended that the respondent be disbarred. The respondent requested indefinite suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This court agrees with the recommendation of the Disciplinary Administrator and holds that disbarment is the appropriate discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The respondent violated multiple rules of professional conduct and their subsections, some of them numerous times. We agree with the panel that he engaged in \"serious dishonest conduct.\" Among other things, he admitted that while he was the emergency administrator of the A.V. estate he improperly paid out $45,000\n   from its funds to himself. And he made these eight different estate disbursements over nine months without: (1)\n   presentation to the district court; (2) approval by the court; or (3) reporting to that court when, pursuant to court order, he filed the July 2017 estate accountings. While he did make repayment, he did so only after the court ordered him to file the accountings; and he did not report that repayment to the court. See American Bar Association Standard 5.11 (\"Disbarment is generally appropriate when ... [b] a lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty ... that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that TIMOTHY J.
