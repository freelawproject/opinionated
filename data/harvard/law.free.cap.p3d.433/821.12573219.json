In the published part of this opinion, we conclude the trial court did not err in applying the free crimes aggravating factor. In the unpublished portion, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying a mistrial motion and it did not commit reversible error in sentencing Smith. We also reject Smith's assertions in his statement of\n   additional grounds (SAG) and supplemental SAG. We affirm Smith's convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Smith's convictions are based on a series of checks he cashed at the expense of his wife's employer, Spaeth Transfer, a moving\n   and storage company that operated out of Bremerton. Smith's wife, Sharyl Smith,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   worked as the company's bookkeeper between October 2012 and October 2015. Ultimately, Smith cashed 176 checks totaling $264,500 between December 2014 and November 2015. A jury found Smith guilty of both identity theft in the first degree and theft in the first degree. It also found that both crimes were major economic offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State submitted a sentencing memorandum where it calculated Smith's offender score as 21. It requested an exceptional sentence above the standard range of 100 months on both counts and that the sentences on each count be served consecutively. The State cited the jury's finding of the major economic offense aggravator as well as an additional aggravator that, because of Smith's high offender score, some of the current offenses would go unpunished. RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c). The court determined Smith had an offender score in excess of 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The trial court sentenced Smith to the statutory maximum on each conviction count, 120 months, to be served consecutively. The trial court also orally found that Smith's current offenses did not constitute the same criminal conduct. It cited the State's sentencing memorandum, which argued that the crimes did not occur at the same time or place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The trial court entered written findings of fact supporting its exceptional sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) The offenses do not constitute same criminal conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) The jury found that the crimes were major economic offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) The defendant's high offender score results in some crimes going unpunished if sentenced concurrently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 193. Based on those findings, the court entered a conclusion of law that an exceptional sentence was appropriate. Smith appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I. FREE CRIMES AGGRAVATING FACTOR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6 Smith argues that the trial court erred in applying the free crimes aggravator,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which applies when some of the current offenses would otherwise go unpunished. He contends that the aggravator does not apply in cases like this one, where only one conviction would go unpunished. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.

Legal Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10 A defendant's standard sentencing range is based on his or her offender score. Under RCW 9.94A.525, a trial court calculates a defendant's offender score based on prior convictions. RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a) provides that when a defendant is sentenced for multiple current offenses, the offender score for each current offense is determined by treating the other current convictions as prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 The standard range sentence for both of Smith's crimes reached its maximum with an offender score of 9. RCW 9.94A.510 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

This fact means that when a defendant's offender score equals or exceeds 9, other prior and other current offenses do not increase the standard sentence range.\n   <em>\n    Alvarado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996071\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/164/556/#p561\">\n    164 Wash.2d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20P.3d%20345\">\n    192 P.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A defendant whose offender score is at or above 9 will have the same standard range sentence regardless of the number of current or prior offenses.\n   <em>\n    State v. France\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271187\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/176/463/#p468\">\n    176 Wash.App. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20P.3d%20812\">\n    308 P.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

Once the court determines that some of the defendant's current offenses will go unpunished, it has discretion to impose an exceptional sentence on all current offenses.\n   <em>\n    France\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271187\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/176/463/#p468\">\n    176 Wash.App. at 468-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20P.3d%20812\">\n    308 P.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court may make this determination without any finding by the jury. RCW 9.94A.535(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C. Smith's Crimes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 Here, Smith argues that the free crimes aggravator cannot apply when the defendant is charged with only two current offenses because only one offense would be unpunished. He cites to the language in RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c) that \"\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the current offenses\" would go unpunished. (Emphasis added.). He argues that because \"some\" is synonymous with a \"few,\" this aggravator is inapplicable when only a single offense is unpunished.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 Smith's interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c). According to WEBSTER'S THIRD INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2171 (2002) (Webster's), \"some of the current offenses\" can properly refer to a single offense. First, Webster's states that when \"some\" acts as a pronoun, as it does here, it can be used either in the singular or plural. Webster's at 2171. Second, there are two applicable definitions: \"one person or thing among a number\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   and \"one indeterminate quantity, portion, or number as distinguished from the rest.\" Webster's at 2171. Either could apply to single or multiple unpunished offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 Smith also argues that the legislature's use of \"some\" in the free crime aggravator must mean more than one because\n   the legislature has used the phrasing \"one or more\" in other places. Br. of Appellant at 22-23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h) (\"The current offense involved domestic violence ... and\n   <em>\n    one or more\n   </em>\n   of the following was present.\" (Emphasis added.) ); RCW 9.94A.537(6) (\"If the jury finds ...\n   <em>\n    one or more\n   </em>\n   of the facts alleged by the state in support of an aggravated sentence ....\" (Emphasis added.) ). He relies on a maxim of statutory construction that when the legislature uses different terms, we presume that the legislature intended for those terms to have a different meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster v. Dep't of Ecology\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440922\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/184/465/#p473\">\n    184 Wash.2d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20P.3d%20959\">\n    362 P.3d 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 But that maxim is only a presumption, and two factors demonstrate its inapplicability here. First, the dictionary definition states that \"some\" may be used in the singular or plural, and can refer to one or multiple things among a group. This definition is consistent with the remaining text of RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c), which applies when the defendant has committed multiple offenses with not all of them resulting in punishment. Applied here, two convictions plainly qualify as multiple offenses, and one offense would go unpunished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 Second, interpreting the free crimes aggravator to apply only when more than one crime is unpunished leads to a strained result that is not supported by the statute's text. Nothing in RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c) suggests that the\n   legislature intended a defendant to avoid additional punishment when he or she is convicted of two crimes at once, but not three. We avoid construing a statute in a manner that results in unlikely or strained consequences.\n   <em>\n    State v. Barbee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452143\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/375/#p389\">\n    187 Wash.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20P.3d%20729\">\n    386 P.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n   <em>\n    State v.

The rule of lenity applies to ambiguous criminal statutes, which we will strictly construe in the defendant's favor.\n   <em>\n    State v. Breaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026826\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/167/166/#p179\">\n    167 Wash.App. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20P.3d%20447\">\n    273 P.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Because the free crimes aggravator statute is not subject to two reasonable interpretations, it is not ambiguous, and the rule of lenity does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in applying the free crimes aggravator to impose an exceptional sentence on Smith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm Smith's convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 A majority of the panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports and that the remainder shall be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040 it is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Bjorgen, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lee, A.C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The following facts relate to the published portion of this opinion.
