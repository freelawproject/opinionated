The Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) imposed the penalty against Masco Corporation for delayed payments of time loss compensation benefits. The Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (the Board) affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The superior court reversed, concluding that the payments were not due until the Board decided Masco's motion for a stay of benefits and that Masco did not unreasonably delay paying the benefits. Suarez appeals. L&amp;I joins Suarez's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 We conclude that under RCW 51.52.050(2)(b), payments to Suarez became due when ordered by L&amp;I, and that Masco unreasonably delayed making payments. Accordingly, we reverse the superior court's order and reinstate the penalty award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Suarez worked as an insulation installer for Masco, a self-insured employer. On June 27, 2012, Suarez received an on-the-job injury. Suarez could not work for several months and received time loss compensation benefits. Suarez then attempted to return to work part time, on light duty. By October 2013, Suarez felt he could no longer work because of his injuries. He filed a claim with L&amp;I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On December 19, 2014, L&amp;I ordered Masco to pay time loss compensation benefits for the period of October 11, 2013 through December 10, 2014. On January 30, 2015, Masco appealed this order to the Board and filed a motion to stay payment of benefits while the appeal was pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On February 25, the Board denied Masco's motion for a stay of benefits. Masco received notice of the Board's decision on February 27. On March 5, five business days later, Masco paid Suarez $27,647.91 for time loss compensation for October 2013 through December 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 On August 25, L&amp;I ordered Masco to pay $6,911.01, the statutory rate of 25 percent of the total time loss compensation award to Suarez as a penalty for delaying\n   payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Masco appealed this order to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 At the Board hearing, Sheryl Whitcomb, L&amp;I's penalty adjudicator, testified that \"until or unless a stay is granted, benefits are due.\" Board Transcript (Whitcomb) at 21. The Board affirmed L&amp;I's order, concluding \"[Masco] unreasonably delayed in the payment of benefits when due.\" Board Record at 30. Masco appealed to the superior court. The superior court reversed the Board, concluding, \"[Masco] is entitled to defer payment of ... benefits until [the Board] has acted upon the Motion for a Stay of Benefits.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 72. The court also concluded that \"[Masco] timely filed an appeal to [the Board] ... and timely filed a Motion for a Stay of Benefits. As such, the benefits were not due and payable until [Masco] received [the Board's] order denying the Motion for a Stay of Benefits which was February 27, 2015.\" CP at 72. Lastly, the court concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Masco] did not unreasonably delay the payment of benefits ordered by [L&amp;I] in that the benefits were not due and payable until the order denying the Motion for a Stay of Benefits was received by [Masco].

RCW 51.14.010. In the case of a self-insured employer, like Masco, the injured employee files an application for compensation with the employer. RCW 51.28.020(1).

The Board will then \"conduct an expedited review\" of L&amp;I's claim file as it existed on the date of L&amp;I's order and will issue a final decision on the stay \"within twenty-five days of the filing of the motion for stay or the order granting appeal, whichever is later.\" RCW 51.52.050(2)(b).

Thus, benefits are payable while the Board is considering a motion to stay benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 L&amp;I and the Board also interpret this statute as requiring the payment of benefits until a stay of benefits is granted during the appeal process.

The IIA mandates that it be liberally construed in\n   favor of the injured worker, and that it should be interpreted to minimize the suffering and economic loss that arises from injuries in the course of employment. RCW 51.12.010 ;\n   <em>\n    Cowlitz Stud Co. v.

RCW 51.52.050(2)(b). Once an employer has made a motion to stay, the Board is required to \"conduct an expedited review\" of L&amp;I's claim file as it existed on the date of L&amp;I's order and will issue a final decision on the stay \"within twenty-five days of the filing of the motion for stay or the order granting appeal, whichever is later.\" RCW 51.52.050(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 Masco argues that self-insured employers will be penalized for exercising their right to move for a stay of benefits by being required to pay benefits while it awaits a Board decision. However, RCW 51.32.240(3) states that \"[w]henever the department issues an order rejecting a claim for benefits, ... after it has been paid by a self-insurer, ... the recipient thereof shall repay such benefits.\" Thus, an employer is allowed to recoup payments under RCW 51.32.240(3) if the Board grants the stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Based on RCW 51.52.050(2)(b) 's plain language, we conclude that L&amp;I-ordered benefits to Suarez must have been paid while Masco's motion for a stay of benefits was pending before the Board. This conclusion is in harmony with the purpose of the IIA to provide sure and certain relief for workers and in harmony with the requirement that the IIA be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker. We next turn to the issue of whether Masco unreasonably delayed making payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IV. UNREASONABLE DELAY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 Under the IIA's penalty statute, if a self-insured employer \"unreasonably delays or refuses to pay benefits as they become due\" to an injured worker, L&amp;I must issue a penalty to the employer. RCW 51.48.017. The penalty is five hundred dollars, or 25 percent of the amount due, whichever is greater. RCW 51.48.017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, the court concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Masco] did not unreasonably delay the payment of benefits ordered by [L&amp;I] in that the benefits were not due and payable until the order denying the Motion for a Stay of Benefits was received by [Masco].

LAWS OF 2008, ch. 280 \u00a7 1. As discussed above, the plain language of RCW 51.52.050(2)(b) clearly states that if benefits are ordered, the benefits \"shall not be stayed pending a final decision on the merits unless ordered by the board.\" Only the Board can order a stay of the payment of benefits. In other words, benefits are payable up until the time of a Board order. Thus, benefits are payable while the Board is considering a motion to stay benefits. The meaning of the statute is clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29 Under RCW 51.32.190(3), where temporary disability compensation is payable, as is the case here, \"the first payment thereof shall be made within fourteen days after notice of claim.\" L&amp;I ordered Masco to pay Suarez compensation on December 19, 2014. Masco did not pay until March 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 30 This 77-day delay would be unreasonable because Masco was required to pay within 14 days. Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding that Masco did not unreasonably delay the payment of benefits ordered by L&amp;I.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 31 We hold that under RCW 51.52.050(2)(b), payments are due when ordered by L&amp;I. Accordingly, the superior court erred in deciding benefits were not due and payable while Masco's motion for a stay of benefits was pending before the Board. The superior court further erred in deciding Masco did not unreasonably delay payment of benefits. We reinstate the penalty award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   V. ATTORNEY FEES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 32 Suarez requests attorney fees on appeal based on RCW 51.52.130(1). Under RAP 18.1(a), this court may grant a party its attorney fees on appeal when an applicable law allows. RCW 51.52.130(1) requires a court to award a worker attorney fees if he or she improves their position on appeal. Because we reinstate the penalty award to Suarez, he prevails on appeal. Thus, we award Suarez his reasonable attorney fees conditioned upon his compliance with RAP 18.1(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33 We reverse the superior court's order and reinstate the penalty award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Worswick, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Maxa, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The majority of the facts are taken from\n    <em>\n     Suarez v.
