Pazzo, Associate District Judge, adjudicating him delinquent in Case No. JDL-2017-44 in the District Court of Rogers County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2 On May 8, 2017, G.W. was charged by juvenile delinquency petition with one count of Sexual Battery. The crime was alleged to have occurred on or about April 11, 2017, when G.W. was 14 years and 10 months old. On March 9, 2018, a bench trial on the juvenile delinquency petition was held before Judge Pazzo. After considering the evidence and arguments, Judge Pazzo found G.W. had committed the offense of Sexual Battery and adjudicated him delinquent. G.W. appeals this adjudication asserting four propositions of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   (1) whether the record is insufficient to demonstrate that G.W. knowingly and intelligently waived his right to jury trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (2) whether error occurred when no election was made with regard to the specific act relied upon as the basis for the offense charged in the petition and the trial court failed to require the same prior to issuing its ruling, resulting in a general verdict;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (3) whether the evidence presented by the State was insufficient to prove that G.W. intentionally acted in a lewd and lascivious manner; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (4) whether trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Pursuant to Rule 11.2(A)(3)\n   <em>\n    , Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal\n   </em>\n   Appeals, Title 22, Ch.18, App. (2018), this appeal was automatically assigned to the Accelerated Docket of this Court. The propositions were presented to this Court in oral argument on August 16, 2018, pursuant to Rule 11.2(E). After hearing oral argument and considering the briefs and record in this case, this Court found that the order of the District Court adjudicating G.W. delinquent should be\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In his first proposition G.W. claims that the appeal record is insufficient to demonstrate that he knowingly and intelligently\n   waived his right to a trial by jury in the juvenile delinquency proceeding. In Oklahoma the right to a jury trial in a juvenile delinquency proceeding is granted by statute. Title 10A O.S.2011, \u00a7 2-2-401 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In adjudicatory hearings to determine if a child is delinquent or in need of supervision, any person entitled to service of summons or the state shall have the right to demand a trial by jury, which shall be granted as in other cases, unless waived ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To be sure, Section 2-2-401 presents something of a conundrum: a juvenile only has a right to jury trial in a juvenile delinquency proceeding if he demands it, unless he waives it. And to make matters worse, a literal reading of the statute could yield a situation where a defendant fails to demand, and fails to waive, leaving him or her in a sort of legal limbo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 In\n   <em>\n    D.M.H. v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416690\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/1054/\">\n    2006 OK CR 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416690\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/1054/\">\n    136 P.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055, this Court considered whether a juvenile's failure to demand a jury trial in a delinquency proceeding constitutes a valid waiver of that right or whether, as in adult cases, the record must reflect a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to a jury trial. Because the right to a jury trial in a juvenile delinquency proceeding is conferred by statute and not required by either the United States Constitution or by the Oklahoma Constitution, the Court in\n   <em>\n    D.M.H.\n   </em>\n   found that a juvenile has no substantive due process right to a jury trial in this proceeding.\n   <em>\n    D.M.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416690\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/1054/\">\n    2006 OK CR 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416690\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/1054/\">\n    136 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1056 (citing\n   <em>\n    McKeiver v.

The juvenile court judge shall not accept a waiver unless the juvenile, after being advised by the court of his right to a trial by jury and consulting with counsel, personally waives his right to trial by jury in open court on the record.

The problem with this reasoning is that it places the statutory right to demand a jury trial in a juvenile delinquency proceeding on par with an adult's constitutional right to jury trial, requiring the same showing of waiver and thereby elevating the statutory right to a constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416690\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/1054/\">\n    2006 OK CR 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416690\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/1054/\">\n    136 P.3d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 We take this opportunity to revisit the minimum requirements for a valid waiver of this statutory right to demand a jury trial. \"What suffices for waiver depends on the nature of the right at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    New York v.

It is clear that the Legislature assumed knowledge of the statutory right by the juvenile; otherwise, it could neither be demanded nor waived. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    D.M.H\n   </em>\n   ., we interpret the statutory language to require that the juvenile be advised on the record that he or she has a right to demand a jury trial. Any waiver of this right, however, need not be made affirmatively on the record because neither the statute nor constitutional procedural due process principles require it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 Deciding this case based on statutory interpretation is consistent with clear legislative intent, avoids unnecessarily deciding a constitutional issue, and comports with an oft-cited maxim for judicial restraint: \"If it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Majority focuses solely on the juvenile's \"right to demand\" a jury trial, and ignores the rest of the sentence where that right is mentioned. It was not this Court in\n   <em>\n    D.M.H.\n   </em>\n   which \"elevated\" the importance of the juvenile's right to a jury trial; rather, it was the Legislature which, over a century ago, guaranteed the right \"as in other cases,\" unless \"waived\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (as in other cases). What \"other cases\" could the Legislature be talking about? The only possible answer: Those cases where the right to jury trial is constitutionally protected. When it comes to due process -- which is guaranteed to every litigant -- legislatures are certainly authorized to prescribe just what process is due in a particular situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Majority stops short of requiring a record waiver of the juvenile's right, and would accept forfeiture of the right by silence. That conclusion doesn't just overrule\n   <em>\n    D.M.H.\n   </em>\n   ; it is contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 2-2-401, which requires that the right be \"waived\"; forfeiture by silence is not sufficient. The concepts of \"waiver\" and \"forfeiture\" are often confused,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but they are not the same:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Waiver is different from forfeiture.

As always in the law, it depends. Some rights are more important than others. The Majority cites\n   <em>\n    New York v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476159\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/110/#p114\">\n    528 U.S. 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476159\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/110/#p114\">\n    120 S.Ct. 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476159\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/110/#p114\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (which, in turn, cited\n   <em>\n    United States v. Olano\n   </em>\n   ) for the principle that the nature of the right at stake determines whether, and to what extent, a litigant must acknowledge his choice regarding that right. This sliding-scale approach is one fashioned, in\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   fashion, by courts themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority recognizes a distinction between constitutional rights and statutory ones, and that distinction is a legitimate starting point for many purposes. But it does not always end the inquiry. Whether an \"on the record\" waiver makes sense depends on more than just whether the subject is explicitly contained in constitutional language. It depends, again, on the right at stake. It also depends on relevant legislative direction. Neither the federal nor the Oklahoma constitution includes explicit language on what is necessary to waive a right contained therein; the statute at issue here does. Even if this Court believes such a procedure is somehow burdensome or archaic, the Legislature has the authority to require courts to treat the juvenile's right to a jury trial with the same procedural care and respect as if it were protected by the constitution. And I believe it has done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 8 We are dealing here with a special category of litigants -- juveniles. They are treated differently from adults \"for their own good,\" and in keeping with modern society's perceived moral obligations. We give them certain rights in this process. Those who fall under the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts are not allowed to or have limits on their ability to vote, drink, smoke, drive, work,\n   attend school, stay out past a curfew, contract, own a weapon, sue, leave home, and disobey adults of authority. They are entitled by law to be given shelter, clothing, food and education by adults, because it is presumed they cannot provide those basic needs for themselves. We should remember the immaturity of these litigants when we seek to apply rules of procedural default against them. The Majority does not even construe \u00a7 2-2-401 to require that the juvenile have the assistance of counsel when he is advised of the right to trial by jury. Thus, the immature litigant may be found to have forfeited this important right (through silence) without any advice of counsel. I would require, at the very least, that the record show the right to trial by jury was explained at a proceeding where counsel was present to acknowledge that fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 9 This Court's duty is to follow and apply the law. Considering the nature of the right at stake, and the special concerns that gave birth to the juvenile justice system in the first place, I would require that before the juvenile's right to a jury trial can be extinguished, the juvenile must, at the very least, be advised of the consequences of not demanding same, with counsel present.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Adhering to formal protections against waiver for the statutory right to jury trial also avoids the necessity of determining whether some of the modern, adult consequences of delinquency adjudications have undermined prior decisions holding that the Constitution does not require jury trials in these ostensibly therapeutic, but increasingly punitive, proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    Rule 3.4(F)(1),\n    <em>\n     Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n    </em>\n    , Title 22, Ch. 18, App. (2018) (claims advanced for the first time in a reply brief shall be deemed \"waived and forfeited for consideration\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \"[W]hether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.\"\n    <em>\n     Olano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n     507 U.S. at 733\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n     113 S.Ct. at 1777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Olano\n    </em>\n    's citation to authority for this principle is not a constitutional or statutory provision, or even a prior Supreme Court case, but a treatise on criminal procedure and a law-review article.
