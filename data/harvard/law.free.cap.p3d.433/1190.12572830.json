The first is a temporary order related to Father's petition for legal decision-making, parenting time, and child support, which granted Father temporary parenting time of his two children. The second order affirmed an active order of protection barring Father from any contact with the children's mother, Araceli Chaidez (\"Mother\"), and the children. We accept special action jurisdiction and hold that although the superior court may act to harmonize parenting-time and protective orders, its authority to do so is limited once a coordinate member of that same court affirms the protective order following an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Father and Mother are the biological parents of two minor children. In April 2018, Mother obtained an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of protection in the Phoenix Municipal Court prohibiting Father from having any contact with Mother. The children were also designated as protected persons under the order of protection. Mother, without informing Father, then moved out of Arizona with the children, allegedly to escape the domestic violence that gave rise to the need for the order of protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Before Father realized Mother and the children had left the state, Father petitioned to establish legal decision-making authority, parenting time, and child support in the superior court (\"the family case\"). After learning Mother and the children had left Arizona, Father petitioned the court to issue a series of emergency\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary orders awarding Father sole legal decision-making authority over the children and requiring Mother to immediately return them to Arizona. The court denied Father's request to issue the orders\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   but scheduled a temporary-orders hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Between the time of the filing of Father's petition for temporary orders and the temporary-orders hearing, Father was served with the order of protection. On Father's motion, the municipal court, pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 12-3602(P), ordered the order-of-protection\n   case to be transferred to the superior court \"for consolidation under Case No. FC2018-091238 for all further proceedings.\" Once the transfer was effectuated, however, the superior court, pursuant to its obligations under Arizona Supreme Court Rule 123 and the Federal Violence Against Women Act, assigned the order of protection case a new cause number-FC2018-092621.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 In the family case, the superior court held the temporary orders hearing as scheduled. Before the hearing, Father filed a pretrial statement notifying the court that the order of protection had been transferred to the superior court. At the hearing, the court heard testimony and took evidence concerning Father and Mother's relationship, their relationship with the children, the allegations of domestic violence by Father, and the order of protection. The court took the matter under advisement and subsequently issued temporary orders. The court awarded Mother sole legal decision-making authority regarding the children, but ordered that Father have regular access to the children, including daily remote communication and in-person parenting time on school holidays and breaks. But the court made no mention of the still-active order of protection prohibiting Father from any contact with Mother or the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Both Mother and Father immediately challenged the temporary orders as conflicting with the order of protection. Mother requested the court reconsider the parenting time aspects of its order given the order of protection, and Father requested the court amend the order of protection to implement the temporary order concerning parenting time. The court denied both requests by minute entry, mistakenly noting the order of protection had not been transferred to the superior court under a new cause number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that \"[o]nce an Order of Protection is properly transferred to the Superior Court, a hearing may be properly requested and will take place accordingly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Father then requested a hearing on the order of protection. At the order-of-protection hearing before a different judicial officer, Mother, Father, and the court discussed the conflict between the order of protection and the temporary orders issued by the court in the family case. The judge handling the order of protection interpreted the minute entry in the family case denying reconsideration of the temporary orders as placing priority on the active order of protection. The court determined that the parenting-time order would become effective only if the court modified the order of protection or removed the children from that order. Based on this interpretation, the court found that it could go forward with the hearing. Father did not object to proceeding in the manner outlined by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 After hearing testimony and taking evidence on the domestic abuse allegations raised by Mother against Father, the court affirmed the order of protection in its entirety. The court found Mother had met her burden of proving the domestic abuse allegations by a preponderance of the evidence, and that the involvement of the children in the incidents justified their inclusion on the order of protection. Father then filed this special action seeking an order directing the court in the family case to amend the order of protection to effectuate its temporary parenting-time order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    SPECIAL ACTION JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 \"Special action jurisdiction is discretionary, but appropriate, when there is no equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Courtney v.

A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(P) provides that an order of protection issued in a municipal or justice court must be promptly transferred to the superior court when a family law action is pending between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Protect. Ord. P. 34(c). Upon transfer, the court is authorized to \"proceed as though the petition for an order of protection had been originally brought in the superior court.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(P).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 When a parent's request for temporary parenting time conflicts with an active order of protection transferred to the superior court, the Family Rules\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   recognize the court's concurrent authority over both actions by permitting it to consider them together in a joint hearing. Family Rule 5(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   When actions within the scope of these rules involving a common child, common parties, or a common question of law or fact, are pending before the court, the court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   order a joint hearing ... of any or all the matters in issue in the actions ... and the court may make such orders concerning proceedings therein to avoid unnecessary costs or delay or to serve in the best interest of a minor child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphasis added.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) A joint hearing to consider both actions is especially appropriate in a case such as this. Requests for temporary parenting time and orders of protection that bar contact with a parent's child necessarily involve a common child and will typically concern common questions of law or fact. By resolving the issues raised by both actions in a joint hearing, the court may ensure that conflicts do not arise between the order of protection and the parenting-time order and avoid forcing the alleged victim of domestic abuse to testify multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 Thus, if at the end of a joint hearing a court finds both that (1) the requesting parent is entitled to immediate, temporary parenting time and (2) the protective order should not remain in effect as originally issued, it may harmonize the temporary parenting-time order and the order of protection. Ariz. R. Fam. Law. P. 5(A) (\"[T]he court may make such orders ... to serve in the best interest of a minor child.\"). In doing so, a court may fashion an appropriate solution from the range of statutory and procedural options available to it, including amending the order of protection to remove any child listed as a protected person.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403.03(F) (listing conditions that may be placed on parenting time when the court finds a parent has committed an act of domestic violence); A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3062(G) (listing conditions that may be imposed by an order of protection); Ariz. R. Protect. Ord. P. 35 (modification of an order of protection to permit one parent to contact the other parent to implement legal decision-making and parenting-time orders). But given the priority placed upon protective orders-and the criminal penalties associated with them-the court must ensure that any decision affecting the order of protection will not hinder the \"understanding and compliance by the parties and ease of enforcement by law enforcement officers.\" Ariz. R. Protect. Ord. P. 35(d);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Protect. Ord. P. 21(c) (protective orders control over conflicting legal decision-making orders); A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2810 (criminal penalties for violations of protective orders).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 We note two important caveats to the superior court's authority to amend an order of protection. First, while the superior court has the\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   to hold a joint hearing to harmonize parenting-time orders and an order of protection, it is not\n   <em>\n    obligated\n   </em>\n   to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Fam. Law. P. 5(A). Second, the court's authority to modify an order of protection only exists pursuant to the statutes and rules controlling protective orders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ariz. R. Protect. Ord. P. 2 (\"To the extent\n   <em>\n    not inconsistent\n   </em>\n   with these rules, the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure apply to protective order matters heard in conjunction with pending family law cases.\" (emphasis added) ). With this background in mind, we now turn to the issues Father raises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Statutes and Rules Governing Orders of Protection Do Not Authorize the Relief Father Seeks in this Case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 Father argues the superior court in the family case erred by failing to amend the order of protection to effectuate its parenting-time orders. Father's argument hinges on his contention that \"this Court has already reviewed this issue\" in\n   <em>\n    Courtney\n   </em>\n   , and the straightforward application of our holding in that case authorizes us to order the superior court to amend the order of protection. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 In\n   <em>\n    Courtney\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the superior court denied a mother's request for temporary parenting time with her minor child because the court found it could not amend an active order of protection that included the child as a protected person. We accepted special action\n   jurisdiction to determine whether the superior court had the authority to amend an order of protection that had been issued, contested, and affirmed in the municipal court before its transfer to superior court.\n   <em>\n    Courtney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249218\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/613/#p615\">\n    235 Ariz. at 615, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249218\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/613/#p615\">\n    334 P.3d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, Father had two options after the court denied his motion to reconsider the inconsistent orders: (1) file a special action petition challenging the court's denial of his motion to reconsider based on the court's erroneous factual premise that it could not harmonize the two orders because the order-of-protection case had not been transferred to the superior court; or (2) ask for a hearing on the order of protection.
