But the Supreme Court disagrees. We therefore remand this case to the district court for reconsideration. If the district court finds that Owens' probation should be revoked, it shall set forth, with greater particularity than previously, its reasons for finding that public safety will be jeopardized or the defendant's welfare will not be furthered with an intermediate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Remanded with directions.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
