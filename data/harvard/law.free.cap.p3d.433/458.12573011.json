Defendant was convicted of a variety of crimes, including second-degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon committed against the victim. Defendant raises four assignments of error on appeal. We reject defendant's first three assignments without written discussion. However, because we agree with and accept the state's concession that the trial court erred by failing to merge the guilty verdicts for second-degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon, we reverse and remand for the trial court to merge the verdicts on Counts 9 and 11 and for resentencing, but otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant's convictions stem from two incidents involving the victim. In the second incident, defendant pressed a pen-knife to the victim's throat. The victim pushed the knife away, and defendant and the victim struggled for control of the knife. During that struggle, the victim had her hand on the knife and defendant pulled it away, cutting the victim's hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was charged with unlawful use of a weapon under ORS 166.220(1)(a) for \"[a]ttempt[ing] to use unlawfully against another * * * any dangerous or deadly weapon,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   and with second-degree assault under ORS 163.175(1)(b) for \"[i]ntentionally or knowingly caus[ing] physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\" Defendant contends that the trial court plainly erred by failing to merge defendant's guilty verdicts on those charges into a single conviction for second-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant did not object to the trial court's failure to merge the verdicts on those charges, but he asserts, and the state concedes, that the court's failure to merge those verdicts constitutes plain error. ORAP 5.45(1). We accept that concession as well founded.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, \"we cannot identify any strategic reason that defendant may have had for not objecting\" to the trial court's failure to merge the verdicts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641304\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/219/561/#p564\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641304\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/219/561/#p564\">\n    at 564-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641304\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/219/561/#p564\">\n    184 P.3d 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
