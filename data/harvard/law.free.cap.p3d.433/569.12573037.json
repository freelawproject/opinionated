Valer obtained sole ownership of the Ranch pursuant to the terms of the Settlement. She subsequently demanded the Roes vacate the Ranch, and the Roes filed an action for declaratory judgment claiming a life estate in the house and surrounding property on the Ranch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Valer asserted the statute of frauds as a defense to the Roes' claim, arguing there was no written contract evincing the creation of a life estate. She also filed a counterclaim to quiet title to the Ranch. In addition, Valer filed a third-party complaint against Josiah, alleging the Settlement required him to defend and indemnify her against the Roes' life estate claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Valer subsequently moved for summary judgment on the Roes' life estate claim and on her indemnification claim against Josiah. The trial court denied summary judgment on both claims, concluding issues of fact existed that required resolution at trial. At trial, pursuant to Rule 50, Ariz. R. Civ. P., Valer moved for judgment as a matter of law on the Roes' life estate claim, and the court denied her motion. After trial, the jury awarded the Roes a life estate in the house on the Ranch and found Josiah had not breached the indemnification provisions of the Settlement. Valer renewed her motions for judgment as a matter of law on the Roes' life estate claim and also moved for judgment as a matter of law on her third-party indemnification claim against Josiah. The court denied the motions and ultimately entered judgment in favor of the Roes, granting them a life estate in the house and 214 surrounding acres on the Ranch, and in favor of Josiah on the indemnification claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Valer appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Statute of Frauds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 Valer argues the statute of frauds bars the Roes' life estate claim because it is based on an oral contract and, therefore, the trial court erred when it denied her motions for judgment as a matter of law. In its denial of the Rule 50 motion Valer made at trial, the court concluded the alleged acts of part performance by the Roes \"raise a question for the trier of fact as to whether [the Roes'] acts are unequivocally referable to the alleged agreement.\" Subsequently, when denying Valer's renewed motions, the court concluded it \"d[id]n't think any other explanation is plausible....

The Roes argue that these acts were undertaken in reliance on the alleged promise of a life estate and that the question of whether they are unequivocally referable to the existence of a life estate was an issue of fact for the jury. In addition, they argue the proponent of an alleged contract need only show his acts are unequivocally referable to the alleged contract \"as between the two positions articulated by the parties.\" Valer, on the other hand, argues the Roes moved to the Ranch and worked for her and Josiah as part of a \"work-for-free-rent arrangement,\" disputes the amount the Roes allegedly contributed to the Ranch house, and asserts she and Josiah contributed over $799,000 to constructing the house.

There, the proponents of an oral long-term lease had paid rent for six to eight months while they were not using the premises and they made improvements worth approximately five months' rent, while the landowner claimed there was merely a month-to-month tenancy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595379\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/127/191/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the Roes assert the existence of a life estate in a house that cost approximately $955,000, as well as an additional 214 acres of surrounding land; yet, they only contributed approximately $155,000 (over $50,000 of which was spent on appliances, furniture, and maintenance) to the house during a span of approximately eight years. Further, in addition to distinguishable facts,\n   <em>\n    Tovar\n   </em>\n   was decided nearly thirty years before\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   , in which our supreme court makes clear that the unequivocally referable standard is a demanding one, part-performance exceptions to the statute of frauds are rare, and the determination of whether acts are unequivocally referable does not depend on the relative strength of the parties' explanations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425609\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/222/\">\n    218 Ariz. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425609\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/222/\">\n    182 P.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the very fact the Roes argue that they need only show that, as between their position and Valer's, their acts are unequivocally referable to the creation of a life estate supports the conclusion that the Roes' conduct does not \"itself supply the key to what is promised.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20N.E.%20273\">\n    135 N.E. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 The Roes also cite the example from\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   of a buyer who pays the purchase price for a parcel, takes possession, and improves the land, asserting it supports the argument that by concluding their acts are not unequivocally referable to the creation of a life estate, we give license to Valer and other similarly situated defendants to simply concoct other possible explanations to avoid enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20N.E.%20273\">\n    135 N.E. at 273-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree. First, the example of the buyer is distinguishable from the case at hand. The Roes never claimed a purchase contract, that they paid a purchase price, or that they own the ranch house and the surrounding 214 acres. Further, we find the Roes' acts more closely align with the housekeeper example described in\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   : \"The housekeeper who abandons other prospects of establishment in life and renders service without pay upon the oral promise of her employer to give her a life estate in land must find her remedy in an action to recover the value of the service.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20N.E.%20273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20N.E.%20273\">\n    at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 In addition, we conclude there are several plausible explanations for the Roes' acts, including an at-will tenancy arrangement in which the Roes lived on the Ranch and, rather than pay rent, worked for Valer and Josiah. Alternatively, the Roes' $155,000 contribution to the house could have been a down payment on a purchase contract or a purchase option, with the $155,000 being applied toward the ultimate purchase price. It is also plausible the Roes had a lease arrangement in which the $155,000 and the value of their work on the Ranch were applied toward lease payments over a span of several years. In sum, the Roes' acts could be consistent with these or other plausible explanations and thus are not sufficient to constitute part performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 We thus conclude that, as a matter of law, the Roes' alleged acts of part performance by themselves are not unequivocally referable to a contract for a life estate. The statute of frauds, therefore, bars the Roes' life estate claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44-101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Indemnification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 Valer also appeals from the trial court's ruling that Josiah has no obligation to defend and indemnify her against the Roes' life estate claim. In denying Valer's pretrial motion for summary judgment, the court considered extrinsic evidence, and concluded the Settlement's indemnification provisions were not \"so clearly written that they can only be supported by one party's interpretation\" and that the intent of the parties raised questions requiring resolution at trial.

In the event a claim is brought by a third party creditor against either of the parties for an Obligation for which another Party is liable, either independently or jointly and severally, the Party who is liable for such Obligation under this Agreement shall, in the case of an independent Obligation, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party or Parties for such Obligation, including attorneys' fees and costs ... for any failure to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   b.\n   <strong>\n    JOSIAH'S OBLIGATIONS.\n   </strong>\n   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Josiah shall pay and be responsible for ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   i.

The list did not include a life estate to the Roes and there is no mention of a life estate anywhere in the Settlement other than Josiah's specific representation in \u00a7 22(f) that none exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 19 On appeal, Valer argues she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the Settlement clearly and unambiguously requires Josiah to defend and indemnify her. Specifically, she asserts the last sentence of \u00a7 22(f) requires Josiah to defend and indemnify her against the Roes' life estate claim because Josiah specifically represented that no life estate existed and did not\n   disclose that such life estate existed in \u00a7 2(u)(ii). Further, Valer argues Josiah accepted all obligations in connection with the Ranch in \u00a7 3(b) and that he must indemnify her pursuant to \u00a7 3(a). According to Valer, given its clear and unambiguous provisions, the Settlement is not reasonably susceptible to any interpretation other than that Josiah must defend and indemnify her in connection with the Roes' claim. She also argues the trial court erred by admitting parol evidence to vary and contradict the Settlement's plain terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 20 Josiah, on the other hand, argues the third sentence of \u00a7 22(f) must be read as being modified by a clause in the first sentence of the same section: \"which are not known to the other Party.\" Under Josiah's interpretation, \u00a7 22(f) only requires him to defend and indemnify Valer against liens and encumbrances\n   <em>\n    which are not known to her\n   </em>\n   . And, according to Josiah, Valer was aware during the settlement negotiations that both Josiah and Valer \"had made a verbal promise of a 'life estate' to the Roes.\" Thus, Josiah argues the court was correct in finding the Settlement is reasonably susceptible to his interpretation and in admitting parol evidence to interpret the Settlement.
