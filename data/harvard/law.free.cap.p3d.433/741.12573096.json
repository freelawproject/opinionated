J.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Defendant appeals a judgment convicting him of unlawful possession of cocaine, ORS 475.884, and second-degree criminal mischief, ORS 164.354. Those charges arose out of acts committed by defendant on the same day, but the indictment did not reflect any connection between the charges. Defendant assigns error to the trial court's denial of his demurrer to the indictment, contending that the charges were improperly joined. Alternatively, defendant assigns error to the trial court's failure to sever the improperly joined charges. We agree that the trial court erred in denying defendant's demurrer and conclude that the error was not harmless. Thus, we reverse defendant's conviction on both counts and do not reach defendant's second assignment of error.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  A defendant may demur to an indictment for improper joinder of charges when the indictment fails to substantially conform to the requirements of ORS 132.560 (1)(b).\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  We review the denial of a demurrer for legal error.\n  <em>\n   State v.

The trial court denied defendant's demurrer. In doing so, the court explicitly considered facts outside of the indictment, explaining that \"frankly[,] just the language of the indictment doesn't say anything about the relationship between the two [criminal] acts.\" After a bench trial at which defendant stipulated to the facts that (1) a witness would testify that defendant had intentionally damaged her car by throwing a brick through the window and (2) a police officer would testify that defendant unlawfully possessed cocaine, the trial court entered a judgment of conviction on both counts. We agree with the trial court's assessment of the indictment; however, we reach the opposite legal conclusion as to the demurrer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, defendant argues, as he did below, that the indictment fails because it does not allege that the charged offenses fall under one of the three categories of charges that may be permissibly joined under ORS 132.560(1)(b). In response, the state argues that because the indictment alleges that the charges took place on the same day, there were facts sufficient to meet ORS 132.560 (1)(b)(C), the \"connected together\" category of the joinder statute. In the alternative, the state argues that, if the charges were improperly joined, the improper joinder was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An indictment's failure to comply with ORS 132.560 (1)(b) is one ground for demurrer under ORS 135.630.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since defendant filed his appeal, we have reaffirmed that ORS 132.560(1)(b) requires the state to allege \"the basis for\n   the joinder of the crimes that are charged in it\" either \"by alleging the basis for the joinder in the language of the joinder statute or by alleging facts sufficient to establish compliance with the joinder statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Poston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167543\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/277/137/#p143\">\n    277 Or.

The parties here focus their arguments on ORS 132.560 (1)(b)(C), which permits joinder of charges that are based on acts \"connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan[.]\" As the indictment does not allege any other facts showing the\n   required relationship under ORS 132.560(1)(b)(A) or (B), we focus our analysis on the \"connected together\" category as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When the state chooses to allege facts instead of the language of ORS 132.560(1)(b)(C) in an indictment, the state must \"use some language specifically connecting the crimes together, or specifying the crimes' common scheme or plan.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, in this case, the allegation of the facts that the acts were committed \"on the same day\" is not enough to connect the charges together.

For the possession charge, the evidence was a police officer's testimony that defendant possessed cocaine. For the criminal mischief charge, the evidence was a witness's testimony that defendant threw a brick into her car window. The state argues that the evidence on each charge was \"discrete and had no bearing on the other charge,\" and that consequentially, any error in denying defendant's demurrer was harmless. The state's argument misstates the test for harmless error in this context and, therefore, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   OEC 402 provides that \"[e]vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\" Thus, without facts demonstrating that defendant's act of throwing a brick into a car window was related to his later possession of cocaine, or that his\n   possession of cocaine explained his throwing the brick, we cannot conclude that each piece of evidence was \"admissible\" in both hypothetical trials as that term is used in\n   <em>\n    Poston\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, we certainly cannot say that it is implausible that, had defendant objected under, for example, OEC 403, a trial court would have excluded the evidence of the unrelated criminal charge due to the risk of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
