Pugh committed these offenses while he was a juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2 Under RCW 9.94A.730(3), the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   fix statute, a juvenile offender who commits a crime, other than aggravated murder in the first degree, may petition the Indeterminate Sentencing Review Board (ISRB) for release after serving 20 years of confinement. The ISRB is required to release the individual unless it determines, by a preponderance of\n   the evidence, that the individual is more likely than not to commit new criminal law violations if released.

The ISRB found Pugh was not likely to commit a crime if released, but delayed his release for 18 months so certain conditions could be met. In 2017, the ISRB found Pugh did not meet the conditions imposed and found him more likely than not to commit criminal law violations if released. Pugh filed this personal restraint petition (PRP), arguing that under RCW 9.94A.730(3), the ISRB was not permitted to impose pre-release conditions in 2015 after finding that Pugh was unlikely to reoffend. Pugh further argues the ISRB abused its discretion by not releasing him in 2015 and by finding him likely to reoffend in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 4 We conclude that the ISRB lacked authority in 2015 to impose pre-release conditions and delay Pugh's release by 18 months after its finding that Pugh was not likely to reoffend.

While at LCC, Pugh had several behavior management incidents. He was angry and disrespectful towards his instructors. During one class, Pugh became \"angry (red face, veins popping out of his arms and forehead, balled fists, piercing eyes) stating '[t]his is all your fault! You caused this!

The two infractions were later dropped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 In January 2017, the ISRB conducted another release hearing. The ISRB considered Pugh's ISRB file, the most recent Department of Corrections (DOC) plan, information regarding institutional behavior and programing, letters directed to the ISRB at the presentence investigation, and a psychological evaluation completed in April 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ISRB also heard from Pugh, who stated that it was difficult transferring to LCC where he did not know anyone and he \"underestimated the amount of stress and worry that [he] was going to be going though.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 76.

RCW 9.94.730- THE MILLER FIX STATUTE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 While Pugh has been incarcerated the law of juvenile sentencing has changed dramatically. In 2012, the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 465,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that a sentence imposed on a juvenile of mandatory life without parole violates the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Following\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , our legislature passed an act to allow inmates who are serving sentences for crimes committed as a juvenile to petition for early release after serving 20 years. SEE LAWS OF 2014, ch. 130, \u00a7 10 (codified at RCW 9.94A.730 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Once an offender petitions for release, the ISRB is then required to conduct \"an examination of the person, incorporating methodologies that are recognized by experts in the prediction of dangerousness, and including a prediction of the probability that the person will engage in future criminal behavior if released on conditions to be set by the board.\" RCW 9.94A.730(3).

When Pugh did attend class, he was argumentative and angry. The ISRB then transferred Pugh to a minimum security facility. While at the facility, Pugh had several behavior management incidents. He was angry and disrespectful towards his instructors. During one class, Pugh became \"angry (red face, veins popping out of his arms and forehead, balled fists, piercing eyes) stating '[t]his is all your fault! You caused this! You are negative and I came to this class wanting to participate. I don't even like you.' \" Supp. Br. of Resp't at Ex. 5, at 3. In another occurrence, Pugh was asked by one of his instructors how his business class was going. Pugh responded, \"I will give you 100% Monday and Wednesday in class other than that do not talk to me.\" Supp. Br. of Resp't at Ex. 5, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 In July 2016, the ISRB received information that Pugh committed two infractions while at the minimum security facility for strong-arming/intimidation and discriminatory harassment. Pugh was transferred to a hospital for a mental health evaluation. The two infractions were later dropped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 In January 2017, the ISRB conducted a second release hearing. The ISRB considered Pugh's ISRB file, the most recent DOC plan, information regarding institutional behavior and programing, letters directed to the ISRB at the presentence investigation, and a psychological evaluation completed in April 2015. The ISRB also heard from Pugh, who stated that it was difficult transferring to the minimum security facility where he did not know anyone and he \"underestimated the amount of stress and worry that [he] was going to be going through.\" RP at 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 Based on the above, a preponderance of evidence supports the ISRB's 2017 finding that Pugh \"is more likely than not to commit a new crime if released.\" Supp. Br. of Resp't at Ex. 4, at 6. Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30 We conclude that the plain language of RCW 9.94A.730 did not grant the ISRB the authority to impose pre-release conditions and delay Pugh's release by 18 months\n   after finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not likely to commit new criminal law violations. However, given that this case presents the unique fact that the ISRB made a subsequent finding that Pugh was likely to reoffend if released, and given that under RCW 9.94A.730(3), public safety considerations must be given \"the highest priority,\" we conclude that remanding for release is not the proper remedy. We, therefore, deny Pugh's PRP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Maxa, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <em>\n     Miller v.

But because the ISRB was allowed to make a subsequent determination in 2017 (after violating the law in 2015) that Pugh is likely to reoffend, the majority denies Pugh's personal restraint petition (PRP). Majority Opinion at 877-78. I respectfully disagree with the majority's position of further punishing Pugh by denying Pugh's PRP based on the ISRB's 2017 decision\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the ISRB clearly violated RCW 9.94A.730(3) in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 32 In his PRP, Pugh \"contends he is unlawfully restrained in 2015 because the ISRB failed to release him after finding he was not likely to commit a crime if released.\" Majority at 875. The majority, as do I, agree with Pugh that the ISRB erred in 2015. However, the majority concludes Pugh is not unlawfully restrained because of the ISRB's subsequent finding in 2017. That is where the majority and I depart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 33 Contrary to the majority's position, Pugh remains unlawfully restrained because the ISRB had no statutory authority to set pre-release conditions on Pugh after finding he was not likely to commit a crime if released in 2015. If the ISRB had not violated RCW 9.94A.730(3) in 2015 and had released Pugh as required by the statute, the ISRB would not have had the opportunity to make its 2017 determination. Therefore, I respectfully disagree with the majority's reliance on the ISRB's 2017 decision. I would grant Pugh's PRP and remand for his release.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    On October 26, 2016, Pugh filed a PRP in this court challenging the ISRB's 2015 decision to set pre-release conditions despite finding that Pugh was not likely to reoffend.

Pugh did not pay the filing fee, and his challenge was not reviewed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
