The Information stated that on or before December 19, 2013, Hardground failed to appear in person and give notification of his change of residence to the registration agency within three business days. On October 20, 2014, the State filed an Amended Information, adding \"Sexual Offender\" to the offense\n   description but leaving December 19, 2013, as the offense date. On February 4, 2015, the State filed a Second Amended Information. On February 23, 2015, the District Court held a hearing for Hardground's initial appearance on the Second Amended Information. The District Court expressed concern that the facts constituting probable cause to charge Hardground with the offense were not recited in the charging documents and requested that the State file another amended information. On February 25, 2015, the State filed a Third Amended Information, which still included the December 19, 2013 offense date but added the predicate offense warranting sexual offender registration-a 1994 conviction in the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Hardground was arraigned on the Third Amended Information and entered a plea of not guilty, the District Court set a trial date for June 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On June 4, 2015, the District Court presided over a one-day jury trial. Following the preliminary jury instructions, and immediately prior to breaking for a lunch recess, the State moved orally to amend the Information, pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-205(3), MCA, to reflect the proper date of the alleged offense: August 5, 2014. The State contended the change of date was not a substantive amendment and instead characterized the correction as a \"typographical error.\" The State represented to the District Court that the proper date was set forth in the State's original Motion for Leave to File an Information, which described that Blaine County Sexual or Violent Offender Registry Administrator Debbie Gomke received a phone call on or around August 5, 2014, with information that Hardground was out of compliance with his offender registration requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Hardground objected to the proposed amendment, arguing that the jury was empaneled and defense counsel was prepared to proceed \"based on the fact that Mr. Hardground was arraigned on the December 19[ ], 2013[ ] date\" and \"on that specific set of facts.\" Hardground argued that the requirement to register at a particular address in a three-day window was specific to the offense charged. He pointed out that the Information was amended four times, and in each\n   version the December 19, 2013 date appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The District Court concluded, \"there's certainly no different offense charged, and there's no additional offense charged. It's the same charge.\" The District Court allowed the State to amend the Information to reflect the August 5, 2014 date. During trial, the State offered testimony as to where Hardground lived during August of 2014; the State did not offer direct testimony as to where Hardground lived in December of 2013. On June 4, 2015, the jury convicted Hardground of Failure of Sexual Offender to Provide Notice of Change of Residence. On November 10,\n   2015, the District Court sentenced Hardground to the Department of Corrections' custody for five years, minus credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 We review a district court's decision to permit an amendment to a criminal complaint or information for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Hardground argues that because the charge of Failure of Sexual Offender to Provide Notice of Change of Residence is an offense that requires proof of when the accused was or was not living at a specific residence, and whether the failure to provide notice occurred within three days of when the change of residence occurred, the last-minute amendment to the offense date altered the proofs required and his defense to the charge.

However, during the March 5, 2015 hearing on Hardground's initial appearance on the Third Amended Information and Hardground's Motion to Dismiss, it was determined that Hardground's federal conviction did not require violent offender registration. The State then orally withdrew the allegation requiring Hardground to register as a violent offender but maintained Hardground was required to register as a sexual offender.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
