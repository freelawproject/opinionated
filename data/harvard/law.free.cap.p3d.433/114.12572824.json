(father) appeals the juvenile court judgment terminating his parent-child legal relationships with his children, L.M. and M.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case poses an unusual situation. The juvenile court adjudicated the children dependent and neglected, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that father had sexually abused L.M. and that M.M. was suffering secondary trauma as a result of the abuse. The court granted temporary custody of the children to E.L. (mother) and prohibited father from having any contact with the children during the pendency of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Father's treatment plan was premised on his guilt. But he was later acquitted in the companion criminal case, and, following the termination hearing, the juvenile court could not find that the assault allegations had been established by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Even so, the juvenile court terminated father's parental rights. In so doing, it found that there were no less drastic alternatives to termination because the children continued to experience trauma specific to father, which he did not recognize. On appeal, father challenges this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 To address father's challenge, we examine the legal standard for determining whether there is a less drastic alternative to termination. As shown by the record in this case, the standard for considering less drastic alternatives to termination is often intertwined with a determination of whether an appropriate treatment plan can be devised for a parent and whether the parent is fit or can become fit in a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Because the record does not support the juvenile court's decision to terminate father's parental rights, we reverse the judgment and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. The Dependency and Neglect Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 In March 2015, the Larimer County Department of Human Services (Department) became involved in this case after six-year-old L.M. had disclosed that \"she woke up to [father] touching her in her private\" while she was at his home. L.M. and eight-year-old M.M. primarily lived with mother, but spent overnights at father's home. The juvenile court granted temporary custody of the children to mother and prohibited father from having any contact with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 In early May 2015, father was criminally charged with aggravated incest in relation to L.M.'s disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Meanwhile, mother admitted that the children's environment was injurious. But, father denied the allegations in the petition. After a multi-day hearing in August 2015, the juvenile court adjudicated the children dependent and neglected, finding by a preponderance of evidence that father had sexually abused L.M. and that M.M. was suffering from secondary trauma as a result of the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 The next month, the court adopted the parties' stipulated treatment plan for father. The treatment plan required father to (1) participate in a psychosexual evaluation within thirty days and follow any recommended offense-specific treatment and (2) maintain contact with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Father completed the psychosexual evaluation in June 2016, after the Department authorized a one-way release so that the caseworker could provide information to the evaluator without the evaluator automatically releasing the assessment to the Department. That same month, the Department moved to terminate the parent-child legal relationships between father and the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Two months later, a jury acquitted father of the criminal charge arising from L.M.'s outcry. Immediately after the verdict, father released the psychosexual evaluation to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The court held a four-day termination hearing in October and December 2016. Although the children remained in mother's care, the court concluded that granting permanent\n   custody of the children to her was not a less drastic alternative. The court then entered a judgment terminating father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Father appealed the termination judgment. We issued an opinion reversing the judgment because the record did not support the juvenile court's decision to terminate father's parental rights. The opinion also held that before the juvenile court could again consider termination of parental rights, it had to adopt an appropriate treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Department then filed a petition for rehearing asking us to \"revisit\" the opinion. After reviewing the petition, we issue a modified opinion and deny the petition for rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. Less Drastic Alternative and Termination of Parental Rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Father contends that the juvenile court erred in terminating his parental rights by determining that there was no less drastic alternative. We agree that the record does not support the juvenile court's decision to terminate father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.

It also observed that all the allegations in the case arose out of the alleged sexual assault of L.M., which it had found occurred by a preponderance of the evidence in its adjudicatory order. But, the court concluded that it could not find that\n   the sexual assault allegations had been established by clear and convincing evidence. The court even observed that it could not \"discount the possibility that no sexual abuse occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 34 Still, the juvenile court concluded that clear and convincing evidence showed that the children were experiencing trauma and the \"trauma is specific to [father].\" The court found that father denied and failed to recognize the children's trauma and would not change his attitude. It also determined that empathy was a \"key issue\" in the case and father had not completed a victim's empathy program as recommend by the psychosexual evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 35 The court reviewed an evaluation made during the parties' domestic relations case and further concluded that father lacked self-awareness about his anger issues. The court also found that father's lack of recognition that he had done anything wrong would prevent progress in his reunifying with the children. Accordingly, it determined that father was unfit, as he was unable or unwilling to meet the children's needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 36 The court also considered whether granting permanent custody of the children to mother was a less drastic alternative to termination. But, it determined that this was not a viable option as (1) the children were fearful and believed the sexual assault happened; (2) father was not ready or able to acknowledge the children's perceptions; and (3) the likelihood or possibility of reunification therapy or future contact with father would not be in the children's best interests and could cause trauma to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   1. Undetermined Sexual Abuse and Victim Empathy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 37 We first address the juvenile court's conclusion that father had failed to address the children's perception of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38 To be sure, the record demonstrates the difficulty in devising a treatment plan to address an allegation of sexual abuse by a parent when the child believes the abuse happened but the parent maintains that he or she did not commit the abuse. The initial caseworker explained that it was challenging to reunite children with parents who do not acknowledge the children's experience because \"the child has a belief this happened, so they are fearful.\" Likewise, the current caseworker opined that it would be traumatic for the children \"to confront an abuser who won't admit that the event happened itself, when the [children] sincerely seem to believe that it did.\" She further elaborated that it would invalidate L.M.'s experience to \"confront someone who had sexually abused her\" and \"pretend[ ] nothing is wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39 Despite this difficulty, a single incident of sexual abuse (as opposed to a pattern of sexual abuse) is not one of the circumstances in which the Children's Code authorizes a court to terminate parental rights without devising a treatment plan that is calculated to render the parent fit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 19-3-508(1)(e)(I), 19-3-604(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 40 The court approved a treatment plan that required father to complete a psychosexual evaluation and recommended treatment. The evaluation, in turn, required father to follow Sex Offender Management Board (SOMB) guidelines and protocols. This requirement continued even though father was ultimately acquitted of the criminal charges related to the sexual abuse allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 41 The SOMB procedures \"provide for an evaluation and identification of the adult sex offender and recommend management, monitoring, and treatment based upon existing research and shall incorporate the concepts of the risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional model.\" \u00a7 16-11.7-103(4)(a), C.R.S. 2017. The SOMB also develops, implements, and revises, as appropriate,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   guidelines and standards to treat adult sex offenders, including adult sex offenders with intellectual and developmental disabilities, incorporating in the guidelines and standards the concepts of the risk-need-responsivity or another evidence-based correctional model, which guidelines and standards can be used in the treatment of offenders who are placed on probation, incarcerated with the department of corrections,\n   placed on parole, or placed in community corrections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00a7 16-11.7-103(4)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 42 But, a key provision of the SOMB procedures is that they are designed for sex offenders. A \"sex offender\" is designated as a person who is one of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (I) Convicted in the state of Colorado, on or after January 1, 1994, of any sex offense ...; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (II) Convicted in the state of Colorado on or after January 1, 1994, of any criminal offense, if such person has previously been convicted of a sex offense ... in the state of Colorado, or if such person has previously been convicted in any other jurisdiction of any offense that would constitute a sex offense ..., or if such person has a history of any sex offenses ...; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (III) Convicted in the state of Colorado on or after July 1, 2000, of any criminal offense, the underlying factual basis of which involves a sex offense; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (IV) A juvenile who has committed a sexual offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00a7 16-11.7-102(2)(a), C.R.S. 2017. A person who receives a deferred judgment or deferred sentence for these offenses is also included. \u00a7 16-11.7-102(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 43 In short, SOMB treatment protocols are geared toward treating individuals who have been convicted of a sexual offense instead of determining whether an individual has committed an alleged sexual offense. Indeed, father's evaluator explained that \"offense specific evaluations are really built around the premise of guilt\" and that \"we don't have tools that determine whether somebody is guilty or innocent, so evaluations such as this are always done under the premise of guilt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 44 And, the SOMB has processes that therapists and supervising officers, like a caseworker, are to follow when offenders are convicted of a sexual crime before allowing contact with child victims. One part of the process is that the offender is not allowed to have contact with a child until he or she has admitted the offense against the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 45 As a result, the record is replete with evidence that no progress was made toward reunification because father had not admitted or acknowledged the abuse. And, father was adamant that he was not going to admit molesting or abusing the children when he had not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 46 This component of SOMB treatment - the requirement that an offender admit to abusing a child before having contact with the child - placed father in a no-win situation and was not reasonably calculated to render him a fit parent who could meet the children's needs. On the one hand, if, as here, father failed to admit that he had abused L.M., this led to termination on the basis that father had not complied with the treatment plan and was unable to have contact with the children or work toward reunification with them. On the other hand, if father had acknowledged that he had sexually abused L.M., this would also be evidence of his unfitness under section 19-3-604(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 47 Moreover, faulting father for not completing treatment that required him to acknowledge sexual abuse of L.M. is incompatible with the juvenile court's conclusion that it could not discount the possibility that no sexual abuse had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 48 And, there is no indication in the record that father was offered treatment or a path to becoming a fit parent other than to acknowledge that he had sexually abused L.M. In fact, the record offers no indication that father could have taken any steps, short of admitting that he had sexually abused L.M., to acknowledge the children's perceptions of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 49 Finally, we recognize that the grounds for adjudicating the children dependent and neglected-the sexual abuse of L.M.-only needed to be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of J.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805263\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/1151/\">\n    2016 CO 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805263\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/1151/\">\n    370 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, for the sexual abuse to serve as a basis for determining that father was unfit, and, thus, there was no less drastic alternative to termination, it needed to be established by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-3-604(1)(c), (2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 50 For these reasons, the juvenile court's findings regarding father's failure to address the abuse or perceived sexual abuse are insufficient\n   to support its conclusion that there is no less drastic alternative to termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 51 In reaching this conclusion, we do not intend to suggest that a court is necessarily prohibited from requiring a parent to participate in psycho-sexual or offense specific evaluations and treatment absent a criminal conviction. Just the opposite, a juvenile court may require such treatment when it is warranted by the record before the court. See People in the Interest of C.L.S.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12004712\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/934/851/#p856\">\n    934 P.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 (Colo. App. 1996) (perceiving no abuse of discretion in the juvenile court's decision, based on the evidence before it, to require the father to submit to a sexual aggression evaluation and possible treatment as a component of the treatment plan). And, we need not decide whether it is appropriate to require a parent to admit to sexual abuse when he or she has been convicted of a criminal offense related to the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 52 Nonetheless, when as here, a parent is acquitted of the criminal charges related to sexual abuse of his or her child and the court cannot find that the abuse occurred by clear and convincing evidence, the parent's failure to admit to the sexual abuse as part of the treatment protocol is insufficient to support termination of parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   2. Other Causes for the Children's Trauma\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 53 Next, we turn to the juvenile court's conclusion that father was unwilling to take responsibility for any portion of the children's trauma even if it was related to \"other conduct or statements of [father] during or after the divorce proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 54 The record undeniably establishes that the children were experiencing significant trauma related to father. The initial caseworker observed trauma symptoms in the children when they discussed father. When the criminal trial was approaching, the children, especially L.M., would \"shut down\" when she discussed visitation with father. The caseworker also testified that L.M. typically did not want to visit father and was having difficulty in school and sleeping because she was worried about visits. Thus, she opined that the children were not ready to visit father. Mother also described exacerbated behaviors by the children. For example, she described that L.M. would have aggressive outbursts as well as panic attacks and make threats to harm herself and M.M. In contrast, she described that M.M. would stop verbal communication and grunt or mimic animal sounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 55 The children's therapist stopped working with L.M. on completing a trauma narrative because she could not tolerate the anxiety that it was causing her to write it. Likewise, a therapist who completed trauma assessments of L.M. and M.M. determined that the children were experiencing trauma symptoms, but had not tried to determine when the traumatic event occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 56 The trauma therapist also opined that the children were experiencing stress from the court involvement. For example, during the trauma assessment, L.M. was asked to put people who were in her life in a sand tray. She separated mother's family and father's family. She placed father's family in the corner with a fence and \"indicated that she hated court ... and put herself on the fence between her mom and dad and indicated that it was her job to make sure that she-everyone was being good.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 57 But, the record is devoid of any indication that father was asked to address any other potential causes of the children's trauma. For example, the Department made no request (nor was there a court order) for father to participate in evaluations or treatment services to resolve other issues, such as father exhibiting intense anger or making inappropriate statements during the parties' divorce proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 58 To be sure, the initial caseworker testified that father had not made any admissions to her about his behavior that had impacted his children. The therapist providing denier's intervention therapy likewise agreed that father had not admitted any abuse or mistreatment of the children. Nonetheless, the record does not establish that, apart from the sexual abuse allegation, father was asked about or otherwise unwilling to acknowledge any parental deficiencies that might have contributed to the children's trauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 59 We also recognize that the juvenile court faulted father for failing to complete a victim's empathy program as recommended by the psychosexual evaluator. Indeed, the psychosexual evaluator believed that father could benefit from a victim empathy program regardless of whether he had committed the abuse to \"thoroughly understand how this has likely impacted the children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 60 Yet, there is no evidence that the program would have enabled father to develop empathy or otherwise understand the children's needs generally. Rather, the evaluator explained that the victim's empathy module is aimed at \"helping a client to better understand how sexual behaviors likely have impacted the victim\" and, ideally, \"work[ing] a little bit with the actual victim's therapist so that the offender can really learn more about how [his or her] behaviors directly impacted [the] victim.\" In short, it was to help father \"better understand how his sexually abusive behavior ... directly impacted the children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 61 Under these circumstances, the juvenile court erred in concluding that father's failure to address other possible issues, and the children's corresponding trauma, demonstrated that he was an unfit parent, and thus, that granting custody of the children to mother was not a viable less drastic alternative to termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 62 Accordingly, the termination judgment must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   III. ICWA Compliance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 63 Although not raised by father on appeal, the record does not demonstrate full compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 1963 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 64 ICWA's provisions are for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and their resources and to protect Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), (3).
