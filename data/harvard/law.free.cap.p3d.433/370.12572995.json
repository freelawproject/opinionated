The following facts reflect that standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On an October night, around 9:00 p.m., Deputy Lillie was patrolling the small city of Lakeside and saw defendant walking on a sidewalk. Lillie noticed that defendant's body movements were irregular, in that she walked with \"jerky * * * kind of spastic type movements.\" Defendant walked with a cane, but Lillie thought her movements were \"something beyond\" what could normally be attributed to walking with a cane. Lillie believed that defendant might be under the influence of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Without activating his lights or using his PA system, Lillie pulled over and parked his marked patrol vehicle in a parking space abutting the sidewalk. Lillie got out of his vehicle, approached defendant from the side, and initiated a conversation about local fall festivities. Lillie observed that defendant's speech was very fast, her mouth appeared\n   dry, her lips were chapped, and her eyes were dilated-all things that Lillie knew, from his training and experience, were signs of stimulant usage. Lillie told defendant that he \"was observing these certain signs\" and that based on his\n   knowledge, he \"believed that she was under the influence of methamphetamine.\" He then asked her if she had any illegal drugs on her person. Defendant, taken aback, said, \"I don't appreciate you insinuating that I have drugs on me.\" Lillie responded, \"It would be easy to prove me wrong, you know, * * * [b]y showing me that your purse doesn't contain drugs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant admitted that she had a marijuana joint in her purse, and stated that she did not have a medical marijuana card.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant told Lillie that he could look through the top of her purse for the joint. When he did, Lillie saw a tissue darkened with soot sticking out of a hard glasses case. From his training and experience, Lillie believed that the case contained a pipe for smoking methamphetamine. He asked defendant what was in the case, and defendant told him that it was a marijuana pipe. Lillie told defendant she could not keep the pipe. Defendant said, \"Yep, I understand,\" and told Lillie that he could take the case. Lillie did so, and found a pipe inside the case that subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state charged defendant with unlawful possession of methamphetamine. Defendant moved to suppress all evidence that Lillie seized as a product of the encounter, arguing that Lillie lacked reasonable suspicion to justify a stop under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. That is, defendant argued that Lillie stopped her when he accused her of using drugs, and that because Lillie lacked reasonable suspicion that defendant was in possession of illegal drugs, the stop was unlawful. Defendant and Lillie both testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court denied the motion to suppress, concluding that Lillie did not stop defendant until after she consented to the search of her purse. The court explained, \"[Lillie] parked his car and [defendant] stopped and looked at him and they began a conversation. * * * And, when he told her about his suspicions she might have been taken aback by that, but she allowed him to glance in her purse.\" After the suppression hearing, defendant waived her right to a\n   jury trial. The parties stipulated that the trial court could consider Lillie's testimony and a lab report stating that the pipe contained methamphetamine, and the court found her guilty of the possession charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, defendant renews her argument that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress. Defendant contends that Lillie stopped defendant when he confronted her with his belief and observations that she was under the influence of methamphetamine, asked her if she possessed any illegal substances, and told her that she could easily prove him wrong by consenting to a search of her purse. Because Lillie lacked reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed methamphetamine at that point, defendant argues that the stop was unlawful, and that the results should therefore be suppressed. The state responds that, under the totality of the circumstances, the interaction between Lillie and defendant did not implicate Article I, section 9, until after defendant consented to the search of her purse. The state does not dispute defendant's contentions that, if defendant was seized before that point, (1) Lillie acted without reasonable suspicion and (2) the evidence sought to be suppressed was the unattenuated product of that alleged unlawful seizure. Thus, our review turns on whether Lillie stopped defendant before or after defendant's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Article I, section 9, protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. A stop is \"a type of seizure that involves a temporary restraint on a person's liberty and that violates Article I, section 9, unless justified by, for example, * * * reasonable suspicion that the person has been involved in criminal activity[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that circumstance, no reasonable person would conclude that she could say \"no thanks\" or walk away until the accusation of drug possession was disproven. Thus, we are convinced that Lillie engaged in a \"show of authority\" such that defendant was stopped for purposes of Article I, section 9, before defendant consented to the search of her purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Whenever the state has obtained evidence following the violation of a defendant's Article I, section 9, rights, it is presumed that the evidence was tainted by the violation and must be suppressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414212\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/274/#p279\">\n    286 Or.App. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414212\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/274/#p279\">\n    398 P.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our conclusion that defendant was stopped for purposes of Article I, section 9, fully resolves the appeal, because the state has not argued that Lillie had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant or that the challenged evidence was nonetheless admissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414212\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/274/#p279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414212\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/274/#p279\">\n    at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414212\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/274/#p279\">\n    398 P.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
