We need address only two. We conclude that the juvenile court erred by incorporating the detailed allegations of the petition in dependency and neglect into its statement-of-the-case instruction to the jury and by admitting evidence that mother refused to submit herself and her child to drug testing before the petition had been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Because the errors are not harmless, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The child weighed approximately seven pounds at birth, but he lost twelve percent of his birthweight in the next three days. The hospital social worker had concerns that the baby (who was breastfeeding) was not being fed enough, that the parents were not sufficiently \"responsive to advice or information that hospital personnel were providing\" to them, and that \"perhaps substance use was going on.\" Her \"greatest concern,\" however, was that, while \"typical first-time mother[s]\" tend to \"ask[ ] a lot of questions and [are] nervous about the care of a baby,\" she \"didn't see evidence of that\" with mother. Based on these concerns, the hospital social worker reported the family to the Denver Department of Human Services (the Department). The Department was also informed that mother had refused to allow the hospital to test her or the child for drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Around the same time, the Department received a second referral, from an unknown source, stating that mother and father might be using methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Upon receipt of the referrals, a caseworker visited the family at their pop-up camper. The child was six days old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The visit went badly. The caseworker asked both parents to submit to drug testing, and she asked mother to stop breastfeeding the child until mother could show that she was not using controlled substances. Both parents refused. The caseworker later described mother's reaction as \"escalated\" and father's as \"escalated,\" \"hostile,\" and \"volatile.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The caseworker believed that the child's environment was unsafe because she could not determine whether the parents were using controlled substances and because the parents had been \"hostile and volatile\" in their interactions with her. As a result, she obtained a \"judge's hold\" granting the Department custody of the child and immediately removed him from the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Two days later, the Department filed a petition in dependency and neglect. The petition contained a detailed case history, including a summary of the referrals that prompted the Department's action and a description of the caseworker's encounter with the parents and the removal of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 At the Department's request, a magistrate ordered the parents to submit to sobriety monitoring. The magistrate ruled that the tests were for safety purposes and their results would not be admissible at the parents' adjudicatory trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Shortly before the trial, the Department amended the case history portion of the petition. It added information that included the dates the parents had missed court-ordered drug tests and the results of the tests they had taken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 At the beginning of the adjudicatory trial, as part of its statement of the case instruction, the juvenile court read the entire amended case history portion of the petition to the venire. Later, the court also admitted evidence that mother had declined requests for drug testing before the Department had even filed the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The jury determined that the child was dependent and neglected because his environment was injurious to his welfare, he was lacking proper parental care, and his\n   parents had failed or refused to provide proper or necessary subsistence, education, medical care, or other care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-3-102(1)(b)-(d), C.R.S. 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.

The Juvenile Court's Statement of the Case Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 Father contends that the juvenile court committed reversible error when it incorporated the case history portion of the petition into its statement of the case instruction to prospective jurors. We agree. We further conclude that the error requires reversal because it impaired the basic fairness of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Standard of Review and Preservation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 A trial court must correctly instruct the jury on applicable law, but it retains substantial discretion over the form and style of jury instructions.\n   <em>\n    Townsend v. People\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989364\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/1108/#p1111\">\n    252 P.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1111 (Colo. 2011). Accordingly, we review legal conclusions implicit in jury instructions de novo, but review issues of form and style for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989364\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/1108/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We conclude, and the parties agree, that the juvenile court's formulation of the statement of the case instruction is an issue of form and style and is therefore reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. A trial court abuses its discretion when it instructs a jury in a way that is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair,\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33, or when it misconstrues the law, including a rule of procedure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

The Department and the guardian ad litem acknowledge the parents' objection, but they nonetheless contend that the parents invited any error by failing to tender an alternate instruction. That contention misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 The invited error doctrine encapsulates the principle that \"a party may not complain on appeal of an error that he has invited or injected into the case[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

The doctrine prevents a party from inducing an inappropriate or erroneous ruling and then later seeking to profit from that error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10395975\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/779/1307/#p1309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Here, for example, if the parents had requested that the juvenile court read the entire petition as its introductory instruction, they would be barred by the invited error doctrine from complaining on appeal that the court had read the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zapata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10395975\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/779/1307/#p1309\">\n    779 P.2d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the parents did not ask the court to read the petition; they asked the court not to read the petition. And the court denied their request. Accordingly, we conclude that the invited error doctrine does not apply and that the parents have preserved the issue for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 In a civil case, a properly preserved objection to an instruction is subject to review for harmless error.\n   <em>\n    Gasteazoro v.

The Juvenile Court's Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 26 The parties did not submit a jointly prepared CJI-Civ. 41:1 instruction or joint statement of factual information for the court to include in its introductory remarks to prospective jurors. In accordance with CJI-Civ. 41:1, the court began with an introduction\n   of the parties and an explanation regarding their role in the case. From there, the pattern instruction directs the court to explain that \"[t]he case is based upon a petition that claims (insert the relevant portions of the petition).\" CJI-Civ. 41:1 (2018). Rather than inserting the statutory grounds for the petition, with some limited factual explanation of those grounds, the court announced, \"[t]he case is based on a Petition, and I'm going to read you the contents of that Petition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 27 The court then recited the entire 900-word amended case history-a portion of the petition identified as \"[t]he facts, based on information and belief, which bring said children [sic] within the jurisdiction of the [c]ourt.\" The Department was not identified as the declarant, although some statements were attributed to the caseworker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 28 By doing so, the court read a play-by-play account of the Department's interactions with the family in the days and weeks after the child's birth. It recounted in detail the caseworker's description of the parents' conduct when she contacted the family six days after the child's birth, including statements that the parents were \"volatile,\" \"escalated,\" and \"aggressive.\" The court recited allegations that the parents were \"uncooperative\" and had refused drug testing; mother had dark, fresh bruises on the insides of her arms; mother had refused to stop breastfeeding pending a drug test that would verify she did not have marijuana in her system; the parents had refused a safety plan to ensure a sober caregiver for the child; the caseworker had called the police because she was \"in fear of the family fleeing with the child\"; the Department had obtained a judge's hold; and the Department had been granted custody of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 29 The case history the court read also contained specific information about drug testing: dates when the parents agreed or refused to submit to testing, the number of tests they missed or completed, and the test results. The descriptions included creatinine levels and statements that the Department had \"determined\" that mother's dilute urine samples-which, by definition, do not establish the presence of a controlled substance-were positive for controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 30 The court also read an unattributed assertion that mother had \"admitted knowing that [father] was using methamphetamine while caring for the[ ] child, but fail[ed] to recognize the impact on the child when [father] [was] under the influence of substances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 31 The court then instructed the prospective jurors as follows: \"You should understand that these are only claims, and you should not consider the claims as evidence in this case. [Mother] and [father] have denied the claims in the [p]etition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 32 The court's instruction did not explain the reason for the instruction in the first place-to inform the jury that it had to determine whether the Department had proved a statutory basis for finding the child dependent and neglected. The court's instruction did not mention the term \"dependent and neglected\" or any statutory basis for such a finding. To the contrary, the petition listed every possible statutory ground for adjudication under section 19-3-102(1), including some that could not possibly have applied to this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 19-3-102(1)(f) (child beyond control of parent); \u00a7 19-3-102(1)(g) (child tests positive at birth for controlled substance). Consequently, to what extent this information would have helped the prospective jurors understand the issues before them is at best debatable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2. The Instruction Was Not a Proper CJI-Civ. 41:1 Introductory Statement of the Case Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33 As we have said, the purpose of the introductory statement of the case instruction is simply to orient the jury to the nature of the case as a way of facilitating the jury selection process. The juvenile court's instruction departed from this limited purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 Contrary to the directives of C.R.C.P. 47(a)(2)(IV), the juvenile court's introductory instruction did not derive from a jointly prepared statement or consensus of the parties.

CJI-Civ. 2:1, for example, explains that the statement of the case instruction should use \"simple language\" to \"briefly\" describe the parties' positions, stating only \"the essential elements of the claim[s]\" and defenses. Similarly, COLJI-Crim. B:01 (2017), which is derived from Crim. P. 24(a)(2)(v) (the counterpart to C.R.C.P. 47 ), directs the court to summarize the charges set forth in the information, complaint, or indictment. That instruction makes clear the court should read only a short statement of the elements of the offense, rather than a detailed exposition of the circumstances surrounding the defendant's alleged commission, and the police investigation, of the crime. But here, the juvenile court chose the latter, impermissible approach, reading the functional equivalent of an arrest warrant affidavit to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

Circumstances Surrounding Mother's Refusal to Voluntary Submit to Drug Testing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 62 The record does not reveal why hospital personnel requested the tests. Testimony at trial established that the child exhibited none of the symptoms of prenatal drug exposure described by the various expert witnesses. Rather, he was born full term at an average birth weight of six pounds, fourteen ounces. He showed no signs of withdrawal at birth: there was no evidence that he had reflux, extreme tremors, or extreme startle reflexes, and he did not cry inconsolably. Further, the Department did not offer any evidence that the test was medically necessary to treat the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 63 Nor did the Department offer any evidence that mother was under the influence of controlled substances when she gave birth. The record suggests that mother had reported regular use of marijuana at a prenatal visit when she was sixteen weeks pregnant. But no evidence links this report to the request for the drug tests or to the Department's initiation of its investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 64 At the adjudicatory trial, a pediatric nurse who treated the child after he was removed from mother's custody repeatedly referenced mother's refusal to allow the hospital to drug test the child. The caseworker testified that mother's refusal to consent to drug testing of the child was \"very concerning\" because \"why would you refuse something that's going to be negative?\" She interpreted mother's refusal to mean \"there was something going on. There was usage going on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 65 Mother contends that evidence of her refusal to consent to the drug testing is irrelevant and therefore inadmissible, as she had no obligation to submit to testing or otherwise cooperate with the hospital or the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   2.

CRE 401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 67 The Department and the guardian ad litem argue that mother's refusal to consent to drug testing was relevant because it allowed the jurors to conclude that the results would have been positive for controlled substances and that mother wished to prevent the Department from assessing the child's safety. And, once the jury determined that mother had exposed the child to drugs, it could find that the child was dependent and neglected. This argument falters at the first step because the mere fact of mother's refusal does not reasonably lead to the conclusion that the test results would have been positive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 68 A person's refusal to perform a particular act has probative value only if the person has a duty to perform the act or it would have otherwise \"been natural under the circumstances\" for the person to take the action.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If the newborn baby was in medical distress and, in an effort to rule out drug exposure as a possible cause of the baby's condition, a doctor requested the parent's consent to perform a drug test, the parent's refusal would have some probative force, as reasonably suggesting that the parent's strong interest in avoiding a drug test trumped the safety of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 73 In this case, though, the jury had no way to evaluate the objective reasonableness of mother's refusal to consent. Therefore, any conclusion that mother had refused to consent for a nefarious, rather than an innocent, reason would have been based on complete speculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of R.D.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4602046\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/183/89/#p95\">\n    183 Colo. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4602046\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/183/89/#p95\">\n    514 P.2d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 (1973) (inferences may not be based on mere speculation or conjecture).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 74 Importantly, mother was entitled to a presumption that her refusal to consent was objectively reasonable.
