The Honorable Thad Balkman, District Judge, presided over Mason's jury trial and sentenced Mason, in accordance with the jury's verdict, to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Mason appeals raising the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) whether the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction for First Degree Malice Aforethought Murder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (2) whether the trial court erred in failing to suppress his statement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (3) whether the trial court erred in allowing the State to bolster a witness's extrajudicial identification with third-party testimony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (4) whether the trial court erred by failing to give a cautionary jury instruction on eyewitness identification;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (5) whether his trial was rendered fundamentally unfair by the admission of improper opinion testimony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (6) whether an enhancement statute resulted in a violation of the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (7) whether ineffective assistance of counsel deprived him of a fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b62 We find relief is not required and affirm the Judgment and Sentence of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b63 On October 15, 2006, Lowry Ewing, went to see his friend, Burney Ray Bounds, at Bounds' house located south of Dibble off of Highway 76 in McClain County. When he arrived, Ewing noticed that Bounds' car, a blue Subaru wagon, was gone and the front door of the house was ajar. He was alarmed because this was out of the ordinary; Bounds never left his house unlocked. Ewing entered the house and noticed that the front room was torn up; furniture was turned upside down and papers were strewn about the floor. Ewing knew Bounds to keep a tidy house so he assumed that Bounds' home had been broken in to and burgled. Ewing walked toward the telephone in the bedroom to call Bounds and tell him about the condition\n   in which he discovered his house. When he approached the bedroom door Ewing saw Bounds face down on the floor with his hands and feet tied behind him. Ewing knew that Bounds was dead. He backed up and went to the kitchen where he located Bounds' cell phone and called 911. Ewing waited outside for the police to arrive. When the authorities arrived it was confirmed that Bounds was dead. It was subsequently determined that the manner of death was homicide and that Bounds had died from traumatic asphyxia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b64 During the subsequent investigation it was discovered that in the late afternoon the day before Bounds' body was discovered, Bounds stopped at DJ's convenience store to fill up with gas and purchase gum as was his custom about once or twice a week. When Bounds went inside the store he spoke with his friend, Clara Rogers. Bounds told Rogers that he had picked someone up at the casino. When Rogers looked toward Bounds' car she noticed a man with long, black, curly hair and a bandana around his head. He was standing by Bounds' car waiting for him to exit the store. Rogers could not stop looking at the man because he was standing with his arms crossed glaring at her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b65 On the night of October 14, 2006, at around 10:00 to 11:00 p.m., Amanda Mayhew was driving with her mother on Highway 76 when they saw a skinny man, about fifty-eight or fifty-nine years old, beside a small blue station wagon that was up on jacks with a flat tire. A few days later when Mayhew drove past the area again, she noted that the blue station wagon was gone but a tire and jack had been left behind. By then she had heard about the homicide and that the police were looking for a blue station wagon so she notified the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b66 On October 14, 2006, at around 10:00 to 10:30 p.m., Dibble Reserve Police Officer Ricky Lee Peterman was driving a marked patrol unit traveling north on Highway 76 when he saw a man on the side of the road changing a tire on a small car like a Subaru. Peterman noted that the man was about five foot nine or ten and weighed approximately 155 or 160 pounds. He looked a little scruffy with long hair and a beard. Peterman pulled in behind the disabled vehicle and asked the man if he needed help. The man declined and Peterman left. Peterman learned the following day that there had been a homicide a block south of where he saw the man changing the tire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b67 On the morning of October 15, 2006, Terry Joe McDonald and his wife were driving north near Southwest 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   and MacArthur in Oklahoma City when they noticed a light blue Subaru wagon in a vacant lot. They noticed the car because they drove a Subaru and at the time there were very few Subarus in the state. The car was parked about a hundred yards from the interstate. Although it was a misty, rainy day, its windows were rolled down and there was no one inside the vehicle. The following day, MacDonald saw on the news that police were looking for a Subaru that had been involved in a crime. The news story gave a description of the car and the tag number. MacDonald went back to where he had seen the abandoned Subaru which was still there and confirmed that it was the car the police were looking for. He called and reported the missing vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b68 The OSBI was involved in the investigation of the crime and processed items found in Bounds' house and car. Duct tape had been used extensively to bind Bounds and was found on his hands, feet, neck, and mouth. It was also used to secure him to the bed. This duct tape was collected and examined as were several hairs found at the crime scene. OSBI Criminalist Chris Davis, certified as a latent fingerprint examiner, found usable latent prints not belonging to Bounds on pieces of duct tape stretching from Bounds' hands to the bed, on the partial roll of unused tape on the bed, and on a piece of tape attached to the headboard of the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b69 OSBI Criminalist Wendy Duke, who specialized in forensic biology, evaluated hairs found at the crime scene for the potential to conduct DNA analysis. Of twelve hairs deemed potentially capable of producing a DNA profile, one collected from a shirt found underneath Bounds' body produced enough DNA to develop a partial profile. This partial profile was submitted to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) which houses DNA profiles from other forensic cases as well as convicted offender samples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b610 Although the case went cold for a while, it was subsequently discovered that\n   Howard Shelton Mason, Jr., was a possible match to the forensic evidence. A DNA profile was developed from a known buccal swab taken from Mason and this profile was compared to the partial DNA profile developed from the hair found at the scene of the homicide. OSBI Criminalist, Antji Stambaugh, with the forensic biology unit, determined that Mason could not be excluded as a donor for the DNA profile from the hair collected from the scene; the statistical probability of the same profile belonging to a random person in the population was 1 in 4.66 million. Mason's fingerprint cards were also compared to the latent prints taken from duct tape found at the crime scene. Four of the latent prints matched Mason's known prints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b611 After Mason was identified as a suspect in the case Clara Rogers was approached by the police and asked to view photographs to see if she could identify the person she saw outside the convenience store waiting for Bounds. Despite the fact that Rogers was asked to view the pictures in 2015, some eight years after Bounds had been killed, Rogers identified a photograph of Mason as the man who she saw with Bounds the day before he was found dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b612 Mason was located and questioned by OSBI Agents David Gatlin and Josh Dean. During the audiotaped interview Mason admitted that he had been in Oklahoma hitchhiking along I-40 around the time Bounds was killed. Mason told the agents that an older fellow driving a station wagon picked him up. The man had work for him to do; he cleaned out the man's chicken coop and washed his dog. Mason said he stayed a couple of hours and the man took him back to the interstate. Mason said that he \"didn't hurt nobody.\" He was subsequently arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 Mason argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction for first degree malice murder. This Court reviews challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and will not disturb the verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime charged to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Head v.

Rather, Mason asserts that upon close examination of the trial testimony and evidence, no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the State proved he caused Bounds' death. As Mason points out, the evidence presented at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, established that he was at Bounds' home shortly before Bounds' was found dead on October 15, 2006. He acknowledges that the State presented evidence that he was seen with Bounds and his vehicle on the afternoon of October 14, 2006 and that two witnesses saw a man fitting his description changing a tire on a vehicle matching the description of Bounds' Subaru later that same day. Mason argues, however, that this evidence merely placed him with Bounds prior to his death. He goes on to acknowledge that the fingerprints and DNA profile obtained from a hair tie him to the crime scene but do nothing other than raise a suspicion of guilt because there was no additional evidence showing anything more than his presence\n   at the scene. Mason notes that unidentified fingerprints were found on other objects in the house and the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support his conviction because the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the only person who could have committed the crime. He argues that the State's case against him was based entirely upon conjecture and speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Mason's argument is unpersuasive. His fingerprints and the hair from which the DNA profile was extracted were found in close proximity to Bounds' body and on items used to restrain Bounds during the fatal attack. The forensic evidence connecting Mason to the attack must be considered along with the other evidence placing Mason with Bounds the day before Bounds' body was discovered. Considered in the aggregate and in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the charged offense, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 When Mason was identified as a suspect in this case he was located at the El Paso Transitional Center in El Paso, Texas. OSBI Agent David Gatlin secured a warrant for Mason's arrest and on May 5, 2015, Gatlin went with OSBI Agent Josh Dean to the transitional center and interviewed Mason. Mason subsequently filed a motion to suppress his statement arguing that it was inadmissible because it was made during a custodial interrogation before he was advised of his rights pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to trial the court held a\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Denno\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing to address the admissibility of Mason's statement. The trial court denied his motion to suppress and Mason argues on appeal that this ruling was error. Mason did not renew his objection to the introduction of his statement at trial. He has therefore, waived review of this issue on appeal for all but plain error.\n   <em>\n    Seabolt v.

The extent to which he could freely move about the facility was unclear. Although a Texas Ranger was in the conference room during the interview, the record does not show whether Mason was escorted to the conference room by the Texas Ranger or whether he went to the room unaccompanied. The interview lasted only fifteen to twenty minutes and there is no indication from the record that Mason was restrained during the questioning. Although Mason was not released at the end of the interview and it is clear that Agents Gatlin and Dean intended to arrest him, there is no indication that they conveyed this information to Mason before or during the interview. Mason was unaware of the extent to which his freedom of movement was actually limited. Mason has provided no evidence suggesting that a reasonable person in his circumstances would have believed he was not free to terminate the interview and leave before he specifically asked if he could leave. On the record before this Court, considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interview, we find that Mason has failed to show that the agents were required to advise him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights prior to the interview and that the trial court's ruling denying his motion to suppress was error.

Mason argues on appeal that the trial court erred in allowing Agent Gatlin to bolster Rogers' testimony about the extrajudicial identification.

Nor does he argue that Davis should not have been allowed to testify about his observations regarding the latent and known prints and the similarities he observed.

However, he asserts that in the last decade serious questions have been raised about the validity of these expressions of absolute certainty. He avers that \"[s]cholars have concluded that fingerprint examiners' claims to be able to individualize, that is to determine the source of an unknown print to the exclusion of all other possible sources in the universe, are not supported by empirical evidence.\" In support of his argument Mason cites to scholarly and scientific articles which call into question the ability of fingerprint examiners to state with absolute certainty that a particular latent print matches a known print. He also cites to two cases from Massachusetts which caution that testimony individualizing latent fingerprints to known fingerprints should be offered as opinion rather than as infallible fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b630 A similar argument was set forth in\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

The Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   that the appellant failed to cite to any jurisdiction which had ruled in support of his position. The Court also noted that Webster could have used the scholarly materials which raised questions about the validity and admissibility of fingerprint analysis to cross-examine the fingerprint experts at trial but he did not do so. The Court further found that Webster had failed to follow the proper procedure for supplementing the record in this Court with this kind of evidence. It was also noted that the fingerprint identification testimony could not plausibly have resulted in a mistaken identification or a wrongful conviction since Webster was also implicated in the commission of the crime by DNA evidence. Consequently, the Court did not address the claim further but declined to find plain error in the admission of the testimony about the latent prints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b631 We reach the same conclusion here. While Mason cited to two cases from Massachusetts in support of his argument, those cases are merely persuasive authority and not particularly so. As in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   , the scholarly and scientific articles could have been, but were not, used at trial to cross-examine the fingerprint expert about the reliability of his conclusions regarding the comparison of fingerprints and palm prints. Also, as in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   , Mason was not connected to the crime scene by fingerprint evidence alone; he was also placed at the scene of the homicide by DNA evidence and a person fitting his description was placed by eyewitnesses with the victim and near the victim's home around the time of the homicide. Additionally, his own statement to the OSI agents placed him with the victim and at the victim's home around the time of the homicide. The introduction of testimony about the latent prints was not actual error and did not affect Mason's substantial rights. We find no error and relief is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b632 Mason killed Bounds in 2006.
