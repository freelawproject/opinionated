Racus argues\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress private communications that he had with an undercover Washington State Patrol (WSP) detective because he did not consent to these communications being recorded as required by the Washington Privacy Act (WPA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In the published portion of the opinion, we hold that Racus's communications with the undercover detective that occurred before the authorization to record was issued (referred to as \"pre-intercept communications\") were private, but that Racus impliedly consented to the communications being recorded, and thus, the trial court did not err by denying the motion to suppress the pre-intercept communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we reject all additional arguments and hold that probable cause supported the authorization to record Racus's communications; thus, the trial court did not err by denying the motion to suppress Racus's communications with the undercover detective that occurred after the authorization to record was issued (referred to as \"post-intercept communications\"). We further hold that the trial court did not err by refusing to give an entrapment instruction because the evidence did not support giving the instruction. We also hold that the State presented sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that Racus took a substantial step toward committing the crime of attempted first degree rape of a child. Lastly, we hold that because Racus did not object at trial and fails to show that any of the prosecutor's arguments were so flagrant and ill-intentioned that they could not have been cured with an instruction, he has waived his claim of prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On December 17, 2015, WSP Detective Sergeant Carlos Rodriguez (Det. Rodriquez) posted an advertisement on Craigslist as part of an online sting operation by the Washington State Patrol Missing and Exploited Children's Task Force (MECTF). The advertisement was posted in the \"casual encounters\" section of Craigslist. Det. Rodriguez posed as a female parent seeking others to have sexual contact with her minor children. The advertisement stated, \"Looking for a close family connection - 2 dau, [ ] 1 son - w4w (Tacoma).\" 4 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 602. The body of the advertisement stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I just moved here and looking for someone to connect with my young family. Would like a woman's touch, but open to a man as well, must be discrete, no solicitations, open to presents. No RP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4 VRP at 605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Det. Rodriguez later explained at trial that \"dau\" means daughters and \"w4w\" means woman for woman. Using an anonymous e-mail address, Det. Rodriguez posed as a fictitious mother named \"Kristl,\" who had three minor children. Det. Rodriguez's computer used Google Hangouts software to preserve the messages received by persons who responded to the advertisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 On December 17, Racus answered the advertisement. He then engaged in a series of e-mails and text messages with \"Kristl,\" asking about having sex and asking about her children. The next day, Racus reinitiated contact though another series of e-mails and then text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 On December 18 at 4:00 PM, Det. Rodriguez obtained an authorization to record communications. The intercept authorization was based on Det. Rodriguez's belief that there was probable cause to believe Racus would engage in\n   the commercial exploitation of a minor for sex for a fee later that day when he met \"Kristl\" and her children. Based on the intercept authorization, Det. Rodriguez recorded all communications with Racus after December 18 at 4:00 PM, including numerous text messages and two telephone calls related to Racus's desire to meet with the mother and her children for sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 During the two telephone calls with \"Kristl,\" Racus agreed to meet the mother and her children at their house to have sex, and then obtained the address of \"Kristl's\" house. After arriving at \"Kristl's\" house and greeting her, Racus was arrested. The State charged Racus with attempted first degree rape of a child and communicating with a minor for immoral purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Prior to trial, Racus filed a motion to suppress the communications that occurred before the authorization to record based on a lack of consent. Racus also moved to suppress the communications that occurred after the authorization to record based upon a lack of probable cause. The trial court reviewed the transcript of all of the communications both before and after the authorization to record communications, and found that Racus \"implicitly or impliedly\" consented to the recording of the pre-intercept communications and text messages. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 249-50. Accordingly, the court denied the motion to suppress the pre-intercept text messages. The trial court also ruled that probable cause existed to authorize the intercept and denied the motion to suppress the post-intercept communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. TRIAL TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 At trial, Det. Rodriguez testified about the sting operation that resulted in Racus's arrest. Det. Rodriguez\n   explained that he completed an online form on Craigslist using a fictitious name and an anonymous e-mail address. Using the name \"Kristl\" and the e-mail address, Det. Rodriguez then typed the message and posted the advertisement in the \"casual encounters\" section of Craigslist which is viewed by persons looking for people to engage in sex. He explained that each advertisement on Craigslist is assigned a unique post identification number that lists the date and time of the particular\n   posting. He testified that a person responding to the advertisement would contact him using the anonymous e-mail address. Det. Rodriguez would respond via e-mail and then attempt to have the person agree to respond back by text message and then by telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Craigslist advertisement posted on December 17 contained the phrase \"looking for a close family connection.\" 4 VRP at 602. Det. Rodriguez explained that he used this phrase because \"close family ... generally means something dealing with incest.\" 4 VRP at 585. The advertisement also contained the phrase \"open to presents.\" 4 VRP at 605. Det. Rodriguez explained that he used the words \"presents,\" \"gifts,\" and \"donations\" in the advertisement because those words are commonly used on Craigslist to suggest payment for a fee or the exchange of money for sex. 4 VRP at 586-87. He also explained that the term \"RP\" as used in the advertisement means role play. 4 VRP at 605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Det. Rodriguez testified that Racus responded to the advertisement on Craigslist on the same day it was posted. Racus's full name appeared in the e-mail response. Because Racus had an account with Craigslist, the post identification number \"4747\" on the first e-mail sent by Racus allowed Det. Rodriguez to verify that a person by the name of Darcy Racus was responding to the same Craigslist advertisement that he had posted in the casual encounters section earlier that day. 4 VRP at 603.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Det. Rodriguez testified that he was able to capture, preserve, and record his communications with Racus using\n   a Gmail account. Det. Rodriguez was able to display the communications to and from Racus to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 In his initial e-mail to \"Kristl,\" Racus stated, \"A little more detail, please.\" 5 VRP at 662. Det. Rodriguez responded by e-mail, \"What are you looking for? I am looking for someone with close family experience. I was very close with my father and brother.\" 5 VRP at 663. Racus e-mailed that he was \"looking to give a gal some oral and anything else sexual she needs.\" 5 VRP at 665. \"Kristl\" responded, \"What are your age limits? My girls are nearly 12 and 8. My oldest is very mature for her age. More restrictions with the 8, but she is good for oral.\" 5 VRP at 666. Racus asked, \"How old are you?\" 5 VRP at 667. \"Kristl\" e-mailed, \"I am 39, but this is more for them. I'm always present, but I'm into watching to make sure they are ok and happy.\" 5 VRP at 667.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Racus e-mailed, \"Really need to be of legal age. A person can go to jail over that. If you are interested in receiving oral, I don't mind if they watch or even do their own thing. You have photos?\" 5 VRP at 667. \"Kristl\" acknowledged that Racus could go to jail and asked whether he would feel more comfortable texting. Racus replied, \"Do you host and when would this take place?\" 5 VRP at 672. \"Kristl\" explained that the person would come to her place. Racus then e-mailed and asked, \"You no longer interested? I have until 3.\" 5 VRP at 663. \"Kristl\" e-mailed that she was \"not home till 4. Can do tomorrow. Text me [at the telephone number provided]. Text your name and word till three.\" 5 VRP at 675. In his last e-mail that day, Racus asked, \"So what is it you are looking to get out of this? So we are on the up and up.\" 5 VRP at 677.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The next day, December 18, Racus reinitiated contact by text at 11:27 AM and asked, \"Darcy till three. Is this free? Or are you looking for something?\" 5 VRP at 679. Soon after, he e-mailed the same message in all capital letters. Racus e-mailed again and said, \"What you wanting from me? You ask that I text you today and I did. No response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   You still interested?\" 5 VRP at 683. He then e-mailed, \"Hello? Family connection?\" 5 VRP at 698. In response, \"Kristl\" texted back, \"Sorry, Darcy. So many people answer on here and it's hard to see who is real and not a flake.\" 5 VRP at 699. Racus texted back, \"I am real.\" 5 VRP at 699. \"Kristl\" texted and asked what experience Racus had and what he wanted. Racus promptly texted, \"Not much. Looking to give oral and maybe receive if all are clean. What is it you are looking for?\" 5 VRP at 700. \"Kristl\" texted, \"That sound[s] good[ ]. This is more for my family to have the same experience that I had growing up. My son is 13, my daughters are nearly 12 and 8.\" 5 VRP at 700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 After several texts, Racus asked if the mother wanted to meet. \"Kristl\" texted, \"Not till I know what you want, hun, and I have a system. I have to talk to you first.\" 5 VRP at 708. He then texted, \"Want to orally please a gal and have it done back to me. Or sex.\" 5 VRP at 708. \"Kristl\" texted, \"So which one gal, hun? Oral pleasure is always good.\" 5 VRP at 709. Racus texted, \"Yes it is. Older or you.\" 5 VRP at 709. \"Kristl\" texted that Lisa, her fictitious daughter, was nearly twelve years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 Racus and \"Kristl\" continued to text and then talked on the telephone. In response, Racus asked Kristl to explain the rules of the encounter, \"Kristl\" texted, \"No pain, no anal, condoms if more than oral,\" Racus texted, \"Ok. Good with that.\" 5 VRP at 714. After this message at 4:00 PM, Det. Rodriguez requested and obtained an intercept authorization warrant from a supervisor based on his belief that Racus was going to engage in the commercial exploitation of a minor for a fee when he went to meet with \"Kristl\" later that day. The intercept authorized Det. Rodriguez to record all communications with Racus from that point forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 \"Kristl\" and Racus spoke on the telephone and during those calls, \"Kristl\" confirmed that Racus wanted to have oral sex. When \"Kristl\" asked Racus which of the daughters he would prefer to have sex with, he responded, \"Lisa. Have a pic?\" 5 VRP at 711. Det. Rodriguez sent a\n   picture of a young girl. During another telephone call, Racus mentioned Lisa's braces as he saw them in the picture that \"Kristl\" sent him. \"Kristl\" assured Racus that Lisa could give him oral sex without scraping his genitals. Det. Rodriguez then handed the telephone to another undercover officer posing as Lisa. Racus asked Lisa if she was looking forward to their meeting, she said yes and referred to all of her other friends' experiences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Racus then coordinated with \"Kristl\" when and where to meet them. On his way to meet them, \"Kristl\" asked Racus to bring Skittles for Lisa because \"[s]he asked for some.\" 5 VRP at 716. Racus said he would try and then confirmed that he had obtained a bag of Skittles for Lisa. Racus arrived at the agreed address provided by \"Kristl.\" Another female undercover officer posing as \"Kristl\" greeted Racus at the door of the house. Officers then arrested Racus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III. VERDICT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 The jury found Racus guilty of attempted first degree rape of a child and communicating with a minor for immoral purposes. The trial court sentenced Racus to a standard range sentence. He appeals his convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I. COMMUNICATIONS BEFORE AUTHORIZATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 Racus first argues that the trial court erred by failing to suppress the pre-intercept recorded communications because he did not consent to their being recorded under the WPA. We disagree because Racus impliedly consented to the pre-intercept e-mails and text messages being\n   recorded under the WPA. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not err by denying Racus's motion to suppress the pre-intercept communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 The WPA provides that it is unlawful for any individual or for the State to intercept or record a private communication or conversation, by any device, electronic or otherwise, without obtaining the consent of all of the parties participating in the conversation.

Appellant's Opening Br. at 33. Racus argues that no reasonable detective would have had probable cause to believe that Racus was engaging in the commercial sexual abuse of a minor. Therefore, he argues that the requirements of RCW 9.73.230(1)(b)(ii) were not met for the supervisor to authorize an intercept to record the communications Racus had with \"Kristl\" after 4:00 PM on December 18. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 The WPA allows for communications to be recorded when authorized by someone above a \"first line supervisor\" if \"[p]robable cause exists to believe that the conversation or communication\" will involve \"[a] party engaging in the commercial sexual abuse of a minor.\" RCW 9.73.230(1)(b)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 Former RCW 9.68A.100(1)(c) (2013) provides that a \"person is guilty of commercial sexual abuse of a minor if ...

Rodriguez testified that the terms \"presents,\" \"gifts,\" and \"donations\" and the phrase \"open to presents\" as used in the advertisement, are used by persons viewing the Craigslist casual encounters section to suggest payment for a fee or the exchange of money for sex. 4 VRP at 586-87, 605. Shortly after contacting \"Kristl,\" Racus e-mailed and asked, \"So what is it you are looking to get out of this? So we are on the up and up.\" 5 VRP at 677. When Racus did not receive a response, he followed up the next morning by sending an e-mail and then a text message asking, \"Is this free? Or are you looking for something?\" 5 VRP at 679-80. He then sent a series of e-mail and text messages attempting to set up sex between him and \"Kristl's\" daughter. Based on all of these communications, Det. Rodriguez requested and obtained an intercept authorized by a supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 In the case at bar, Racus responded to an advertisement that requested a sexual encounter with a minor, the advertisement used a colloquialism for payment, and Racus asked about payment. The communications that Racus exchanged with \"Kristl\" establish that he was aware that she was offering her two minor daughters for sex in exchange for a fee and that he appeared interested in paying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 All of these communications demonstrate that Racus intended to exchange sex with a minor for a fee. Thus, we hold that based on the totality of the circumstances, there were facts that would lead a reasonable detective to conclude that probable cause existed to believe that Racus would engage in the commercial sexual abuse of a minor in exchange for a fee. Thus, the WSP properly authorized the intercept to record the communications with Racus under RCW 9.73.230(1)(b)(ii).
