EHB 2163, 65th Leg., 3rd Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2017). The superior court dismissed Eyman's action for declaratory relief, Eyman appealed directly to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court transferred this case to our court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Eyman argues that his appeal is not moot and that the superior court improperly dismissed his action for declaratory relief as untimely. He also argues that the Attorney General's designation of a single advisory vote on EHB 2163 was inconsistent with the general purpose of Initiative 960, which amended RCW 43.135.041, and with the plain language of that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We hold that Eyman's appeal is moot, but presents matters of continuing and substantial public interest. For that reason, we exercise our discretion to decide it. We also hold that the superior court did not err when it dismissed Eyman's action for declaratory relief as untimely. For that reason, we do not reach the merits of Eyman's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Initiative 960 was approved by the voters in 2007. LAWS OF 2008, 60th Leg., Reg. Sess., ch. 1. This initiative requires that an advisory vote be held on any legislative tax increases which are not otherwise subject to public vote. RCW 43.135.041(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On June 30, 2017, the legislature passed EHB 2163, which, among other matters, amended three different excise taxes. First, the measure eliminated the retail sales and use tax exemption for food and food ingredients as it applied to bottled water. EHB 2163, \u00a7\u00a7 101, 102. Second, the bill narrowed a use tax exemption so that it no longer applied to refinery fuel consumed or used in Washington.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 107. Third, the bill modified the business and occupation tax nexus, so that the tax applied to more business activity than it previously did.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 301. Each of these provisions effectively raised taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 On July 27, the Attorney General designated the legislation for a single advisory vote on all three excise tax amendments and provided notice to the Secretary of State. The notice stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [w]ithin five days of receiving from your office a serial number for and copy of each of these measures as provided in RCW 29A.72.040, the Attorney General's Office will transmit to you a short description of each measure for the next general election ballot, as provided in RCW 29A.72.283.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 That same day, Eyman e-mailed the Attorney General, stating, \"[A]s you can see below, EHB 2163 had 3 different revenue sources. So each needs to be its own advisory vote.\" CP at 13. The Attorney General disagreed, stating that it treats the subcategories of excise taxes under RCW Title 82 as a single revenue source-excise taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 On August 3, the Attorney General provided the Secretary of State with a notice designating EHB 2163 as\n   Advisory Vote No. 17, with the following short description of Advisory Vote No. 17 to be printed on the general election ballot:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The legislature expanded, without a vote of the people, the business and occupation tax and narrowed certain retail sales and use tax exemptions, costing $565,000,000 in the first ten years, for government spending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This tax increase should be:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Repealed [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Maintained [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CP at 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 On August 4, Eyman filed a petition for declaratory judgment challenging the Attorney General's designation of Advisory Vote No. 17 as a single advisory vote. In his prayer for relief, Eyman requested, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a. For Declaratory Judgment declaring that Engrossed House Bill 2163 enacts three discrete tax increases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   b. For Declaratory Judgment declaring that Engrossed House Bill 2163 derives tax revenue from three discrete revenue sources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   c. For Declaratory Judgment declaring that the Attorney General's decision to seek one advisory vote for the tax increases imposed by EHB 2163 is therefore unlawful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CP at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 11 The superior court denied Eyman's petition, concluding that Eyman's action was untimely because the statute provided that once the ballot language has been established\n   it cannot be appealed. The superior court did not reach the merits of Eyman's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12 Eyman sought direct review at the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court transferred his appeal to our court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 Meanwhile, on Election Day 2017, Washingtonians voted on Advisory Vote No. 17. By more than 62 percent, the people called for repeal of EHB 2163.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I. MOOTNESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14 The State argues that Eyman's claims are moot because the people of Washington have already voted on EHB 2163 and the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine does not apply. Eyman argues there is an actual, present and existing dispute and that, even if his claims were moot, we should address the merits of his appeal because it involves matters of continuing and substantial public interest. For the following reasons, we hold that Eyman's appeal is moot, but presents issues of continuing and substantial public interest.

There, an association of city residents filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the placement on the ballot of a local measure repealing an ordinance that authorized the use of automated traffic safety cameras in the city. In a dissent, Justice Johnson argued that the advisory nature of the public vote weighed in favor of mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 22 The issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Mukilteo\n   </em>\n   was whether the measure exceeded the scope of the initiative power because it involved powers granted by the legislature to the governing bodies of cities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021856\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/41/\">\n    174 Wash.2d at 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=272%20P.3d%20227\">\n    272 P.3d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority opinion held that the measure exceeded the initiative power, but it did not discuss mootness in doing so.

Thus, the single advisory vote that Eyman challenged has become an accomplished fact.

Whether Eyman was right or wrong in his original contention, we can no longer provide him effective relief.

The State argues that because each piece of tax legislation involves a unique combination of elements, the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine does not apply, and that we should avoid issuing an advisory opinion. We agree with Eyman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 26 In determining the degree of public interest, we first consider whether or not the matter is of a private or public nature.\n   <em>\n    Satomi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004863\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/781/#p796\">\n    167 Wash.2d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=225%20P.3d%20213\">\n    225 P.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The content of a ballot and issues of statutory interpretation are generally matters of substantial public interest, and this factor weighs heavily in favor of applying the exception. The gravity of the interest is not substantially reduced by the advisory nature of the measures at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 27 We next consider the need for guidance to public officials.\n   <em>\n    Satomi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004863\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/781/#p796\">\n    167 Wash.2d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=225%20P.3d%20213\">\n    225 P.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State argues that Eyman's claims are specific to EHB 2163 and that our application of the advisory vote statutes to EHB 2163 will not necessarily resolve future issues about different, newly adopted laws. Therefore, the State argues, a decision will not be authoritative in other circumstances, especially considering the myriad forms tax legislation can ultimately take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 28 However, the timeliness and appealability issues here presented do not depend on the nature of the tax increase at issue. Nor\n   does the issue of consolidation, since the State argues that all excise taxes are a single revenue source, while Eyman argues that each specific excise tax is a separate source. That is the basic issue on the merits, and that issue will likely recur with each package of legislative tax increases. Resolution of the issues presented would supply valuable guidance to public officials and potential parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 29 Finally, we consider whether the problem is likely to recur.\n   <em>\n    Satomi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004863\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/781/#p796\">\n    167 Wash.2d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=225%20P.3d%20213\">\n    225 P.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons just given, this consideration also favors addressing the merits of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 30 The statute in controversy, and the Attorney General's interpretation of it, affects all Washingtonians. Because RCW 43.135.041(1)(a) requires an advisory vote each time the legislature raises taxes not otherwise subject to public vote, there will be more tax advisory ballot measures in the future. Thus, these same issues will likely recur: the scope of the \"not subject to appeal\" language in RCW 29A.72.283, and whether chapters .283 and .285 impose a deadline on challenges to consolidation. This case squarely presents these issues, and the State and the public have a continuing stake in them. Further, the resolution of these issues does not depend on the individual nature of the tax increases themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 31 Therefore, we conclude that this appeal presents matters of continuing and substantial public interest necessitating judicial resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   II.

This placement discloses an intent that the phrase \"not subject to appeal\" applies only to the Attorney General's formulation of the short description and not any other action related to advisory votes on tax legislation. Equally important, the phrase \"not subject to appeal\" is found only in RCW 29A.72.283, which specifically addresses the formulation of the short description; it is not found in the\n   statutory sections addressing any other steps in the preparation of advisory votes on tax legislation.

The effect of this provision, together with RCW 29A.72.283, is that the Attorney General's short description is not subject to appeal and shall be used in ballots after the events described in RCW 29A.72.285. A challenge to the\n   consolidation of measures necessarily affects their description and how they appear on the ballot. Thus, allowing challenges to the Attorney General's advisory vote designation after the events described in RCW 29A.72.285 would inject self-contradiction into the statutory scheme and potentially jeopardize timely preparation of the ballots.\n   <em>\n    Cary\n   </em>\n   requires us to use reasonableness as the standard for judging the timeliness of a declaratory judgment action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882785\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/132/495/#p500\">\n    132 Wash.

The requirement of RCW 29A.72.285 that \"[t]hereafter such short description shall be the description of the measure in all ballots\" could linguistically apply to either event. However, as held above, the formulation of the Attorney General's short description under RCW 29A.72.283 is not subject to appeal. The last step by the Attorney General in finalizing that description is transmitting it to the Secretary of State under RCW 29A.72.283, which occurred on August 3, 2007. That is the point beyond which the short description cannot be appealed. Thus, that is the point at which the short description is fixed, and at which RCW 29A.72.285 requires that it be used in the ballots. As shown above, any declaratory judgment action challenging consolidation must be filed by that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 49 On August 3, the Attorney General transmitted the short description of Advisory Vote No. 17 to the Secretary of State.
