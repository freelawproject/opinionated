LEXIS 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current appeal involves shares of Farmers' Stock that John Jr. owned with his father, John Sr., and Farmers' disposition of shares of that stock relative to John Jr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 On November 27, 1995, Farmers (then called Alpha-Omega Holding Company) issued stock to John Sr. and John Jr. as joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS). On March 26, 1997,\n   John Sr. and John Jr. jointly owned 181.619 shares pursuant to Farmers' Stock Certificate No. 20, which identified the owners as \"John P. Cote, Sr., or John P. Cote, Jr., JTWROS.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 In January 2011, John Sr. and Smith-Cote were living in Renton, Washington. Farmers communicated with Smith-Cote about transferring Stock ownership from John Sr.\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   John Jr. to John Sr. only. On January 19, 2011, Farmers' Executive Secretary sent Smith-Cote an e-mail with an attached \"Stock Power Form\" recognizing John Sr. and John Jr. as owning the Stock as JTWROS. The same day, Farmers' President sent an e-mail to the Executive Secretary regarding the proposed transfer of Stock ownership:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [W]ill you find out ihow [sic] [Smith-Cote] wants the [S]tock titled? Will it be just in her name or if John Jr. will be on it also as he is now?? He doesn't need to be, I just want to make sure it is how [John Sr.] wants it. [I]f so whether it is joint with survivorshilp [sic] or as tennats [sic] in common....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 John Sr. purportedly signed two stock power forms, one dated January 21, 2011, and the other dated February 3, 2011. Farmers' policies and procedures require each stock owner's signature on a stock power form to be accompanied by a medallion signature guarantee to effectuate transfer of Farmers' stock. A medallion signature guarantee is an endorsement affixed to a request to transfer a security by the transferring financial institution that guarantees the genuineness of the signature and the legal capacity of the signatory. John Jr. and John. Sr.'s Stock required an Edward Jones' medallion signature guarantee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The January 21, 2011 Stock Power Form (January Form) was sent to Edward Jones' offices in St. Louis, Missouri. No Edward Jones' employee authorized to affix the medallion signature guarantee witnessed the execution of the January Form. However, several days after John Sr. allegedly signed the January Form, an Edward Jones employee affixed a medallion signature guarantee to the Form. Farmers claimed it never received the January Form, and the January Form was not found in Farmers' records. On February 2, 2011, Farmers contacted Smith-Cote to notify her no signed form had been\n   received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 On February 3, 2011, John Sr. purportedly received and signed a second Stock Power Form (February Form) in an attempt to transfer all 181.619 shares of the Stock to Smith-Cote. Edward Jones has no records of any employee being present to witness the execution of the February Form. On February 5, 2011, John Sr. passed away. On February 7, 2011, the local branch of Edward Jones transmitted the February Form to the Edward Jones' St. Louis office. At an uncertain point in time, the February Form was also stamped with a medallion signature guarantee issued by Norman Eaker, CEO of Edwards Jones, although\n   Eaker was not present to witness John Sr. sign the Form. Edward Jones transmitted the February Form to Farmers. Farmers then canceled the Stock held by John Sr. and John Jr. and transferred all 181.619 shares to Smith-Cote. The Stock Certificate cancellation and reissue date was February 3, 2011. The February Form Farmers accepted had been altered from the form Farmers originally provided to Smith-Cote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 In November 2012, John Jr. requested records from Farmers related to the Stock. John Jr. learned of the Stock transfer to Smith-Cote when Farmers responded in December 2012. Farmers determined that it had erred in transferring all 181.619 shares to Smith-Cote, declaring that it should have only transferred half the Stock. On December 21, 2012, Farmers requested that Smith-Cote return the Stock Certificate, which she did on June 24, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 On February 28, 2013, John Jr. and the Cote family initiated litigation against Smith-Cote.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Cote\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4. On June 30, 2014, John Jr. and the Cotes filed an Amended Petition, alleging claims of undue influence and lack of capacity, conversion, fraud, and unjust enrichment against Smith-Cote regarding the Stock transfer.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Cote\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4. The Amended Petition also stated claims against Farmers for negligent violation of fiduciary duties and conversion. On March 28, 2014, Farmers wrote to John Jr. and advised him that in exchange for a release of liability, Farmers would issue John Jr. a certificate for half of the Stock, or 90.8095 shares. John Jr. declined to sign a release, and Farmers did not issue a stock certificate. Farmers answered with a counterclaim and cross-claim for interpleader against John Jr. John Jr. responded and reiterated his claims against Farmers, alleging breach of the duty of care owed to a stockholder, breach of the fiduciary duty owed to a stockholder, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting punitive damages. Around August 14, 2015, Farmers filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Smith-Cote and John Jr. each owned equal shares of the 181.619\n   shares of Farmers' Stock as tenants in common.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 The District Court conducted two bench trials: on August 31-September 1, 2015, and on April 19-20, 2016. On April 11, 2016, the District Court granted John Jr.'s motion for partial summary judgment against Smith-Cote and Farmers. The District Court held that John Jr. is the sole owner of all 181.619 shares of Stock because Farmers did not transfer the Stock to Smith-Cote until after John, Sr.'s death. The District Court found there was no genuine dispute as to the following material facts: (1) John Jr. did not provide his consent to transfer all shares of the jointly held Farmers' Stock at issue to Smith-Cote; (2) the medallion signature guarantee, which was a requirement on Farmers' own form, was not provided until sometime after February 7, 2011, regardless of when the stamp was affixed; (3) the February Form was not transmitted to Farmers in order to effectuate the transfer until sometime after John Sr.'s death; and (4) Farmers' admission that it erred is an additional ground showing that the attempted transfer is invalid in its entirety. On March 2, 2017, Farmers represented to the District Court that it paid the remaining 2012-2016 dividends on the Stock and has now paid all the dividends on the 181.619 shares of Stock to John Jr., together with interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 On March 16, 2017, the District Court issued an order requiring Farmers to pay John Jr. (1) any and all outstanding dividends with ten percent interest that has not already been paid on the 181.619 shares of Stock, including any dividends distributed to stockholders between February 3, 2011 and the order date; (2) $1.1 million in punitive damages to John Jr.; and (3) John Jr.'s costs in pursuing recovery of the Stock. Farmers filed a motion to vacate or reduce the award of punitive damages. The District Court denied Farmers' motion. Farmers appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 This Court reviews a district court's conclusions of law de novo for correctness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Folsom v.

In its initial order awarding punitive damages and in its order denying Farmers' motion to vacate or reduce the award of punitive damages, the District Court justified its award and analyzed\n   relevant statutory considerations under \u00a7 27-1-221(7)(b), MCA. The District Court reasoned that Farmers blatantly disregarded its own policies and procedures regarding stock transfer and the rights associated with JTWROS.

Farmers further contends that, ultimately, John Jr. was not harmed and incurred no compensatory damages, rendering him ineligible for punitive damages. Farmers argues the District Court's findings of actual fraud and actual malice were based solely on the erroneous conclusion that Farmers misrepresented the stock transfer date during litigation.

The District Court found that Farmers made multiple misrepresentations regarding the ineffective Stock transfer and concealed the fact that it backdated the Stock transfer. Farmers knew John Jr. owned the Stock and knew, or should have known, based on the advice of its own counsel and its own policy requirements that a stock power form must be affixed with a valid medallion signature guarantee before stock can be transferred. Farmers knew before John Sr. died that the Stock Power Form had not been delivered to any Edward Jones office, and that the medallion signature guarantee was not affixed until after John Sr.'s death. John Jr. did not sign any stock power form, and Farmers admitted John Jr. did not consent to transferring the shares to Smith-Cote. Nevertheless, Farmers representatives still told Smith-Cote it could transfer the Stock to her and, ultimately, Farmers did transfer the Stock. It was only after Edward Jones produced records proving the transfer did not occur on February 3, 2011, that Farmers admitted it did not actually transfer the Stock before John Sr.'s death. Farmers also admitted the Stock Power Form it accepted to make the improper transfer had been altered. The sheer implausibility of John Sr. receiving and signing the\n   Stock Power Form in Washington, obtaining a medallion signature guarantee in Missouri, and transmitting the Form to Montana all on February 3, 2011, casts a further pall over Farmers' conduct that certainly supports the conclusion that Farmers intentionally disregarded the facts because it knew, or should have known, such a transfer was illegitimate, and the transfer led to John Jr.'s injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b635 Farmers further disregarded John Jr.'s rights as a shareholder when it failed to take any real steps to recover the Stock for several years. Farmers ignored John Jr.'s repeated demand for the return of the Stock, it initially requested that Smith-Cote retain the Stock Certificate, and it ignored its statutory obligation to reissue all 181.619 shares of Stock in John Jr.'s name. Farmers admitted it never notified John Jr. that it was in the process of transferring his interest in the 181.619 shares of Stock. John Jr. testified that it was not until he contacted Farmers in November 2012 that he learned of the improper conversion and Stock transfer. Although Farmers admitted to improperly transferring the Stock in December 2012, Farmers repeatedly claimed Smith-Cote was entitled to at least half of the shares. Farmers failed to fulfill its good faith obligation to John Jr. and deprived John Jr. of the benefit and use of the Stock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b636 In direct contravention of its own policies and Montana law, Farmers allowed one stock owner who is a joint tenant with a right of survivorship to unilaterally terminate the other joint tenant's interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Afrank\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9 ; Cote Family Ex.

A precise definition of compensatory damages is critical here-absent an award of compensatory damages, we may not uphold an award of punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Folsom\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 52.

Because of the comparatively modest value of John Jr.'s compensatory damages (only the interest award), the ratio between the compensatory\n   damages and punitive damages-a common indicator of an award's constitutionality-would almost certainly denote a violation of Farmers' substantive due process rights. Nevertheless, in\n   appropriate cases such as this, courts should compare the punitive damages award to both actual\n   <em>\n    and potential\n   </em>\n   harm.

Compensatory damages may only be based in money.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b647 Stock certificates and money are distinct. The language of \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA, which grants the right to compensatory damages, is plain: \"Every person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor\n   <em>\n    in money\n   </em>\n   , which is called damages.\" (Emphasis added.) Clearly, the statute does not allow the party at fault to compensate the aggrieved party with some other asset like inventory, equipment, or real property-let alone stock certificates. Money is \"[t]he medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a government as part of its currency.\"\n   <em>\n    Money\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-1-201(2)(y), MCA (defining money in Montana's version of the Uniform Commercial Code as \"a medium of exchange currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government\"). Unlike money, stock certificates represent ownership of equity in a corporation; they grant their holder the right to participate in the corporation's management; and they often allow their holder to vote on corporate matters, receive dividends, and share in corporate assets upon liquidation.\n   <em>\n    Stock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). The Court attempts to obfuscate these differences by citing numerous sources that, while explaining the overall goal of compensatory damages (compensation), ignore the statutory mechanism for actually compensating aggrieved parties. Opinion, \u00b6 15. Only one asset may satisfy an award for compensatory damages-money. Section 27-1-202, MCA. The Court's conclusion to the contrary is unsupported by any cognizable theory of compensatory damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b648 An action brought under \u00a7 30-8-414, MCA, is in many ways functionally similar to an action for the return and delivery of personal property under \u00a7 27-1-432, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reissuance of stock is not monetary compensation any more than an order for the return of a bicycle is. It is a form of specific relief through which a court may compel one party \"to do that which ought to be done\"-delivery of the personal property to the person entitled to its possession. Section 27-1-402, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-1-432, MCA (\"A person having the possession or control of a particular article of personal property of which the person is not the owner may be compelled specifically to deliver it to the person entitled to its immediate possession.\"). This Court has never held that, within a remedy for the return of specific personal property, the personal property itself is compensatory damages. Moreover, this Court has never held\n   that compensatory damages may be anything\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b649 Further review of the statute's remedial procedure evinces the same conclusion. The Official Comments to \u00a7 30-8-414, MCA, state that historically, when an issuer wrongfully registered a security transfer, some courts allowed the rightful owner to elect between either an equitable action to compel issue of a new security or an action for damages. Section 30-8-414, MCA, Official Comment 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   12 William Meade Fletcher,\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5551, at 426 (Jennifer L. Berger &amp; Carol A. Jones eds., 2004). Under pre-U.C.C. law, it was \"well-settled ... that if a corporation wrongfully refuse[d] to recognize and register a valid transfer of stock, and issue a new certificate to the transferee, the shareholder [could] maintain a bill\n   <em>\n    in equity\n   </em>\n   to compel it to do so.\" 12 Fletcher,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5519, at 319-20 (emphasis added). Section 30-8-414, MCA, confines a rightful owner's remedy under the statute to reissuance of like securities-an equitable remedy of specific relief. Section 30-8-414, MCA, Official Comment 1 (\"[Title 30, chapter 8] does not allow such election. The true owner of a certificated security is required to take a new security....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, the statute only allows the rightful owner to recover the\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   of the stock (in lieu of reissuance) as a last resort in one situation: where reissuance of the securities would exceed the amount the issuer has corporate power to issue and identical securities are not reasonably available for purchase. Sections 30-8-220, -414, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b650 Statutes can codify equitable remedies. Even if a statutory remedy displaces a remedy previously available to courts in equity, the statutory remedy itself can still be equitable. Many statutes in Montana codify equitable remedies. Some examples include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 specific performance, \u00a7 27-1-411, MCA ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 injunctions, \u00a7\u00a7 27-19-101 through -406, MCA ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 abatement as a remedy for public and private nuisances, \u00a7\u00a7 27-30-202 and -301, MCA ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 partition, \u00a7 70-29-101, MCA ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 mortgage foreclosure proceedings, \u00a7 71-1-222, MCA ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \u2022 constructive trusts, \u00a7 72-38-123, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Like these statutes, \u00a7 30-8-414, MCA, codified an equitable remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b651 Furthermore, statutory relief comes in both equitable and monetary forms. Whether a statute provides a remedy of compensatory damages depends on the nature of the relief a court ultimately provides through the statute. Thus, to determine whether a statutory remedy provides compensatory damages, a court needs only to ask whether the statutory remedy is\n   <em>\n    monetary compensation\n   </em>\n   given to a party \"who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dobbs,\n   <em>\n    Law of Remedies\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.1 (\"The stated goal of the damages remedy is compensation of plaintiff for legally recognized losses.\"). For example, both an action for the return and\n   delivery of personal property and an action for stock reissuance allow a court to order compensatory damages for the value of the property in limited scenarios.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although inapplicable to\n   the case at issue, these remedial provisions illustrate how the same statute may afford differing types of relief; in a particular case, the type of statutory relief a District Court ultimately provides depends on how it applies the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b652 The Court also reasons that reissuance of stock under \u00a7 30-8-414, MCA, is different than a court-ordered return of a unique piece of property because it authorizes the issuer to provide \"a\n   <em>\n    like\n   </em>\n   certificated or uncertificated security.\" Opinion, \u00b6 24 (quoting \u00a7 30-8-414, MCA ) (emphasis in original). Thus, the Court implies that where a court orders a defendant to provide a plaintiff with\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   property as restitution instead of the plaintiff's original, specific property, such a remedy qualifies as compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b653 The Court's line of reasoning is incompatible with the facts of the case: Farmers returned to John Jr. the specific, original stock he was entitled to-a specific remedy. Regardless, even remedies that allow one party to restore the other by providing fungible, equivalent property are not compensatory damages. They are equitable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once\n   again, compensatory damages must be paid in money. Section 27-1-202, MCA. The Court states, comparing the stock to money, the stock \"looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck,\" so the award \"was a duck.\" Opinion, \u00b6 24. But this ugly duckling is simply not a duck-it is a swan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b654 More nuanced, however, are the \"payments or distributions\" that \u00a7 30-8-414(2), MCA, compels an issuer to provide to an entitled party who did not receive them due to a wrongful registration. Payments and distributions received by a stock owner often take the form of a cash dividend. When they do, \u00a7 30-8-414(2) essentially requires the issuer to provide money to the entitled party, and that provision may or may not be compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b655 While a party may only satisfy an award of compensatory damages with money, not all monetary awards are compensatory damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dobbs,\n   <em>\n    Law of Remedies\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.1 (\"The damages award is not the only money award courts make.

The key distinction between a judgment for compensatory damages and an order to deliver specific funds is, once again, whether the remedy is\n   <em>\n    monetary compensation\n   </em>\n   given to a party \"who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA. For example, a plaintiff asserting a preexisting ownership right in money taken by or transferred to the defendant seeks specific, equitable relief-return of the money. Instead of seeking monetary compensation for the property's value and a claim for the defendant to pay damages out of the defendant's general funds, the plaintiff seeks the return of the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   funds she is entitled to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Colleen P.

As the dividends on John Jr.'s stock accrued while his stock ownership was in dispute, Farmers opened and maintained a separate account for them. Had Farmers dissipated the dividends on nontraceable items, John Jr. could have sought monetary compensation for their value. However, Farmers never dissipated the funds, and they were traceable at the time the District Court ordered Farmers to provide them to John Jr. John Jr. did not seek a claim against Farmers' general assets; instead, he sought to recover specific funds in Farmers' possession. Therefore, in this situation, \u00a7 30-8-414(2), MCA, functioned to provide John Jr. with the specific property-the dividends-that he was entitled to instead of monetary compensation for their value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b659 Notably, however, the District Court also awarded interest on the dividends to John Jr. In an action to recover personal property, \u00a7 27-17-401(1), MCA, allows the claimant to recover possession of the property (or its value if delivery is impossible) along\n   with \"damages for the detention.\" The statute does not define what, precisely, \"damages for the detention\" are.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Restatement of Restitution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53(1) states: \"A person who is liable to make restitution of property or its value is liable for supplemental enrichment in the form of interest, rent, or other measure of use value, to the extent that such further enrichment is either realized in fact or appropriately presumed.\" The property's use value includes \"ordinary income or accretion in respect of the original asset (dividends on shares, interest on bonds, rent on land, a calf born to a cow).\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement of Restitution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53 cmt. c. Therefore, the wrongful possessor of stock belonging to another party must return both the stock and any cash dividends that accrued while\n   the wrongful possessor held the stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b660 If a wrongful possessor returns property, courts typically cannot also award interest as damages for the property's detention by virtue of the property's value alone. Most property does not produce additional value; before a court may impose further liability beyond delivery of the property (e.g., the value of interest or rent), the original owner must show the wrongful possessor realized interest, rent, proceeds, consequential gains, or some other form of use value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b661 Nevertheless, in the case of\n   <em>\n    money\n   </em>\n   wrongfully held by a conscious wrongdoer, \"[l]iability for the [money's] use value ... may be imposed by an award of prejudgment interest, consistent with applicable statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement of Restitution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53(4). \"The function of prejudgment interest in such a case is simultaneously to compensate the claimant for the interim loss of use of the damage award, and to eliminate the unjust enrichment (and the incentive to delay) that would otherwise result from the defendant's retention of the same funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement of Restitution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53, cmt. e.

John Jr.'s compensatory damages-the interest on his dividends-was minimal compared to the value of his stock. Farmers first wrongfully transferred John Jr.'s stock in February 2011 after the death of his father. Farmers subsequently refused to reissue John Jr. his stock for nearly five years, even as the stock drastically increased in value. Had Farmers succeeded in permanently transferring his stock, John Jr. may have lost its full value. Because John Jr. did not actually lose the full value of his stock, Farmers' egregious actions resulted in only a small amount of economic damages to John Jr., and the monetary value of any noneconomic harm is difficult to determine here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/#p568\">\n    517 U.S. at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/#p568\">\n    116 S.Ct. at 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b679 Therefore, based on the current record, this case appears to be one in which potential harm should factor into an award of punitive damages. However, the District Court-here the factfinder-has not yet found whether the record factually supports a value for potential harm; what the value of any potential harm would be, considering among other things, the stock's fluctuating value over time; and has not stated whether punitive damages are based in-part on any potential harm. The District Court should reconsider the punitive damages award in light of the fact that the interest award is the only compensatory damages award, and it should give the parties the opportunity to argue the question of potential harm. I would reverse and remand the case with instructions that the District Court do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b680 Finally, Farmers contends the punitive damages award is unsupported by the punitive damages factors under \u00a7 27-1-221(7)(b), MCA. When a judge acts as the factfinder when issuing an award of punitive damages, the judge must clearly state his reasons in findings of fact and conclusions of law, demonstrating consideration of the factors listed in \u00a7 27-1-221(7)(b), MCA :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (i) the nature and reprehensibility of the defendant's wrongdoing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   (ii) the extent of the defendant's wrongdoing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   (iii) the intent of the defendant in committing the wrong;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   (iv) the profitability of the defendant's wrongdoing, if applicable;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   (v) the amount of actual damages awarded by the jury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   (vi) the defendant's net worth;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   (vii) previous awards of punitive or exemplary damages against the defendant based upon the same wrongful act;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   (viii) potential or prior criminal sanctions against the defendant based upon the same wrongful act; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (ix) any other circumstances that may operate to increase or\n   reduce, without wholly defeating, punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b681 Other than factors four and seven, I have already addressed the District Court's consideration of the punitive damages factors\n   in my analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Gore\n   </em>\n   guideposts. The District Court's thorough findings of facts and conclusions of law demonstrate the court clearly found the reprehensibility of Farmers' conduct (i.e., factors one, two, and three) to be controlling in this case. Regarding factor four, the District Court noted Farmers' misconduct was unlikely driven by any significant profit motive, \"other than to avoid litigation with Janice ...\"; and regarding factor seven, the District Court found no evidence of any previous award of punitive or exemplary damages against Farmers based upon the same act. However, Farmers' lack of a profit motive or a history of misconduct does not \"reduce the high level of reprehensibility already established by the other aspects of [Farmers'] misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seltzer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 174. Further, any potential harm Farmers' conduct posed John Jr. would be a circumstance that could operate to increase punitive damages, fitting under factor nine. That potential harm is the only factor that requires further evaluation by the District Court in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b682 In conclusion, I disagree with the Court's misguided holding that stock reissuance may be construed as compensatory damages. Moreover, I disagree with the contention that anything other than money may serve as compensatory damages. Instead, I would hold the District Court's only award of compensatory damages was the interest on John Jr.'s dividends. However, the measure of John Jr.'s interest award may not be representative of the true potential harm Farmers' conduct posed to him. Because punitive damages may be based in-part on potential harm, the District Court should evaluate whether the punitive damages here may be based on something more than the interest on John Jr.'s dividends-possibly, the total value of his stock and dividends. Accordingly, I would reverse and remand the case with instructions that the District Court reevaluate the punitive damages award based on the foregoing analysis of compensatory damages and potential harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Justice Beth Baker and Justice Jim Rice join in the dissenting Opinion of Justice McKinnon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    , Dan B.
