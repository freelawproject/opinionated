The Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, sentenced Walker to four, 100-year concurrent prison sentences, with no time suspended. Walker appeals, presenting three evidentiary issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Did the District Court correctly apply Montana's Rape Shield Law, \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, to exclude evidence of a victim's alleged prior sexual conduct?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Walker married A.W.'s mother, Kim, when A.W. was an infant. A.W. later disclosed that, when she lived with Walker, he subjected her to a series of sexual assaults, beginning when she was seven or eight years old and ending when she was twelve or thirteen years old. She testified at trial that Walker frequently and regularly sexually assaulted her. Walker and Kim divorced in 2007. The next year, Walker married Laura. Laura's two daughters, B.W. and R.W., lived with Walker and Laura. Walker and R.W. did not have a good relationship. R.W. testified that Walker constantly made her uncomfortable by doing things like smacking and grabbing her bottom and trying to kiss her on the lips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 R.W. and B.W. both participated in competitive archery. A tournament took place near their home on February 14, 2015. At that time, R.W. was eleven years old. Early that morning, around 6:00 a.m., Laura and B.W. left to help set up the tournament, leaving Walker and R.W. alone at home. R.W. and Walker planned to meet B.W. and Laura at the tournament. Walker and R.W. each testified at trial, recounting different versions of what occurred that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 R.W. testified that, after she woke up, she went to Walker and Laura's bedroom, where Walker was lying in bed. R.W. crawled into the bed on the side where her mother usually slept. She testified that she did so because she wanted to wake up a little bit before she got ready for the tournament, but thought she would fall back asleep if she stayed in her own bed. R.W. then explained, in detail, how Walker initiated sexual contact with her. Walker, on the other hand, testified that R.W. made sexual advances at him and that, as soon as he realized what was happening, he jumped out of the bed. R.W. and Walker went to the archery tournament later that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The State charged Walker with two counts of felony incest and two counts of felony sexual assault based on Walker's ongoing conduct towards A.W. when she was his step-daughter and Walker's conduct towards R.W. on February 14, 2015, when she was his step-daughter. Walker denied all charges and maintained his innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 In preparing his defense, Walker voluntarily underwent a psychosexual evaluation with Dr. Robert Page (Dr. Page). Walker sought to have Dr. Page testify at trial as to the results of his psychosexual evaluation. Walker made an offer of proof, representing to the District Court that Dr. Page would testify that \"Walker's [psychosexual] profile is that he is not sexually interested in school-age males or females, or preschool age males or females\" and that Walker showed \"no signs of psychopathology or personality pathology.\" Dr. Page would further testify that he had no therapeutic recommendations for Walker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Walker also voluntarily took a polygraph test with Dick Stotts (Stotts). Stotts examined Walker pursuant to the American Polygraph Association's standard polygraph procedure. During the polygraph test, Stotts asked Walker whether he ever had sexual contact with underage children generally or with R.W. particularly. Walker denied having any such contact. Stotts subsequently issued a report, in which he indicated that Walker's \"polygrams did not contain specific reactions to the relevant questions, indicating no attempt at deception.\" Stotts further concluded,\n   \"After careful analysis of [Walker's] polygrams, it is the opinion of the examiner that [Walker] told the truth during his examination.\" Walker planned to have Stotts testify about the polygraph test's results at his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State filed pre-trial motions to exclude Dr. Page's and Stotts's testimony. The District Court accepted briefing on the issues and ultimately granted the State's motions. Walker's case proceeded to a jury trial in August 2016. At trial, Walker planned to have Stacy Wood (Wood) testify about alleged past sexual contact between victim R.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   and a three-year-old. Walker represented that Wood planned to testify about a time when she found eight-year-old R.W. in bed with the three-year-old, allegedly engaging in sexual conduct initiated by R.W. The State asked the District Court to exclude Wood's testimony pursuant to Montana's Rape Shield Law, \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA. The District Court heard the parties' arguments and subsequently granted the State's motion to exclude Wood's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 After five days of trial, the jury found Walker guilty on all four counts. The District Court sentenced Walker to four, 100-year concurrent prison sentences, with no time suspended. Walker appeals, arguing that the District Court improperly excluded Dr. Page's, Stotts's, and Wood's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 District courts have broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State filed a pretrial motion, seeking to exclude Stotts as a trial witness and prohibit any reference to the polygraph examination by any attorney, party, or witness. The State based its motion on a line of precedent from this Court excluding polygraph evidence from all court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, Walker asserted that his offer to take the polygraph examination was admissible. Walker stated, \"If\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   testifies, he will seek to\n   <em>\n    offer the fact he volunteered to take the polygraph test\n   </em>\n   as evidence relevant to his state of mind-more specifically, evidence relevant to his consciousness of innocence.\" (Emphasis added.) Walker further argued that, because the jury would know that he offered to take the polygraph examination, it would also need to know the examination's results. He urged the District Court to consider the interaction of M. R. Evid. 403, 404, 608, and 702 in deciding whether the polygraph examination's results should be admitted. Walker asserted that each side should \"present evidence concerning the general science of polygraph evidence\" to assist the court in determining whether the results were admissible under M. R. Evid. 702. Walker further stated that, if the State impeached his testimony, he would use the polygraph examination results to corroborate his truthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 The District Court granted the State's pretrial motion to exclude Stotts's testimony\n   and prohibit any attorney, party, or witness from referencing the polygraph examination. In its order, the court recognized the disparity between what the State requested and what Walker argued: \"Walker fails to address, or even acknowledge, the Montana Supreme Court's bright line prohibition of polygraph evidence.... Instead, he contends the issue of the admissibility of an\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   to take a polygraph test has not yet been addressed by the Montana Supreme Court.\" (Emphasis in original.) The District Court found Walker's argument unpersuasive in view of this Court's precedent clearly prohibiting polygraph evidence. Walker appeals the District Court's decision, arguing it should have admitted the polygraph evidence pursuant to M. R. Evid. 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 We begin our analysis by noting that there are two distinct types of polygraph evidence at issue here. The first type involves the admissibility of Walker's polygraph test results through Stotts's expert testimony pursuant to M. R. Evid. 702. The second type of evidence concerns Walker's\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   to take the polygraph test, which does not involve expert testimony or implicate considerations of M. R. Evid. 702. In his argument to the District Court, Walker argued that his offer itself should be admissible, but we do not discern a similar argument on appeal. Walker only mentions his offer in passing, urging us to \"consider\" the fact that he \"willingly submitted\" to the polygraph test. Accordingly, our decision only addresses the argument Walker raises on appeal-admissibility of polygraph test results pursuant to\n   M. R. Evid. 702. We do not consider Walker's ancillary argument concerning the admissibility of his offer to take a polygraph test, which would involve evidentiary considerations other than M. R. Evid. 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Walker urges us to depart from our precedent holding that polygraph test results are inadmissible and apply, instead, general standards for admitting expert opinion evidence. The analysis of whether to admit or exclude expert testimony begins with M. R. Evid. 702, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our jurisprudence recognizes that expert evidence is admissible if the expert field is reliable, the expert is qualified, and the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.\n   <em>\n    McClue v.

If the polygraphist asks the defendant properly phrased questions about relevant facts and elements of the crime, and the polygraphist then testifies at trial that the defendant's responses were not fabricated, the testimony's import is clear. The jury may easily draw an implicit conclusion that the\n   defendant did not commit the crime for which he is charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 Although perhaps subtle, there is thus a fundamental difference between polygraph test results and other types of scientific evidence. Here, Walker seeks to introduce, through scientific expert testimony, polygraph test results to establish that he is telling the truth about his innocence. We conclude the purpose for which the evidence is being offered, to show that Walker is credible when he says he is innocent, invades matters that are clearly committed to the province of the jury. First, it bolsters Walker's credibility; second, it speaks to Walker's guilt or innocence. Thus, apart from considerations of M. R. Evid. 702, the evidence is inadmissible. Even if polygraph\n   examinations were deemed reliable, evidence of polygraph test results improperly comments on a witness's credibility and invades the province of the jury. A jury must decide the guilt or innocence of a defendant, and it was exclusively within the province of the jury to weigh the credibility and veracity of each witness at Walker's trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bashor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2561502\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/188/397/#p414\">\n    188 Mont. at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2561502\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/188/397/#p414\">\n    614 P.2d at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find no basis to depart from the sound reasoning expressed in our precedent that polygraph test results invade the province of the jury and are inadmissible in all Montana court proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, we find it prudent to address Walker's argument that the Legislature's 1995 repeal of a 1983 statute demonstrates the Legislature's intent for polygraph test results to be admissible. In 1983, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 37-62-302, MCA (1983), entitled \"Inadmissibility of results as evidence,\" which provided, \"Results of a polygraph examination or other test given by an examiner may not be introduced or admitted as evidence in a court of law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20Mont.%20Laws%20370\">\n    1983 Mont. Laws 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 1995, the Legislature repealed the professional and occupational licensing statutes that contained \u00a7 37-62-302, MCA (1983). Walker argues that the Legislature's repeal demonstrates its intent to have polygraph evidence treated the same way as other forms of expert witness testimony. Walker's argument is, however, unpersuasive, as our precedent excluding polygraph test results predated \u00a7 37-62-302, MCA (1983), and we continue to apply the same principles post-repeal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, more importantly, it is this Court's responsibility to protect the integrity of the fact-finding process and to maintain the important function served by the jury.

Specifically, Walker sought to have Dr. Page testify that Walker's psychosexual profile demonstrated Walker had no sexual interest in children; that Walker did not show any signs of psychopathology or personality pathology; and that Dr. Page did not have any therapeutic recommendations for Walker. The State filed a pre-trial motion to exclude Dr. Page's testimony regarding the results of Walker's psychosexual evaluation, arguing the testimony would improperly bolster Walker's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 Walker responded, arguing Dr. Page's testimony would not directly bear on Walker's credibility as a witness but would, instead, undermine the State's factual theory that Walker had sexual contact with the victims. Walker reasoned that evidence showing he is not psychologically inclined to be sexually gratified by children would render it less probable that he knowingly had sexual contact with the victims. After considering each party's briefing, the District Court agreed with the State and excluded the testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 Walker now appeals the District Court's decision, arguing it improperly excluded Dr. Page's testimony. Walker sought to examine\n   Dr. Page as an expert witness. Walker asserts Dr. Page would not have offered evidence concerning any witness's credibility, but instead would have simply offered a \"clinical finding that, in his professional opinion, Walker's psychosexual traits include no sexual interest in ... children.\" Walker contends Dr. Page's evaluations of Walker's psychosexual characteristics would have assisted the jury in determining a fact in issue-whether Walker knowingly had sexual contact with either victim. The State argues that, instead of helping the jury, Dr. Page's testimony would have invaded its province by improperly bolstering Walker's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 In his oral argument before this Court, Walker distinguished between \"characteristics\" and \"character traits,\" reasoning that Dr. Page would have commented only on Walker's \"characteristics,\" not on his \"character traits.\" Walker specifically stated during argument that he was not advancing Dr. Page's testimony as character evidence pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(a)(1), which allows an accused to offer evidence of a pertinent character trait. Instead, Walker argues his psychosexual profile evidence should be admitted pursuant to M. R. Evid. 702.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30 We view the evidence offered by Walker-that based on interviews and psychological testing, he does not fit the profile of a person sexually interested in children-as comparable to Walker's attempt to admit the results of a favorable polygraph test, which is also administered and interpreted by an expert. Evidence of favorable polygraph test results addresses the truthfulness of a witness, a determination exclusively within the province of the fact finder at trial. Similarly, a clinical finding by Dr. Page that, in his professional opinion, \"Walker's profile is that he is not sexually interested in school-age males or females, or preschool age males or females\" is scientific evidence supporting the notion that because Walker does not fit a profile of a pedophile he must be innocent of the sexual assaults. Both are attempts to\n   bolster the credibility of a witness; both speak directly to the guilt or innocence of the defendant; and both invade the\n   exclusive province of the jury to judge credibility and the guilt or innocence of the accused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31 Our precedent addressing the admissibility of profile evidence consists primarily of three cases:\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, we concluded that Passmore failed to provide a record which would allow admission of expert testimony pursuant to M. R.

Here, Dr. Page would have similarly testified that Walker did not have the characteristics of someone who is sexually attracted to children. Sullivan's and Dr. Page's testimony constitutes the same type of evidence: profile evidence. In\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , we held that admissibility of profile evidence depends on a careful application of M. R. Evid. 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702.\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 73. Significantly, however, we did not address the effect of admitting profile evidence like we did in\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   . We take this opportunity to explain the inherent problem-recognized in\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , but not addressed in\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   that arises if profile evidence is submitted to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   evidence that a defendant does or does not fit within a class of offenders impermissibly bolsters the defendant's claim of innocence and improperly invades the province of the jury in determining the defendant's guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38 ;\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41. Apart from the careful application of M. R. Evid. 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702 required in\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , it is still a requirement that the evidence not impermissibly bolster the defendant's claim of innocence or invade the province of the\n   jury to decide guilt or innocence. Here, Dr. Page's clinical finding that, in his professional opinion, Walker did not fit the statistical profile of a pedophile is inadmissible because it related directly to the question of whether Walker was or was not a pedophile capable of committing the crimes for which he was charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 41 If profile evidence excluding the defendant from a class of persons known to have certain characteristics is presented to the jury, the jury is essentially asked to conclude that the defendant could not have committed the offense because he does not share certain characteristics with people who are known to have committed that same offense. In this case, Dr. Page would have testified that, based on Walker's psychosexual test results, Walker does not fit into a class of people sexually attracted to children. From this expert testimony opining that Walker's profile is not one of a pedophile flows the inevitable conclusion that, therefore, Walker could not have sexually abused the underage victims. Thus, profile evidence invades the province of the jury in determining the defendant's guilt or innocence and impermissibly bolsters a defendant's claim of innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41 ;\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38. Accordingly, while a \"careful application of M. R. Evid. 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702\" is required,\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 73, the evidence is nonetheless inadmissible if it impermissibly invades the province of the jury. Finally, as in\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , where there was no record supporting admission of expert testimony pursuant to M. R. Evid. 702, Walker specifically states he is not seeking admission pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). Accordingly, the careful application of the relevant evidentiary rules required by\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   cannot be made, even had Dr. Page's profile testimony not invaded the province of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 42 Importantly, profile evidence like Dr. Page's testimony that Walker does not fit within a class of pedophiles, is, for example, distinguishable from expert testimony on battered woman syndrome. Expert testimony on battered woman syndrome is limited to how women with the syndrome act and behave.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2716809\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/252/205/#p210\">\n    252 Mont. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2716809\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/252/205/#p210\">\n    828 P.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386-88 (1992). The expert testifies about consistencies between other abuse victims who have battered woman\n   syndrome and the behavior of the particular woman. The purpose of the testimony is to explain the woman's behavior that the jury may construe as inconsistent with that of an actual abuse victim. The testimony therefore assists the jury in understanding the woman's actions. Dissimilarly, specific profile evidence, like that Dr. Page would have testified to, relates to psychological tests taken by a defendant as part of the defendant's preparation for trial in the criminal action. Dr. Page's testimony would paint Walker's psychosexual profile as that of someone who is not sexually attracted to children, rather than help the jury understand aspects of Walker's behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 43 Primarily, the distinction rests on whether the testimony is offered to assist the jury with understanding a fact at issue or whether it impermissibly bolsters a defendant's claim of innocence. Dr. Page's testimony concerned test results-which established that, scientifically, Walker does not fit into a class of offenders who are sexually interested in children. The testimony would lead the jury to inevitably conclude that because Walker is not sexually interested in children, he is credible and believable; and that, because Walker is not sexually interested in children, he is not guilty. However, the jury, and not Dr. Page, had the responsibility of determining whether Walker knowingly engaged in sexual contact with the victims. Dr. Page's testimony was based on psychosexual test results opining that Walker is not disposed towards being a member of a class of pedophiles. Being statistically excluded from a class of offenders based on test results is distinguishable from expert testimony offered to help the jury understand a fact at issue. The former instructs the jury that a defendant it not guilty based on testing. The latter may be admissible after a careful application of M. R. Evid. 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702.\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 44 To support his argument on appeal, Walker attempts to draw similarities between the circumstances of his case and those of\n   <em>\n    State v.

In contrast to acceptable testimony pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Page's testimony would not be explaining Walker's behavior, nor would he be testifying regarding consistencies or inconsistencies in\n   <em>\n    behavior\n   </em>\n   between known sex offenders and Walker; rather, the focus of Dr. Page's testimony would be on test results. Dr. Page would have extrapolated data or information from psychological testing conducted on known sexual offenders and compared his extrapolation to Walker's test results. This is different from reliance on actual life events and activities-i.e., patterns of actual behavior. Our decision today does not foreclose an expert from testifying about the behavior and patterns of others in similar circumstances, as substantiated by scientifically collected data, to help explain the defendant's actions to the jury in the case before the trial court. However, that is not what Dr. Page would do here. He would not explain Walker's actions and the actions and patterns of known sex offenders, but would instead compare Walker's psychosexual test results to the results of known sex offenders.

Courts give various reasons for rejecting\n   of this type of evidence, including that it has not gained general acceptance in the scientific community, it invades the province of the jury, it unfairly prejudices the prosecution, and it does not assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 48 The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded Dr. Page's testimony. Dr. Page's testimony would have improperly bolstered Walker's claim of innocence and invaded the province of the jury to determine Walker's innocence. While, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , a court's decision regarding the admissibility of scientific test results offered by an accused pertaining to either his \"character\" or \"characteristics\" requires a careful application of M. R. Evid. 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702, the evidence may not invade the province of the jury, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   . Based on Walker's proffer that he sought to admit evidence of testing which would indicate he was not a member of a particular class of individuals sexually attracted to children, we conclude the evidence was inadmissible because it impermissibly bolstered Walker's claim that he was innocent, thus invading the jury's province to determine his guilt or innocence. We accordingly affirm the District Court's exclusion of Dr. Page's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 49\n   <em>\n    3.

Wood would have testified about a time when she found the two girls lying in bed together. When Wood noticed the girls, R.W. jumped out of bed and ran away. Wood asked the three-year-old what was going on, and she responded that R.W. was touching her \"hoo-hoo,\" the family term for private parts. She told Wood that R.W. said it would feel good. Wood told Laura and the two of them asked R.W. about the incident. R.W. responded that her older sister, B.W., introduced her to sexual activity. Walker wanted Wood's testimony admitted because he believed R.W.'s past sexual conduct demonstrated her sexual awareness. He reasoned the evidence supported his theory that R.W. acted out in a sexual manner on the morning of February 14, 2015. Walker asserted the information would have aided the jury in evaluating the conflicting testimony before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 51 The State requested the District Court exclude Walker's proffered testimony, relying on \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, Montana's Rape Shield Law.

On appeal, Walker argues the District Court inappropriately mechanically applied the Rape Shield Law with no regard for Walker's constitutional rights.

The court should apply M. R.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , an eleven-year-old victim underwent a forensic interview during which she made detailed statements indicating Colburn sexually abused her.\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. At trial, Colburn sought to introduce evidence that the victim's father was convicted of sexually abusing the victim.\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. Colburn's defense theory was that the victim fabricated her allegations against him and he therefore sought to admit the evidence to demonstrate that the victim's detailed knowledge of sexual abuse stemmed from abuse inflicted by her father, not from abuse inflicted by him.\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. The district court excluded the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.

When the State requested the District Court exclude the evidence, it argued the alleged incident was neither relevant to nor probative of whether Walker sexually assaulted R.W. on February 14, 2015. The State distinguished\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , where the Rape Shield Law did not apply because the victim disclosed sexual abuse by more than one person, and argued the Rape Shield Law should apply in Walker's case because R.W. never disclosed sexual abuse by anyone other than Walker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 57 The District Court inquired further, asking more about the evidence of R.W.'s sexual conduct at issue. It questioned, \"Well, is there any evidence anything even happened?\" The State responded that the evidence consisted solely of Wood's hearsay statement of what the three-year-old said to her. The court further asked whether the three-year-old was interviewed about the incident and whether there was any physical evidence, both of which the State answered in the negative. The District Court then gave Walker the opportunity to explain why he thought the evidence should be admitted. Walker explained that he wanted to use the incident to demonstrate R.W.'s knowledge of and exposure to sexual matters. The court followed up with multiple questions, to which Walker responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 58 After considering the parties' arguments, the District Court excluded the evidence pursuant to the Rape Shield Law. The\n   District Court told the parties that it would, however, reconsider the issue if presented with different information. Walker thanked the court for its willingness to reconsider the issue but never followed up with further argument. Review of the record demonstrates that the District Court performed a thorough inquiry and appropriately balanced R.W.'s rights under the Rape Shield Law with Walker's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. Because the District Court diligently considered the evidence at issue and weighed the parties' competing interests, we conclude it did not mechanically apply the Rape Shield Law to exclude evidence of R.W.'s sexual conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 59 Further, we note that there was no clear evidence of the prior incident-Walker's proffered evidence of R.W.'s sexual conduct was\n   speculative and unsupported.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguado\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34 ;\n   <em>\n    Awbery\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. He sought to present Wood's hearsay testimony of what the three-year-old told her happened and what the three-year-old said R.W. said. The probative value of Walker's proffered, unsupported evidence would not have been substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colburn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25 ; M. R. Evid. 403 (\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice....\").

The type of evidence Walker sought to admit is precisely the type of probe into R.W.'s past sexual conduct that the Rape Shield Law was designed to exclude, and Walker failed to demonstrate that his constitutional rights outweigh R.W.'s rights under the Rape Shield Law.

The State moved to exclude Dr. Page's testimony because it alleged his testimony would impermissibly bolster Walker's credibility. Walker disagreed, arguing that M. R. Evid. 704 allows an expert witness to enter the province of the jury and testify to an ultimate issue of fact. Walker went on to explain how he believed Dr. Page's opinions constitute clinical findings and not opinions of law, and why these opinions would not impermissibly bolster Walker's testimony. The District Court found Walker's proposed expert testimony indistinguishable from the\n   testimony found inadmissible in\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   and granted the State's motion.

Thus, I would not consider Walker's Rule 702 argument on appeal, nor would I consider statements he offered during oral argument regarding the substance of the tests Dr. Page performed as part of his psychosexual evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 64 However, the Majority has gone beyond the bounds of the District Court's proceedings. It has considered Walker's Rule 702 argument and in so doing, it creates new rules of law that broadly curtail trial courts' discretion in making evidentiary rulings on expert testimony. The Majority concluded that a psychosexual evaluation is more like a polygraph examination than like any other type of potentially admissible evidence, and announced a new exclusionary rule prohibiting any scientific evidence that indicates a defendant does not fit the profile of a pedophile. While the Majority looks favorably upon the ruling the District Court made here, and while it finds that ruling consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , it has nonetheless determined the trial courts should no longer have the discretion to consider the admissibility of expert testimony regarding psychosexual evaluations under Rules 702 and 704. Instead, it creates a rule that such evidence is per se inadmissible, regardless of the scientific basis of the expert's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 65 Until now, to determine the admissibility of expert evidence under Rule 702, a district court need determine whether (1) the expert field is reliable and (2) the expert is qualified; the jury then determines whether the expert reliably applied the field to the facts.\n   <em>\n    McClue v.

In this instance, neither party disputed Dr. Page's qualifications. Thus, if we were to conduct an analysis under Rule 702, we need consider only whether the expert field is reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 66 Relying on an undeveloped record, the Majority has concluded the\n   field is unreliable. The Majority admits, \"Walker shared no information with the District Court about the scientific methods by which Dr. Page performed the [psychosexual] evaluation.\" Opinion, \u00b6 27, n.2. The District Court did not have Dr. Page's report, did not know which tests he had performed, and did not know what information Dr. Page had based his results upon at the time it ruled on the State's motion. Walker did not provide information upon which the District Court could have conducted a Rule 702 analysis and determined if the field of psychosexual evaluations was reliable and thus, on review of the record, this Court likewise lacks such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 67 Because of the undeveloped record, this case should be distinguished from\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , we upheld a district court's decision to exclude from evidence the videotaped testimony of an expert witness who had conducted a psychosexual evaluation of that defendant. In so doing, we reviewed the testimony and questioned whether the testimony, if admitted, would have assisted the trier of fact. We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Though Dr. Scolatti conducted a number of tests ... much of his testimony focused on the Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest test (the Abel test).... Dr. Scolatti stated that the Abel test is controversial among researchers and that he thought the test could be \"beaten.\" He also stated that, when applied to an existing offender group, the Abel test identified child molesters \"with different levels of success.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40. We further commented that Dr. Scolatti had partially based his conclusion Spencer did not have the diagnostic criteria of a pedophile on the fact Spencer told Dr. Scolatti he did not have a sexual interest in children.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41. We found the evidence inadmissible under Rule 403-a theory not at issue in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 68 The Majority finds the evidence Walker sought to admit via Dr. Page \"bear[s] remarkable resemblance to the testimony by Dr. Scolatti that Spencer sought to introduce.\" Opinion, \u00b6 37. Walker, however, offered no evidence of which tests Dr. Page conducted, the focus of his testimony, or whether the tests were controversial or able\n   to be \"beaten.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the outcome of\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   does not control the outcome here. However,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   should serve as an example for the kind and\n   amount of information which a court needs to have in order to rule on admissibility under Rule 702, and consistent with\n   <em>\n    McClue\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 69 Under\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , courts may no longer weigh the admissibility of such evidence as did the\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   court. In\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , we held there is neither a per se rule requiring admission, nor a per se rule requiring exclusion, of evidence that a defendant does or does not possess the character traits of a sex offender. Rather, admissibility depends on a careful application of Rules 403, 404(a)(1), 405(a), and 702.\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 73. In this case, the Majority has determined to remove the District Court's discretion to apply the pertinent Rules of Evidence and make such a determination, overruling\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   and creating a per se rule requiring the exclusion of this evidence. This decision precludes a court from considering if scientific advancements in a field have taken previously specious theories and turned them into reliable, reproducible, and validated results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 70 A per se rule of exclusion goes against this Court's tendency to allow juries to consider all evidence. In\n   <em>\n    McClue\n   </em>\n   , we reiterated courts should liberally construe the rules of evidence and admit all relevant testimony. We held our standard for admissibility recognizes admissible expert evidence should come in, even if that evidence may be characterized as \"shaky.\" The testimony is then open for attack through vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    McClue\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Under the new standard of admissibility pronounced here, courts will no longer have the discretion to admit certain scientific evidence and subject that evidence to rigorous testing by the State. Instead, defendants and prosecutors will be barred from putting such evidence before the jury in any circumstances, including instances where the results are unquestionably reliable, reproducible, and validated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority holds that parties may present evidence which compares behaviors, but not evidence which compares test results. Opinion, \u00b6 46. Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), DNA testing, and ballistics matching are all types of evidence which compare test results. Under this logic, the Majority would find eyewitness testimony that a defendant appeared intoxicated to be more reliable than the results of a blood draw in determining a\n   DUI accusation. While the field of psychosexual evaluation has not reached-and may never reach-the reliability of BAC testing, it is premature to declare it forever untrustworthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 71 Furthermore, in considering Walker's newly-raised arguments concerning Rule 702, the Majority has fundamentally misunderstood his position. When Walker disclosed Dr. Page as a possible witness, he stated Dr. Page would testify, \"that upon his psycho-sexual evaluation of Defendant, Defendant has no abnormal or other attraction for pubescent or prepubescent children.\" The Majority contends that if one accepts Dr. Page's opinion that Walker's psychosexual profile indicates that he is not sexually interested in children, and thus, not a pedophile, that he then \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be innocent of the sexual assaults.\" Opinion, \u00b6 30 (emphasis added). From the evidence we have concerning the expected content of Dr. Page's testimony, it is clear Dr. Page was not expected to testify that Walker did not commit sexual assault and/or incest. Thus, the Court is incorrect when it states that this testimony would \"speak directly to the guilt or innocence of the defendant,\" as being, or not being, sexually interested in children does not prove that Walker is guilty or innocent of sexual assault and incest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 72 The applicable statutes elucidate the distinction between being a pedophile-someone sexually attracted to children\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and committing sexual assault and/or incest. The crimes of sexual assault and incest both require \"sexual contact.\" Section 45-2-101(67), MCA, defines \"sexual contact.\" It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Sexual contact\" means touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (a) cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass, or degrade another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (b) arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <s>\n    \u00b6 73\n   </s>\n   Under these statutes, in order to commit either sexual assault or incest, the offender must touch the victim with the knowledge or purpose to accomplish one or more of the objectives enumerated in \u00a7 45-2-101(67)(a) and (b), MCA. Dr. Page would have offered no opinion on the credibility of Walker's denial, and whether or not Walker committed the offenses with which he was charged. Therefore, a jury could find Dr. Page credible and still conclude Walker had sexual contact with A.W. and/or R.W. for any of the other reasons enumerated in \u00a7 45-2-101(67), MCA, and is therefore guilty of the charged offenses\n   even if he was not motivated by his own sexual gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 74 Although the majority maintains the exclusionary rule it has created is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , I do not see how a blanket prohibition against scientific evidence that indicates a defendant does not fit the profile of a pedophile would not in fact overrule these decisions as well as abrogate our holding in\n   <em>\n    McClue\n   </em>\n   . Rather than allowing courts to apply the Rules of Evidence, this Court has now identified an \"inherent problem\" in allowing juries to consider profile evidence. It broadly holds that, \"evidence that a defendant does or does not fit within a class of offenders impermissibly bolsters the defendant's claim of innocence and improperly invades the province of the jury in determining the defendant's guilt or innocence.\" Opinion, \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 75 However, we have safeguards to prevent expert testimony from invading the province of the jury. \"Expert testimony cannot 'invade the province of the jury' unless the jury is instructed that it\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   agree with the expert's assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Geyman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609754\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/224/194/#p199\">\n    224 Mont. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609754\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/224/194/#p199\">\n    729 P.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478 (1986) (citation omitted and emphasis in original) (holding expert testimony concerning the credibility of a child alleged to have been the victim of sexual assault admissible and did not impinge upon jury's obligation to decide credibility). \"Our case law demonstrates that even though testimony on an ultimate issue of fact may implicate legal issues, an expert's testimony is admissible as long as it does not reach a legal conclusion or apply the law to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Wittich\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41 (citation omitted). Our courts routinely instruct jurors they are not bound to believe the testimony of expert witnesses. In cases in which a party offers expert testimony regarding psychosexual evaluations, the court would properly instruct the jury to ensure jurors understand they are free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the opinions offered by the expert. Montana Criminal Jury Instruction No. 1-113 (2009) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A witness who by education and experience has become expert in any art, science, profession or calling may be permitted to state an opinion as to a matter in which the witness is versed and which is material to the case, and may also state the reasons for such opinion. You should consider each expert opinion received in evidence in this case and give it such weight as you think it deserves; and you may reject it entirely if you conclude the reasons given in support of the opinion are unsound.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 76 Finally, the Majority alleges the profile evidence here is distinguishable from another type of profile evidence-expert testimony on battered woman syndrome-because expert testimony on\n   the latter is limited to \"how women with the syndrome act and behave.\" Opinion, \u00b6 42 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , generally). In\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , however, the State did not challenge-and the court did not rule upon-the admissibility of battered woman syndrome, nor was the\n   admissibility challenged on appeal. Rather, although the defendant gave notice of her intent to rely on battered woman syndrome as an affirmative defense, she challenged the State's right to have her examined by their own experts.\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2716809\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/252/205/#p210\">\n    252 Mont. at 209-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2716809\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/252/205/#p210\">\n    828 P.2d at 385-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
