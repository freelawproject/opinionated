The vendee, however, to have the privilege of retaining said goods on the immediate payment of the whole purchase price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201c Mrs. Matthew Griffin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The goods in question were part of those above described, and were replevied in July, 1902, part of the balance of $25.08 then remaining unpaid and several weeks having elapsed during which no payments on account had been made. The jury were instructed that the words \u201c account to be settled in full in twelve months,\u201d gave the plaintiffs an absolute right to their possession for twelve months from the delivery of the paper. This charge virtually denied any effect to the words next preceding those quoted, \u201c to be paid weekly.\u201d All these words were written by the defendants upon a printed blank. The obligation thereby assumed by the plaintiffs was twofold: to pay something every week until all should be paid, and to pay all within twelve months. Any default in either respect gave the defendants an immediate right to resume possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">There is error and a new trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
