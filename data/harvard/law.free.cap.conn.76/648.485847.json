But waiving the irregular manner in which these claims are presented in this court, they cannot be sustained upon the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">As to the first of these claims, if we assume, for the reasons stated by the defendant, that the special meeting of May 1st, 1901, was not a lawful one for the purpose of acting upon the matter of expelling the plaintiff, and that the action taken upon that matter at such meeting was unauthorized by, and not binding upon, the defendant as an association, it still appears that the association is responsible for the illegal expulsion of the plaintiff, since the court finds that the defendant afterwards, at a regular meeting of the society, in effect approved the action of the meeting of May 1st, 1901, by refusing the plaintiff admission to its meeting, and that it has ever since debarred the plaintiff from all the rights and privileges of membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">As to the second claim, we are not prepared to hold that a writ of mandamus to compel the association to readmit him to membership is the plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy for the illegal expulsion complained of, nor even that it is an available remedy to the plaintiff for such injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">The writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy to be applied only under exceptional conditions, and is not to be extended beyond its well-established limits. <em>Duane </em>v. <em>Mc</em>Donald, 41 Conn. 517, 522. It lies to compel the performance of a public duty, or one imposed by public authority and for the nonperformance of which there is no other specific or adequate remedy at law, but not for the enforcement of merely private obligations such as those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>arising from contracts. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Street Ry. Co., 74 </em>Conn. 194, 196; <em>Bassett </em>v. Atwater, 65 id. 355, 360; <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Hakes, </em>54 id. 274; <em>Parrott </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, 44 </em>id. 180,182; <em>American Asylum </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Bank, 4 </em>id. 172,178. It is often an appropriate remedy for the reinstatement of a member of an incorporated benevolent or social society, who has been unlawfully and unreasonably deprived of the enjoyment of the rights and privileges of membership in such societies. 1 Morawetz on Corp. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 277; 2 Spelling on Extraordinary Rem. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 1606 ; <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Burt </em>v. <em>Union League, </em>135 Pa. St. 301; and note on same case, 8 L. R. A. 195. Such associations, although private corporations, are chartered by the State, and enjoy privileges and exercise powers expressly granted by the State, and- for that reason the duties devolving upon them are regarded as of a public character, the performance of which may properly be compelled by writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Cuppel </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, </em>47 Wis. 670; <em>Burt v. Grand Lodge of Masons, </em>66 Mich. 85; <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Hakes, </em>54 Conn. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\"><em>Otto </em>v. <em>Journeymen Tailors\u2019 Union, </em>75 Cal. 308, and <em>Von Arx </em>v. <em>San Francisco Gruetli Verein, </em>113 id. 377, are cited by the defendant as cases where writs of mandamus were issued against unincorporated associations to compel the reinstatement of members wrongfully expelled. Our attention has not been called to any other authorities holding that mandamus is an appropriate remedy against unincorporated societies for the restoration of an expelled member. It seems generally to have been held that writs of mandamus will be denied in such cases. <em>People ex rel. Rice </em>v. <em>Board of Trade, </em>80 Ill. 134; <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge of Masons, </em>66 Mich. 85; <em>Lamphere </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge of Workmen, </em>47 id. 429. But whether or not a person might be expelled from an unincorporated society under such circumstances as to warrant .the granting of a writ of mandamus to compel his restoration to membership, and what effect the granting of such writ might have upon one\u2019s right' to recover damages for such illegal expulsion, are questions which we are not called upon to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>in this case. No writ of mandamus has been issued or asked for in the present case. The circumstances of his expulsion were perhaps such that the plaintiff could not thereafter have enjoyed the privileges of membership, had his reinstatement been ordered. Mandamus might for that reason have been but a partial remedy for the injury sustained by his wrongful expulsion, and an action for damages a more complete remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Upon the facts before us the plaintiff had the right to abandon all claim to reinstatement in the society and resort to an action for damages for the injury sustained by reason of the illegal expulsion. <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge of Masons, </em>66 Mich. 85 ; <em>Lamphere </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge of Workmen, </em>47 id. 429; <em>Washington Beneficial Soc. </em>v. <em>Bacher, </em>20 Pa. St. 425; <em>People ex rel. Deverell </em>v. <em>Musical Union, </em>118 N. Y. 101; <em>People ex rel. Dilcher </em>v. <em>German United Church, </em>53 id. 103; <em>Ludowiski </em>v. <em>Polish Benevolent Soc., </em>29 Mo. App. 337; <em>State ex rel. Koppestein </em>v. Lipa, 28 Ohio St. 665 ; <em>Fraternal Mystic Circle </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Fritter, </em>62 id. 628; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Board of Trade, </em>80 Ill. 85. We cannot adopt the view which seems to be expressed in <em>Lavalle </em>v. <em>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St. Jean Baptiste, </em>17 R. I. 680, that the bringing of an action for damages in such a case is a waiver by the plaintiff of the illegality of his expulsion. The loss sustained by the plaintiff in being deprived of the use and enjoyment of the property of the society and the privileges of membership were proper elements of damage, as was also the mental suffering of the plaintiff caused by his wrongful expulsion and the manner in which it was effected. <em>People ex rel. Dilcher </em>v. <em>German United Church, </em>53 N. Y. 103 ; <em>Maisenbacker </em>v. <em>Society Concordia, </em>71 Conn. 369, 376; <em>Gibney </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>68 id. 392, 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
