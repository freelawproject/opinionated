Pietruszka, J.), rendered August 26, 2010. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 [1]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the record establishes that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal <em>(see generally People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]), and that valid waiver forecloses any challenge by defendant to the severity of the sentence <em>(see id. </em>at 255; <em>see generally People v Lococo, </em>92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; <em>People v Hidalgo, </em>91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">We have considered defendant\u2019s contentions in his pro se supplemental brief and conclude that they are without merit. Present \u2014 Scudder, EJ., Peradotto, Garni, Whalen and Martoche, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
