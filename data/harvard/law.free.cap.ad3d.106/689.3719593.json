A property owner will be held liable under such circumstances only when it created the dangerous condition which caused the accident or had actual or constructive notice thereof <em>(see Kaplan v DePetro, </em>51 AD3d 730, 731 [2008]; <em>Zabbia v Westwood, LLC, </em>18 AD3d 542, 544 [2005]).</p><p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by demonstrating that it neither created nor had actual or constructive notice of the icy condition alleged to have caused the plaintiffs fall. The plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact in opposition <em>(see Mayo v Cedar Manor Mut. Hous. Corp., </em>96 AD3d 913 [2012]; <em>Pierson v North Colonie Cent. School Dist., </em>74 AD3d 1652, 1655 [2010]; <em>Kaplan v DePetro, </em>51 AD3d at 731). Her contentions that water runoff from an improperly placed downspout or melting snow piles played a role in her accident are speculative and contradicted by the record <em>(see Kaplan v DePetro, </em>51 AD3d at 731; <em>Abbattista v King\u2019s Grant Master Assn., Inc., </em>39 AD3d 439, 441-442 [2007]). Accordingly, upon reargument, the Supreme Court properly adhered to its determination in the order dated January 13, 2011, granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p><p id=\"b516-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court also properly denied that branch of the plaintiffs motion which was for leave to renew her opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint <em>(see Rowe v NYCPD, </em>85 AD3d 1001, 1003 [2011]).</p><p id=\"b516-5\">The plaintiffs remaining contentions are without merit. Rivera, J.E, Dickerson, Leventhal and Roman, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
