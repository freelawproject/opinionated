The District Court sentenced him principally to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 60 months on the conspiracy count and 32 months on the substantive count. Familiarity with the relevant facts, procedural history, and the issues on appeal is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">On appeal, Appellant raises two issues. He contends that the District Court erred in its jury charge by failing to instruct the jury that one sale is insufficient proof that he was \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of dealing in firearms within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A). He also maintains that the District Court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by reading \u00a7 5G1.2(d) to require consecutive terms. Because we find that each of these contentions lack merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Turning to the first issue, the District Court charged the jury that \u201cthe government does not need to prove that dealing in firearms was the defendant\u2019s primary business. Nor is there any magic number that has to be established, number of firearms purchased that must be proven. Nor does a gun sale in the course of a hobby violate the statute.\u201d The District Court correctly identified the standard for defining \u201cengaged in the business.\u201d The \u201c[N]or is there a \u2018magic number\u2019 of sales that need be specifically proven\u201d language was expressly approved in <em>United States v. Carter, </em>801 F.2d 78, 82 (2d Cir.1986), quoting <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>633 F.2d 856, 860 (8th Cir.1981). In any event, Appellant did not preserve the issue for appeal. During the charge conference, the parties and the court discussed alternative language. Ultimately, the language quoted above was given to the jury without objection. It is well settled that a request for an instruction before the jury retires does not preserve an objection to the instruction actually given by the court. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 388, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999); <em>United States v. Crowley, </em>318 F.3d 401, 412 (2d Cir.2003). Since Appellant did not object after the instructions were given, the issue is now waived. \u201cFailure to object in accordance with this rule precludes appellate review, except as permitted under Rule 52(b).\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 30(d). When, as here, no objection is made to the relevant charge, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Middlemiss, </em>217 F.3d 112, 121 (2d Cir. 2000). We find no error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">As to the second issue, U.S.S.G \u00a7 5G1.2(d) provides: \u201cIf the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\u201d Here the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d under the guidelines was 92 to 115 months. Because the statutory maximum sentence allowed on either count is 60 months, \u00a7 5G1.2(d) required the imposition of the statutory maximum term of 60 months of imprisonment on one count and at least 32 months of imprisonment on the second count to run consecutively. We have construed this provision consistent with its text to require consecutive terms when, as here, the total punishment ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ceeds the statutory minimum sentence on either count. <em>United States v. McLeod, </em>251 F.3d 78, 83 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Kapaev, </em>199 F.3d 596, 598 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We have considered Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the District Court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address the Appellant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fan-fan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
