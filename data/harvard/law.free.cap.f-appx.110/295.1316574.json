See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-29\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b325-30\">Eleazar Ramirez-Ibanez was convicted following his guilty plea to conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to distribute, 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana, five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841 (2000), and to conspiring to import more than 1000 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960, and 963 (2000). The district court sentenced Ramirez-Ibanez to the statutory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 960(b)(1)(H). Ramirez-Ibanez timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding RamirezIbanez ineligible for application of the safety valve provision set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2000). To qualify for sentencing under the safety valve provision, a defendant must meet all five criteria set out in \u00a7 3553(f), which are incorporated into <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5). A defendant who meets these criteria shall be sentenced within the guideline range without regard to any statutory minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that RamirezIbanez satisfied four of the five requirements for application of the safety valve. The only issue is whether Ramirez-Ibanez engaged in \u201ccredible threats of violence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In general, this Court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). In conducting this review, this Court gives due regard to the district court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2000). Credibility determinations by the fact finder are rarely disturbed on appeal. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Based on a recorded telephone conversation and the eyewitness account of a Government agent, the district court found Ramirez-Ibanez had used threats of violence, which rendered him ineligible for application of the safety valve. Based on our review of the record, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s determination that Ramirez-Ibanez engaged in credible threats of violence was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
