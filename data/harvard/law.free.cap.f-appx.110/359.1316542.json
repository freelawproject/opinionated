He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court dismissed Vance\u2019s motion in an order filed on August 27, 2004. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Vance\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
