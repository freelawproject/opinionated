We have reviewed the record and find that the district court correctly concluded that Lockhart\u2019s petition was untimely filed. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s findings on this issue on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Lockhart v. South Carolina, </em>No. CA-03-0678-04-18BH (D.S.C. filed Nov. 21, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>entered Nov. 24, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-26\">The district court declined to issue a certificate of appealability on Lockhart\u2019s remaining claims. In these claims, he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Respondents on procedural grounds without considering the underlying merits of his petition and contends that the district court erroneously failed to resolve a discovery dispute. Lockhart cannot obtain a certificate of appealability as to these claims absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Lock-hart has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Lockhart\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability as to his remaining claims and dismiss the appeal as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
