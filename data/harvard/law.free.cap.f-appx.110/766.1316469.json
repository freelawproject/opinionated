We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Vasquez v. County of L.A., </em>349 F.3d 634, 639-40 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-26\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Sanders\u2019 race discrimination claim under Title VII because, even if Sanders could make out a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>case of discrimination, he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants\u2019 proffered reasons for the employment decisions were pretextual. <em>See Vasquez, </em>349 F.3d at 642, 647. Moreover, the district court properly evaluated Sanders\u2019 evidence under both the direct and circumstantial evidence standards. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Sanders\u2019 hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims because there was no triable issue about whether defendant\u2019s conduct interfered unreasonably with his employment or was so intolerable that it would force an employee to quit. <em>See Kortan v. Cal. Youth Auth., </em>217 F.3d 1104, 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Sanders\u2019 Rehabilitation Act claims because Sanders did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any of his impairments substantially limits a major life activity. <em>See Thornton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 1045, 1046 (9th Cir.2002) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Sanders has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s delay in ruling on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment caused him prejudice. <em>Cf. Bunch v. United States, </em>680 F.2d 1271, 1283 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that errors and defects in district court proceedings will be disregarded unless doing so would be inconsistent with substantial justice.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b796-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b796-28\"> Sanders does not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on his age discrimination claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
