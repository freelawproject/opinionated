Neely has appealed. He contends that evidence seized after a protective sweep of the house at which he was arrested should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-25\">\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, this court reviews questions of law de novo and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>232 F.3d 447, 448 (5th Cir.2000). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>Where a police officer acts without a warrant, the Government bears the burden of proving that the search was valid. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>166 F.3d 728, 733 n. 6 (5th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-26\">\u201cA \u2018protective sweep\u2019 is a quick and limited search of premises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety of police officers or others. It is narrowly confined to a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person might be hiding.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). A \u201cprotective sweep may extend to areas of the home where the police <em>otherwise </em>(i.e., <em>apart </em>from the protective sweep doctrine) then have no right to go.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>United States v. </em>Gould, 364 F.3d 578, 587 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). \u201c[T]he protective sweep must be supported \u2018by a reasonable, articulable suspicion\u2019 ... \u2018that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to\u2019 those on the scene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587 (quoting <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. at 336-37; internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Neely argues that the officers could not lawfully enter the house because he was arrested outside of the house. \u201cA protective sweep of a suspect\u2019s house may be made \u2018even if the arrest is made near the door but outside the lodging\u2019 if the arresting officers \u2018have reasonable grounds to believe that there are other persons present inside who might present a security risk.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Watson, </em>273 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir.2001)(quoting <em>United States v. Merritt, </em>882 F.2d 916, 921 (5th Cir.1989)). The district court\u2019s finding that Smith articulated a reasonable basis for conducting a protective sweep of the house was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Wilson, </em>306 F.3d 231, 234, 237-39 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Neely contends also that the scope of the search was too broad and that it was not reasonable to search the entire house. The arresting officer\u2019s testimony reflects that the scope of the search was limited to \u201cplaces in which a person might be hiding.\u201d <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. at 327. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
