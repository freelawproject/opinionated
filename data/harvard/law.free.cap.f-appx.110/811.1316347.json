He asserts that the elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) must be pled in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The indictment here did not specifically charge that Nunez committed an offense under \u00a7 1326(b)(2); it charged him under \u00a7 1326(a). As the Supreme Court has clearly held, that was proper because \u00a7 1326(b)(2) \u201cis a penalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Nunez argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) changes that. It does not. <em>See United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). Nor does <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 2443, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), for it, too, excepts prior convictions from its strictures. <em>Id. </em>at 597 n. 4, 122 S.Ct. at 2437 n. 4. Nor does <em>Blakely v. Washington</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Quintana-Quintana, </em>383 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir.2004). Finally, as we said in <em>Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d at 414, we cannot \u201cignore controlling Supreme Court authority. Unless and until <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled by the Supreme Court, we must follow it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-25\">.
