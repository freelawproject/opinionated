Rakoff, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b220-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b220-21\">Petitioner Woon Y. Rhee appeals from the July 31, 2003 judgment of the United States Tax Court (Mary Ann Cohen, <em>Judge) </em>ordering her to pay income-tax liabilities in accordance with a stipulated settlement she entered into with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Rhee also appeals from the tax court\u2019s order of October 23, 2003 denying her motion to vacate the stipulated settlement. We affirm. Familiarity with the facts and procedural background is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">There is no dispute that, in settlement of the litigation before the tax court, the parties entered into a stipulation pursuant to which Rhee agreed to pay $4,000, in $70 monthly installments, to cover tax liabilities she owed for the 1991 and 1996 fiscal years. Nor is there any dispute that the tax court entered an order on July 31, 2003 approving the terms of that agreement. But Rhee argues that she entered into the agreement under duress, and that the tax court and the IRS colluded to force her into a settlement. These same arguments were made to, and rejected by, the tax court when, by order dated October 23, 2003, it denied Rhee\u2019s motion to vacate the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-23\">We review the tax court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>its factual findings for clear error, and its application of its own procedural rules for abuse of discretion. <em>Sunik </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>v. Comm\u2019r, </em>321 F.3d 335, 337 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Madison Recycling Assocs. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>295 F.3d 280, 285 (2d Cir.2002). A stipulated tax-court settlement is binding on the parties, and will not be vacated absent some showing of fraud, mutual mistake of fact, or another \u201clike cause.\u201d <em>Farrell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>136 F.3d 889, 894 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see </em>Tax Ct. R. 91(e). There being no evidence in the record to support Rhee\u2019s allegations of duress and collusion, the tax court\u2019s order approving the parties\u2019 stipulated settlement and its subsequent refusal to vacate the settlement agreement are unimpeachable.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the tax court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
