The immigration judge found, and petitioner concedes, that he is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony. He argues that his conviction should be vacated, but he has only just filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court on September 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-22\">Congress has removed judicial review of an order of removal of an alien who has committed an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1252(a)(2)(C). As a result, this court does not have jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s appeal. <em>Khalayleh v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir. 2002); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-24\">Petitioner\u2019s request for release on bond is denied without prejudice. That request should be raised in the district court in a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The motion for a stay of removal is denied, the request for immediate release</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">is denied without prejudice, and the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b127-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
