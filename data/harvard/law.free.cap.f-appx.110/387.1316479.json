California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cuellar has filed a response, arguing that his criminal history was incorrectly calculated, that his base offense level was improperly enhanced for aggravated felonies despite the absence of such felonies in his criminal history, and that his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance by not challenging these facts at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">Our independent review of the brief, Cuellar\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. To the extent that Cuellar raises claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record is not adequately developed for us to consider this issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
