In his brief, Li contests the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s order of removal, rather than the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. Li\u2019s only assertion concerning the motion to reconsider is his conclusory statement that his rights were prejudiced because he made other arguments in his motion to reconsider in addition to the one noted by the BIA. Li has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 F.2d 1136, 1141 (5th Cir.1984). Accordingly, Li\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
