We have reviewed the record and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Our review of the denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Such motions are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding the motion to reopen was untimely and failed to establish changed circumstances. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
