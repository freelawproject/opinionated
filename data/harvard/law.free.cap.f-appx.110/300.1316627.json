Awoyemi, a native and citizen of Nigeria, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying his motion to reopen and to reconsider its previous order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen immigration proceedings. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Awoyemi\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Awoyemi, </em>No. A75-836-158 (B.I.A. Jan. 15, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
