Upon our review of the administrative record, we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Miiro failed to establish eligibility for the relief sought. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994); <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Miiro thus cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">Miiro also contends that the Board violated his right to Due Process in declining to grant his motion to submit new evidence on country conditions. We find this contention to be without merit. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 (4th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-16\"> We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
