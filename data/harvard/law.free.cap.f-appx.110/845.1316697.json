He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and 36 months post-prison supervision. He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition challenging his conviction on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to test physical evidence seized at the crime scene and he was prejudiced thereby. We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition <em>de novo. See Taylor v. Maddox, </em>366 F.3d 992, 997 (9th Cir.2004). Habeas relief may be granted if a state court\u2019s decision \u201c[w]as contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must prove: (1) that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">We conclude that the decision of petitioner\u2019s counsel not to have the blood on the victim\u2019s t-shirt and the petitioner\u2019s coat and van bumper independently tested was a \u201creasonable\u201d tactical decision under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Even if counsel\u2019s decision not to test the physical evidence was not reasonable, petitioner did not prove that he was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b876-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
