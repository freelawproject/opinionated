The district court concluded that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination; and that even had plaintiff done so, she failed to rebut defendant\u2019s articulation of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">Having had the benefit of oral argument and having carefully considered the record on appeal, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we are not persuaded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-22\">Because the reasoning which supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff failed to rebut defendant\u2019s articulation of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its conduct has been set out by the district court, the issuance of a detailed written opinion by this court would be duplicative and serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed upon the reasoning employed by that court in that portion of its memorandum opinion discussing plaintiffs failure to rebut defendant\u2019s articulation of a legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>mate non-discriminatory reason for its conduct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
