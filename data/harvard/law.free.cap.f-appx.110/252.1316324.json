The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We exercise appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review \u201cis identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-25\">In January 1998, Ries suffered a myocardial infarction, which necessitated the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Because Ries\u2019s position as a boilermaker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>entailed heavy lifting, he was precluded from returning to his former position. Subsequent stress tests, however, were negative for ischemia. Ries\u2019s cardiologist, Dr. Carabelli, documented that Ries was \u201cdoing well\u201d and encouraged him to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">At a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), Ries asserted that he was completely disabled because of his cardiac status, depression, an old back injury, and a knee impairment. The ALJ found that Ries was capable of performing light level activity and that he did not have any non-exertional impairments. Accordingly, the ALJ applied the grids in Appendix 2 and concluded that Ries was not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, Appendix 2. The District Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Ries contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence for several reasons. He asserts that the ALJ erred by finding that he was capable of performing light level work and by applying the grids in Appendix 2. In Ries\u2019s view, the ALJ failed to accord sufficient weight to the opinion of his treating physician, Dr. Gross, that he was limited to lifting objects of three to five pounds and was completely disabled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">In <em>Plummer, </em>we instructed that [tjreating physicians\u2019 reports should be accorded great weight, especially when their opinions reflect expert judgment based on a continuing observation of the patient\u2019s condition over a prolonged period of time. An ALJ may reject a treating physician\u2019s opinion outright only on the basis of contradictory medical evidence, but may afford a treating physician\u2019s opinion more or less weight depending upon the extent to which supporting explanations are provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">186 F.3d at 429 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The ALJ complied with this standard, according great weight to Dr. Gross\u2019s opinion that Ries\u2019s ability to perform work related activity was limited by finding that he was restricted to light level activity. Dr. Gross\u2019s opinion that Ries was able to lift only three to five pounds and that he was completely disabled was appropriately discounted. The ALJ explained that Ries\u2019s own testimony regarding what he could lift contradicted Dr. Gross\u2019s lifting limitation. Although diagnostic testing confirmed that Ries had degenerative joint disease of his back and knee, the ALJ noted that these conditions were not disabling and that Dr. Gross\u2019s records were devoid of any complaints of persistent back or knee pain. Indeed, Ries testified that his back and his knee were essentially the same as when he worked as a boilermaker before he suffered a myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">In addition, the ALJ pointed out that Dr. Gross\u2019s opinion conflicted with the recommendation of Ries\u2019s cardiologist that he should exercise. Light level activity, the ALJ concluded, was consistent with this recommendation and supported by the fact that Ries\u2019s stress tests were negative for ischemia. The ALJ also cited the fact that Ries\u2019s own description of his activities indicated that he was able to perform a wide variety of activities. Accordingly, there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Ries was able to perform light level activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The ALJ did not err by applying the grids in Appendix 2 because the evidence of record does not support a finding that he had a mental impairment that resulted in non-exertional limitations. When the impairments cause solely exertional limitations, the ALJ is entitled to rely on the grids. <em>See Sykes v. Apfel, </em>228 F.3d 259, (3d Cir.2000). In Ries\u2019 case, the grids direct a finding of not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In sum, the ALJ\u2019s decision that Ries was not disabled is supported by substantial evidence. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
