Because we write solely for the parties, we do not recite the underlying facts, which are set forth in the order of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) dated August 8, 2003. We conclude that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and we deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of an application for asylum to determine if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>supported by substantial evidence. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 247 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc). Under this standard, the decision of the Board may be reversed \u201conly if the evidence presented by [the applicant] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). In other words, \u201cthe BIA\u2019s finding must be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483-84 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who demonstrates that she is unable or unwilling to return to her native land because of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2004); <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 482. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 469 (3d Cir.2003). We have held that \u201cpersecution\u201d includes \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a real threat to life or freedom,\u201d but does not amount to \u201call treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 168 (3d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Camara argues that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence because her testimony and the country reports she submitted both showed that members of her political party, the RDR, were being targeted for violence and detention by the country\u2019s ruling government. She further testified that she feared for her life after the government\u2019s \u201canti-riot brigade\u201d (the \u201cBAE\u201d) had twice visited her house in the middle of the night. The IJ deemed this testimony \u201cabove reproach,\u201d finding it \u201ccredible, persuasive, and specific.\u201d Administrative Record (\u201cA.R.\u201d) at 72. Since Camara testified that her life was in danger and the IJ found this testimony credible, she argues that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find that she had a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We disagree. It does not follow from a finding of credibility that Camara was eligible for asylum based solely on her testimony. Testimony may want for more than credibility. A reasonable factfinder may credit a witness yet still discount her testimony as speculative or hearsay, and even testimony without these limitations must meet the basic requirement of alleging facts that would entitle the applicant to relief. The BIA\u2019s decisions have distinguished between claims that fail for lack of credibility and claims that fail because testimony, while credible, failed to satisfy an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 551 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>In re S-M-J, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 722 (BIA1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Camara\u2019s testimony, if credited, may compel the conclusion that she genuinely feared persecution, but it does not compel the conclusion that this fear was reasonable. Although she testified that government agents would arrest and kill her because of her membership in the RDR, <em>see </em>A.R. at 155, she offered no evidence as to how commonly RDR members were persecuted or whether she was similarly situated with those who had been. The State Department\u2019s 2002 Country Report on Cote d\u2019Ivoire actually suggests that a relatively small number of people had been targeted. <em>See </em>A.R. at 379-80 (reporting that in a country with a population of 16 million, \u201cmore than 200 extrajudicial kill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ings\u201d and \u201cseveral\u201d disappearances had occurred). While these facts might permit the conclusion that Camara\u2019s fear of persecution was reasonable, we do not believe they compel it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Nor do we believe this conclusion was compelled by Camara\u2019s testimony about the BAE. According to her, BAE agents had twice arrived on her doorstep in the middle of the night and demanded entry. A.R. at 148-49. She also testified, however, that BAE agents had done the same thing to others in her neighborhood who belonged to the RDR, <em>see </em>A.R. at 149, yet she offered no evidence that any of them had suffered violence at the BAE\u2019s hands. As the IJ observed, the BAE agents always left her house without incident, even though Camara was a well-known RDR member who may have been denounced by her husband. <em>See </em>A.R. at 72. Based on this testimony, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that her fear, though genuine, was not reasonable. The decision to deny her application was thus supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Since the denial of Camara\u2019s asylum application was supported by substantial evidence, it follows that the Board\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal under the INA must be upheld as well. <em>See Lukwago, </em>329 F.3d at 182 (\u201cIf [petitioner] is unable to satisfy the standard for asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the standard for withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3).\u201d). We also believe a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Camara had failed to show that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be tortured if removed to Cote d\u2019Ivoire. <em>See id. </em>at 182-83. The Board\u2019s decision to deny her application for withholding of removal under the U.N. Convention Against Torture therefore must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">After thoroughly examining the record and exploring the issues at oral argument, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision to deny the petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum and withholding of removal. The petition for review is accordingly denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\">. We assume that Miriam (spelled \"Mariam\u201d in several places in the record) and Khady Stephanie Camara may both file applications derivative of their mother\u2019s application, despite our doubts whether Khady, who was informally adopted by Kadiatou, qualifies as a derivative applicant. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 208(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A) (2000). Since the record contains no evidence that Miriam and Khady would be \"otherwise eligible for asylum,\u201d <em>id., </em>we focus our energies on Kadiatou's application, assuming that the success of Miriam\u2019s and Khady\u2019s applications depends on hers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
