Preska, <em>Judge) </em>affirming the findings of the Independent Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\u201cIBT\u201d). <em>United States v. IBT, </em>No. 88 Civ. 4486(LAP), 2003 WL 21998009, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14508 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.25, 2003). The IRB found that Hogan and Passo colluded with a non-union employer to enter into a contract that would harm members of IBT Local 631 and thereby brought reproach on the union in violation of Article II, Section 2(a) and Article XIX, Sections 7(b)(1) and (2) of the IBT Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">Hogan and Passo argue that the IRB decision impermissibly violated their free speech rights under the First Amendment and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (\u201cLMRDA\u201d). The district court was correct in concluding, however, that the IRB\u2019s sanctions were not for the mere advocacy of ideas, but were a response to the actions Hogan and Passo took to benefit their friend Richard Simon and Hogan\u2019s brother, which they knew would harm the Local. Because the IRB\u2019s efforts were designed to rid the Local of the defendants\u2019 corrupt influence, the district court did not err in finding that the IRB\u2019s behavior did not violate Hogan and Passo\u2019s rights under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>LMRDA or the First Amendment. <em>See United States v. IBT (\u201cDiGirlamo\u201d), </em>19 F.3d 816, 823 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Hogan and Passo also argue that the proposed contract would not have harmed the union. We review the IRB\u2019s decision for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cGiacumbo\u201d), </em>170 F.3d 136, 143 (2d Cir.1999). Assuming the IRB\u2019s factual findings are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d we disturb its findings only if they are \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on an exhaustive hearing during which both Passo and Hogan testified, the IRB expressly found that \u201cPasso and Hogan colluded with Simon to enable Simon to profit from paying his workers below the rates the governing Teamster contract required.... There was no benefit to Local 631, its members or the United employees. In fact, they were repeatedly harmed. Passo\u2019s and Hogan\u2019s claimed reasons for advocating the agreement with United are not believable.\u201d IRB Decision at 57. Having carefully reviewed the hearing record, we conclude that the IRB\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, are not arbitrary or capricious, and plainly demonstrate that Hogan and Passo were negotiating a contract that they knew would have harmed the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Hogan and Passo also argue that the IRB exceeded its authority in reaching its determination that Passo and Hogan\u2019s conduct brought reproach upon the IBT. The IRB has a broad grant of authority, including the ability to investigate and discipline any person whose actions bring reproach upon the union. <em>See United States v. IBT (\u201cMireles &amp; Roa\u201d), </em>315 F.3d 97, 99 (2d Cir.2002). In light of Hogan and Pas-so\u2019s conduct, the IRB has not exceeded its broad authority in this case. Hogan and Passo\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Finally, Hogan and Passo argue that the IRB\u2019s choice of sanction was excessive. \u201cThe court must sustain the IRB\u2019s determination unless it finds the penalty \u2018unwarranted in law1 or \u2018without justification in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Giacumbo, </em>170 F.3d at 144. \u201cThe choice of appropriate sanctions ... [is] peculiarly within the purview of the IRB.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court recently stated that \u201c[e]xpulsion from union membership, though a drastic sanction, is permissible under the LMRDA if the union\u2019s constitution so provides. There is no dispute that the IBT Constitution provides that a member may be stripped of membership rights if found guilty of misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Boggia, </em>167 F.3d 113, 120 (2d Cir.1999) (citation omitted). Based on the evidence presented to it, the IRB found that Hogan and Passo colluded to push through a contract that threatened to undermine the bargaining position, wages, and benefits of Local 631; that they did so to aid their friend and Hogan\u2019s brother; that, in doing so, they instigated the firing of several union officers who opposed Hogan\u2019s and Passo\u2019s efforts to secure a contract with Simon; that they lied to local union officials in an effort to pressure them into approving the contract; and that they did all this while in positions of trust. Ample evidence supported the IRB\u2019s findings, and therefore the sanction of expulsion was well within the IRB\u2019s broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
