Rosario-Peralta, </em>175 F.3d 48, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) (\u201cIt is elementary that evidence cannot be submitted for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Plaintiffs contention that he was deprived of an adequate opportunity to develop the record below is mistaken. Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion was filed within the time prescribed by the scheduling order, after discovery had closed. And plaintiff neither moved for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) nor voiced any such complaint in his summary judgment opposition. (He sought an extension to file his opposition only because he was \u201cin the process of moving\u201d; no mention was made of difficulties in obtaining his medical records.) That plaintiff may have been unfamiliar with his evidentiary burden at the summary judgment stage provides no basis for appellate relief. <em>See, e.g., FDIC v. Anchor Properties, </em>13 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that litigant\u2019s pro se status does not absolve him from compliance with the federal rules). We might add that the outcome of this appeal would be the same even if the newly proffered materials were considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\"><em>Second. </em>Plaintiff contends that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether a true threat of violence was involved here. Yet he acknowledges making the reference to the Wakefield tragedy at the end of a heated exchange with his supervisor. Whatever plaintiffs ultimate intention, defendant cannot be faulted for taking this threat at face value. In analo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>gous contexts, courts have not hesitated to reject claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. River Valley School Dist., </em>197 F.3d 804, 813 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201cthreatening other employees disqualifies one from a job\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Chapa v. Adams, </em>168 F.3d 1036, 1039 (7th Cir. 1999) (\u201cpeople who threaten to kill their supervisors are not \u2018qualified\u2019 for [employment] even if their threats are hollow\u201d). As this court has recently stated: \u201cPut simply, the ADA does not require that an employee whose unacceptable behavior threatens the safety of others be retained, even if the behavior stems from a mental disability. Such an employee is not qualified.\u201d <em>Calef v. Gillette Co., </em>322 F.3d 75, 87 (1st Cir.2003). Such a conclusion is dictated here whether plaintiff is viewed as having the burden of showing he posed no threat to safety in order to establish he was otherwise qualified for the job, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 87 n. 10; <em>EEOC v. Amego, Inc., </em>110 F.3d 135, 142-44 (1st Cir.1997), or whether defendant is viewed as having the burden of establishing a \u201cdirect threat\u201d as an affirmative defense under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(3), 12113(b) and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1630.2(r), 1630.15(b)(2), <em>see, e.g., Hutton v. Elf Atochem North America, Inc., </em>273 F.3d 884, 893 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (9th Cir.2001). The case on which plaintiff mainly relies in arguing that factual disputes remained, <em>Whitney v. Bd. of Educ. of Grand County, </em>292 F.3d 1280, 1286 (10th Cir.2002), did not involve threatened violence and is otherwise distinguishable on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><em>Third. </em>Plaintiff likewise asserts that a trialworthy issue remained as to whether any such threat could be eliminated through reasonable accommodation. Even if such an inquiry were pertinent in this context, <em>but cf. Calef, </em>322 F.3d at 87 n. 11, it would not avail plaintiff. It was his burden to show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he made a specific request for an accommodation that would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his job. <em>See, e.g., Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., </em>244 F.3d 254, 259, 261 (1st Cir.2001). Plaintiff mainly points in this regard to a therapist\u2019s letter, delivered to defendant after the incident in question (and introduced for the first time on appeal), indicating that he would benefit from a leave of absence of unspecified length. In <em>Criado v. IBM Corp., </em>145 F.3d 437, 443-44 (1st Cir. 1998), we did hold that a leave of absence was a reasonable accommodation for an employee suffering from depression. But no threatening behavior was there involved. And unlike in the case at bar, that employee had \u201coffered evidence tending to show that her leave would be temporary and would allow her physician to design an effective treatment program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444. In turn, the proposal mentioned by plaintiff below-that he be subjected to regular security screening-not only was untimely but was properly rejected as unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., Chapa, </em>168 F.3d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>Plaintiff has also failed to sustain his burden of proof on the two remaining elements of his ADA claim: that he was disabled within the meaning of the Act; and that he was discharged as a result thereof. <em>See, e.g., Criado, </em>145 F.3d at 441. \u201cThis circuit has recognized depression as a mental impairment that may constitute, at least in some circumstances, a disability under federal law.\u201d <em>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>355 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir.2004). Yet the evidence submitted below failed to substantiate such a diagnosis. And even when the appellate filings are considered, plaintiff has not shown that a major life activity was substantially limited. <em>See, e.g., Calef, </em>322 F.3d at 83-86 (discussing this requirement). His main complaint in this regard is about suffering unspecified side-effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>from his medication and needing to take sick and vacation leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">By the same token, there is no genuine dispute about the fact that plaintiff was discharged because of his unacceptable behavior rather than because of any mental impairment. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 87 (noting that employee \u201cwhose unacceptable behavior threatens the safety of others\u201d need not be retained \u201ceven if the behavior stems from a mental disability\u201d); <em>Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe cause of Hamilton\u2019s discharge was not discrimination based on [his mental impairment] but was rather his failure to recognize the acceptable limits of behavior in a workplace environment.\u201d); <em>Palmer v. Circuit Court of Cook County, </em>117 F.3d 351, 352 (7th Cir. 1997) (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\"><em>Fifth. </em>We decline to address plaintiffs First Amendment and due process arguments as they were not properly raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
