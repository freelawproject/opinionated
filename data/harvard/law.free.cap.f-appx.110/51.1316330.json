Arabe appeals pro se the district court\u2019s order denying his second motion to reconsider following the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action alleging <em>inter alia </em>improper denial of military benefits. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Pasatiempo by Pasatiempo v. Aizawa, </em>103 F.3d 796, 801 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s underlying order dismissing Arabe\u2019s action. <em>See Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, </em>954 F.2d 1441, 1462-63 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that a timely appeal from an untimely tolling motion brings up for review only the post-judgment motion, not the underlying judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Arabe\u2019s second post-judgment motion because, assuming Arabe\u2019s claim is justiciable, he conceded that he did not initiate exhaustion with the Army Board for Correction of Military Records until after his district court action was dismissed. <em>See Wenger v. Monroe, </em>282 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir.2002). The district court also properly concluded that Arabe\u2019s fraud claim against the Army was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a); <em>Engleson v. Burlington Northern R. Co., </em>972 F.2d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that ignorance of statute of limitations is not grounds for 60(b) relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying mandamus relief because the Secretary of the Army was not under a clear and certain duty to enlist Arabe and the decision concerning enlistment was discretionary. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361; <em>Lowry v. Barnhart, </em>329 F.3d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We decline to consider Arabe\u2019s contention that the defendant racially discriminated against him because it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 1054, 1066 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Arabe\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b81-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
