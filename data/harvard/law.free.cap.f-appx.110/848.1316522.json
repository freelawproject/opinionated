Applying the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual, the district court ultimately determined Defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range to be between 57 and 71 months in prison. He now appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">The district court advised Defendant of his rights and the consequences of his guilty plea. Defendant stated that his plea was given freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">As for sentencing, Defendant\u2019s indictment and presentence report listed his previous conviction for the aggravated felony of second-degree sexual assault on October 11,1994. Applying \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court found that Defendant had a base offense level of 8 for unlawfully reentering the United States, which was boosted by 16 levels due to his previous conviction for a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii); <em>see also id. </em>cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as including \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d). This resulted in an offense level of 24, which the district court reduced by 3 levels to 21, because Defendant accepted responsibility for his offense and otherwise satisfied the requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">The presentence report assessed 9 criminal history points against Defendant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, placing him in sentencing category IV. The presentence report included 3 points for Defendant\u2019s sexual-assault conviction under \u00a7 4Al.l(a); 2 points for a criminal-impersonation conviction on May 23, 2002, under \u00a7 4Al.l(b); and 4 points for prior sentences of imprisonment of less than 60 days, under \u00a7 4Al.l(c). Defendant\u2019s offense level of 21 and his criminal history category of IV combined to yield a sentencing range between 57 and 71 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A. The district court sentenced Defendant at the bottom of this range, to 57 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Defendant directed his defense counsel to file a notice of appeal, and counsel timely complied. Defense counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief indicating his belief that the case affords no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although <em>Anders </em>entitles the defendant to raise additional points in response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, Defendant has made no such filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Agreeing with counsel that Defendant has no nonfrivolous arguments, we GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
