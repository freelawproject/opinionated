R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed. Because the United States Parole Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) may \u201cweigh the particular nature of an offense as an aggravating factor even if the offense itself was accounted for\u201d in determining the salient factor score, <em>Thomas v. Brennan, </em>961 F.2d 612, 620 (7th Cir.1992), the Commission did not abuse its discretion in considering the nature of appellant\u2019s offense in departing from the guidelines to deny parole. <em>See also Stroud v. United States Parole Commission, </em>668 F.2d 843, 847 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Mason v. United States Parole Commission, </em>768 A.2d 591, 593-94 (D.C. 2001). Nor did the Commission double-count in extending the time for petitioner\u2019s rehearing, as no double-counting occurs when the Commission relies on the same factor in reaching two independent determinations such as the denial of parole and extension of a rehearing date. <em>See Hall v. Henderson, </em>672 A.2d 1047, 1056 (D.C. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
