We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">1. Adverse Credibility Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">The IJ found Zhong\u2019s testimony to be incredible. \u201cTo determine whether substantial evidence supports the [IJ\u2019s] finding, we evaluate each ground cited by the [IJ] for its finding.\u201d <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">The IJ stated that its adverse credibility determination was based upon \u201csignificant vagaries, inconsistencies, implausibilities, and other difficulties with respect to [Zhong\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Specifically, the IJ noted that Zhong \u201cdid not answer or was unable to answer or was unwilling to answer specific questions by the Court, such as the date that she left Tonga,\u201d and that Zhong was able \u201cto recall only certain dates [of her travel and] could not recall other interim dates.\u201d The IJ also stated that Zhong was not responsive to questions about \u201chow many persons were involved [in the Marxist Democratic Party (MDP) ], what exactly she did, as well as other questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that Zhong testified incredibly. It is well-settled that \u201c \u2018discrepancies in dates which reveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear of his safety1 [are] \u2018minor inconsistencies\u2019 that cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988)). Thus, Zhong\u2019s inability to recall exactly when she left Tonga, or when and where she made her brief stops on the way back to Hong Kong, does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, as these discrepancies have nothing to do with her fear of safety. <em>See id. </em>Her inability to recall how many people were in the MDP is similarly unrelated to her own fear of persecution, especially because, notwithstanding the IJ\u2019s statements to the contrary, her testimony discussed in detail her involvement in the pro-democracy movement. Such purported discrepancies do not support an adverse credibility determination because they do not reflect an \u201cattempt[] by the applicant to enhance [her] claims of persecution.\u201d <em>Damaize-Job v. INS, </em>787 F.2d 1332, 1337 (9th Cir. 1986); <em>see also Wang, </em>341 F.3d at 1022. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Having reached this conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>sion, we deem Zhong to be credible. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1203 (9th Cir. 2004). Therefore, it is unnecessary to remand for another credibility determination. <em>He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 604 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">2. Zhong\u2019s \u201cResettlement\u201d in Tonga</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">An applicant is not eligible for asylum if she has been firmly resettled within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(c)(2)(i)(B); <em>Andriasian v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 1033, 1043 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination that Zhong was firmly resettled in Tonga. Although Zhong did receive a \u201cright of abode\u201d in Tonga, this was not an \u201coffer of permanent residence status,\u201d for the purposes of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15. The IJ\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is belied by a letter from the Tongan Office of the Minister of Police to the Tongan Consulate in San Francisco concerning the renewal of Zhong\u2019s passport, which states: \u201c[As to the] issue of residence in Tonga, Mrs. ZHONG must apply to the minister of Police for an entry visa and such visa is in the sole discretion of the Minister of Police, on application.\u201d Because Zhong was required to submit an application for residency that was subject to the discretion of the Tongan Police, Zhong plainly had not yet received an \u201coffer of permanent residence status\u201d from Tonga, as required for a finding of firm resettlement under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15. Because Tonga made no \u201coffer of permanent residence status\u201d to Zhong, the exceptions set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15(a) and (b) are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">\u201c[I]n the absence of direct evidence of an offer [of permanent residence], a lengthy, undisturbed residence in a third country may establish a rebuttable presumption that an individual has the right to return to that country and remain there permanently.\u201d <em>Andriasian, </em>180 F.3d at 1043. It is undisputed, however, that Zhong spent no more than a few days in Tonga; she never resided there, let alone spent a lengthy, undisturbed residence sufficient to establish a presumption that she may return to Tonga and reside there permanently. Because Zhong had neither an offer of permanent residence in Tonga nor had she spent an undisturbed period of residence in the country, the IJ\u2019s determination that Zhong was firmly resettled in Tonga is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Accordingly, we remand to the BIA to determine whether, accepting Zhong\u2019s testimony as true and given that Zhong was not firmly resettled in Tonga, Zhong is otherwise eligible for asylum. <em>See Ventura v. INS, </em>317 F.3d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">PETITION GRANTED, REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
