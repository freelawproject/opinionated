He also has filed motions requesting to continue his cross-claims against Adjusters Incorporated for the People (Adjusters) and the IRS, and to supplement the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-24\">We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because at the time the district court granted summary judgment, the cross-claims were pending and the district court did not rule on them. Thus there was no final judgment from which to take an appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (appellate jurisdiction over final orders); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b) (\u201corder or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties\u201d); <em>Miller v. Special Weapons, L.L.C., </em>369 F.3d 1033, 1034-35 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Thomas v. Basham, </em>931 F.2d 521, 522-24 (8th Cir.1991) (appellate courts have obligation to raise jurisdictional issues sua sponte \u201cwhen there is an indication that jurisdiction is lacking\u201d). Given this disposition, we need not rule on McManus\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-25\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-20\">.
