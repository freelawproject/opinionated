Udell, Assistant United States Attorney (Karl Metzner, Assistant United States Attorney, David N. Kelley, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, on the brief), United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, New York, NY, for Appellee, of counsel.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-12\">PRESENT: MINER, CABRANES and STRAUB, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">Defendant Alfonso Pilinci appeals the judgment of the District Court on the grounds that (1) evidence adduced at trial by the Government against Pilinci was insufficient to support his conviction; (2) the District Court erred in admitting hearsay statements of an alleged co-conspirator beyond the purview of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) the District Court erred in denying Pilinci\u2019s two motions for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">We have reviewed the record, considered Pilinci\u2019s arguments, and our <em>de novo </em>review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Pilinci\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim compels us to conclude that he has failed to meet his \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>335 F.3d 170, 180 (2d Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted), of establishing that no rational trier of fact could find otherwise. <em>See United States v. Payton, </em>159 F.3d 49, 55-56 (2d Cir.1998). To the contrary, we find ample evidence in the record that Pilinci was properly found by the jury to have conspired to commit robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-20\">We have reviewed Pilinci\u2019s argument that the statements of Florian Spahiu, as testified to by Edwin Rios at Pilinci\u2019s trial, were improperly admitted, and we hold that the District Court did not err, much less plainly err,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in admitting those statements. The record supports the conclusion that a conspiracy between, among others, Rios, Spahiu and Pilinci existed, and that the Spahiu statements were made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>during the course of the conspiracy. <em>See generally </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>203 F.3d 156, 161 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We further hold that Pilinci\u2019s argument that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motions for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 is without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record, and we agree with the District Court that both the Spahiu recordings and the Hani interview information could have been discovered, at the latest, during trial with the exercise of due diligence, and that neither the Spahiu recordings nor the Hani interview information would have led to acquittal. <em>See generally United States v. Slutsky, </em>514 F.2d 1222, 1225 (2d Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Gallego, </em>191 F.3d 156, 161-62 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s arguments and hold that each is without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-15\">. Pilinci further argues that, by permitting the hearsay co-conspirator testimony, and entering a judgment based upon a jury verdict in support of which there is insufficient evidence, the District Court denied him his rights under the Due Process and Confrontation Clauses of the Constitution. Because we hold that the District Court did not err in any of the ways identified by Pilinci, we need not consider the (unrealized) constitutional ramifications of those asserted errors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-21\">. We review a claim of insufficiency of evidence <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Reyes, </em>302 F.3d 48, 52-53 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-22\">. Because the record indicates that Pilinci did not object to the Rios testimony \u2014 about Spahiu's statements \u2014 at the trial, we review this decision of the District Court for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 83 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Wong, </em>78 F.3d 73, 78 (2d Cir.1996), and we review the factual findings in support of such a decision for clear error, <em>see United States v. Imran, </em>964 F.2d 1313, 1318 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
