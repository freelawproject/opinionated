We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The IJ properly denied Prado\u2019s motion to terminate because, after giving Prado an opportunity to argue the merits of his motion, Prado did not offer any evidence that the matter involved exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We are not persuaded by Prado\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process by finding him removable on a ground that did not exist in 1992. The IJ found Prado removable in part because, when Prado entered the United States in 1992, he was inadmissible because of his prior conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i), and this ground existed in 1992, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Prado\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s affirmance without opinion violates due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Prado\u2019s remaining claims because he failed to present them to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
