Prather, filed a complaint against Ocean Ships, Inc. and others seeking damages under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.CApp. \u00a7 688, and general maritime law for negligence and unseaworthiness, maintenance and cure, and attorney fees. James Prather had developed acute urine retention while in the service of an Ocean Ships vessel. The Prathers dismissed without prejudice all claims against all defendants other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Ocean Ships. The district court and dismissed Mrs. Prather\u2019s loss of consortium claim. The Prathers appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Ocean Ships on the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as would the district court. <em>See Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings and summary judgment evidence present no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The district court found that the Prathers presented no evidence that Ocean Ships had been negligent or that its vessel was unseaworthy. <em>Gautreaux v. Scurlock Marine, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 331, 338 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc); <em>Johnson v. Offshore Express Inc., </em>845 F.2d 1347, 1354 (5th Cir.1988). On appeal, the Prathers have not shown a genuine issue of material fact with respect to either negligence or unseaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Contrary to the Prathers\u2019 argument, there is no factual dispute that Ocean Ships paid Prather the required maintenance and cure for his illness while in the service of the vessel. <em>Baldassaro v. United States, </em>64 F.3d 206, 212-13 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Given all of the foregoing, the district court did not <em>err </em>in not awarding the Prathers either punitive damages or attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
