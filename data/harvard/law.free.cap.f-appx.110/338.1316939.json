See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b369-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Berhanemeskel Goshu Mengistu, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Mengistu challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely because he failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application within one year of the date of his arrival in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Mengistu\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Mengistu\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of his requests for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of proof of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). Based on our review of the record, we find that Mengistu has failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Accordingly, we deny Mengistu\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
