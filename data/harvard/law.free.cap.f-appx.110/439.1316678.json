He contends that the district court erred by failing to hold a colloquy pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) before using a prior conviction to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); that the use of the prior conviction to enhance his sentence was unconstitutional because the prior conviction was not alleged in his indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We review all of Duenas\u2019s contentions under the plain-error standard. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.l994)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Due\u00f1as has failed to demonstrate reversible error regarding the district court\u2019s failure to hold a colloquy pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b), as he did not challenge the information indicating the Government\u2019s desire to use his prior conviction to enhance his sentence. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>348 F.3d 78, 87 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 1481, 158 L.Ed.2d 131 (2004). <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>358 F.3d 344 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2390, 158 L.Ed.2d 966 (2004), is inapposite to Duenas\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Due\u00f1as correctly concedes that his remaining contentions are foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve them for further review. First, the fact of a prior conviction need not be alleged in an indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Second, <em>Apprendi </em>did not render 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 facially uneonstitutional. <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-43\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
