Rodriguez contends that his counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, thereby prejudicing his defense. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-29\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petition under \u00a7 2255 <em>de novo. United States v. </em>Day, 285 F.3d 1167, 1169 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(9th Cir.2002). We review the factual findings of the district court for clear error. <em>United States v. Christakis, </em>238 F.3d 1164, 1168 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Rodriguez contends that his counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of the terms of the proposed plea and his sentencing exposure under the sentencing guidelines constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. In order to establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, Rodriguez must show (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). An attorney\u2019s performance is not \u201cdeficient\u201d unless it falls \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\u201d and \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The record reveals that Rodriguez\u2019s attorney explained the sentencing guidelines to him; informed Rodriguez of the government\u2019s plea offer several times; explained that the dismissal of the gun count had the effect of reducing any sentence by 60 months; and encouraged Rodriguez to accept the bargain. The district court found that Rodriguez\u2019s claims to the contrary were not credible, and we must accord \u201cspecial deference\u201d to that finding. <em>See Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). We therefore conclude that counsel\u2019s advice regarding the terms of the plea offer was not \u201cdeficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Rodriguez also contends that his counsel\u2019s failure to move for a new trial based on newly discovered impeachment evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel\u2019s failure to move for a new trial was not \u201cdeficient,\u201d however, because he investigated the relevant law and facts and reasonably concluded that a new trial would result in the same outcome. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (holding that strategic choices made by an attorney \u201cafter thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable\u201d). We agree with counsel\u2019s assessment, because the evidence against Rodriguez, including his own testimony, was strong enough to sustain his conviction even without the testimony of the two witnesses who claimed to have perjured themselves. Therefore, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue a new trial based on the impeachment evidence was neither deficient nor prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The judgment of the district court denying Rodriguez\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is accordingly AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b35-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit, except as provided by Ninth Cir.
