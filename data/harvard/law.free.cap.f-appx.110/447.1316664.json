Reyes argues for the first time on appeal that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As Reyes concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Reyes also argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), should be applied to sentences determined under the federal sentencing guidelines. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), but he raises it to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
