See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b360-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b360-24\">Randy Oliver appeals from his conviction and 188-month sentence pursuant to his guilty plea to possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-25\">Oliver raises a number of challenges to the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Pasguantino, </em>305 F.3d 291, 294 (4th Cir.2002). Oliver\u2019s assertions are not compelling. Oliver cannot establish the district court erred in rejecting his arguments regarding: the applicability of <em>United States v. Caron, </em>524 U.S. 308, 314-16, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998), to North Carolina\u2019s Felony Firearms Act (\u201cNCFFA\u201d), N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-415.1; Oliver\u2019s alleged lack of notice regarding his rights; entrapment by estoppel, <em>United States v. Clark, </em>986 F.2d 65, 69 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318, 320-21 (4th Cir.1991); the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws, <em>United States v. Farrow, </em>364 F.3d 551, 555 (4th Cir.2004); and the Rule of Lenity, <em>Caron, </em>524 U.S. at 316, 118 S.Ct. 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Oliver also contends the district court erred in sentencing him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000). Oliver, however, expressly waived his right to raise this sort of challenge to his appeal in his plea agreement, foreclosing this claim. <em>See United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Oliver\u2019s conviction and dismiss his appeal insofar as he attempts to challenge his sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
