Amey appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction over his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging his conviction on grounds of actual innocence. We review de novo, <em>Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir.1988), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Amey is incarcerated in the Central District of California but was convicted and sentenced in Kentucky. Prior to filing this challenge, the record indicates that Amey\u2019s murder conviction and 292-month sentence were affirmed in 1995 on appeal to the Sixth Circuit, and he had already filed one petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He was therefore prohibited by the AEDPA from filing another \u00a7 2255 petition, unless he first obtained certification from the Court of Appeals that his petition was premised on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">Absent that certification, Amey has couched his claim as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 on the ground that section 2255\u2019s remedy is inadequate or ineffective. His section 2241 petition contends that Amey is actually innocent of second degree murder because his conviction was based on the trial court\u2019s use of an erroneous jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">This court recently held that section 2255 provides the exclusive procedural mechanism by which a federal prisoner may test the legality of his detention, unless the petitioner demonstrates that he has never had an \u201cunobstructed procedural shot\u201d at presenting his claim. <em>Ivy v. Pontesso, </em>328 F.3d 1057, 1059 (9th Cir. 2003). The record here indicates that the jury instruction issue was raised in Amey\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction. <em>United States v. Amey, </em>1995 WL 696680, unpublished memorandum disposition (6th Cir. 1995). Accordingly, Amey has had the opportunity to raise his claim previously, and the district court properly dismissed his section 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
