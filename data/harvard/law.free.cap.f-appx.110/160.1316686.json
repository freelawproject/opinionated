Her state law claims alleged that CL breached an implied contract for bonus compensation and that she was entitled to additional payment for the value of her services under the <em>quantum meruit </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, construing all evidence in connection with the motion in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Horvath v. Westport Library Ass\u2019n, </em>362 F.3d 147, 151 (2d Cir.2004). The Court will affirm a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc., </em>223 F.3d 62, 68 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">For the reasons stated by the district court in its decision and order, we agree that CL is entitled to summary judgment. We have also considered all of Ferrand\u2019s other arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>CL\u2019s motion and dismissing Ferrand\u2019s complaint is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
