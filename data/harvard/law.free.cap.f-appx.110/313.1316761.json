Concessi seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. In civil actions in which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, all parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). These time periods \u201care mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">The district court\u2019s order denying Concessi\u2019s motion was entered on October 30, 2003. Concessi\u2019s notice of appeal was dated December 30, 2003, one day outside the sixty-day appeal period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Along with his notice of appeal, Concessi submitted a letter that appears to argue that he had good cause for his late filing. We construe Concessi\u2019s letter as a motion to extend the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(5). <em>See Washington v. Bumgarner, </em>882 F.2d 899, 901 (4th Cir.1989); <em>Myers v. Stephenson, </em>781 F.2d 1036, 1038-39 (4th Cir.1986). Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court to determine whether Concessi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>has shown excusable neglect or good cause to warrant an extension of the appeal period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\">. Because Concessi was in prison, we construe the date he executed his notice of appeal as the earliest date on which it can be considered filed. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988); Fed. R.App. P. 4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-19\">. We express no opinion whether Concessi has made the requisite showing under Rule 4(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
