R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b803-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-22\">Linda Susanti, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001). To the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Susanti failed to file her asylum application within one year of entering the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We also lack jurisdiction over Susanti\u2019s contention that the IJ violated her due process rights by making an adverse credibility determination, by refusing to continue her hearing, and by requiring corroborating documents, because she failed to exhaust these issues before the BIA. <em>See Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a petitioner must exhaust \u201cdue process\u201d claims that are premised on procedural errors correctable by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Susanti failed to show that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted on account of an enumerated ground where she testified to being a victim of random acts of sexual harassment and general turmoil in Indonesia. <em>See Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816 (denying withholding of removal holding that \u201ceven for purposes of the less stringent asylum standard, the applicant must show more than the existence of a generalized or random possibility of persecution in [their] native country.\u201d). Susanti\u2019s withholding of removal claim is further undercut by her testimony that her entire immediate and extended family continues to reside in Indonesia without incident. <em>See id. </em>at 816-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Contrary to Susanti\u2019s contention, the BIA clearly rejected the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749-50 (9th Cir.2004), Susanti\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b803-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
