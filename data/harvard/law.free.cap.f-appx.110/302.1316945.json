Hawkins was convicted of committing perjury in two criminal trials in which she testified for the defendant, Ahmad Perry, who is her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Hawkins raises three claims on appeal. First, she claims the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit certain lines of questioning to her treating physician and co-worker. Next, she maintains that the court erred in denying her motion for acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 at the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief. Lastly, she argues the court abused its discretion at sentencing in declining to authorize funds for defense counsel to retain a mental health expert pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l) (2000) and in denying her motion for a downward departure. For the following reasons, we affirm Hawkins\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">We find that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit Hawkins\u2019s treating physician and her coworker to present lay testimony as to Hawkins\u2019s emotional state. In addition, we find that substantial evidence supported Hawkins\u2019s jury convictions. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Littleton, </em>76 F.3d 614, 618 (4th Cir.1996). We therefore find that the district court did not err in denying Hawkins\u2019s Rule 29 motion for acquittal. <em>See Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80; <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>1 F.3d 1430, 1437 (4th Cir.1993). Finally, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to authorize funds for defense counsel to retain a mental health expert as unnecessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l) (2000) and in denying her motion for a downward departure based primarily on diminished capacity-</p>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">Accordingly, we affirm Hawkins\u2019s convictions and sentence. We also grant Hawkins\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental brief asserting that <em>Blakely v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), invalidates her sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines. On August 2, 2004, we entered an order in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3121, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193), concluding that <em>Blakely </em>did not affect the validity of a sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines. Thus, after reviewing the defendant\u2019s supplemental brief, we find no plain error under <em>Blakely </em>occurred in imposing Hawkins\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
