Carter asserts that his sentence of 165 months\u2019 imprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proportionality principle. He further claims that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">Carter\u2019s sentence was enhanced, consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender provisions, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, to reflect his eight prior convictions, which include four felony convictions. He did not raise the issue of Eighth Amendment proportionality below, and so we review for plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>352 F.3d 654, 664 (2d Cir.2003) (plain error review requires (1) an error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">It is hard for us to see, given our holdings in <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>932 F.2d 1027, 1028-29 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam), and <em>United States v. Santos, </em>64 F.3d 41, 46 (2d Cir.1995), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>516 U.S. 1156, 116 S.Ct. 1038, 134 L.Ed.2d 186 (1996), how a sentence of this sort, based as it is on his long record of recidivism, could be erroneous. Even if it were, the cases on which Carter relies, <em>see Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 20-21, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (plurality), <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 72-73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003), and <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (plurality), create no basis whatsoever for viewing the error as plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">Carter\u2019s Sixth Amendment challenge is also unavailing. In <em>United States v. Mincey, </em>380 F.3d 102 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam), our Circuit held that \u201c[ujnless and until the Supreme Court rules otherwise, the law in this Circuit remains as stated\u201d in prior cases upholding the validity of the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>380 F.3d at 106, *11. Following <em>Mincey, </em>we reject Carter\u2019s <em>Blakelybased </em>challenge to the constitutionality of the Guidelines and to the validity of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fan-fan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We have considered all of Carter\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
