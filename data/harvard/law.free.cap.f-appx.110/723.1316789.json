Howe Developmental Center for race discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Marshall\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants (1) discriminated against her on the basis of her race because they faded to respond to her complaints regarding a co-worker\u2019s threats and (2) retaliated against her by disciplining her and withholding a promotion. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and Marshall appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-21\">On appeal, Marshall for the first time asserts that the defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her sex and subjected her to a hostile work environment. Issues not raised before the district court, however, are waived on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Grayson v. O\u2019Neill, </em>308 F.3d 808, 817 (7th Cir.2002). Further, Marshall\u2019s brief on appeal does not address the race discrimination and retaliation claims that she pursued in the district court, and any arguments regarding those claims are also waived. <em>Hildebrandt v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>347 F.3d 1014, 1025 n. 6 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Robin v. Espo Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>200 F.3d 1081, 1088 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
