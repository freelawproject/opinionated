He was smuggled into this country in January 1999 and removal proceedings commenced on March 20, 2001. After a hearing, an Immigration Judge (IJ) found petitioner not credible and on the merits rejected his claims for asylum and protection under Article 3 of the United Nations\u2019 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16, 208.18. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed on August 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-25\">Petitioner appeals the ruling based on the Convention Against Torture, conceding that his claim for asylum was barred as untimely pursuant to the one-year limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-26\">Petitioner testified that in 1996 he became involved in an altercation when he protested the authorities\u2019 action in forcing his aunt to have an abortion. He was beaten and confined for one day. In addition, he was penalized by being denied the right to attend school and was threatened with being summoned for further interrogation. Petitioner then went into hiding for the next three years. He asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>authorities came to his mother\u2019s home and asked about his whereabouts on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Petitioner fears that if he is removed to China he will be imprisoned and abused. He relies on <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055 (3d Cir.1997) to support his claim. This case is distinguishable because there a breach of China\u2019s state security laws was involved. Rather, we conclude that the situation here is similar and more akin to that in <em>Li v. INS, </em>92 F.3d 985 (9th Cir. 1996). Here, the petitioner\u2019s confrontation with local authorities does not appear likely to cause him, on his return, to be singled out for brutality, either physical or economic.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We are not persuaded that the IJ\u2019s findings of credibility lack substance in the record. Our review of the transcript does not establish that the petitioner has met his burden of showing that the findings were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
