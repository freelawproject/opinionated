Dowd, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b634-17\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b634-18\">DOWD, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b634-19\">Patrice Donaldson, the defendant-appellant, charged in a multi-defendant case with conspiring with intent to possess and distribute heroin and cocaine, was found guilty after a three-day jury trial. The testimony in the trial was completed on the second day of the trial. The government\u2019s opening statement identified its three witnesses, Anthony Burns, Terese Burns and Steven Harris, all co-defendants in the multi-defendant conspiracy. Their testimony, if deemed credible by the jury, was sufficient to support Donaldson\u2019s conviction. The jury found Donaldson responsible for one kilogram or more of heroin and 500 or more grams of cocaine. Donaldson received a life sentence based on two prior felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-20\">The primary issues raised on appeal challenge the district court\u2019s handling of the series of verbal outbursts by Donaldson in the presence of the jury during the trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-21\">Before we consider the district court\u2019s response to Donaldson\u2019s outbursts in front of the jury, we note that no claim is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>that the evidence was insufficient to support Donaldson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Donaldson\u2019s first outburst came as soon as the first government witness, Anthony Burns, provided incriminating testimony. The following colloquy took place in the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Q. Can you give us \u2014 you don\u2019t have to list everybody, but some of the names of the people who were working with you who were located here in Detroit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">A. Yes. There was Steven Harris, David Wynn, Christopher Lewis, a few others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">Q. Okay. Terese Burns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">Q. That\u2019s your sister?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">A. That is my sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">Q. Ricky Burns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">A. Yes. That\u2019s my brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">Q. They are both charged in this ease also; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">A. Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-16\">Q. Who were some of the people who were located in New York who were working with you on this enterprise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaA\">A. There was Patrick Donaldson; Elvis, I don\u2019t have no last name; Novus, no last name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-17\">MR. DONALDSON: You\u2019re lying man. He\u2019s sitting up here lying on me, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\">MR. GUREWITZ: Your Honor, I would ask that you instruct the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzXV\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson, you will have the opportunity through your attorney to challenge this witness. So please wait until that time. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-19\">MR. DONALDSON: I\u2019m looking at life in prison. He\u2019s trying to give me life in prison and he\u2019s sitting up here lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-20\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-21\">Thank you. You may continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">Tr\u201e Vol. I at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">The next outburst soon followed, still during the direct examination of Anthony Burns in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-24\">Q. And what about Patrick Donaldson, did he engage in credit transactions with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-25\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-26\">Q. In what way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-27\">A. He fronted us some drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-28\">Q. Okay. For payment later?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-29\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-30\">MR. DONALDSON: Did I ever give you drugs, man? Are you going to lie on me, man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-31\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-32\">MR. DONALDSON: I\u2019m facing life and he\u2019s going to lie. You know I never gave you no drugs, and you\u2019re going to sit up there and lie, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-33\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson. You may approach, Mr. Gurewitz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZ\">(Bench conference held out of the hearing of the jury, between the Com\u00ed and counsel, on the record as follows:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agh\">MR. GUREWITZ: Your Honor, I don\u2019t think that Mr. Donaldson is doing this intentionally. I think he is just having some difficulty controlling himself. Maybe a break might be appropriate to talk with him separately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-35\">MR. CHADWELL: I don\u2019t object to a break.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-36\">THE COURT: How strenuously do you object to his outbursts? I think the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-37\">MR. CHADWELL: I\u2019m not asking that he be gagged or anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\">THE COURT: No. I\u2019m wondering if we even need a break. Do you think he needs a break to calm down, Mr. Gurewitz, or do you think by having this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>conversation he has the time to calm down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">I will trust your judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">MR. GUREWITZ: Really \u2014 just after the first one he apologized to me, and I think he had realized that he had made a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">THE COURT: Why don\u2019t you just bring him up to sidebar if you have no objection to that or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">MR. GUREWITZ: I would rather not call anymore attention to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">The juror in the front row in the white shirt just stood. I don\u2019t know if that means he has a question or not for the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">THE COURT: No. I just told them they could have a break.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">Do you want to have a break, Mr. Gurewitz? It is your call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">MR. GUREWITZ: I just don\u2019t want to call any undue attention to it. I\u2019m concerned that it is going to happen again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">THE COURT: If it happens again, we\u2019ll take a break.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-14\">(End of Bench conference.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">Tr., Vol. I at 85-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">The third statement of the defendant, still during the direct examination of Anthony Burns, expressed relief on the part of the defendant in the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">BY MR. CHADWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-17\">Q. Why did your sister introduce you to Patrick Donaldson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-18\">A. So we could hook up on some drugs. Q. Okay. What was Patrick Donaldson\u2019s role in your operation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-19\">A. Pretty much the supply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-20\">Q. Of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-21\">A. Of heroin\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-22\">Q. What about cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-23\">A. \u2014pretty much. We tried to arrange some cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-24\">Q. You never actually got cocaine from him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-25\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-26\">Q. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-27\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-28\">MR. DONALDSON: Thank God.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-29\">Tr., Vol I at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-30\">Donaldson again commented on the testimony of Anthony Burns in the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-31\">BY MR. CHADWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-32\">Q. What\u2019s the least amount \u2014 based upon your knowledge and experience, in your opinion, having seen the heroin and having taken delivery of it, what\u2019s the absolute minimum amount that that would have been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-33\">A. I would have to say 300 grams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-34\">Q. 300 grams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-35\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-36\">Q. And how did you know that this heroin came from Patrick Donaldson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-37\">A. First of all, I talked to him about it, and it was his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-38\">It belonged to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-39\">MR. DONALDSON: That\u2019s a lie, man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">Tr., Vol I at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-40\">Donaldson\u2019s final comment during the testimony of Anthony Burns came in the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-41\">Q. Did he have any other of his associates present with him when he met with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-42\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-43\">Q. Who were they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-44\">A. That was Elvis. I don\u2019t know his last name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>MR. DONALDSON: That\u2019s who gave you the drags.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Tr., Yol I at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">On the second day of the trial, the second government witness, co-defendant Terese Burns, testified on direct examination and incriminated the defendant. Again, as soon as the witness incriminated the defendant, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">Did you meet Patrick face-to-face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">Q. How many times have you met Patrick face to face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">A. Seven times or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">MR. DONALDSON: Why are you lying? Why are you sitting there lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuY\">BY MR. CHADWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">Q. Did any of those meetings occur outside the state of Michigan or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-13\">MR. DONALDSON: She\u2019s lying on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahz\">A. I didn\u2019t hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-14\">MR. CHADWELL: Your Honor, I would ask that you instruct the Defendant to speak quiet enough to have a question and answer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-15\">THE COURT: You may continue. I think Mr. Donaldson knows the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-16\">Mr. Donaldson\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-17\">MR. DONALDSON: I\u2019m looking at life in prison, Your Honor, and this woman is lying on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-18\">I didn\u2019t give you no drugs to see. Tell them about Marque. That is what you need to do, is tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-19\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-22\">MR. DONALDSON: I\u2019m not going to sit here and let ya\u2019ll bury me. The only reason\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-23\">THE COURT: Will counsel approach the bench, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-24\">MR. DONALDSON: Excuse me, Your Honor. Your Honor? I just found out yesterday my sister was in the World Trade Center bombing and she almost got burned in that disaster. I apologize for this outbreak but this\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtS\">THE COURT: You may sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-25\">MR. DONALDSON: But this has kind of taken a toll on my life here. I\u2019m just letting you know that she just escaped from death. I haven\u2019t seen her in over four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-26\">(Bench conference held out of the hearing of the jury, between the Court and counsel), on the record as follows: THE COURT: Are we ready?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-27\">I figure if he has about 40 seconds to cool down, he will get himself back under control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-28\">MR. GUREWITZ: Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-29\">THE COURT: Go on, Mr. Gurewitz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-30\">(Mr. Donaldson continues to make comments in open court, which were not recorded on the record, at the same time the side bar conference between the Court and counsel is being conducted on the record.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-31\">MR. GUREWITZ: I thought about having a discussion with him and telling him that you\u2019ve got the authority to have him taken out of the courtroom during the trial. But I\u2019m not sure if that will set him off even more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>THE COURT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at this point. And I just hope that \u2014 and I know you\u2019ve explained to him that he has already hurt himself by letting the jury hear his voice and compare it to the tapes. And that\u2019s the risk he\u2019s taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">I think if we just wait about another minute here, he\u2019ll have calmed down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">MR. GUREWITZ: He told me that he had a hard night. He didn\u2019t feel well. In fact, I did tell him yesterday \u2014 I talked to his sister yesterday, who told me that she was in the World Trade Center on the 34th floor, and had to walk down the stairs and was able to get out, and the ambulance she had gotten out of collapsed. He is upset, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">THE COURT: Okay. I am going to excuse the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">(End of bench conference.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">MR. DONALDSON: My sister had to face the disaster in the World Trade Center bombing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">THE COURT: We are going to take a recess. The jury should go to the jury room. We\u2019ll take a break for ten minutes. Remember, don\u2019t talk to each other about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">(Jury leaves the courtroom at 9:23 a.m.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">THE COURT: Everyone may be seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">Witness, you may take a ten-minute break also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-13\">THE WITNESS: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-14\">THE COURT: Please be back here at 25 to ten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-15\">(Witness leaves the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-16\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson, you\u2019re not helping yourself. I understand the trauma of finding out that your sister was almost killed in the World Trade Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-17\">MR. DONALDSON: Your Honor, I am facing time on a wrongful conviction. These people are trying to bury me some more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-18\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson, you have a chance of getting an acquittal in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-19\">MR. DONALDSON: I can\u2019t see that from this lying testimony. The jury believes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-20\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know what the jury believes, but I can tell you that your outbursts are not helping your case for two reasons. One, the obvious reason of they are going to maybe like you less because of your outbursts; and the other probably equal reason, if part of the Government\u2019s case has to do with tapes, now the jury has heard your voice. But that was your choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-21\">I would suggest you limit the damage by trying to control yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-22\">MR. DONALDSON: I promise I will not do it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-23\">THE COURT: Well, I would like to believe you and I do believe you. But you have to do better than that. Your life is on the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-24\">MR. DONALDSON: I have a medical condition. After counsel broke the news to me, I was refused aspirins or Tylenol. I have a reversible colostomy, and I also have a bullet in my lung that I am suffering from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-25\">If Your Honor would look into the first case from \u201996 when this incident all started, the only reason why the Government is prosecuting me is because their office falsified my case against me from the \u201997 case. And I raised these issues, and they have yet to respond to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-26\">So, they come now with an indictment \u2014 they got the indictment over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>turned, and they come with a superseding indictment. And I am supposed to sit here and let them put all the burden on. I am not going to sit here and let them do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">THE COURT: Mr. Donaldson, the last thing I am going to hold you to is what you said. And that is that there would be no more outbursts in front of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">MR. DONALDSON: I\u2019ll do that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASZ\">THE COURT: So, calm down. We will have somebody bring some aspirins to you if you need that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">MR. DONALDSON: I appreciate that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">THE COURT: We are going to take a break for a few minutes, and I will have somebody bring some aspirin to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">(Recess taken.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">(Jury enters courtroom at 9:38 a.m.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">Tr., Yol II at 42-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The primary claim advanced by Donaldson is that the district court had a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to stop the trial and conduct an additional competency hearing after the repeated outbursts. We review such a claim for clear error and we find no such error. The options available to a trial judge when confronted with a disruptive defendant were discussed in <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). Justice Black, writing for the court, provided directions to trial courts confronted with disruptive defendants as he opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-12\">It is essential to the proper administration of criminal justice that dignity, order, and decorum be the hallmarks of all court proceedings in our country. The flagrant disregard in the courtroom of elementary standards of proper conduct should not and cannot be tolerated. <em>We believe trial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the circumstances of each case. No one formula for maintaining the appropriate courtroom atmosphere will be best in all situations. </em>We think there are at least three constitutionally permissible ways for a trial judge to handle an obstreperous defendant like Allen: (1) bind and gag him, thereby keeping him present; (2) cite him for contempt; (3) take him out of the courtroom until he promises to conduct himself properly. Emphasis added.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">In this case, the district court elected to counsel Donaldson rather than select one of the more onerous possibilities described in <em>Allen, supra. </em>The district court advised Donaldson, in the absence of the jury, that his outbursts were not helping him.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">We find that the options available to the trial court when confronted with a disruptive defendant must, of necessity, be subject to the discretion of the trial court who is in a far better position than a reviewing court to select a sanction best suitable to the unique situation. The record in this case is devoid of any error, clear or otherwise, in the careful manner in which the district court handled the repeated outbursts of Donaldson. We reject Donaldson\u2019s appellate argument that the district court, on the strength of this record, was required to stop the trial and conduct an additional competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">A review of the record indicates that Donaldson, in front of the jury, and without testifying, challenged the testimony of two of the three witness against him. Moreover, he advised the jury of the severe sentence he was facing and attempted to enlist the sympathy of the jury because his sister\u2019s life was threatened in the Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tember 11, 2001 destruction in New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We find no basis for disagreement with the district court\u2019s observation that Donaldson\u2019s outbursts were strategic as opposed to those of a defendant suffering from a competency deficiency. In denying the motion for a new trial, the district court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">And while counsel has argued that his mental state made it impossible for him to assist counsel, nothing that I saw during the trial would indicate that, except for what had been referred to, the outbursts. And the only time there were outbursts, there were several of them, but they were, as the Government has indicated, strategically appropriate in the sense that Mr. Donaldson was able to present to the jury his view that these witnesses were lying without having to be cross-examined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">JA at 283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Donaldson seeks a new trial based on flagrant prosecutorial misconduct based primarily on the government\u2019s final argument. Donaldson\u2019s voice was an issue as evidence involving wiretaps was introduced with witnesses identifying the voice as that of Donaldson. Against that background, in final argument the government\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">Well, his testimony is corroborated by two other witnesses, for starters. It\u2019s corroborated by the tapes, right? You heard him on the tapes. He has this whole scenario where Patrick is passing messages through his sister. Well, you heard that was true for yourself, didn\u2019t you? He says he\u2019s engaged in cocaine\u2014 in heroin transactions with Patrick. You heard that on the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">You don\u2019t even have to rely on him to know that was Patrick\u2019s voice, because Mr. Donaldson chose to scream out at various times in the trial, and you had the opportunity to hear his voice and his distinctive Jamaican accent, which you can also hear on the tape. You can hear it for yourself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">JA at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Donaldson alleges prosecutorial misconduct in that argument as he did not testify and moved for a new trial on the basis of the government\u2019s argument. The district court denied the motion based on the invitation of the government to compare the voice on the tapes with that of Donaldson as heard in the courtroom because the characteristics of speech, tone of voice, accent and the like are not protected by the Fifth Amendment. (JA at page 284, lines 6-9). We agree with the district court and find no merit in the claim of flagrant prosecutorial misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">The defendant was serving a 71-month federal sentence when indicted in this case. The indictment was returned on May 11, 1999, but the defendant was not arraigned until October 25, 2000 and his jury trial commenced on October 2, 2001. The defendant moved for a dismissal of the indictment based on pre-arraignment delay. The motion was denied by the district court during a hearing conducted on April 2, 2001. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, but without prejudice to a renewal of the motion if the defendant was able to \u201cshow actual prejudice in preparing for the trial, if you can show witnesses that have banished [sic] or become unavailable because of the delay or something of that nature.\u201d JA at 81. No claim is advanced that Donaldson was denied a statutory speedy trial nor did he renew his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>motion to dismiss for pre-arraignment delay. Thus, we find no error in the denial of the motion to dismiss for pre-arraignment delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the life sentence based on the conviction involving the quantity of the heroin and cocaine plus the fact of the two prior felony drug convictions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. This contention has been addressed and rejected by this court. See <em>United States v. Hill, </em>30 F.3d 48, 50-51 (6th Cir.1994) and <em>United States v. Flowal, </em>163 F.3d 956, 963 (Sixth Cir.1998)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-22\">. The competency of the defendant was raised pre-trial and again post-trial.
