We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The IJ found clear and convincing evidence to support the conclusion that Zhen was inadmissible at the time of entry because he had committed marriage fraud, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), and so was removable, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A). The IJ also concluded that the preponderance of the evidence supported the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cINS\u201d) conclusion that Zhen entered a marriage for the purpose of procuring admission as an immigrant, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1186a(b)(l), and that termination of Zhen\u2019s status as a conditional permanent resident was thus appropriate. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). As the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, \u201cthe IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final agency decision, and ... [this court] scrutinize^] the IJ\u2019s decision as [it] would a decision by the BIA itself.\u201d <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 855 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">We can grant Zhen\u2019s petition for review only if \u201ca reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find that the facts supported a finding that [Zhen] fulfilled [his] marital agreement and that [his] marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring [his] admission as an immigrant.\u201d <em>Nakamoto v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 874, 883 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see also Damon v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining application of substantial evidence standard in marriage fraud cases). Zhen has presented no evidence that compels such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">Hamel described with particularity the plan for her sham marriage to Zhen and how the plan was carried out. The IJ credited Hamel\u2019s account of the relevant facts, concluding that Hamel was \u201cbasically [Zhen\u2019s] visa to the United States.\u201d The evidence presented by Zhen, including income tax returns, affidavits, rent receipts, and photographs, was all adequately accounted for by Hamel\u2019s account of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">As Zhen presented no evidence compelling us to question the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, we deny Zhen\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b826-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. able for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.
