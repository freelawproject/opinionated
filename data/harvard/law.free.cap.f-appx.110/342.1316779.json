To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Jones fails to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\"> Because petitioner appeals only her asylum claim, we do not consider her applications for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
