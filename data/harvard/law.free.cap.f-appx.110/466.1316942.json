He argues that the dismissal was erroneous because the district court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 as he has recently moved to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The district court lacked the authority to assume jurisdiction over Mann\u2019s attempt to modify the terms of a state-court child custody order. <em>See Rykers v. Alford, </em>832 F.2d 895, 900 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also Chrissy F. by Medley v. Miss. Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>995 F.2d 595, 599 (5th Cir.1993). The appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). We caution Mann that the filing of frivolous appeals and motions will invite the imposition of a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
