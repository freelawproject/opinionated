After carefully reviewing the briefs and record below, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision, essentially for the reasons set out in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s October 31, 2003, Report and Recommendation. We add only that, contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, neither Dr. Grafs opinion that claimant\u2019s impairment was equivalent to a listed impairment, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, nor Dr. Holzaepfel\u2019s finding that claimant could lift no more than ten pounds are entitled to controlling weight. Both of the cited conclusions are plainly inconsistent with or unsupported by contemporaneous findings made by the same and other physicians. <em>Cf. Prince v. Bowen, </em>894 F.2d 283, 285-86 (8th Cir.1990). The Commissioner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">In light of our conclusion, we find it unnecessary to address the Commissioner\u2019s contention that claimant\u2019s amendment of the alleged onset date limited the period under review to a single day. We also decline to address claimant\u2019s arguments concerning the appropriate weight to afford disability determinations of other agencies, as this argument was not presented to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\"><em>Affirmed. </em>See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
