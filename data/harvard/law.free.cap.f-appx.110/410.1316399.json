I.N.S., </em>514 U.S. 386, 395, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition challenges only the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. Our review is limited to whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying that motion. <em>See Osuchukwu v. I.N.S., </em>744 F.2d 1136, 1141 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Lin maintains the BIA failed to apply the three-prong analysis set forth in <em>Matter of A-S-, </em>211. &amp; N. Dec. 1106,1998 WL 99553 (BIA 1998), when it deferred to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. The BIA deferred to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination after examining the inconsistencies and implausibilities in Lin\u2019s testimony, applications, and statement to the Immigration Officer. Further, contrary to Lin\u2019s contention, the BIA specifically cited <em>Matter ofA-S- </em>in support of its determination. It goes without saying that our court does not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA or the IJ with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the ultimate findings based on credibility determinations. <em>See Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir. 1994). Therefore, Lin\u2019s having failed to identify a legal or factual error in the BIA\u2019s prior decision, he has failed to demonstrate that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
