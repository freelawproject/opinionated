The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343. Appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over an order granting summary judgment and \u201capply the same test employed by a district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).\u201d <em>Curley v. Klem, </em>298 F.3d 271, 276 (3d Cir.2002). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">Carr was a passenger in the rear seat of a vehicle that was stopped by Officer Popovic for several traffic violations. After the stop was effected, Officer Popovie observed a white powdery substance in a plastic bag tucked in the seat pocket in front of Carr. The occupants of the vehicle were ordered to exit and a subsequent pat down search revealed the presence of drugs on Carr\u2019s person. Although Carr was arrested for several drug offenses, the charges were dropped when laboratory analysis failed to detect a controlled substance in the plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">Carr filed suit alleging that his arrest was unlawful. He challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>whether there was a legitimate basis for the initial stop. In a thorough memorandum opinion, the District Judge concluded that Carr\u2019s arrest was not invalid. With regard to the initial stop, the District Court noted that the officer had based his stop on three traffic violations. Although Carr disputed the officer\u2019s assertion that the vehicle had failed to come to a complete stop, Carr had not denied that there was a turn signal violation and \u201che was not in a position to deny the t[emporary]-tag violation.\u201d Accordingly, the Court ruled that the initial stop was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">Carr asserts that the District Court erred because he did dispute the T-tag violation, contending that Pennsylvania did not have a statute or rule for the alleged T-tag violation. Carr\u2019s argument is without merit. Title 67 of the Pennsylvania Administrative Code contains the regulation at issue. 67 Pa.Code \u00a7 47.4(c). Moreover, it is clear that a failure to use a turn signal is a violation of Pennsylvania law. 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3334. Accordingly, Officer Popovie had a lawful basis for making the stop. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
