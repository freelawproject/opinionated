In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir.2004), we held that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), such a practice is unconstitutional. Therefore the petition for rehearing is GRANTED, and the case is remanded to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. See United States v. Shearer, </em>379 F.3d 453, 455 (7th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>379 F.3d 425, 427 (7th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Ohlinger, </em>377 F.3d 785, 787 (7th Cir. 2004).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b730-23\">RIPPLE, <em>Circuit Judge,</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJq\">dissenting. I would hold this case until the Supreme Court decides the issues presently before it in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir.2004). I see nothing to be gained by compounding the already existing chaos caused by <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington, - U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) in sending this case back to the docket of a busy district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
