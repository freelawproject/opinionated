After denial of the petition, Petitioner filed several motions related to his habeas case, which the district court reviewed in 2001. On August 28, 2001, the district court issued an order denying the motions because full consideration had been given to Petitioner\u2019s claims. At that time, Petitioner was advised that his case was closed and that no further papers would be accepted for filing without leave of the court. Then, in the motion underlying the current appeal, Petitioner again sought to re-open his closed habeas case. The district court denied the motion and repeated its order that no further papers would be accepted for filing without leave of the court. Petitioner appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court did not act on the issue of certificate of appealability; therefore, it is deemed denied. Petitioner then applied to this court for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2004). To do so, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Petitioner\u2019s brief raises an issue which satisfies our standard for the grant of a certificate of appealability. For substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court in its Order of April 2, 2004, we cannot say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Appellant\u2019s motion to file an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED. The motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-15\">. We note that this case has a long filing history in both the district court and on appeal. This is Petitioner's sixth appeal to this court related to the underlying district court case 95-CV-940.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
