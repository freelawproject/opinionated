Fassler (\u201cFassler\u201d or \u201cappellant\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>of his motion to strike special conditions of parole. Fassler argues that the United States Parole Commission\u2019s (the \u201cCommission\u201d or \u201cappellee\u201d) special parole conditions violated the district court\u2019s and this court\u2019s orders; they were arbitrary and capricious; and they were imposed vindictively.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Appellee contends that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the district court did not have jurisdiction when it granted Fassler\u2019s motion for release and denied his motion to strike. Whether a district court has jurisdiction over a \u00a7 2241 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. See Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, </em>232 F.3d 1042, 1044 (9th Cir.2000). It is well-established that a court has inherent power to enforce its orders. <em>See, e.g., Shillitani v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 370, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966); <em>United States v. Yacoubian, </em>24 F.3d 1, 5 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Hook v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>972 F.2d 1012, 1014 (9th Cir.1992). Here, the district court had inherent jurisdictional power to render a decision on Fassler\u2019s motion because it involved alleged non-compliance with its prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Commission also claims that jurisdiction is lacking because Fassler faded to exhaust his administrative remedies. Exhaustion is a judicially created prerequisite to filing for habeas relief in parole cases. <em>See Martinez v. Roberts, </em>804 F.2d 570, 571 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Brown v. Rison, </em>895 F.2d 533, 535 (9th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 54-55, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995). Therefore, \u201cthe district court must determine whether to excuse the faulty exhaustion and reach the merits, or require the petitioner to exhaust his administrative remedies before proceeding in court.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>895 F.2d at 535. The district court reached the merits when presented with Fassler\u2019s motion; therefore, it effectively excused the failure to exhaust. Furthermore, Fassler subsequently exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is reviewed <em>de novo. See Hunter v. Ayers, </em>336 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.2003). This court reviews the Parole Commission\u2019s interpretations of law <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Kleeman v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>125 F.3d 725, 730 (9th Cir.1997). Review of the Commission\u2019s decisions is limited to a determination of \u201cwhether the Commission exceeded its statutory authority or acted so arbitrarily as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Benny v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>295 F.3d 977, 981 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Fassler contends that the Commission\u2019s special parole conditions violate \u201claw of the case\u201d principles, because prior court orders established that the Commission could only consider Fassler\u2019s failure to report an arrest when imposing parole penalties. For the law of the case doctrine to apply, the issue in question must have been \u201cdecided explicitly or by necessary implication in th[e] court\u2019s previous disposition.\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. EEOC, </em>691 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.1982). The prior orders were limited to deciding the proper bases for parole revocation. Fassler\u2019s present motion challenges -the Commission\u2019s special conditions of parole \u2014 not parole revocation. The law of the case doctrine is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Fassler next argues that the Commission\u2019s special parole conditions lack a rational basis; therefore, they are arbitrary and capricious and should be stricken. Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, a reviewing court must consider whether an agency\u2019s decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>whether there has been a clear error of judgment. <em>See Envtl. Def. Ctr., Inc. v. EPA </em>344 F.3d 832, 858 n. 36 (9th Cir.2003). The challenged conditions are upheld if the Commission\u2019s record provides a rational basis for the decision. <em>Bagley v. Harvey, </em>718 F.2d 921, 925 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The Commission can impose special conditions of release if the \u201ccondition is necessary to protect the public from further crimes ... and to provide adequate supervision.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.40(b)(1); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.204(b)(1). Special parole conditions must also be reasonably related to the offense\u2019s nature and circumstances and the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1). Additionally, the conditions imposed cannot involve a \u201cgreater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\u201d to effectuate the goals of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Under the special parole condition, Fassler is prohibited from contact with minor children absent his Probation Officer\u2019s approval. The Commission imposed the condition as a result of appellant\u2019s inappropriate conduct with a minor child. This court noted, in its October 4, 2002 order, that the record showed Fassler touched a minor child\u2019s \u2018pubic area\u2019 and took nude photos of her. <em>Fassler v. Pendleton, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 627, 629 (9th Cir. 2002). Thus, the Commission had a legitimate concern Fassler might commit similar acts with children. The sex offender conditions are not remote in time to the alleged improper conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and are reasonably related to the nature of Fassler\u2019s improper conduct and to the Commission\u2019s public safety and supervision goals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">The Commission predicated the employment special conditions on Fassler\u2019s 2001 disciplinary actions for conducting a business while incarcerated. The record of Fassler\u2019s institutional violations shows that he is willing to incur substantial consequences for a pecuniary benefit and lacks the discipline to comport with imposed conditions and rules. The employment limitations are reasonably related to appellant\u2019s illegal custodial conduct, the Commission\u2019s interest in public safety, and Fassler\u2019s rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Finally, appellant argues that the Commission\u2019s special conditions were imposed vindictively because he successfully litigated against the Commission. Allegations of actual or presumed vindictiveness constitute a due process challenge; therefore, <em>de novo </em>review is required. <em>See Bono v. Benov, </em>197 F.3d 409, 411-12 (9th Cir.1999). This court extended the vindictiveness presumption to parole decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The presumption of vindictiveness applies only \u201cwhere there is a \u2018reasonable likelihood\u2019 that the parole decision is the product of actual vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Fenner v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>251 F.3d 782, 788 (9th Cir.2001) (internal citation omitted). The Commission proffers reasonable and nonvindictive reasons for instituting the conditions of parole. In the absence of a reasonable likelihood that the Commission acted vindictively, Fassler must prove actual vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>at 789. Because Fassler\u2019s allegations that the Commission violated law of the case principles and acted arbitrarily and capri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>ciously are without merit, he has not shown \u201cactual vindictiveness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b780-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">.

T.M., </em>330 F.3d 1235 (9th Cir.2003), we explained that \"supervised release conditions need <em>not </em>relate to the offense\u201d the parolee was convicted for as long as they meet the goals of deterrence, public protection, or rehabilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 1240 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
