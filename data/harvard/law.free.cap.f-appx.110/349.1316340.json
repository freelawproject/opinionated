California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising as potential issues whether the district court complied with Fed. R.Crim. P 11 in accepting Eaddy\u2019s guilty plea and whether the court erred in denying Eaddy a two-level decrease under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2002). Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Eaddy declined to do so. Eaddy, however, filed a Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) letter directing our attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-26\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court fully complied with Rule 11 and that Eaddy entered his plea knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. We also find that the court did not err in determining that Eaddy was not eligible for application of \u00a7 3E1.1 due to his failure to appear at jury selection. Finally, in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (No. 03-4253), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>72 U.S.L.W. 3121, \u2014 U.S. \u2014,S.Ct -, -L.Ed.2d-(U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193), Eaddy\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-30\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no m\u00e9rito<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>rious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Eaddy\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
