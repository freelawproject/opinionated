The BIA affirmed the removal order, and Tjandra petitioned this Court for review. After the denial by this Court of a motion to stay the order of removal, she was taken into custody pending her removal. Tjandra then filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for a writ of habeas corpus directing her custodian to explain why she should be kept in custody \u201cpending determination of her appeal in connection with her asylum case before the Court of Appeals.\u201d Petition at 17. That petition was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-19\">While her petition for review of the removal order and her appeal from the denial of a writ of habeas corpus were pending before this Court, the immigration authorities removed Tjandra from the United States. Thereafter, on March 22, 2004, her petition for review was denied by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-20\">We will enter an order dismissing Tjandra\u2019s appeal as moot. The only relief sought by her petition to the District Court was relief from custody pending disposition of her petition for review of her removal order. She is no longer in custody, and that petition is no longer pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-21\">This appeal will be dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
