It is assumed that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">We affirm the dismissal of the claims against the defendants in their individual capacities because they are entitled to qualified immunity. \u201c[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions ... are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Lattanzio does not allege that the individual defendants violated any federal statute or right guaranteed to him by the Constitution. <em>See R.R. Village Ass\u2019n v. Denver Sewer Corp., </em>826 F.2d 1197, 1201-02 (2d Cir.1987) (\u201cif state law makes the pertinent official action discretionary, one\u2019s interest in a favorable decision does not rise to the level of a property right entitled to procedural due process protection\u201d); Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 31-76a(a) (2003) (authorizing, but not requiring, the Connecticut Department of Labor to conduct hearings in nonpayment of wage investigations).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">The dismissal of Lattanzio\u2019s claim against the Department of Labor and the individual defendants in their official capacities, as well as his state law claims, is affirmed for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-19\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
