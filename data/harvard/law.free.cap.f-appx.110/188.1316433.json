Furthermore, we conclude that, construing the unamended complaint in plaintiffs favor, none of his claims are likely to survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">We have considered all of plaintiffs claims on appeal and we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
