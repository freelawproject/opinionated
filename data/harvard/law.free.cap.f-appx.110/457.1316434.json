He contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for suppression of evidence and dismissal of his indictment because his previous removal proceeding violated the Due Process Clause due to the immigration judge\u2019s failure to inform him of the possibility of discretionary relief from deportation; that the district court erred by treating his two state-court robbery convictions separately when calculating his criminal history score; and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Cruz-Perez\u2019s argument that his previous removal order violated the Due Process Clause is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, 537 </em>U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003). The district court\u2019s finding that Cruz-Perez\u2019s February 1995 robberies were not informally consolidated and were unrelated was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Buford v. United States, 532 </em>U.S. 59, 64-66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). Cruz-Perez\u2019s robberies were factually distinct, and they were neither formally nor informally consolidated in any manner recognized by this court. <em>See United States v. Huskey, </em>137 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>984 F.2d 143, 147 n. 18 (5th Cir. 1993). Finally, Cruz-Perez\u2019s argument regarding the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
