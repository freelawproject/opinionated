Simmons has appealed from the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion. <em>See United States v.

King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous is GRANTED. Simmons is warned that he will be subject to sanctions if he makes any further frivolous filings. APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
