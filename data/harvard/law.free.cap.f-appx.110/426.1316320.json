Yett pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Yett argues that a sentence enhancement for possession of a weapon constituted impermissible double counting in violation of Amendment 599. He asserts that Amendment 599 must be applied to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1, 2K2.4, and 2K2.5. Amendment 599, which amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, applies to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 929(a). Yett pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and his guideline sentencing range was computed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, based upon his drug conviction. Amendment 599 is irrelevant to his sentence, and his claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Yett also raises the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in support of his appeal. Yett\u2019s argument is not cognizable in the context of a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Yett\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
