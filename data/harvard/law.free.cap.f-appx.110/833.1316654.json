We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review Petitioners\u2019 due process contentions de novo. <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 599 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">The Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance violates due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">The Petitioners\u2019 contention that the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act should apply to them because they applied for asylum prior to the effective date of the permanent rules is foreclosed by <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1108 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-23\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2004), the Petitioners\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the motion for stay of removal was granted, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b863-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
