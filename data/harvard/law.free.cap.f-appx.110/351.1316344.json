On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal, but raising the following issue: whether Tyson\u2019s three previous convictions were properly considered separate violent crimes for purposes of sentencing him as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e)(1). Although informed of his right to do so, Tyson has failed to file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">We find that Tyson\u2019s three prior felonies were properly counted for purposes of the enhancement because each conviction arose out of a separate and distinct criminal episode, <em>United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 334-35 (4th Cir.1995), and because breaking and entering is considered a violent crime under the enhancement. <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>975 F.2d 1080, 1083-85 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that breaking and entering under North Carolina is considered a violent felony for career offender purposes). Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">We have examined the entire record in this case, in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We deny counsel\u2019s pending motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
