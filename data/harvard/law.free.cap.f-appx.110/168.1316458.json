Daniels, Judge), after a plea of guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute at least one kilogram of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Paghense moved for a downward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances. The district court considered Paghense\u2019s arguments and concluded that the circumstances were not sufficiently extraordinary to warrant a departure from the Guidelines range. The court therefore denied Paghense\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">On appeal, Paghense does not argue, nor do we find reason to conclude, that the district court misapprehended the scope of its authority or misinterpreted the law. \u201cA district court's decision not to depart is ordinarily not reviewable, unless the refusal is due to an erroneous interpretation of the law or an erroneous view of the extent of its departure authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Aponte, </em>235 F.3d 802, 803 (2d Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We decline Paghense\u2019s invitation to reconsider this precedent. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 154 (2d Cir.2001). We therefore have no authority to review the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">For the foregoing reason, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
