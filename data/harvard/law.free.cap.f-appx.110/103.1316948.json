Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>Civ. Action No. 98-699-KAJ, 2003 WL 21076779 (D.Del. May 9, 2003), <em>amended by NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>Civ. Action No. 98-699-KAJ (D.Del. July 30, 2003). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">NeoMagic owns the \u2019806 patent, which is directed to a graphics controller system that combines a graphics engine and video memory on a single integrated circuit for use in notebook computers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The invention prevents noise generated by the memory components in the semiconductor substrate from interfering with the graphics engine by, among other things, electrically isolating the analog components of the graphics engine in a well and then biasing the junction between the substrate and the well. In the preferred embodiment, the junction is reverse-biased by applying to the substrate a voltage that is less positive than the voltage applied to the well. Figure 5 of the \u2019806 patent provides a cross-sectional diagram of an analog component isolated in accordance with the claimed invention. It depicts a capacitor in a well (at a voltage VDD), which is formed in the semiconductor substrate (at a voltage VBb):</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The only claims at issue in this appeal derive from independent claims 7 and 18. Claim 7 recites a capacitor comprising, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cwell connected to a first power supply\u201d and a \u201csubstrate connected to a second power supply at a negative voltage with respect to said first power supply.\u201d Claim 18 in turn recites an integrated circuit comprising, <em>inter alia, </em>the capacitor disclosed in claim 7. Claims 9 and 13 depend from claim 7, while claims 20, 24, and 26 depend from claim 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Trident manufactures the Cyber 9388, 9520, 9525, 9540, and PV8 embedded memory graphics accelerators. Like the invention claimed in the \u2019806 patent, Trident\u2019s products isolate analog components from noise in the semiconductor substrate by placing them in wells. Trident\u2019s products apply a positive voltage YDD to the well and a ground voltage AVSS <em>(i.e., </em>zero volts) to the substrate. Trident\u2019s products additionally utilize a split-bias device to maintain certain current sources at constant values; the split-bias device connects to the gate of a capacitor over the BIAS signal line.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u00edn December 1998, NeoMagic filed suit against Trident for infringement of claims 7, 9, 13, 18, 20, 24, and 26 of the \u2019806 patent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After initially construing the disputed claim terms in May 2000, <em>NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>98 F.Supp.2d 538 (D.Del.2000), the district court granted Trident\u2019s motion for summary judgment of noninfringement in February 2001, <em>NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>129 F.Supp.2d 689 (D.Del.2001). In its summary judgment opinion, the court revisited two of its earlier claim constructions. It now interpreted the term \u201cpower supply\u201d to mean \u201ca source of electrical energy, such as a battery, that requires at least two power supply lines to deliver a constant voltage supply of power to an electrical circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696. It also construed the phrase \u201cnegative voltage with respect to\u201d to require the substrate to be tapped at a voltage of less than zero volts. <em>Id. </em>at 697. Applying those revised claim constructions, the court then concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the accused products\u2019 split-bias device is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>neither a \u201csecond power supply\u201d nor at \u201ca negative voltage with respect to\u201d a first power supply. <em>Id. </em>at 696-97. The court accordingly held that Trident was entitled to summary judgment of no literal infringement and no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. <em>Id. </em>at 697-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">On appeal, this court vacated and remanded. First, we adopted the district court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cpower supply\u201d to the extent that it required two supply lines to deliver power in an electrical circuit but, finding that the district court had improperly construed the term so as to exclude the accused products, remanded for further consideration of whether a \u201cpower supply\u201d must provide a constant voltage. <em>NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>287 F.3d 1062, 1073-74 (Fed.Cir.2002). Second, we construed the \u201cnegative voltage with respect to\u201d language to mean that the second power supply must have a voltage that is less positive than that of the first power supply, but need not have a voltage that is negative with respect to ground (i.e., zero volts). <em>Id. </em>at 1075. Having materially altered the district court\u2019s claim constructions, we vacated the summary judgment of noninfringement and remanded for further proceedings with respect to both claim construction and infringement. <em>Id. </em>at 1075-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On remand, the district court designated a magistrate judge to resolve the pending motions for summary judgment. The magistrate judge found no need to address whether the term \u201cpower supply\u201d calls for a constant output voltage and instead interpreted the term to require \u201cdehver[y of] power at a voltage to enable the junction between the well and the substrate to remain reverse-biased.\u201d <em>Neomagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>Civ. Action No. 98-699-KAJ, slip op. at 25, 2003 WL 21076779 (D.Del. May 9, 2003). Turning to the question of infringement, the magistrate judge then held that the accused products cannot infringe the \u2019806 patent because they do not have a \u201csecond power supply\u201d as recited in the claims. Initially, she explained that the accused products\u2019 split-bias device cannot be a \u201csecond power supply\u201d because its AVSS line grounds the substrate at zero volts and its BIAS line does not deliver power to the substrate. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. Upon Trident\u2019s motion for clarification, however, she modified her reasoning, explaining that the split-bias device cannot be a \u201csecond power supply\u201d because it does not influence the voltage of the well and does not enable the junction between the substrate and the well to remain reverse-biased. <em>NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>Civ. Action No. 98-699-KAJ, slip op. at 6-7 (D.Del. July 30, 2003) (amending the May 9, 2003 memorandum opinion). The magistrate judge thus granted Trident\u2019s motion for summary judgment of noninfringement, and the district court entered final judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>Civ. Action No. 98-699-KAJ (D.Del. Sept. 24, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">NeoMagic timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reapplying the same standard used by the district court. <em>Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., </em>149 F.3d 1309, 1315 (Fed.Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>swers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cThe evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A determination of infringement requires a two-step analysis. \u201cFirst, the court determines the scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted ... [and second,] the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing device.\u201d <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc) (citations omitted). Step one, claim construction, is a question of law, <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 970-71 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996), that we review <em>de novo, Cybor, </em>138 F.3d at 1456. Step two, comparison of the claims to the accused device, requires a determination that every claim limitation or its equivalent be found in the accused device. <em>Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 29, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997). That determination is a question of fact. <em>Bai v. L &amp; L Wings Inc., </em>160 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">On appeal, NeoMagic challenges the district court\u2019s summary judgment of noninfringement, charging that the court made errors in both its claim construction analysis and its infringement analysis. NeoMagic first contends that the court erred in reading the claims to require the two recited power supplies to reverse-bias the junction between the substrate and the well. NeoMagic further argues that the accused products\u2019 split-bias device is a \u201csecond power supply\u201d and thus that the accused products literally infringe the asserted claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Trident responds that the district court did not err in construing the \u201cpower supply\u201d limitations or in determining that the split-bias device cannot be a \u201csecond power supply\u201d because it does not contribute to the reverse-biasing of the substrate-well junction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We agree with Trident that the district court was correct to enter summary judgment of noninfringement because the accused products do not have a \u201csecond power supply\u201d as recited in the claims. We begin our analysis with the construction of the \u201cpower supply\u201d limitations. As we held in our earlier opinion, the term \u201cpower supply\u201d means, at minimum, \u201ca source of electrical energy ... that requires at least two power supply lines to deliver power in an electrical circuit.\u201d <em>NeoMagic, </em>287 F.3d at 1074 (omission in original). The question now before us is whether the recited power supplies must also \u201cdeliver power at a voltage to enable the junction between the well and the substrate to remain reverse-biased,\u201d as the district court concluded on remand. <em>Neomagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., </em>Civ. Action No. 98-699-KAJ, slip op. at 25, 2003 WL 21076779 (D.Del. May 9, 2003). We hold that they must.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">NeoMagic focuses its claim construction argument on the meaning of the term \u201cpower supply\u201d; however, the terms \u201cfirst power supply\u201d and \u201csecond power supply\u201d must be read in the context of the claim limitations of which they are a part. The relevant language in claims 7 and 18 reads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>as follows: \u201csaid ... well connected to a first power supply, and said substrate connected to a second power supply at a negative voltage with respect to said first power supply.\u201d The claims thus instruct that the well and the substrate must be connected to the respective power supplies at voltages necessary for reverse-biasing the junction between the substrate and the well (i.e., \u201cat a negative voltage with respect to said first power supply\u201d). Importantly, the claims refer to the voltages not of the substrate and the well, but of the power supplies to which they are connected. In so doing, the claims identify the power supplies as the sources of the substrate and well voltages and expressly link the two power supplies to the reverse-biased condition of the substrate-well junction. We therefore conclude that the first and second power supplies must apply voltages to the well and substrate, respectively, so as to enable the reverse-biasing of the substrate-well junction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">NeoMagic argues, however, that the district court erred in requiring each power supply, standing alone, to reverse-bias the substrate-well junction. Although the magistrate judge\u2019s claim construction analysis does not include such a requirement, her amended infringement analysis contains some statements that could be read to that effect. To avoid any misunderstanding on this point, we clarify that each power supply need not be capable of reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction by itself. Such a construction would be nonsensical in that it would effectively vitiate the second power supply in the context of the invention. Moreover, it would impermissibly exclude the specification\u2019s preferred embodiment, in which the first power supply is an external source that generates and applies to the well a positive voltage VDD, \u2019806 patent, col. 4, 11. 54-60 &amp; fig. 5, and the second power supply is an on-chip charge pump that generates and applies to the substrate a negative voltage VBB, <em>id., </em>col. 3,1. 64 to col. 4,1. 6 &amp; fig. 5. The preferred embodiment is thus one in which both power supplies are necessary to reverse-bias the junction, and the claims should be interpreted so as not to exclude that embodiment. We therefore reiterate that each power supply need not be capable of reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction on its own; rather, the first power supply and the second power supply must apply voltages to the well and the substrate, respectively, so as to establish and maintain the reverse-biased condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">NeoMagic further objects to the district court\u2019s construction of the \u201cpower supply\u201d limitations on the ground that it renders the \u201cnegative voltage with respect to\u201d language superfluous. NeoMagic asserts that the claims are silent regarding how the substrate-well junction is reverse-biased and that they only require the substrate to be at a voltage that is negative with respect to the voltage of the well. We disagree, for as noted above, the claims do not simply recite that the substrate voltage must be less positive than the well voltage; instead, they disclose the relative voltages of the substrate and the well by reference to the voltages of the power supplies to which they are connected. The \u201cpower supply\u201d and \u201cnegative voltage with respect to\u201d clauses thus serve two distinct purposes: the former establishes the sources of the well and substrate voltages, while the latter establishes the relative values of those voltages. As such, the district court\u2019s construction of the \u201cpower supply\u201d limitations \u2014 and ours\u2014 gives meaning to the \u201cpower supply\u201d and the \u201cnegative voltage with respect to\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not err in interpreting claims 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and 18 to require the two power supplies to contribute to reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction. Based on our reading of the claims and the specification, we hold that the \u201cfirst power supply\u201d and the \u201csecond power supply\u201d must deliver power to the well and the substrate, respectively, at voltages that enable the junction between the substrate and the well to remain reverse-biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Having construed the \u201cpower supply\u201d limitations, we turn next to the question whether the accused products\u2019 split-bias device may be considered a \u201csecond power supply\u201d within the meaning of the claims. NeoMagic argues that the split-bias device is a \u201csecond power supply\u201d because it has two supply lines (ie., BIAS and AVSS), the latter of which connects to the substrate and provides a voltage that is negative with respect to the voltage provided by the first power supply. Trident responds that the split-bias device cannot satisfy the \u201csecond power supply\u201d limitation because it has nothing to do with reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction or isolating the capacitor from noise in the substrate. According to Trident, the accused products\u2019 first power supply <em>(ie., </em>VDD/VSS) is alone sufficient to maintain the reverse-biased condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We agree with Trident that the district court was correct in concluding that there is no genuine issue of material fact whether the accused products\u2019 split-bias device can be a \u201csecond power supply\u201d as recited in the claims. It cannot. Even if the split-bias device may be considered a \u201cpower supply\u201d as that term has been construed, it does not deliver power to the substrate at a voltage that enables the junction between the substrate and the well to remain reverse-biased. Rather, the split-bias device uses the BIAS signal line to deliver a control voltage to a capacitor in order to maintain certain current sources at constant values. The mere fact that both the split-bias device and the substrate are tied to ground does not, as NeoMagic suggests, mean that the split-bias device contributes to reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction, for it is the external reference voltage VSS, and not the split-bias device, that establishes the voltage of the substrate. Indeed, under NeoMagic\u2019s purported logic, any component that is tied to ground \u2014 most, if not all, of the components in the integrated circuit \u2014 would contribute to reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction. However, as discussed above, the claims require the second power supply to enable the reverse-biased condition by establishing the voltage of the substrate at a voltage that is less positive than the voltage applied to the well. The split-bias device does not do that.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that it cannot be a \u201csecond power supply\u201d within the meaning of the claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>struing the claims to require that the recited power supplies contribute to reverse-biasing the substrate-well junction or in concluding as a matter of law that the accused products lack a \u201csecond power supply.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment of noninMngement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-12\">.
