He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Sanchez-Garcia, </em>319 F.3d 677, 678 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 918, 124 S.Ct. 311, 157 L.Ed.2d 213 (2003), which held that, to determine whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction satisfied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii), the district court was not limited to consideration of conduct charged in the indictment but could go beyond the statute of conviction and the charging instrument. <em>Sanchez-Garcia </em>forecloses Loredo-Torres\u2019 argument, and the district court did not err by considering the PSR to determine whether to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Loredo-Torres also argues that the district court erred when it applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii) because transportation of illegal aliens is not \u201calien smuggling.\u201d Loredo-Torres concedes that this claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164, 167-68 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert, denied, </em>538 U.S. 991, 123 S.Ct. 1811, 155 L.Ed.2d 689 (2003), in which this court held that the term \u201calien smuggling offense,\u201d as used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii), includes the offense of transporting aliens within the United States. Based on <em>Solis-Campozano, </em>the 16-level increase to Loredo-Torres\u2019 offense level was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
