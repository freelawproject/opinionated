The district court sentenced Rhodes to 294 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. Counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), noting an appeal waiver in the plea agreement. Rhodes did not file a pro se supplemental brief by the court\u2019s deadline, but has recently moved to file a supplemental brief in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">In pleading guilty, Rhodes expressly waived the right to appeal \u201call non-jurisdictional issues,\u201d except a departure from the Guidelines range. We enforce this appeal waiver, concluding that no miscarriage of justice would result from such enforcement because the district court properly questioned Rhodes at the plea hearing; Rhodes indicated that his plea was voluntary; and the court explained the waiver and received Rhodes\u2019s assurance that he had discussed the plea agreement \u2014 and specifically the appeal-waiver provision \u2014 with counsel, he had no questions, and he agreed with it. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-91 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (court should enforce appeal waiver and dismiss appeal where it falls within scope of waiver, both plea agreement and waiver were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, and no miscarriage of justice would result; one important way district court can ensure plea agreement and appeal waiver are knowing and voluntary is to properly question defendant about decision to enter agreement and to waive right to appeal), cert. <em>denied, </em>540 U.S. 997, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-25\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues falling outside the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny the motion to file a supplemental brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-19\">. The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
