He argues that the sentence, in combination with his original 48-month sentence, exceeds the 60-month statutory maximum for his underlying 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) offense. He further urges that the sentence following revocation was based on facts not determined by a jury or admitted by him and thus violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-27\">Piekrell\u2019s claim fails. On its face, <em>Blakely </em>has no application to supervised-release proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 2537-43; <em>see United States v. Marmolejo, </em>915 F.2d 981, 983 (5th Cir.1990). The case does not present a sentencing guidelines issue and, even if it did, this court has held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, 11; <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263). Finally, contrary to his assertion, Pickrell\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(4), \u00a7 3583(b)(2) and (e)(3); <em>United States v. Celestine, </em>905 F.2d 59, 60-61 (5th Cir.1990). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
