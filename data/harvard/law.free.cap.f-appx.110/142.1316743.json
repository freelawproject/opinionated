The administrative law judge (ALJ) answered those questions in the affirmative, and the magistrate judge, sitting as the district court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">On appeal, the claimant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-23\">(1) that the ALJ erred in relying, in part, on residual functional capacity reports prepared by consultants who had not examined the claimant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-24\">(2) that the ALJ erred in concluding that the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity was not significantly undermined by her nonexertional impairments and therefore relying on the medical vocational guidelines (the Grid) to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>mine that jobs exist that the claimant can perform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Given the deferential standard of judicial review applicable here, <em>see, e.g., Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 399, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Rodriguez v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981), neither of those arguments warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>Reports by Nonexamining Consultants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Although we have encouraged the Commissioner to obtain a residual functional capacity report from an examining consultant, <em>Rivera-Torres v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>837 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1988), reports from nonexamining, nontestifying consultants are \u201centitled to evidentiary weight, which \u2018will vary with the circumstances,\u2019 \u201d <em>Berrios Lopez v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>951 F.2d 427, 431 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Rodriguez, </em>647 F.2d at 223).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Greater reliance on such reports is warranted where, as here, the nonexamining consultants, Hilario De La Iglesia, Ph.D., and Luis R. Vecchini, M.D., who prepared the mental residual functional capacity report, reviewed the reports of examining and treating doctors before doing so and supported their conclusions with reference to medical findings. <em>See Berrios Lopez, </em>951 F.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In this case, we need not consider whether the nonexamining psychiatric consultants\u2019 report, standing alone, constitutes substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision concerning the claimant\u2019s mental residual functional capacity. <em>Cf Berrios Lopez, </em>951 F.2d at 431 (finding such reports sufficient under similar circumstances). In this instance, the record also contains comments on the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity by an examining consultant, Dr. Alberto Rodriguez Robles, and two treating psychiatrists, Dr. Ingrid Alicea-Berrios and Dr. Arias-Boneta. This is, therefore, not a case in which the nonexamining consultants\u2019 reports were the only evidence of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>Cf. Heggarty v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 990, 997 (1st Cir.1991). Nor is it a case in which the only evidence consists of \u201craw, technical medical data.\u201d <em>Cf. Berrios v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>796 F.2d 574, 576 (1st Cir.1986) (remanding because there was \u201cnothing in the record, intelligible to a lay person\u201d anent claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Although the claimant argues that the ALJ should not have relied on reports of nonexamining consultants, she does not argue that any particular finding of the ALJ is unsupported by other substantial evidence in the record. In fact, although the reports of the examining psychiatrists differ in some details from that of the nonexamining consultants, both sets of experts seem to agree with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that, despite her mental impairments, the claimant retains the capacity to follow simple instructions involved in unskilled work. The examining psychiatrists\u2019 reports also lend some support to the ALJ\u2019s subsidiary findings that the claimant retains the capacity for social functioning and for concentration, at least for short periods. Indeed, one of the claimant\u2019s treating psychiatrists reported that, with medication, the claimant\u2019s self-esteem, independence, and attitude toward life have improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">In light of that substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision as to the claimant\u2019s mental residual functional capacity, it is inconsequential that, in some respects, the examining psychiatrists characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the claimaint\u2019s mental impairments as imposing more limits than did the nonexamining consultants. <em>See Berrios Lopez, </em>951 F.2d at 429. In particular, the ALJ\u2019s discrediting of claimant\u2019s claims that she was unable to do any activities of daily living was warranted, given the conflicting evidence in the record on this issue. Resolving such conflicts is for the ALJ, not for a reviewing court. <em>Rodriguez, </em>647 F.2d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Reliance on the Grid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Simply because a claimant suffers from both exertional and nonexertional impairments does not necessarily preclude using the Grid to determine whether jobs exist that the claimant could perform. Rather, where a nonexertional impairment has been \u201cfound to impose no significant restriction on the range of work a claimant is exertionally able to perform, reliance on the Grid remains appropriate.\u201d <em>Ortiz v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir. 1989); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 2.00(e)(2). As long as the nonexertional impairment \u201chas the effect only of reducing th[e] occupational base marginally, the Grid remains highly relevant and can be relied on exclusively to yield a finding as to disability.\u201d <em>Ortiz, </em>890 F.2d at 524. While use of a vocational expert may be helpful in complex cases, such use is not required. <em>See </em>Social Security Ruling 96-Op, <em>Determining Capability to Do Other Work </em>\u2014 Implications <em>of a Residual Functional Capacity for Less than a Full Range of Sedentary Work, </em>1996 WL 374185, at *9 (S.S.A. July 2,1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Here, considering only the claimant\u2019s exertional limitation (back pain), which allowed her to do \u201cmedium\u201d work, in combination with her age (45, which is considered a \u201cyounger individual,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(c)) and her education (high school graduate), the Grid would dictate a finding of no disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, table 3. This is so regardless of the claimant\u2019s previous skilled-work experience. <em>See id., </em>rules 203.25-203.31. Therefore, that the claimant\u2019s mental impairments limit her to unskilled work makes no difference in the number of jobs available.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The claimant argues that her limitations in social functioning would make her unable to get along with supervisors and coworkers and would therefore so restrict her ability to do unskilled work as to require a vocational expert to determine whether sufficient jobs exist that she could perform. However, the ALJ expressly found that the claimant can \u201crelate normally to co-workers and supervisors.\u201d That finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record, including the claimant\u2019s own statements. Even claimant\u2019s treating psychiatrist rated the claimant\u2019s social functioning as only \u201cmoderately limited\u201d in most respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Nor should the claimant\u2019s inability to be exposed to extreme temperatures, chemicals, dust, fumes, and gases \u2014 due to her asthma \u2014 reduce, more than marginally, the broad occupational base generally available to a younger individual with a high-school education who is able to do medium, light, or sedentary work. <em>See </em>SSR 96-9p, <em>supra, </em>1996 WL 374185, at *9 (explaining that \u201c[e]ven a need to avoid all exposure to these conditions would not, by itself, result in a significant erosion of the occupational base for sedentary work\u201d). As noted by the ALJ, that base includes approximately 2,500 separate sedentary, light, and medium occupations, each of which represents numerous jobs in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 203.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>missioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">. Because the claimant here voluntarily waived her right to an evidentiary hearing and chose to rely solely on the documentary record, she cannot complain about her resulting inability to cross-examine the nonexamining consultants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
