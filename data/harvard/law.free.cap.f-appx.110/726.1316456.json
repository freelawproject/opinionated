The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 77 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Cortez\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief in which he argues that (1) the sentence imposed for Cortez\u2019s 2001 Arkansas conviction for criminal impersonation should not have been counted in his criminal history score, (2) the district court should have departed downward because Cortez\u2019s criminal history score was overstated, and (3) trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">After careful review, we find that counsel\u2019s arguments lack merit. Cortez has not shown plain error in the district court\u2019s inclusion of his criminal-impersonation sentence in his criminal history score: the sentence included 37 days in jail, and Cortez has not shown that the jail time was imposed for any reason other than the criminal conviction or for his related contempt of court. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>285 F.3d 664, 674 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1196, 123 S.Ct. 1257, 154 L.Ed.2d 1032 (2003); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) (sentences for certain offenses, including giving false information to police officer and contempt of court, and those similar to them, do not count in criminal history score unless defendant receives at least 1 year probation or 30 days imprisonment, or unless such prior offense is similar to instant offense). Further, Cortez waived his downward-departure argument by faffing to move for departure in the district court, <em>see United States v. Murphy, </em>248 F.3d 777, 779-80 (8th Cir.2001), and Cortez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim would be more properly raised in postconviction proceedings, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>Nos. 03-2862, OS-3494, 2004 WL 1737335, at *1 (8th Cir. Aug.4, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\">.
