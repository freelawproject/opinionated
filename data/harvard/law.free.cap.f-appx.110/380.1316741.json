Smith\u2019s motion to \u201callow\u201d his appointed attorney to withdraw is DENIED. The motion was not timely filed and it does not show that Smith has unequivocally asserted a desire to represent himself on appeal. <em>United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 501 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Rotolo v. United States, </em>404 F.2d 316, 317 (5th Cir.1968). The Government\u2019s motion to strike Smith\u2019s reply brief is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s motion to continue the trial. <em>See United States v. Olaniyi-Oke, </em>199 F.3d 767, 771 (5th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 431 (5th Cir.1998). Smith\u2019s assertion that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to suppress as untimely is not well taken. The district court allowed Smith to contest the admissibility of his written confession outside the presence of the jury. Smith waived the issue whether the search and arrest warrants were supported by probable cause by failing to brief the issue in the district court or to raise it at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">We agree with Smith that the district court plainly erred by making an improper comment on the evidence. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>325 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, the comment did not affect the fairness or integrity of Smith\u2019s trial. <em>Id.; United States v. Hinojosa, </em>349 F.3d 200, 203-04 (5th Cir. 2003) ; <em>see United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">Smith\u2019s argument that his sentence should be vacated pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir. 2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b411-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
