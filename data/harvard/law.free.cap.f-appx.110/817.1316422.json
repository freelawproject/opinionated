The record establishes that the petitioner did suffer past persecution as a Serbian living in Kosovo. He fled ethnic cleansing by Albanian Kosavars, and his house and store were burned and looted. Such flight from ethnic cleansing constitutes past persecution. <em>See Knezevic v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1206 (9th Cir.2004). He is therefore entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Kosovo. The BIA\u2019s conclusion that he had failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution in Kosovo is therefore not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The BIA did not consider the issue of whether the petitioner could relocate internally within the former Yugoslavia, and we therefore remand for consideration of this issue. <em>See Knezevic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The petition for review is GRANTED and the matter REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b847-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
