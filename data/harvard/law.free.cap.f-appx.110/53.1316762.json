R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a Certificate of Appealability (COA) was granted as to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">1) Whether Mr. Beers\u2019 due process rights were violated by the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel in failing to inform him of the nature of the plea bargain offered by the government; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">2) Whether Mr. Beers\u2019 due process rights were violated by the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel in denying him his right to testify on his own behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Having reviewed these issues in light of the entire record, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">After a jury trial, Mr. Beers was found guilty of one count of kidnapping in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1) and coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(a). The court sentenced Mr. Beers to 188 months imprisonment, and this court affirmed the conviction, <em>see United States v. Beers, </em>189 F.3d 1297, 1304 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Mr. Beers now contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not inform him of the nature of a plea bargain offered early on by the government and did not attempt to persuade him to accept it. Mr. Beers further maintains that his trial counsel denied him his right to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Beers\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion after which he recommended that the motion be denied. The district court summarily adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s proposed findings and recommended disposition, and this appeal followed. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s finding of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of fact and law we review <em>de novo, </em>although we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Blackwell, </em>127 F.3d 947, 955 (10th Cir.1997). Under the familiar two-prong analysis of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Mr. Beers has the burden of proving his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and the deficiency prejudiced his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">After hearing the evidence, the magistrate judge found the testimony of Mr. Beers\u2019 first attorney, Mr. Marshall Aungier, more credible than that of Mr. Beers. We therefore cannot conclude the magistrate was clearly erroneous in finding Mr. Beers failed to establish that the terms of the government\u2019s favorable plea bargain were not conveyed to him or that Mr. Aungier failed to counsel him to accept it. Because Mr. Aungier\u2019s performance was not deficient, the assistance he rendered to Mr. Beers was not ineffective. <em>See id. </em>at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">As for the second issue, if Mr. Beers\u2019 trial counsel actually overrode his desire to testify, his counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and would satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland. See United States v. Teague, </em>953 F.2d 1525, 1534 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cWhere the defendant claims a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of his right to testify by defense counsel, the essence of the claim is that the action or inaction of the attorney deprived the defendant of the ability to choose whether or not to testify in his own behalf. In other words, by not protecting defendant\u2019s right to testify, defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below the constitutional minimum, thereby violating the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.\u201d). Even if counsel overrode his desire to testify, however, Mr. Beers must show prejudice, which is \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">With respect to whether Mr. Beers\u2019 two trial attorneys denied him his right to testify, we further agree with the magistrate judge that, even if Mr. Beers\u2019 counsel had prevented him from testifying and thus rendered ineffective assistance, Mr. Beers has failed to show prejudice from his counsel\u2019s performance. The evidence Mr. Beers sought to introduce, particularly the evidence attempting to demonstrate that Mr. Beers had treated his kidnap victim well, would almost certainly have led to the introduction by the prosecution of highly damaging evidence that Mr. Beers had abused his young victim. Evidence of Mr. Beers\u2019 long criminal history, including a state conviction on pimping charges, and the tape of a telephone conversation in which Mr. Beers threatened to cut the throat of the victim\u2019s mother would also presumably have come into evidence. Given these realities, Mr. Beers has faded to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the fact that he did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b83-28\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-12\">. We deny COA as to all the other issues Mr. Beers raises because we conclude he has not \"made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as to any of them. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
