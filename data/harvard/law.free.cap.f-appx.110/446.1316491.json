He was sentenced to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Olvera argues that the district court erred by declining to downwardly depart on the mistaken assumption that it lacked the authority to do so. However, the record does not clearly reveal whether the court properly understood its discretion to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In light of the ambiguity, we REMAND the case for reconsideration of the sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only issue on remand is whether the district court recognized that it had discretion to depart. If the district court was aware of its discretion but declined to exercise it, then the original sentence should stand. However, if the district court believed that it lacked the authority to depart, Olvera should be resentenced with the district court\u2019s full awareness of its discretionary authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We take no position on what decision the district court should make.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Olvera also argues that the enhancement of his sentence due to a prior aggravated felony conviction constitutes a due process violation in light of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the prior conviction was not alleged in the indictment. As Olvera concedes, this argument is foreclosed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">REMANDED FOR RECONSIDERATION OF SENTENCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
