He argues that, because the counterfeit notes at issue were \u201cso obviously counterfeit that they [were] unlikely to be accepted even if subjected to only minimal scrutiny,\u201d the district court should not have increased his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A) and (b)(3). This court reviews \u201cthe district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Wyjack, </em>141 F.3d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-26\">Reviewing the evidence in light of the multi-factor test set forth in <em>Wyjack, </em>141 F.3d at 184, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when determining that the counterfeit notes at issue were not \u201cobviously counterfeit\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A). <em>See United States v. Bollman, </em>141 F.3d 184, 186-87 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
