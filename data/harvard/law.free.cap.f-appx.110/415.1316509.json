The Government appeals that portion of the district court\u2019s final judgment that denied the Government\u2019s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law as to Skeldon\u2019s hostile work environment claim. We review Skeldon\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s post-verdict denial of her motion for attorney\u2019s costs, fees, and equitable relief for an abuse of discretion. <em>Brady v. Fort Bend County, </em>145 F.3d 691, 716 (5th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). While our review of the district court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law is <em>de novo, see Burge v. St. Tammany Parish, </em>336 F.3d 363, 368 (5th Cir.2003), we will only overturn a jury verdict when the evidence points \u201cso strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable [jurors] could not arrive at any contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Baltazor v. Holmes, </em>162 F.3d 368, 373 (5th Cir.l998)(quoting <em>Boeing v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir.l969)(en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>After reviewing the record, we conclude that Skeldon has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and equitable relief. We also conclude that sufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict on Skeldon\u2019s hostile work environment claim. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s final judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
