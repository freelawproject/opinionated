We denied Tatum\u2019s court-appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and directed him to brief whether Tatum\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal or to collaterally attack the plea, conviction, and sentence was knowing and voluntary; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>whether the district court admonished Tatum regarding the waiver provision as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. No other issues are raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Tatum has not shown that any Rule 11 violation by the district court amounted to plain error or that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290 (5th Cir. 1994). We need not address at this time whether a particular issue Tatum might attempt to raise in a post-conviction proceeding could be the proper subject of waiver. <em>See United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 343 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
