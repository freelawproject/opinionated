The IJ denied Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), finding Petitioner did not meet the statutory requirements of the INA and that his story was not credible. The IJ also denied Petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), finding Petitioner failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured upon his return to China. For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">Since we write only for the parties we need not restate the facts in detail. Petitioner is a native citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d). Petitioner testified that as a commercial fisherman in China, he owned a boat along with four other fisherman and paid a monthly tax of 3,000 RBM in connection with his occupation. On May 18, 1999, after an extraordinarily large catch, Petitioner was approached by three tax officials who demanded that he pay an additional 3,000 RBM. Petitioner testified that when he refused to pay the additional money, he was struck by the officials, who then took his day\u2019s catch, which was worth approximately 6,000 RBM. Petitioner stated that after this incident the tax officials did not permit him to return to work. On July 7, 1999 Petitioner fled the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-19\">On October 5,1999, Petitioner arrived in the port of Los Angeles as a stowaway. An asylum officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) interviewed Petitioner, determined that he had a credible fear of returning to China, and referred him to an IJ for a full hearing on his asylum claim. On August 15, 2001, the IJ rejected his request. On August 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>2003 the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and the Petitioner timely filed a petition for review. This Court has jurisdiction over the petition for review pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Although review of a final order of removal generally leads us to review the decision of the BIA, when the BIA merely adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Our scope of review is narrow. We review findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.2001). Under this standard, we are bound by the administrative findings of fact unless those findings would compel a reasonable adjudicator to arrive at a contrary conclusion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Because Congress delegated substantial authority under the INA to the Attorney General, who then vested his authority in the BIA, the BIA\u2019s reasonable statutory interpretations are afforded deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 591 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">1. Eligibility for Asylum and Withholding of Removal under the INA</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">To be eligible for asylum, Petitioner has the burden of establishing that he meets the statutory requirements of refugee status. <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 482. A refugee is one who is outside his or her country of nationality and will not or cannot return \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(A). Withholding of removal has a similar statutory prerequisite that makes it available only \u201cif the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">To be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA, Petitioner must show that the threats he faces arise because of one of the statutorily-protected grounds. <em>See Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272 (citing <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655 (9th Cir.2000)). Although the respondent need not provide direct proof, he must provide some evidence of those motives. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Petitioner argues that he met the statutory prerequisites because he was assaulted by government officials due to his expression of a political opinion about the increased taxation of his larger catch and his affiliation with a social group, namely fishermen. However, the IJ found that the acts of which Petitioner complained only amounted to either extortion by corrupt officials or a legitimate attempt to tax Petitioner\u2019s abnormally large catch of fish, and not persecution because of Petitioner\u2019s political opinion or affiliation with a social group. We may not disturb the IJ\u2019s findings in this regard because Petitioner has not produced evidence that would compel a different conclusion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Based on the IJ\u2019s findings, Petitioner failed to meet the statutory prerequisites for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA. Therefore, we need not reach the IJ\u2019s determination of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>2. Eligibility for Withholding of Removal under the Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The Petitioner further claims that the IJ erred in denying him relief under the CAT. In order to succeed on an application to withhold removal under the CAT, an applicant must demonstrate that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured if removed to the proposed country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The IJ found that the evidence presented by Petitioner was insufficient to establish a likelihood that he would be tortured. This Court must sustain the decision of the IJ if the record provides substantial evidence to support the Id\u2019s findings. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Given the record before us, neither Petitioner\u2019s claims relating to his experience as a fisherman nor his claim that he will be tortured for violating China\u2019s immigration laws compel us to overturn the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">For the foregoing reasons we reject the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
