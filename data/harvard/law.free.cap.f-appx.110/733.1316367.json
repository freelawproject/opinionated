The district court sentenced appellant to concurrent terms of 78 months imprisonment. Counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court plainly erred in assessing a firearm enhancement. In his pro se brief, Martinez adopts the <em>Anders </em>argument, and adds that he received ineffective assistance during the plea negotiations and hearing. Martinez has also filed a Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) letter, arguing his sentence violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was enhanced based on factual findings not made by a jury. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-26\">The <em>Anders </em>argument is without merit. Martinez abandoned the issue when, at sentencing, he and his counsel withdrew his objection to the presentence report\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>(PSR\u2019s) recommendation for a firearm enhancement. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (claim relinquished below need not be addressed on appeal); <em>United States v. Tulk, </em>171 F.3d 596, 600 (8th Cir.1999) (issue deliberately waived below is not reviewed, even for plain error). Further, Martinez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim should be raised \u2014 if at all' \u2014 in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Martinez\u2019s Rule 28(j) <em>Blakely </em>argument also fails. His plea agreement included stipulations as to drug quantity, protected location, and firearm possession. <em>See Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 124 S.Ct. at 2541 (nothing prevents defendant from waiving his rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); when defendant pleads guilty, government is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as defendant either stipulates to relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding); <em>United States v. Lucca, </em>377 F.3d 927, 934 (8th Cir.2004) (holding that <em>Blakely </em>was not implicated where defendant was sentenced based solely upon facts admitted as part of his guilty plea). We have also carefully reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-17\">. The Honorable Donald E. O\u2019Brien, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
