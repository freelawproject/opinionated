As the BIA summarily affirmed the decision of the IJ, we review that decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 887-88 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The IJ found that Omer\u2019s testimony regarding his past detention and torture by the government on account of his membership in the Ml Amhara People\u2019s Organization was \u201cunsupported and seems to be inconsistent with the information provided by the State Department ... report,\u201d raising a \u201cserious issue of credibility.\u201d This court has, however, consistently rejected exclusive reliance on State Department reports as the basis for adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir.2000) (finding that \u201crelying exclusively on a blanket statement in a State Department report, the BIA and the IJ fail[ ] to make the individualized analysis of an applicant\u2019s credibility that our case law mandates.\u201d). The passages relied upon by the IJ in the State Department report were general, and \u201cfail[ed] to identify specific, perhaps local, dangers to particular, perhaps obscure, individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1069 (quoting <em>Galina v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 955, 959 (7th Cir.2000)) (internal quotations marks omitted). Moreover, review of the record reveals that the State Department report itself noted, in conformity with Omer\u2019s testimony, that \u201cthe governmental reality, especially at the local and regional level, does not always live up to the [central government\u2019s] announced respect for human rights. Local administrators and members of the security forces committed human rights abuses, such as beating or mistreating detainees, and arresting citizens without court orders.\u201d Because the IJ\u2019s reliance on the State Department report was neither supplemental, nor for the purpose of \u201crefuting a generalized statement,\u201d but rather was intended to discount \u201cspecific testimony regarding [Omer\u2019s] individual experience,\u201d <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.2001), we hold that the adverse credibility determination is not based on specific, cogent reasons supported by the record. The individual assessment letter, as the IJ\u2019s decision acknowledges, merely reiterates general conditions and contains no specific information regarding the applicant. Thus it in no way affects our holding here.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The IJ also explained that he \u201ccarefully observed\u201d Omer as he testified and concluded that he was not telling the truth. The IJ\u2019s observation was general, however, and he did not \u201cspecifically and cogently refer to any aspect of [Omer\u2019s] demeanor\u201d to support his negative credibility determination. <em>Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the petition and REVERSE the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Because, after making the adverse credibility finding, the IJ did not reach the merits of Omer\u2019s claims, we REMAND for the IJ to consider Omer\u2019s application in the first instance, taking Omer\u2019s testimony as credible. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
