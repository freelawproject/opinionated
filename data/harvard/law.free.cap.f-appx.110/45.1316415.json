The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 apply, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for substantial evidence and will not disturb the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding unless the evidence compels a finding that Singh is credible. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because, among other things, Singh\u2019s testimony was vague and inconsistent, he belatedly admitted to using an alias not disclosed on his asylum application, and, although he conceded to entering the United States without inspection, Singh later testified that he received a \u201cvisa\u201d upon entrance to the country. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Singh\u2019s contention that the BIA and IJ erred in not granting him relief under the Convention Against Torture is unpersuasive because he never applied for that relief. <em>See Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b75-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
