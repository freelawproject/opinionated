After undertaking <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Planned Parenthood of New York City, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">Having reviewed the record and considered the arguments of the parties, we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted for the reasons stated by the district court. We note, however, that, contrary to the district court\u2019s view, the fact that the plaintiff was replaced by an employee within the protected age group satisfies one criterion of <em>aprima, facie </em>case of age discrimination, where, as here, the \u201creplacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., </em>517 U.S. 308, 313, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996). Nevertheless, we find the district court appropriately granted summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
