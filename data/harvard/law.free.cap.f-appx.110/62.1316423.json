HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b92-27\">Defendant Dean Edward Letschka pleaded guilty to receiving child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A). He stipulated in the plea agreement to a sentence of 96 months. At the sentencing hearing, however, Defendant suggested that the court sentence him to a shorter period of incarceration. He informed the court that it was \u201cnot bound\u201d by the \u201cfederal sentencing guideline numbers [that had] been crunched and stretched into a very long period of incarceration suggested by the prosecution,\u201d and asked the court to impose a \u201clighter sentence.\u201d R. Vol. Ill at 12. Notwithstanding Defendant\u2019s request, the district court sentenced him to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment, in accordance with the stipulation. In imposing the sentence, the court noted that \u201c[t]here [was] no formal request, and certainly no cogent rationale, to depart from the guideline range or to deviate from the sentence bargained for by both the government and the defendant in the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Defendant now appeals his sentence. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Defense counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief indicating her belief that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although <em>Anders </em>entitles Defendant to raise additional points in response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, <em>see id., </em>Defendant has made no such filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We agree with counsel that Defendant has no non-frivolous claims to pursue on appeal. Defendant simply received the sentence for which he bargained. There is no indication in the record that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the plea agreement. And to the extent Defendant\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing may be construed as a request for a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary denial of a downward departure unless the denial was based on an illegal factor or an incorrect application of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Guidry, </em>199 F.3d 1150, 1161 (10th Cir.1999). We see no basis for such an argument in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Accordingly, agreeing with counsel that Defendant\u2019s claims are frivolous, we GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b92-28\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
