He contends that the district court erroneously increased his offense level by 16 levels because his prior conviction for harboring illegal aliens for profit is not an \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-22\">This court rejected Duarte\u2019s essential contention in <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 991, 123 S.Ct. 1811, 155 L.Ed.2d 689 (2003). The offenses listed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A), which include harboring aliens, are \u201calien smuggling\u201d offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). <em>Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d at 167-68. Duarte concedes that his argument is foreclosed, and he raises the issue only to preserve it for possible review by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-23\">Duarte contends that his sentence is invalid because the sentencing scheme of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) is unconstitutional and the prior conviction that resulted in his increased sentence was an element of the offense that should have been alleged in his indictment. Duarte acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 237-39, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and he raises the issue only to preserve it for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>possible review by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
