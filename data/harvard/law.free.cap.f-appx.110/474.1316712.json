Because we find that Bird\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was procedurally defaulted in the state courts, and Bird has failed to demonstrate cause and prejudice regarding the default, we will AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Jimmy Lee Bird was arrested by Columbus, Ohio, police officers for disorderly conduct. Bird, who had advised the officers that he was HIV-positive, became belligerent while in the custody of the officers and spat in the face of one of them. Bird was indicted on one count of felonious assault in violation of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2903.11, for \u201cknowingly causing] or attempting] to cause physical harm to [a police] officer [] by means of a deadly weapon, to wit: spit and/or saliva.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">While Bird was in jail awaiting trial, he was transported to the Franklin County Courthouse for an unscheduled appearance. A deputy sheriff approached Bird in the holding cell in which he was confined and asked him to sign a waiver of his speedy trial rights. Bird claims that he first refused to sign the waiver in the absence of counsel, but later agreed to and did sign the waiver when the deputy returned to the holding cell and informed him that the trial judge was requiring Bird\u2019s signature. Bird\u2019s court-appointed attorney was not informed that Bird had executed a waiver of his speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">Ohio law requires that an incarcerated defendant must be brought to trial within 90 days of his arrest. Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2945.71(C)(2), (E). At a plea hearing held 97 days after his arrest, Bird pled no contest to the felonious assault charge. His counsel, who was present at the plea hearing and was by then aware of the speedy trial waiver, neither questioned the circumstances of its execution nor objected that his client had been held for more than 90 days. Bird was sentenced to three-to-fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">More than two years after he entered his plea, Bird filed a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal before the Ohio Court of Appeals. The motion was granted, and through newly-appointed counsel, Bird argued on appeal that the evidence presented at trial did not establish all of the elements of the offense; that the indictment did not state an offense; and that he had been deprived of effective assistance of counsel because counsel had failed to object to the faulty indictment and had failed to raise the defense that saliva was not a deadly weapon. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Bird, </em>1996 WL 751467, 1996 Ohio App. LEXIS 5933 (Ohio Ct.App. Dec. 31, 1996). Bird then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment, <em>State of Ohio v. Bird, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 582, 692 N.E.2d 1013 (Ohio 1998), and later denied Bird\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>While his direct appeal was pending, Bird filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief in the state trial court. While the post-conviction petition was pending, Bird filed a pro se habeas corpus petition in the federal court, claiming that his conviction was in violation of his rights to due process and the effective assistance of counsel. The federal district court dismissed the habeas petition because Bird had not exhausted his claims in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Bird then filed a second federal habeas petition, while his state post-conviction petition was still pending before the state courts. The district court terminated the habeas case administratively. After the state trial court dismissed Bird\u2019s post-conviction petition as untimely, the court of appeals affirmed, and the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed the subsequent appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question, the federal district court reactivated the second habeas petition. In that second habeas petition, Bird claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to assert Bird\u2019s right to a speedy trial and for failing to withdraw Bird\u2019s no contest plea when it became apparent that Bird would be incarcerated; that Bird was denied due process because he pled no contest to charges that did not constitute a crime; and that he was denied due process in his state post-conviction proceedings. In particular, Bird argued that his state post-conviction petition had been timely filed, and that the state courts\u2019 application of the statute of limitations was unfair because the courts\u2019 interpretation of the statute was unforeseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The district court denied the second habeas petition, finding that the issues Bird raised had been procedurally defaulted in the state courts. Bird now argues on appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to assert Bird\u2019s right to a speedy trial, and that the district court erred in finding that his ineffective assistance claim was procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>McQueen v. Scroggy, </em>99 F.3d 1302, 1310 (6th Cir.1996). Because Bird filed his first habeas petition after the effective date of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 as amended by AEDPA govern this case. An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication was (1) contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A federal habeas court may not find a state adjudication to be unreasonable \u201csimply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Harris v. Stovall, </em>212 F.3d 940, 942 (6th Cir. 2000) (same). Rather, the application itself must also be unreasonable. <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 411. State court findings of fact are presumed correct and are rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Petitioner Jimmy Lee Bird argues that his ineffective assistance claim was not procedurally defaulted. But for the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>courts\u2019 unforeseeably interpreting the post-conviction limitations period to bar his post-conviction petition, he contends, the petition would have been considered timely. We require a four-part analysis when a state alleges that a habeas claim is precluded by procedural default. The court must determine: (1) whether there is a state procedural rule applicable to the claim raised by petitioner and with which petitioner actually failed to comply; (2) whether the state courts actually enforced that state procedural rule; (3) whether the petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the state procedural rule is an \u201cadequate and independent\u201d state ground that the state is entitled to rely on in order to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim; and (4) whether the petitioner has demonstrated cause for his failure to follow the state procedural rule and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged constitutional error. <em>See Maupin v. Smith, </em>785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The district court did not err in finding that Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2953.21 is a procedural rule applicable to petitioner\u2019s claim, and that petitioner failed to comply with that rule by failing to file his post-convietion petition within the time provided. Neither Bird nor the State has argued that the state courts actually failed to enforce the statute of limitations. Although Bird is correct in pointing out that the Ohio Supreme Court has not expressly interpreted the limitations period contained in Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2953.21, it does not follow that the statute is unclear and not regularly followed. The statutory language. is \u2014 as the district court stated in its opinion and order \u2014 clear and unambiguous. \u201cIf no [direct] appeal is taken ... the petition shall be filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal.\u201d Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2953.21(A)(2). Here, the petitioner did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Although only a minority of state appellate courts have addressed this topic, each has found that a delayed appeal does not toll the time for filing a motion for post-conviction relief. To the contrary, the courts have consistently held that a defendant must file his petition within 180 days after the time for filing a direct appeal expires pursuant to Ohio App. R. 4(A). See <em>State v. Price, </em>1998 WL 680964, Franklin App. No. 98AP-80 (Sept. 29, 1998) (unreported); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1999 WL 254456, Muskingum App. No. CT980029 (Apr. 21, 1999) (unreported); <em>State v. Fields, </em>136 Ohio App.3d 393, 736 N.E.2d 933 (Ohio App. 8th Dist.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Bird appears to assert that the decisions of three appellate districts are insufficient to support a finding that the rule is firmly established or regularly followed. According to Bird, moreover, \u201cthe law seemed clear that he was filing it timely.\u201d He fails, however, to cite to any Ohio decision that adopts his proposed interpretation of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2953.21. That fact, taken together with the clear meaning of the statute, supports a finding that the rule was applied in a way that Bird could have anticipated. He was thus provided a reasonable opportunity for state court review of his claims. The district court correctly found that the statute of limitations of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2953.21 is firmly established and regularly followed by the state courts, and is therefore an adequate basis upon which the state courts could deny relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). To demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d a petitioner must show that an \u201cobjective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). To demonstrate \u201cprejudice\u201d a petitioner must show a disadvantage \u201cinfecting\u201d the trial with constitutional error. <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 168, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Bird relies on his contention that the state courts imposed an unreasonable interpretation of the limitations period to demonstrate cause for his default. Because the state courts\u2019 interpretation was not unreasonable, Bird cannot show cause for his default.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">It is worth noting, moreover, that Bird was appointed an attorney for his appeal in June 1996. The bill that first established the limitations period in Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2953.21, S.B. 4, took effect on September 21, 1995, and gave petitioner and similarly situated defendants a one-year grace period in which to file post-conviction petitions. Bird therefore had until September 21, 1996, to timely file his post-conviction petition, giving him several months to do so once he was granted leave to file a delayed appeal and counsel was appointed. There was no failure by the trial court to explain petitioner\u2019s right to appeal which would constitute cause to excuse petitioner\u2019s default. Bird has not established cause sufficient to excuse his procedural default. Because Bird has wholly failed to demonstrate cause, we need not determine whether he can show prejudice as a result of the allegedly ineffective performance of his trial counsel. <em>See Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. at 496 (reiterating that \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d are in the conjunctive, and petitioner must demonstrate both).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Before the district court, Bird argued for the first time that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue a claim for violation of Bird\u2019s right to counsel at an allegedly \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings, namely, when he was \u201cinstructed\u201d by the state trial judge to sign a speedy trial waiver. The Supreme Court held in <em>Cronic </em>that a defendant must be afforded counsel at all critical stages of a trial. <em>Id. </em>at 659. This claim is likewise procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">As we have already explained, where a defendant procedurally defaults a claim by failing to raise it in the state courts, the defendant may raise the claim in habeas only if the defendant can first demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice. <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998); <em>Hudson v. Jones, </em>351 F.3d 212, 216 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Caver v. Straub, </em>349 F.3d 340, 346 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Maupin, </em>785 F.2d at 138. There is, however, some support for the assertion that a defendant need not establish actual prejudice when attempting to raise a procedurally defaulted <em>Cronic </em>claim in habeas. When reviewing the merits of <em>Cronic </em>claims, as opposed to the procedural default of those claims, both the Supreme Court and this Court have held that \u201c[a] criminal conviction must be set aside [] even without the showing of any actual <em>[Strickland] </em>prejudice, \u2018if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>351 F.3d at 216 (citing <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659 (1984)); <em>see generally Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). This precedent does not, however, dispense with the requirement that peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tioner demonstrate \u201ccause,\u201d and Bird does not and cannot show any reason for the failure of the counsel appointed to represent him in his delayed appeal to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel under the theory that trial counsel should have raised a <em>Cronic </em>claim. <em>See Carrier, </em>477 U.S. at 488. Since Bird\u2019s <em>Cronic </em>claim is clearly defaulted, and since he cannot show cause for that default, this court need not address the merits of Bird\u2019s <em>Cronic </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Bird also argues that, even if he cannot show both cause and prejudice, his procedural default should be excused because this Court\u2019s \u201cfailure to consider the claim[] will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 750. A \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exists only if the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>134 F.3d 340, 350 (6th Cir.1998). The exception therefore applies only where there is a colorable claim of factual innocence. <em>Kuhlmann v. Wilson, </em>477 U.S. 436, 454, 106 S.Ct. 2616, 91 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Bird contends that he is actually innocent, that is, that he did not commit felonious assault when he spat on the police officer. The central thrust of Bird\u2019s argument is that expert testimony would have proven that his saliva could not transfer the HIV virus, and that the state therefore could not have proven assault with a deadly weapon. \u201cNo reasonable juror,\u201d he posits, \u201cwould have found Mr. Bird guilty of felonious assault. Mr. Bird\u2019s saliva was not a deadly weapon and expert scientific evidence would have proved that.\u201d The state, of course, disagrees with this contention, and maintains that there is some dispute between health care professionals as to whether or not HIV can be spread through salivary transmission. Whether HIV-infected saliva is capable of inflicting death or whether Bird intended to use his saliva as a weapon were issues of fact for the jury. The jury would not have been bound to accept any expert testimony put forward on behalf of petitioner. This Court \u2014 like the district court below\u2014 therefore cannot say that no reasonable juror would have convicted petitioner. Bird has therefore failed to present a credible claim of actual innocence sufficient to excuse his procedural default. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b510-9\">COLE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Al4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"AOK\">Because the majority opinion erroneously concludes that Bird\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is proeedurally barred, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The majority today has held that Bird\u2019s state post-conviction petition was not timely filed. At issue is Ohio\u2019s limitations period for filing a petition for post-conviction relief. O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(2) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">A [post-conviction] petition ... shall be filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction or adjudication.... If no appeal is taken, the petition shall be filed no later than one hundred eighty days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Prisoners \u2014 such as Bird \u2014 who were sentenced prior to September 21, 1995, were also subject to Am.Sub.S.B.4, Section 3, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">A person who seeks post-conviction relief ... with respect to a case in which sentence was imposed prior to the effective date of this act ... shall file a petition within the time required in [O.R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)], as amended by this act, or within one year from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>effective date of the act [September 21, 1995], whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Thus O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(2), when read in conceit with Am.Sub.S.B.4, Section 3, prescribed the following for Bird\u2019s case: (1) If a direct appeal was filed, the post-conviction petition must have been filed within 180 days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the courts of appeals; (2) if no direct appeal was filed, the post-conviction petition must have been filed by September 21, 1996. Bird contends that, because he filed a delayed direct appeal with the permission of the state court, he falls into the first category, and that he properly filed his post-conviction petition within 180 days after the date on which the trial transcript was filed with the court of appeals. (The transcript was filed on August 19, 1996 and Bird filed his post-conviction petition on December 17, 1996). However, the state court ruled that the time for filing a petition for post-conviction relief does not begin to run from the time the trial transcript is filed in a case, such as Bird\u2019s, where a delayed direct appeal has been taken, but that instead, in such cases, the deadline for filing a post-conviction petition is thirty days after the time for filing a timely direct appeal expires, or by September 21, 1996, whichever is later. As the majority does today, the state court relied on <em>State v. Price, </em>1998 WL 680964, Franklin App. No. 98AP-80 (Sept. 29, 1998) (unreported), where an Ohio appeals court held, for the first time, that for prisoners who file a delayed direct appeal, the time for filing a post-conviction petition does not begin to run from the time the trial transcript is filed, but rather, upon expiration of the thirty-day period for filing a timely direct appeal as provided in Ohio App. R. 4(A). As such, the majority today concludes that Bird should have filed his post-conviction appeal by September 21, 1996 \u2014 and that therefore, his December 1996 petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Price\u2019s </em>interpretation of O.R.C. \u00a7 2952.21(A)(2) and Am.Sub.S.B.4 was a firmly established procedural rule at the time of Bird\u2019s conviction and post-conviction proceedings. A state procedural bar can operate as an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state ground for barring federal habeas review only if that rule is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed.\u201d <em>Ford v. Georgia, </em>498 U.S. 411, 423, 111 S.Ct. 850, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991); <em>Rogers v. Howes, </em>144 F.3d 990, 992 (6th Cir.1998). In <em>Ford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a Georgia Supreme Court ruling requiring <em>Batson </em>claims to be raised in the period between jurors\u2019 selection and the administration of their oaths was not firmly established and regularly followed at the time of the petitioner\u2019s trial and appeal and that, therefore, it was not an independent and adequate state procedure that could bar federal habeas review of the <em>Batson </em>claim. The Supreme Court emphasized that a litigant cannot be penalized for failing to adhere to a procedural rule that was neither in existence nor foreseeable at the time of the action in question. <em>Ford, </em>498 U.S. at 423. (\u201cNovelty in procedural requirements cannot be permitted to thwart [federal] review ... applied for by those who, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal constitutional rights.\u201d) (quoting <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 457-58, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958)). Similarly, this Circuit has found that only firmly established state procedural rules will bar federal habeas review, and this Court has refused to preclude habeas review where a petitioner was not reasonably apprised of the procedural rule ultimately used against him. <em>See Warner v. United States, </em>975 F.2d 1207 (6th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Bird\u2019s case fits squarely within the reasoning applied in <em>Ford </em>and <em>Warner. </em>That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Bird failed to file his post-conviction petition by September 21, 1996, but instead filed it within 180 days of the filing of his trial transcript in the court of appeals, does not preclude federal review of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The majority\u2019s conclusion otherwise strains principles of both logic and fairness. The earliest Ohio appellate case to declare that a delayed direct appeal was not a \u201cdirect appeal\u201d within the meaning of O.R.C. \u00a7 <em>2953.21(A)(2)</em>\u2014State <em>v. Price\u2014 </em>was decided on September 29, 1998, over four years after Bird\u2019s conviction and two years after Bird should have filed his post-conviction petition pursuant to Price\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Prior to 1998, however, there is no Ohio case stating that a prisoner who had filed a <em>delayed </em>direct appeal was subject to the \u201c[i]f no appeal is taken\u201d provision of O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(2). Although the <em>Price </em>interpretation of the limitations period in O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(2) may be established now, it was not firmly established at the time Bird should have filed his post-conviction petition in 1996. Moreover, Price\u2019s interpretation was not reasonably foreseeable to Bird or any other reasonable individual relying on the plain language of the statute. First, the statute makes no distinction between timely and delayed direct appeals. Second, in every other context under Ohio law, a delayed direct appeal is considered a direct appeal. <em>See </em>Ohio R.App. P.5(E) (\u201cIf ... leave to appeal is granted, the further proceedings shall be the same as for appeals as of right in criminal cases.... \u201d); <em>Ohio v. Gover, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 577, 645 N.E.2d 1246, 1249 (Ohio 1995) (explicitly recognizing that a delayed appeal is a direct appeal); <em>Ohio v. Ishmail, </em>67 Ohio St.2d 16, 423 N.E.2d 1068 (Ohio 1981) (\u201cNo direct appeal was taken, either as a matter of right or as a delayed appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In sum, there is no way that Bird, in 1996, could have been deemed to have been apprised of the interpretation of the limitations period that would issue in <em>Price </em>in 1998. In 1996, Bird reasonably concluded that he was subject to O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(2)\u2019s limitations period relating to defendants who had filed direct appeals and that, therefore, he had up to 180 days after the filing of his trial transcript to file his petition for post-conviction relief. Because the state procedural rule first set forth in <em>Price </em>was not \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed\u201d at the time of Bird\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, the rule cannot serve as an independent and adequate state ground barring federal review of Bird\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Therefore, I dissent, and I would reverse the judgment of the district court with respect to Bird\u2019s ineffective assistance claim and remand to the district court for consideration of Bird\u2019s claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
