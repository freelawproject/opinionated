We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment, <em>Frost v. Agnos, </em>152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-25\">Summary judgment was proper because Jones failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether prison officials acted with deliberate indifference in diagnosing and treating his knee condition. <em>See id. </em>at 1130. Jones\u2019s disagreement as to his treatment plan does not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-26\">Contrary to Jones\u2019s contention, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment before discovery was complete, because Jones\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>posed depositions would not provide evidence that would have created a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Klingele v. Eikenberry, </em>849 F.2d 409, 412 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b69-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
