On appeal, he argues that the court erred in imposing criminal penalties rather than civil penalties, that the Government failed to prove wilful violations, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and allowing the Government to introduce evidence of his prior alcohol-related convictions. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the lower court\u2019s opinions and orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Choi\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
