We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s findings of fact, <em>Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 892, 895 (9th Cir.2003), <em>amended by </em>339 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-18\">The IJ concluded that Eguino-Torres did not bear his burden of proving that he was not absent from the United States for more than 180 days during the relevant ten-year period. The record does not compel a contrary conclusion given that Eguino-Torres\u2019s testimony regarding his absences from the United States was internally inconsistent, and was inconsistent with the testimony of his father and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>wife, and with his cancellation of removal application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b822-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
