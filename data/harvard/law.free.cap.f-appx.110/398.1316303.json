San<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>chez argues that his 72-month sentence for the conspiracy offense exceeds the statutory maximum sentence of five years in the absence of a jury finding that the offense was committed for private financial gain. The plain language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(i) provides that the penalty for conspiracy to transport aliens within the United States is ten years. The statute does not require a showing that the conspiracy offense was committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain. The statute further provides that the penalty for the offense of transporting aliens under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii), (iii), and (iv) , in which the offense was committed for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain, is ten years. Because the portion of the statute applicable to the conspiracy offense does not require proof of commercial advantage or private financial gain, Sanchez\u2019s 72-month sentence for the conspiracy offense does not exceed the ten-year statutory maximum sentence for this offense, and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is inapplicable. Sanchez\u2019s sentence on count one is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Sanchez was also convicted for aiding and abetting the transportation of illegal aliens within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (v) (II). The statutory maximum sentence for these offenses is five years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(ii); <em>see also United States v. Nolasco-Rosas, </em>286 F.3d 762, 767 (5th Cir.2002). Sanchez\u2019s 72-month sentence for counts two, three, and four, for transporting aliens within the United States exceeds the five-year statutory maximum sentence for these offenses. Therefore, it is an illegal sentence, and its imposition constitutes plain error. <em>United States v. Sias, </em>227 F.3d 244, 246 (5th Cir.2000). Sanchez\u2019s sentence on counts two, three, and four is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
