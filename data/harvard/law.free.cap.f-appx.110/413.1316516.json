Pina argues that the evidence fails to show that she was aware that 205 pounds of marijuana was hidden inside a diesel tank in the back of a borrowed truck that she presented to U.S. Customs Inspectors at the Del Rio, Texas, port of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In light of the value of the marijuana, Pina\u2019s somewhat implausible explanation for borrowing the truck, and her failure to offer a consistent explanation for a large amount of cash found in her possession, a rational jury could have concluded that Pina was aware of the marijuana hidden in the truck. <em>United States v. Ramos-Garcia, </em>184 F.3d 463, 465-67 (5th Cir.1999). We will not disturb that determination. <em>United States v. Runyan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 240 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 888, 123 S.Ct. 137, 154 L.Ed.2d 149 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
