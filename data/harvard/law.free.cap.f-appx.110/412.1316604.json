The Westmoreland debtors filed an appeal of this order to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. The district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court and the Westmoreland debtors appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the reply briefs, the record excerpts and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated by the district court in its opinion filed January 26, 2004, we affirm the action of the district court in affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
