After reviewing the trial transcript below and the district court judgment, we now affirm. Velez brings several claims to this Court and argues, among other things: that the district court provided an improper limiting instruction regarding Velez\u2019s prior felony conviction; that the district court improperly instructed the jury regarding Velez\u2019s alleged flight; that the government\u2019s summation constituted reversible error; that the district court incorrectly designated Velez\u2019s burglary conviction as a qualifying offense; and that the district court erred in failing <em>sua sponte </em>to grant Velez a downward departure. We have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments in this case and find each of them to be either unpreserved, not plain error, or without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
