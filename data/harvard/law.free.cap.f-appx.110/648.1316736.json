The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that it is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Diack is a native and citizen of Mauritania, who left that country in 1989 and entered the United States without authorization in 2001. He later admitted removability and applied for asylum, the withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Diack alleged that Mauritanian authorities confiscated his property, detained him for three days, and forcibly expelled him from the country. An immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Diack\u2019s testimony was credible. However, he also found that Diack was not entitled to relief because the conditions in Mauritania had improved. Our analysis is focused on the IJ\u2019s decision, as it was affirmed by the BIA \u201cwithout opinion\u201d on February 10, 2003. <em>See Denko v. INS, 351 </em>F.3d 717, 726 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">Diack now argues that the BIA abused its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing a reasoned opinion, because it did not follow the regulatory criteria for applying a streamlined appeals procedure to his case. <em>See generally </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). He argues that the IJ reached an incorrect result and made material errors in finding that he did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Our court has upheld the BIA\u2019s streamlined appeals procedure against both administrative law and due process challenges. <em>Denko, </em>351 F.3d at 727-30 &amp; n. 10. Judicial review is not compromised by this procedure because we analyze the IJ\u2019s decision directly when the BIA streamlines its review of a case under \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7). <em>Id. </em>at 730. Our examination of the IJ\u2019s decision does not reveal any grounds that would preclude a streamlined administrative appeal in Diack\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>at 731-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Diack\u2019s current brief does not contain any clear challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision to deny his claim under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, he has abandoned that claim for purposes of judicial review. <em>See United States v. Mick, </em>263 F.3d 553, 567 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>To obtain asylum, Diack must show not only that he is a refugee, but also that his application merits a favorable exercise of administrative discretion. <em>See Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 389 (6th Cir. 1998). A refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A petition for judicial review should not be granted unless the evidence is so compelling that every reasonable adjudicator would have to find the requisite fear of persecution. <em>Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 486 (6th Cir.2001). Moreover, the IJ\u2019s determination as to whether an asylum application merits a favorable exercise of administrative discretion is conclusive, unless it is \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">To qualify for the withholding of removal, Diack must show a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). Since that standard is stricter than the standard for asylum, the failure to show that he is eligible for asylum will also indicate that he is not entitled to the withholding of removal. <em>See Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The IJ found that Diack would not meet the statutory definition of a refugee, even if his testimony were credible. This finding was consistent with information from the State Department, which indicates that conditions in Mauritania have improved for returning refugees since Diack left the country, even though the government\u2019s human rights record is still generally poor. Diack now argues that this finding is not supported by substantial evidence, as it is contradicted by other portions of the State Department Report. However, he has not shown that every reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to reach a different conclusion than the IJ. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Koliada, </em>259 F.3d at 487-88. Thus, Diack has not presented evidence that would compel a finding that he is a refugee based upon a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In addition, the IJ plainly indicated that Diack\u2019s past persecution was not so severe that it would justify a favorable exercise of administrative discretion. The IJ\u2019s ruling on this point is conclusive because Diack has not shown that it is \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D). Since Diack has not established eligibility for asylum, he is necessarily unable to meet the more rigorous standard that is required for the withholding of removal. <em>See Koliada, </em>259 F.3d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Accordingly, the petition for judicial review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
