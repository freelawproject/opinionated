While Rule 15(c) limits the circumstances in which an amended complaint relates back to the filing of the original pleading, relation back should not be a concern if the amendment is filed within the time allotted by the statute of limitations, which appears to expire on October 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
