Bryan (\u201cDebtor\u201d) appeals pro se the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\u2019s (\u201cBAP\u201d) order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order finding that $104,827.58 of a state court\u2019s judgment in favor of Debtor\u2019s sister, Patricia, is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review de novo decisions of the BAP, and we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>In re Summers, </em>332 F.3d 1240, 1242 (9th Cir.2003). We review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Hall v. Norton, </em>266 F.3d 969, 977 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-23\">We reject Debtor\u2019s contention that the bankruptcy court was bound by the special verdict form awarding punitive damages for fraud in determining what portion of the state court judgment was nondischargeable. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), (a)(6) (providing for nondischargeability of debts for money or property obtained by fraud or willful and malicious injury); <em>In re Comer, </em>723 F.2d 737, 740 (9th Cir.1984) (bankruptcy court is not precluded by judgment from exercising its exclusive jurisdiction to determine the nature of debt for purposes of dischargeability).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-24\">We agree with the BAP that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by denying Debtor the opportunity to depose his niece because he did not point to any evidence, other than his own speculation, that his niece could provide information regarding Patricia\u2019s knowledge of facts he allegedly concealed from her. <em>See Hallett v. Morgan, </em>296 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir. 2002) (court\u2019s decision to deny discovery will be upheld unless the denial results in actual and substantial prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-25\">We agree with the BAP that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the purchase price of the property to measure damages, because the broker\u2019s valuation opinion submitted by Debtor was not dated. <em>See In re Jan Weilert RV, Inc., </em>315 F.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>326 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir.2003) (bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings will be accepted absent clear mistake).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Debtor\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b62-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
