We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history and specification of appellate issues and hold as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo. James v. New York Racing Ass\u2019n, </em>233 F.3d 149, 152 (2d Cir.2000). In making our determination we must resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">Graham, a 56-year-old African-American male, claims that his employer discriminated against him based on age and race by demoting him and replacing him with a younger white woman. The court\u2019s review of both of Graham\u2019s discrimination claims follows the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>James, </em>233 F.3d at 153 (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>to age discrimination claim). Upon reviewing the record, we agree with the district court that: (1) Graham established a prima facie case of discrimination, shifting the burden to the employer; (2) the employer satisfactorily presented a nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action, shifting the burden to Graham; and (3) Graham subsequently did not carry his burden of presenting evidence from which the fact finder could reasonably find that the employer\u2019s reasons were a pretext for discrimination. <em>See Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Patterson v. County of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d 206, 221 (2d Cir.2004). Thus, Graham failed to carry this burden by a preponderance of the evidence and summary judgment dismissing these claims was appropriate. <em>See Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">Graham\u2019s collective bargaining related claims against the union and the employer are based on his assertion that the union breached its duty of fair representation when it declined to bring his grievance to arbitration. If a union breaches its duty of fair representation, an employee can also bring suit against his employer. <em>See Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 186-87, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). To breach its duty of fair representation, a union\u2019s actions must be \u201carbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith,\u201d and seriously undermine the arbitral process. <em>Barr v. United Parcel Serv. Inc., </em>868 F.2d 36, 43 (2d Cir.1989) (citations omitted). Upon reviewing the record, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that it was reasonable for the union to determine that the collective bargaining agreement allowed the employer to make merit-based demotions and did not mandate that all grievances needed to be arbitrated. Because we agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>union did not violate its duty of fair representation, Graham\u2019s claims against the union and the employer are properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
