(\u201cADA\u201d) and the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq. (\u201cFMLA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The matter was initially heard by a magistrate judge who issued a report and recommendation finding that summary judgment should be granted to Sprint on Anthony\u2019s ADA claims because Anthony had failed to present evidence that she requested an accommodation and failed to present either direct evidence of discrimination under the ADA or circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of such discrimination. The magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted to Sprint on the FMLA claims because Anthony had failed to present evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, and, even if such evidence had been presented, Anthony presented no evidence to demonstrate that Sprint\u2019s legitimate reason for terminating Anthony\u2019s employment was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">Anthony timely filed objections to the Report and Recommendation, and the district court issued a lengthy opinion reflecting exhaustive de novo review of those objections, which the district court characterized as \u201cunclear and confused.\u201d Noting that Anthony had not objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation regarding the FMLA claims, the district court held that the objections were without merit, and that Sprint was entitled to summary judgment on the ADA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-21\">Anthony urges on appeal that the district court erred in its disposition of the ADA claims and in its conclusion that Anthony did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s disposition of the FMLA claims. After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, the parties\u2019 briefs and counsels\u2019 arguments, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s opinion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>order. We agree that Anthony failed to preserve any objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that summary judgment be granted to Sprint on the FMLA claims, and, in any event, we find no error in that recommendation. As the opinion of the district court and the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge carefully and correctly set out the law governing the issues raised, and clearly articulate the reasons underlying the decisions, issuance of a full written opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion and the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-22\">.
