Martinez argues that the district court lacked the authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) to order that he serve his federal sentence consecutively to any state sentence that may be imposed against him in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-24\">As Martinez acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991). Martinez raises the argument solely to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-25\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
