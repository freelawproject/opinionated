We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">Canfield argues that Officer Lowe lacked sufficient reliable information to support a finding of reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop. \u201cA temporary detention or seizure of a person is \u2018justifiable under the fourth amendment if there is articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Woods, </em>720 F.2d 1022, 1026 (9th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983)). \u201cReasonable suspicion, like probable cause, is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability.\u201d <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990). \u201cTo determine whether reasonable suspicion existed, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Michael R., </em>90 F.3d 340, 346 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Here, Gallegos called 311 and then reported directly to Officer Lowe that he had seen a stranger in the neighborhood wearing a Hostetler football jersey, black pants and a do-rag on his head two days earlier and again just before he called the police. Gallegos\u2019s nephew had told him that on the prior occasion, the man in the jersey had told him and other neighborhood children that he was a gang member who had committed a drive-by shooting, and that the man had shown a 9mm pistol and removed a clip containing ammunition. Gallegos identified himself to Officer Lowe. No more particularized basis was required for Officer Lowe to stop Canfield and inquire whether he had a gun. <em>See United States v. Terry-Crespo, </em>356 F.3d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir.2004). Nor was it unreasonable to pursue Gallegos\u2019s information because it failed to show criminal activity; the person Gallegos described had said he committed a drive-by shooting. <em>See Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 145-47, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b858-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
