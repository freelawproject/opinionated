He argues that the district court erred in holding that his Nebraska misdemeanor conviction for third degree sexual assault was an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d thereby enhancing his base offense level by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The Government concedes that the eight-level enhancement was erroneous; the elements of the offense of Morales\u2019s misdemeanor state conviction do not describe the sexual abuse of a minor, and the district court was precluded from looking to Morales\u2019s underlying conduct to make such a determination. <em>See United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 603 (5th Cir.2000). We therefore VACATE Morales\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing. In light of the foregoing, the issue whether the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.,5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
