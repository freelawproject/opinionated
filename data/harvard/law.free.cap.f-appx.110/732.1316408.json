INS, </em>118 F.3d 594, 597-98 (8th Cir.1997). Specifically, the BIA and the IJ discredited Lin\u2019s testimony because Lin told different stories relating to central aspects of his asylum claim, his documentary evidence contained inconsistencies, and a forensic report concluded that some of his documentation had been altered. Because it was supported by specific, cogent reasons for disbelief, we defer to the credibility finding. <em>See Nyama v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 812, 817 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (deference standard); <em>Akinwande v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 517, 520 (1st Cir.2004) (alien\u2019s inconsistent testimony was enough to raise doubts about alien\u2019s credibility; alien\u2019s submission of altered documents east further doubt on credibility); <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>1156 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding adverse credibility finding where inconsistencies related to key elements of asylum claim); <em>Daiga v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 797, 798 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (upholding adverse credibility finding where alien gave inconsistent testimony and submitted questionable documents). Lin\u2019s request for withholding of removal thus fails as well. <em>See Kratchmarov v. Heston, </em>172 F.3d 551, 555 (8th Cir.1999) (withholding-of-removal standard is more difficult to meet than asylum standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Finally, we have yet to recognize a due process claim in a deportation proceeding based on ineffective assistance, <em>see Nativi-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>344 F.3d 805, 808 n. 1 (8th Cir.2003), and even if such a claim were cognizable in this circuit, it is clear from the record that counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance did not affect the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Accordingly, we deny Lin\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-16\">. Lin does not appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
