Two officers responded. People near Barnes\u2019s house told the officers that Barnes had been shooting a .22 rifle at them and had gone back inside his house. The officers went to the back of Barnes\u2019s home and saw him standing just inside the storm door. The officers asked Barnes to step outside. One officer testified Barnes motioned for the officers to step inside, and the other officer testified Barnes \u201chollered\u201d for them to enter the residence. After Barnes stepped back into a bedroom of the house, the officers entered the house and again asked Barnes to step outside. Barnes met the two officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>on the back porch. One of the officers patted Barnes down and explained why they were there. Barnes then said, \u201cCome in here, I want to show you something.\u201d Barnes went back into the house, followed by the two officers. Barnes went back into the bedroom and walked over to a dresser. One of the officers stepped into the room. Barnes picked up a .22 caliber starter pistol and gave it to the officer. Barnes said he had been threatened by a group of people and fired the pistol to frighten them away. The officer told Barnes the witnesses reported he had fired a rifle, and Barnes responded, \u201cThere\u2019s not any more guns in this house, you can look all you want to, I don\u2019t own any guns.\u201d Looking into the bedroom through the crack between the door\u2019s hinged side and the door frame, the other officer saw the rifle propped up in the corner. The officer told the other officer he could see a rifle, and the officers seized the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The Government later charged Barnes, a six-time felon, with being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Barnes filed a motion to suppress the rifle, asserting he did not consent to the officers\u2019 entry of his home or their search for a gun. After the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Barnes\u2019s motion to suppress, Barnes conditionally pleaded guilty. Barnes now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On appeal, Barnes contends the testimony of the police officers was inconsistent and incredible, and thus, the district court\u2019s reliance on the officers\u2019 testimony in finding Barnes consented to the search was clearly erroneous. Barnes points to the testimony of his aunt, who arrived after the officers were already coming into the house. According to Barnes\u2019s aunt, the officers found the rifle in a second bedroom and she did not hear the officers request consent to search. \u201c \u2018Because the district court is in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses, its determinations regarding credibility are \u201cvirtually unreviewable on appeal.\u201d \u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>281 F.3d 746, 748 (8th Cir.2002) (quoted cases omitted). We conclude the district court\u2019s decision to credit the officers\u2019 testimony regarding Barnes\u2019s consent is not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>Any inconsistencies in the officers\u2019 testimony about the manner Barnes indicated the officers could enter his house the first time, the history about Barnes\u2019s dispute with his neighbors, the direction that the bedroom door opened, and the timing of a third officer\u2019s arrival, are minor and immaterial to the issue of Barnes\u2019s consent for the officers to enter his home the second time and to look around for guns. Besides, the district court could properly credit the officers\u2019 testimony that one of them saw the rifle in plain view. <em>See United States v. Gillon, </em>348 F.3d 755, 759 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">We thus affirm the denial of Barnes\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The Honorable R.
