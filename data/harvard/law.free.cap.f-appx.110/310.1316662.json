The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Morgan that failure to file timely objections to this recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tion could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Morgan failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Morgan has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny Morgan\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> In his informal brief Morgan seeks to raise, for the first time, a claim pursuant to the recent Supreme Court case of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Even if properly before this court for consideration, <em>Blakely </em>would offer Morgan no relief, because, <em>inter alia, </em>the Supreme Court has not made its ruling in <em>Blakely </em>retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>See In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the precursor to <em>Blakely, </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
