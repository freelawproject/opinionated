On appeal, she contends that the court abused its discretion when it revoked her release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-23\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp.2004). We review factual determinations informing the conclusion that a violation occurred for clear error. <em>United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Whalen, </em>82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir.1996) (finding district court\u2019s credibility determinations concerning evidence presented at a supervised release revocation hearing not reviewable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-24\">Here, the court found Pallo\u2019s testimony that her violations of supervised release were caused by miscommunications to be not credible. In addition, although Pallo provided excuses for failing to meet her financial.and reporting requirements, it is undisputed that she did not comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the conditions of her supervised release. Thus, we find that a preponderance of the evidence supported the district court\u2019s findings. The district court was, therefore, statutorily authorized to revoke supervised release and impose a prison term. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
