Formby petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) sustaining the decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d) adjusting her survivor annuity to eliminate credit for the post-1956 military service of her deceased spouse, Bobby R. Formby. <em>Formby v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>No. AT-0831-03-0266-I-1, 95 M.S.P.R. 577, 2004 WL 231911 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 30, 2004) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). </em>We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b899-25\">Ms. Formby\u2019s husband was in military service for a period of nearly twenty years, from September 6, 1957 until August 19, 1977. He then was in civilian service with the federal government for a period of approximately five years. He died January 1, 1984. As the surviving spouse of a federal employee, Ms. Formby is entitled to a survivor annuity benefit. It is the calculation of that benefit that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-26\">Under Public Law 97-253 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982), a civil service annuitant, or his or her surviving spouse, may receive credit for any post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>1956 active-duty military service completed by the annuitant. However, this credit may be received only if the annuitant, or his or her surviving spouse, submits a deposit equal to seven percent of the annuitant\u2019s basic pay or estimated earnings for the period of military service performed after 1956, plus interest. If this deposit is not submitted, when the annuitant, or his or her surviving spouse, reaches the age at which he or she can receive Social Security benefits, his or her federal civil service annuity payment must be recalculated to exclude the amount of the credit for the post-1956 military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Given the extensive post-1956 military service of her late husband, Ms. Formby was one of those affected by this law. OPM so notified her on October 14, 1991. By letter, OPM informed Ms. Formby that if she did not pay the deposit, it would \u201creduce [her] civil service annuity by excluding credit for this post-1956 military service.\u201d The letter explained in detail the requirements of Public Law 97-253. On November 4, 1991, Ms. Formby responded in a letter indicating that, \u201c[s]ince Public Law 27-253[sic] was passed in 1982, two years before my husband passed away, and I made repeated attempts to find out why my husband\u2019s military service was not used when figuring my Postal Service annuity, I do not feel I should have to pay the 7 percent deposit and certainly not the interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In letters dated January 17, 1992 and March 3, 1992, OPM provided Ms. Formby with its estimate of $12,504.33 as the amount due for the post-1956 military service deposit; the sum was computed using records of Mr. Formby\u2019s basic pay in the Marine Corps. In these letters, OPM again reminded Ms. Formby of the consequences of failing to make a timely deposit: \u201cAs you are aware, you are eligible to make a deposit of 7 percent plus interest, of these earnings to avoid a reduction of your civil service survivor annuity.... Please note, you will not have another opportunity to pay this deposit to cover your late spouse\u2019s post-1956 military service.\u201d The thirty-day deadline for the agency\u2019s receipt of the deposit passed without Ms. Formby submitting the required amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Ten years later, in 2002, Ms. Formby became eligible for Social Security benefits. At that time, OPM notified her that it would not be including credit for Mr. Formby\u2019s post-1956 military service in her survivor annuity. OPM stated: \u201cOur records show that Bobby R. Formby was given the opportunity to make this deposit, but elected not to do so.\u201d It thus computed Ms. Formby\u2019s survivor annuity at a lower rate. Ms. Formby requested reconsideration of the agency\u2019s decision. On December 9, 2002, OPM affirmed its initial decision, restating its view that Ms. Form-by had been adequately provided with the opportunity to make the deposit, but had simply elected not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Ms. Formby then appealed to the Board. Before the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the case was assigned, she testified that, despite receiving OPM\u2019s three letters, \u201cshe was \u2018never apprised\u2019 [sic] of the process and that \u2018no one ever explained\u2019 how she should go about receiving credit for this military service or the ramifications for nonpayment of the 7% deposit.\u201d <em>Formby v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>No. AT-0831-03-0266-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 31, 2003) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). </em>She also testified that \u201cshe simply did not have the money to make the deposit within the 30-day deadline specified by OPM.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. After balancing Ms. Formby\u2019s testimony against the three letters sent by OPM, the AJ concluded in the initial decision that \u201cOPM more than adequately informed the appellant of her duties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>responsibilities regarding receipt of credit for the post-1956 military service of her deceased spouse in her survivor annuity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He went on to find that \u201cthe reason the appellant failed to make the deposit was not because she did not understand the processes and procedures as she has claimed, but rather, because she simply did not have the money necessary to make the deposit....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">After the AJ\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the Board on January 30, 2004, <em>Final Decision </em>at 2, 2004 WL 231911, Ms. Formby filed an appeal with this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>see Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir.1998). We will affirm the factual findings of the Board so long as they are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Brewer v. United States Postal Serv., </em>227 Ct.Cl. 276, 647 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1144, 102 S.Ct. 1005, 71 L.Ed.2d 296 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The standard for reversal has not been met in this case. Having reviewed the decision of the Board, we see no error in its ruling affirming OPM\u2019s calculation of Ms. Formby\u2019s survivor annuity. Under the applicable statutory provisions, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8332\u00a9 and \u00a7 8334\u00a9(1), OPM was required to recompute Ms. Formby\u2019s annuity to exclude the credit for Mr. Formby\u2019s post-1956 military service after she failed to submit the required seven percent deposit. As the record indicates, Ms. Formby received multiple written notices from the agency regarding her rights and obligation under Public Law 97-253; she had ample opportunity to submit the funds necessary to secure the military credit. The AJ correctly noted that Ms. Formby was aware of the deposit requirement, but still declined to participate despite the consequences set forth in OPM\u2019s letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Applying our limited standard of review, we cannot say that the Board, in its affirmance of OPM\u2019s decision, abused its discretion or applied the incorrect law. Its decision was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
