The district court determined that Negrete had failed to establish that his removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair and therefore denied Negrete\u2019s collateral challenge to his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-25\">An alien seeking to collaterally challenge an order of removal in an 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 prosecution must establish (1) that the removal proceeding was \u201c \u2018fundamentally un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>fair\u2019 (2) that the proceeding \u201ceffectively eliminated\u201d his right to challenge the proceeding by means of judicial review; and (3) that \u201cprocedural deficiencies\u201d actually prejudiced him. <em>United States v. Mendozar-Mata, </em>322 F.3d 829, 832 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). If the alien fails to establish one prong of the test, the others need not be considered. <em>See Mendoza-Mata, </em>322 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Negrete argues that his removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair because he was denied the opportunity to apply for relief under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and because the removal order had an impermissible retroactive effect. He also contends that he satisfies the remainder of the requirements to collaterally challenge his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The record reveals that Negrete was represented by counsel at his removal hearing before an immigration judge and that counsel was of the opinion that Negrete was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c). The record also reveals that Negrete argued that he was eligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c) before the Board of Immigration Appeals. Negrete has failed to show that his removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Negrete also argues that because his indictment did not allege the fact of his prior aggravated felony conviction as a separate element of the offense, the indictment charged him only with an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) rather than 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). He contends that his sentence should be limited to the maximum authorized under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Negrete acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but wishes to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, Negrete\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Negrete\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
