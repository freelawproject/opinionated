R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">Marvin R. Washington, a state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">In his complaint filed December 12, 2001, Washington contended defendant Steve Kaiser, the former warden of the Davis Correctional Facility, deprived him of his rights by stealing three gold rings from him in June 1998. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment alleging the claim was barred under the doctrine of res judicata. The district court determined that Washington had presented the same claim in a small claims action which involved the same defendant and the same incident, and that a final judgment was entered in the small claims action. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-23\">Washington contends his claim should not be barred by res judicata because there was no final determination on the merits in the prior small claims action. Even if this were true, his \u00a7 1983 action is barred by the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims arising in Oklahoma is two years. <em>See Meade v. Grubbs, </em>841 F.2d 1512, 1522 (10th Cir.1988). Washington filed his complaint on December 12, 2001, more than two years after the incident allegedly occurred. His claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-24\">Washington also alleges the district judge was biased. Washington offers only conelusory statements and fails to present any evidence beyond showing that the district court ruled against him. Therefore, this argument is insufficiently supported. See <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-25\">AFFIRMED. Washington is reminded of his obligation to continue making partial payments of the appellate filing fee until paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
