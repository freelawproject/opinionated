Elashmouny challenges (i) the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a three-level downward adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 2X1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (November 1, 2000 edition); (ii) the court\u2019s calculation of the total loss attributable to Elashmouny\u2019s frauds at $120,087, resulting in a seven-level increase under the Guidelines; and (iii) the court\u2019s refusal to grant him an aceeptanee-of-responsibility reduction. Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a sentence imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines, we \u2018accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), and \u2018will not overturn the court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts before it unless we conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion. However, [w]here a sentencing court\u2019s application of the guidelines approaches a purely legal question, we employ a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Deming, </em>269 F.3d 107, 109 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Hernandez-Santiago, </em>92 F.3d 97, 100 (2d Cir.1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted)). At sentencing, Elashmouny argued that he was entitled to a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1. The district court was initially inclined to agree [A 88-93], but ultimately denied the reduction on the ground that Elashmouny\u2019s \u201ccore criminality [] was endeavoring to obtain a policy after an accident and then make a claim that the accident was covered by that policy\u201d [A 96], not a simple attempt fraudulently to recover $40,000 under then-existing coverage. On these facts, the district court found that the insurer\u2019s discovery of the fraud occurred not during the course of the claims process, but as a result of an extraneous \u201cinterruption\u201d that took the fraud outside the scope of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1. [A 93-97]. The district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous or a legal error, nor was its decision to deny Elashmouny a \u00a7 2X1.1 deduction an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">At the time Elashmouny committed his crime, the length of a sentence for fraud was calculated in part based on the amount of the loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1. The relevant application notes instruct that \u201cif an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, th[at] figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 n. 8, and that such amount \u201cneed not be determined with precision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 9. During the course of a three-day sentencing hearing the district court made detailed evidentiary findings and ruled that the loss attributable to Elashmouny\u2019s fraud exceeded $120,000. Elashmouny disagrees with the district court\u2019s calculations but offers no basis to conclude that they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Finally, Elashmouny contends that he was improperly denied credit for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. \u201c[A] sentencing court\u2019s evaluation of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is entitled to great deference on review because of the court\u2019s unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Remini, </em>967 F.2d 754, 761 (2d Cir.1992) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhether the defendant has accepted responsibility is a factual question, and [a] district court\u2019s determination in this regard should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>13 F.3d 555, 557 (2d Cir.1994) (citation and quotation omitted). It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>deny Elashmouny\u2019s request; while he pled guilty to all charges without the benefit of a plea bargain, the district court found that he \u201cfrivolously contested some of the relevant conduct ... that the Court ha[d] determined to be true,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>his efforts to defraud the Long Island Jet Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>No. 04-104, 2004 WL 2331491, and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>No. 04-105, 2004 WL 2331491 (to be argued October 4, 2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its order that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
