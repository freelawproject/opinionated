We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The IJ\u2019s decision appears to be based on an implicit adverse credibility finding. For example, the IJ stated that she did not believe that Ang was attacked with a brick in high school or later at aviation school because of his Chinese ethnicity, speculating that Ang\u2019s attackers did not know he was ethnically Chinese. The IJ did not explicitly address Ang\u2019s credibility, however, and did not address Ang\u2019s testimony that his attackers called him \u201cChinese, Chinese.\u201d <em>See Shoafera v. INS, </em>228 F.3d 1070, 1074 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cthe law of this circuit does not permit implicit adverse credibility determinations\u201d). Accordingly, we remand to the BIA to evaluate Ang\u2019s credibility expressly. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b800-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
