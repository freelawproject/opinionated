United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), \u201c[t]he crime defined by [\u00a7 261.5(c) ] qualifies as \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 and hence an aggravated felony if and only if the full range of conduct covered by it falls within the meaning of that term.\u201d <em>United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cIf the state statute is over-inclusive, meaning that conduct that does and does not qualify as an aggravated felony is criminalized, we analyze the statute under a modified categorical approach.\u201d <em>Ruiz-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir.2004) (quotation and citation omitted). Under the modified categorical approach, \u201ccourts may examine the record for documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (quotation and citation omitted). We may examine \u201cthe charging documents in conjunction with the plea agreement, the transcript of a plea proceeding, or the judgment to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>whether the defendant pled guilty\u201d to an aggravated felony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Valdez-Camacho pled <em>nolo contendr\u00e9 </em>and was convicted of violating California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5(c), which criminalizes sex with minors who are three years younger than the perpetrator. Even assuming California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5(c) is overly broad and fails the categorical test, Valdez-Camacho\u2019s conviction nonetheless constitutes an aggravated felony under a modified categorical approach. In the record before us, we are confronted with Valdez-Camacho\u2019s judgment of conviction of California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5(c), which is based on his <em>nolo contendere </em>plea. We are also confronted with a criminal complaint, which charges that Valdez-Camacho had sexual intercourse with a girl, aged 15 years old. \u2018When a defendant pleads guilty (or as here, pleads <em>nolo contendere) </em>to facts stated in the conjunctive, each factual allegation is taken as true.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>47 F.3d 993, 995 (9th Cir. 1995). Valdez-Camacho\u2019s judgment of conviction therefore establishes that he was convicted for having sex with a 15-year-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Under our case law, sexual conduct with a 15-year-old qualifies as \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See United States v. Granbois, </em>376 F.3d 993, 996 (9th Cir.2004) (conviction under federal law for sexual contact with minor between ages of 12 and 16 by perpetrator who is four years older is \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d); <em>United States v. Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d 1148, 1149 (9th Cir.2003) (conviction under Virginia law for \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d without use of force of a child between the ages of 13 and 15 constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d); <em>see also See United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir.1999) (use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires is conduct that falls within the common, everyday meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d). Valdez-Camacho was thus convicted for a crime constituting \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d and he is removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Valdez-Camacho also argues that because his \u00a7 261.5(c) conviction was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor after the BIA\u2019s removal order, he cannot be deemed to have committed an aggravated felony. Under the statute, our review of removal orders is limited to the \u201cadministrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(4)(A); <em>see Silva-Calderon v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1135, 1137 (9th Cir.2004). Because the reduction of Valdez-Camacho\u2019s conviction was not before the BIA, we may not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Even, however, were we allowed to take notice of the reduction, we would still conclude that Valdez-Camacho has been convicted of an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). \u201c \u2018Aggravated felony1 is a term of art created by Congress to describe a class of offenses that subjects aliens convicted of those offenses to certain disabilities. \u2018Aggravated felonies\u2019 are not necessarily a subset of felonies; for instance, an offense classified by state law as a misdemeanor can be an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 ... if the offense otherwise conforms to the federal definition of \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d <em>United States v. Robles-Rodriguez, </em>281 F.3d 900, 902 \u2014 03 (9th Cir.2002). We have already concluded that Valdez-Camacho\u2019s was convicted for conduct that constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d the relevant \u201cfederal definition of \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Pallares-Galan, </em>359 F.3d 1088, 1102 n. 7 (9th Cir.2004) (noting consistency of holding with decisions that \u201cstate misdemeanor convictions relating to child sexual matters constitute aggravated felonies of \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).\u201d). Regardless of the reduction, therefore, Valdez-Camacho has been convicted of an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b841-6\">KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aym\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The majority takes too expansive a view of the modified categorical approach by taking account of things other than \u201cthe charging documents in conjunction with the plea agreement, the transcript of a plea proceeding, or the judgment to determine whether the defendant pled guilty\u201d to an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I think (though there is room for doubt) the authorities we must follow would lead to the same result under the categorical approach, so I am concurring rather than dissenting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-26\">. <em>United States v.
