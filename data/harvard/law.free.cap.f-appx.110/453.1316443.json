He argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He therefore reasons that both the instant conviction as well as his prior illegal reentry conviction must be reduced to convictions under the lesser included offense found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-27\">A defendant may not use the revocation of supervised release to challenge his sentence for the underlying offense based on <em>Apprendi </em>for the first time. <em>United States v. Moody, </em>277 F.3d 719, 720-21 (5th Cir. 2001). Therefore, Carbajal may not challenge his prior illegal reentry conviction in the appeal of the revocation of his supervised release. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-28\">Regardless, as Carbajal acknowledges, his attack on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve it for Supreme Court review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Accordingly, this court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d at 470 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Moreover, in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), this court held that <em>\u201cBlakely </em>does not extend to the federal Guidelines.\u201d A panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
