Alianza, a native and citizen of the Philippines, petitions for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming without opinion an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decisions denying his applications for asylum, withholding of deportation, and suspension of deportation. Alianza also petitions for review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review de novo due process challenges. <em>Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 923 (9th Cir. 2003). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Bolshakov v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1279, 1281 (9th Cir.1998). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-17\">Alianza contends that the IJ denied him due process by restricting the breadth of his direct testimony and refusing to permit his expert witness to testify. This contention fails because Aianza does not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s conduct. <em>See Padilla, </em>334 F.3d at 924-25 (concluding that due process challenge failed because the petitioner could not demonstrate any \u201cplausible ground for relief,\u201d and therefore could not prove the requisite prejudice). The IJ restricted Alianza\u2019s direct testimony only after Alianza\u2019s own attorney\u2019s line of questioning failed to elicit testimony demonstrating a reasonable fear of persecution based on religion or other protected ground. Similarly, the expert witness would have testified only about generalized fears of violence in the Philippines, and Filipino social conventions, but would not have provided any evidence specific to Alianza\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Alianza\u2019s motion to reopen. As to much of the new evidence offered in support of his motion, Alianza has not demonstrated that it was not available at his hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Further, even considering all the new evidence, Alianza has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the requested relief. <em>See Bolshakov, </em>133 F.3d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Alianza\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of the court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
