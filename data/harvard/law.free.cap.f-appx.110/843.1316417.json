We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm Springmeier\u2019s conviction. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not recite them in detail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Springmeier first contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) by aiding and abetting his co-defendant\u2019s use of a firearm during the commission of the bank robbery and, therefore, that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on this count. \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based upon insufficient evidence,\u201d and \u201cask whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 767 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">To sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm, the prosecution must prove \u201ca specific intent to aid the firearms crime and some act that facilitates or encourages that crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>137 F.3d 1094, 1103 (9th Cir.1998) (internal citation omitted). Circumstantial evidence that \u201ca defendant knew before the crime that a gun would be used and acted to facilitate or encourage that use\u201d can support a finding of specific intent to aid and abet use of a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 1103-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">Here, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Springmeier \u201cknew before the crime that a gun would be used and acted to facilitate or encourage that use.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Springmeier\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">Springmeier also contends that the Government violated Springmeier\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment rights to jury trial and assistance of counsel when in its rebuttal closing argument, the Government suggested that Springmeier had informed his counsel of details of the bank robbery \u2014 which only a participant in the robbery would have known \u2014 and thereby implicated Springmeier in the robbery. Because Springmeier did not object at trial to the Government\u2019s comment, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>84 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">The Government\u2019s statement did not seriously affect the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d and thus was not plain error. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>States v. Anderson, </em>201 F.3d 1145, 1149-50 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
