R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">Elmore Marks, Jr., a Kansas state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and dismiss the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-19\">In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Marks alleged \u201congoing conspiracy, and purposeful antisemitic retaliatory animus\u201d for use of the corrections grievance process, racketeering, and confiscation and destruction of legal materials. ROA, Doc. 1. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous and malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c)(2). The court found the complaint \u201cfail[ed] to assert facts which might support a claim for relief,\u201d and that plaintiff \u201cfailed to identify any conduct by a named defendant which arguably states a constitutional deprivation and instead relies upon bare invective.\u201d ROA, Doc. 8 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-20\">An action is frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae if \u201cthe claim [is] based on an indisputably meritless legal theory or if it is founded on \u2018clearly baseless\u2019 factual contentions.\u201d <em>Schlicher v. Thomas, </em>111 F.3d 777, 779 (10th Cir.1997) (internal quotation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s dismissal based on frivolousness for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Like the district court, we construe pro se pleadings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Applying these standards, and after careful review of the record on appeal and all of Marks\u2019 filings with the court, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Marks failed to identify conduct by the named defendants that constituted a constitutional deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We DISMISS the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Dismissal of Marks\u2019 appeal as frivolous counts as a strike against him, as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999). Marks is reminded of his obligation to continue making partial payments of the appellate filing fee until paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
