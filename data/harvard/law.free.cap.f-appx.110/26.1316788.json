It was not arbitrary or capricious for the agency to conclude that its \u201cRoads and Trails\u201d decision fell within the parameters of categorical exclusions 31.1(b)(3), (4) and (5). Nor was it arbitrary or capricious for the agency to conclude that its \u201cFence and Utility Line\u201d decision fell within the parameters of categorical exclusions 31.1(b)(4) and 31.2(2). <em>See Alaska Ctr. for the Env\u2019t v. United States Forest Serv., </em>189 F.3d 851, 857 (9th Cir.1999) (agency interpretation of own categorical exclusion controls unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Because the agency was entitled to treat the \u2018Wildland/Urban Interface\u201d decision as a separate project, Forest Conservation Council\u2019s appeal from the denial of injunctive relief has been mooted by the completion of the environmental assessment for this project. <em>See Aluminum, Co. of Am. v. Admin\u2019r, Bonneville Power Admin., </em>175 F.3d 1156, 1163 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b57-17\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AmL\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">Following Arizona\u2019s June 2002 RodeoChediski fire, the Forest Service authorized tree removal on over 37,000 acres of National Forest land. Appellants claim that the Forest Service violated the National Environmental Protection Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) when it authorized the tree removal project without first conducting a proper Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) or Environmental Assessment (\u201cEA\u201d) to evaluate the project\u2019s environmental impact. Because I agree with Appellants that the Forest Service violated NEPA and disagree with my colleagues\u2019 conclusion to the contrary, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-20\">NEPA established a complex system for evaluating environmental management decisions and the environmental effects of proposed federal agency actions. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1500-08. Depending on a proposed project\u2019s \u201ceffect on the human environment,\u201d NEPA and Council on Environmental Quality (\u201cCEQ\u201d) regulations authorize federal agencies to fulfill their NEPA requirements in one of three ways.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, an agency may prepare an EIS, <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.3, which, if properly completed, will always satisfy an agency\u2019s NEPA requirements, <em>see City of Carmel-by-the-Sea v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Trans., </em>123 F.3d 1142, 1150 (9th Cir. 1997). Second, an agency may prepare a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>less-rigorous EA. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.9. If the EA supports a Finding of No Significant Impact on the environment, the EA satisfies the agency\u2019s NEPA obligations in lieu of an EIS. <em>See Bob Marshall Alliance v. Hodel, </em>852 F.2d 1228, 1224 (9th Cir.1988). Finally, NEPA and CEQ regulations allow agencies to avoid the preparation of either an EIS or an EA if a proposed action properly falls within a Categorical Exclusion. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.4(a)(2) &amp; (b); <em>see also West v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Trans., </em>206 F.3d 920, 926-27 (9th Cir.2000) (describing NEPA requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In this case, the Forest Service did not prepare an EIS or an EA to evaluate the environmental impact of the tree removal project. Instead, the Forest Service divided the project into three sub-parts and authorized each sub-part under the Categorical Exclusions enumerated in its Handbook. <em>See generally </em>Forest Service Handbook. The Forest Service explained its decisions to do so in three separate memoranda \u2014 the \u201cRoads and Trails,\u201d \u201cFence and Utility Line,\u201d and \u201cWild-land/Urban Interface\u201d decision memoranda. As a threshold matter, I disagree with the Majority\u2019s approval of the Forest Service\u2019s \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d use of Categorical Exclusions. <em>Cf. United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). The Majority holds that the Forest Service \u201cwas entitled to treat the \u201cWildland/Urban Interface\u2019 decision as a separate project\u201d and that Appellant \u201cForest Conservation Council\u2019s appeal from the denial of injunctive relief has been mooted by the completion of the environmental assessment for this project.\u201d In my view, the Majority\u2019s conclusion is erroneous. \u201cNEPA ... prohibits] an agency from breaking up a large or cumulative project into smaller components in order to avoid designating the project a major federal action\u201d that would be subject to NEPA analysis requirements. <em>Churchill v. Norton, </em>276 F.3d 1060, 1076 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Appalachian Reg\u2019l Comm\u2019n, </em>677 F.2d 883, 890 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Susquehanna Valley Alliance v. Three Mile Island Nuclear Reactor, </em>619 F.2d 231, 240 (3d Cir.1980). The record is replete with evidence \u2014 albeit mostly circumstantial \u2014 supporting Appellant\u2019s contention that the Forest Service considered the three projects to be one and divided the project into three sub-parts to avoid NEPA analysis requirements and to survive litigation. Because, in my view, the Forest Service\u2019s decision to \u201cbreak[ ] up\u201d the tree removal project so as \u201cto avoid designating the project a major federal action\u201d was improper, <em>see, e.g., Churchill, </em>276 F.3d at 1076, I would hold that Appellant\u2019s challenge to the Forest Service\u2019s \u201cWild-land/Urban Interface\u201d decision is not moot and that the Forest Service is required to prepare either an EIS or an EA for the aggregated tree removal operation as a whole. <em>Compare Aluminum Co. of Am. v. Admin\u2019r, Bonneville Power Admin., </em>175 F.3d 1156, 1163 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that compliance with NEPA during the pendency of litigation challenging an agency\u2019s failure to comply with NEPA will moot the challenge to the agency\u2019s actions and the accompanying request for injunctive relief), <em>with Blue Mountain Biodiversity Project v. Blackwood, </em>161 F.3d 1208, 1214-15 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that appeal challenging an EA concerning one part of a five-part project was not moot where the Forest Service erred in segmenting project and not analyzing it under NEPA as a whole).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Even if I were to agree that the Forest Service properly divided the tree removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>project into three sub-parts (which, for the reasons above I do not), I cannot agree with the Majority\u2019s determination that the Forest Service\u2019s use of Categorical Exclusions was not \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In <em>West, </em>we concluded that the authorization of \u201can entirely new, $18.6 million, four-lane, \u2018fully-directional\u2019 interchange constructed over a former Superfund site and requiring 500,-000 cubic yards of fill material, 30,000 tons of crushed surfacing, and 32,000 tons of asphalt concrete pavement\u201d was an arbitrary and capricious application of the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Categorical Exclusion for \u201cchanges in [highway] access control.\u201d 206 F.3d at 928. In particular, we found that \u201c[n]one of the examples\u201d of projects properly authorized by the Categorical Exclusion \u2014 \u201cresurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, reconstruction, adding shoulders, or adding auxiliary lanes;\u201d \u201cthe installation of ramp metering control devices and lighting;\u201d and \u201cbridge rehabilitation, reconstruction or replacement or the construction of grade separation to replace existing at-grade railroad crossings,\u201d \u2014 \u201capproache[d] the magnitude of th[e]\u201d Federal Highway Administration\u2019s interchange project. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Bound as we are by <em>West, </em>I cannot agree with the Majority\u2019s determination that the Forest Service\u2019s \u201cRoads and Trails\u201d and \u201cFence and Utility Line\u201d decisions were properly authorized by the Forest Service\u2019s Categorical Exclusions. Nor can I find that the Forest Service\u2019s \u201cWild-land/Urban Interface\u201d decision was properly authorized by the Forest Service\u2019s Categorical Exclusions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The removal of trees on 14,951 acres of National Forest land, as authorized by the Forest Serviced \u201cRoads and Trails\u201d decision, has nothing to do with the examples of actions properly excludable under the Categorical Exclusions listed in the Forest Service\u2019s Handbook: e.g., mowing lawns, replacing roofs, painting buildings, applying pesticides, resurfacing roads, grading a road, pruning vegetation, posting landline boundaries, applying herbicides to control poison ivy in camp grounds, applying insecticides at recreation sites, repaving a parking lot, and applying pesticides for rodent or vegetation control. <em>See </em>Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, \u00a7\u00a7 31.1(b)(3), (4), &amp; (5). Similarly, the removal of trees on 3,008 acres of National Forest land, as authorized by the Forest Service\u2019s \u201cFences and Utility Lines\u201d decision, has nothing to do with the examples of actions properly excludable under the Categorical Exclusions listed in the Forest Service\u2019s Handbook: e.g., resurfacing roads, grading a road, pruning vegetation, posting landline boundaries, replacing an underground cable trunk, or reconstructing a power line. <em>See </em>Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, \u00a7\u00a7 31.1(b)(4) &amp; 31.2(2). Finally, the removal of trees on 19,365 acres of National Forest land, as authorized by the Forest Service\u2019s \u2018Wildland/Urban Interface\u201d decision, has nothing to do with the examples of actions properly excludable under the Categorical Exclusions listed in the Forest Service\u2019s Handbook: e.g., thinning or brush control to improve growth or to reduce fire hazard, the opening of an existing road to a dense timber stand, and prescribed burning. <em>See </em>Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, \u00a7 31.2(6). In this respect, I agree with the district court that the Forest Service\u2019s Wildland/Urban Interface\u201d decision was not properly authorized by the Forest Service\u2019s Categorical Exclusions. <em>See Forest Conservation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>No. CV-03-0054-PCT-FJM, 2003 WL 23281957, *3-*4 (D.Ariz. July 9, 2003). \u201c[T]he Forest Service\u2019s interpretation of categorical exclusion 31.2(6) [and application to its Wild-land/Urban Interface decision] is inconsistent \u2022with its terms and is therefore plainly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>None \u201cof the examples [given in the Forest Service\u2019s Handbook] support such a vast program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Because I believe that the Majority has improperly relieved the Forest Service of its obligation to properly evaluate with either an EIS or an EA the environmental impact of its tree removal operation, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-21\">. NEPA created the CEQ, which is the agency that administers NEPA and promulgates environmental regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4342, 4344(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">.
