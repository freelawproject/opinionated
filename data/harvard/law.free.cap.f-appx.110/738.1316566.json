Having carefully conducted de novo review, <em>see Meyers v. Neb. Health and Human Servs., </em>324 F.3d 655, 658-59 (8th Cir.2003), we agree with the district court that the instant complaint is untimely, and that neither Wells\u2019s illness nor his lack of counsel during the period of time when he was required to file his suit justifies equitable tolling of the limitations period. We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel for Wells in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Wells\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-12\">. The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
