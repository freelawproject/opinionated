Morales (\u201cMorales\u201d) is incarcerated in the Sierra Conservation Center Prison Facility in Jamestown, California. On July 20, 2000, Morales filed a <em>pro se </em>class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California alleging that prison officials violated the class members\u2019 First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by, <em>inter alia, </em>keeping them in \u201clockdown\u201d following a prison riot and restricting prisoners\u2019 diet and exercise regimes, denying medical visits, phone use, visits and participation in work, school, library and self-help programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-20\">The district court dismissed petitioner\u2019s complaint, <em>sua sponte, </em>on the ground that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-21\">After the district court\u2019s decision in this case, we issued a decision in <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Alameida v. Wyatt, </em>540 U.S. 810, 124 S.Ct. 50, 157 L.Ed.2d 23 (2003), in which we held that a district court may not dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>a petitioner\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Rather, the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement is a defense that must be raised and proved by the <em>defendants </em>and is not required to be pleaded in petitioner\u2019s complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-22\">In light of our decision in <em>Wyatt, </em>the State agrees that remand is appropriate in this case. <em>See </em>Amicus Brief of the California Office of the Attorney General at 2-3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Therefore, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s complaint and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings consistent with <em>Wyatt v. Terhune.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b864-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-23\">. The California Department of Corrections declined to file a brief in this case. Accordingly, on January 15, 2004, we ordered the California Attorney General\u2019s Office to enter an appearance in this appeal for purposes of filing an amicus brief and to appear for oral argument. <em>See </em>Order filed January 15, 2004. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>In its brief filed on June 7, 2004, the California Attorney General\u2019s Office suggested that \"this court remand this case to the district court for proceedings in accord with <em>Wyatt.\u201d See </em>Amicus Brief of the California Office of the Attorney General at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
