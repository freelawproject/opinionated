In this appeal, Defendant argues the district court erred in ruling that Defendant\u2019s commission of an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(b)(2) is not an element of the illegal reentry offense for which Defendant was charged. Additionally, Defendant contends that the district court committed error in holding that it had no authority to grant his motion for a downward departure pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A6x\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b549-23\">On April 18, 2002, a federal grand jury indicted Defendant for unlawfully reentering this country after being deported for committing an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(a)(2) and (b)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Defendant then entered a plea of not guilty on April 26, 2002. On July 80, 2002, Defendant changed his plea to guilty as charged in the indictment. On September 24, 2002, the government filed its position regarding sentencing factors. On October 30, 2002, Defendant then filed his position regarding sentencing factors and a motion for a downward departure pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Exactly a week later, the government filed its response to Defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the sentencing factors and motion for downward departure. Subsequently, the district court sentenced Defendant to forty-six months of imprisonment, followed by two years of supervised release, based on his guilty plea. On January 15, 2003. Defendant filed a notice of appeal with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The facts are taken from the record before the district court. On March 31, 2002, a state trooper with the Tennessee Highway Patrol clocked Defendant\u2019s vehicle traveling above the posted speed limit. After the state trooper stopped Defendant, a check of his driver\u2019s license revealed that he was previously deported from the United States and had illegally reentered the country. The INS was contacted and an investigation revealed that Defendant had been previously deported after serving a sentence for smuggling aliens. Defendant plead guilty to illegally reentering the country, but objected to the sixteen-level enhancement of his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines. Before the district court, Defendant argued that the enhancement was improper because the maximum penalty for reentering the country illegally, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), is 2 years. Defendant admits that, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), the maximum penalty for a prior aggravated felony is twenty years imprisonment. He argued, however, for a discretionary departure from the guideline provisions because he is a foreigner and would not be entitled to the community confinement program during the last six months of his imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(c). Thus, Defendant urged the district court that a fair sentence would be thirteen months in prison followed by the \u201cmaximum term of supervised release.\u201d (Defendant\u2019s Br. at 6). Defendant also urged the district court to depart from the guideline sentence because of his foreign status, but the district court advised Defendant that it was \u201cnot in the foreign policy business\u201d and was \u201cbound by the Guidelines.\u201d (J.A. at 46). After Defendant was sentenced on the low end of the guideline range, this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Defendant first challenges the enhancement of his sentence. A defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to his or her sentence is a question of law requiring <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>181 F.3d 740, 743 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>73 F.3d 1414, 1417 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Defendant argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a distinct offense from 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and, therefore, the district court erred in concluding that Defendant was properly subject to a sentence enhancement under the former statutory section because he violated the latter statutory section. The statutory provisions in dispute provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">(a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding and thereafter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASg\">(2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, unless (A) prior to this reembarkation at a place outside the United States or his application for admission from foreign contiguous territory, the Attorney General has expressly consented to such alien\u2019s reapplying for admission; or (B) with respect to an alien previously denied admission and removed, unless such alien shall establish that he was not required to obtain such advance consent under this chapter or any prior Act, shall be fined under Title 18, or <em>imprisoned not more than 2 years, </em>or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">(b) Criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed aliens</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcX\">Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any alien described in such subsection....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">(2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under such Title, <em>imprisoned not more than 20 years, </em>or both</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzR\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2) (emphasis added). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) does not announce a distinct offense from 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). <em>Id. </em>at 241. Instead, the former subsection \u201cinvolves a sentencing factor\u2014 the prior commission of an aggravated felony \u2014 that is neither \u2018presumed\u2019 to be present, nor need to be \u2018proved\u2019 to be present, in order to prove the commission of the relevant crime [under the latter subsection].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Subsequent to <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>the Court decided the seminal case of <em>Apprendi, </em>preserving a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have a jury find every fact that increases a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 481. <em>Apprendi </em>expressly preserved the rule in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>reasoning that the latter ease is \u201cat best an exceptional departure from this rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473. More recently, this Court applied <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>and concluded that the former case represented the law in this circuit regarding whether a prior conviction was a sentencing factor in a federal three strikes statute or a separate crime under the same. <em>See United States v. Gatewood, </em>230 F.3d 186, 192 (6th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In the instant case, Defendant recognizes that \u201cSixth Circuit law is against him,\u201d but contends that the case should be \u201cremanded for re-sentencing without the enhanced penalty.\u201d (Defendant\u2019s Br. at 13). Defendant does not contest that he was convicted of illegally transporting aliens, an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. Nor does Defendant dispute that he illegally reentered the country after being deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence in <em>Apprendi </em>suggests that the slim majority in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>would be no more if the case were decided today. Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Apprendi </em>indicated that his agreement with the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>majority was error. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 520 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\u201c[0]ne of the chief errors of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u2014 an error to which I succumbed \u2014 was to attempt to discern whether a particular fact is traditionally (or typically) a basis for a sentencing court to increase an offender\u2019s sentence.\u201d). This Court in <em>Gatewood </em>recognized the potential weakness of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>but concluded that the former case \u201cremains the law\u201d on whether a prior conviction referenced in a statute serves as a separate offense or a sentencing factor. <em>Gatewood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>230 F.3d at 192. The specific holding of <em>Apprendi </em>does support the <em>Gatewood </em>court\u2019s conclusion, however. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490 <em>(\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We believe <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>controls the outcome of this issue. Defendant violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2) by reentering this country after being deported for committing the aggravated felony of trafficking in illegal aliens, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. Defendant\u2019s sentence was appropriately enhanced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because he committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d by trafficking illegal aliens and subsequently illegally reentering this country, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Because the government appropriately charged Defendant in the indictment with violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(2) and (b)(2), and the latter plead guilty to violation of the statutes, Defendant\u2019s sentence of forty-six months imprisonment was within the permissible range under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Defendant\u2019s final contention is that the district court erred in determining that it had no authority to make a downward departure. A district court\u2019s determination that it lacked authority to depart downward under the federal sentencing guidelines is a question of legal interpretation reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Hawkins, </em>274 F.3d 420, 426 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Jackson, </em>181 F.3d at 743. <em>But cf. United States v. Galvan-Perez, </em>291 F.3d 401, 404 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s [actual] downward departure at sentencing for an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>264 F.3d 640, 646 (6th Cir.2001). Generally, a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart from the guidelines is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Burke, </em>237 F.3d 741, 743 (6th Cir.2001). A district court\u2019s determination that it lacked authority to depart from the sentencing guidelines, however, is an appealable issue. <em>See id; see also United States v. Ebolum, </em>72 F.3d 35, 37 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">On this final issue, Defendant recognizes that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ebolum </em>prevents a downward departure on the basis of Defendant\u2019s deportable alien status, but Defendant asks this Court to reconsider <em>Ebolum </em>in light of the \u201cliberal departure policy\u201d of <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). (Defendant\u2019s Br. at 16). In <em>Koon, </em>the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling that negated the district court\u2019s discretionary downward departure of several police officers\u2019 sentences based on, among other factors, the fact that the victim (the infamous Rodney King) prodded the officers\u2019 violence against him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the fact that the officers were not a threat to society. <em>Koon. </em>518 U.S. at 103-14. The <em>Koon </em>majority focused on the substantive and legislative history of the sentencing guidelines departure provisions and concluded that the discretionary departure provisions in the guidelines were meant to be applied liberally. <em>Id. </em>at 98. In <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>188 F.3d 354 (6th Cir. 1999) <em>(en </em>banc), this Court applied <em>Koon </em>and concluded that a district court cannot \u201ccategorically exclude any non-prohibited factors from consideration for a downward departure.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>188 F.3d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The defendant in <em>Coleman </em>supplied drugs to an undercover law enforcement agent on several occasions and was eventually convicted of several federal drug offenses. <em>Id. </em>At sentencing, the defendant filed a motion for downward departure on the basis that the government employed improper techniques to lure the defendant, and other African-Americans who were on parole, to commit drug offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 357. The district court reasoned that the defendant\u2019s motion raised a selective prosecution issue and was not properly brought at the sentencing phase of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the district court did not bother to consider whether the defendant\u2019s case was outside the \u201cthe typical heartland of cases embodying the conduct that each [relevant] Guideline describes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358 (citing <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 106-07) (internal citations omitted). This Court reasoned that the district court committed error in failing to consider whether the defendant\u2019s motion for downward departure raised an atypical circumstance outside the \u201cheartland\u201d of craek/eocaine cases, which might entitle the defendant to a downward departure. <em>Id. </em>at 362 (\u201c[W]e hold that the district court erred by failing to consider all of the particular circumstances of this case to determine whether the case was removed from the \u2018heartland\u2019 of crack cocaine cases.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In the instant case, the district court concluded that it could not depart downward from Defendant\u2019s sentence because it was \u201cnot in the foreign policy business\u201d and therefore was \u201cbound by the Guidelines for these purposes.\u201d (J.A. at 45-46). The district court\u2019s reluctance to depart downward, thus, presents an appealable issue for this Court to review. <em>See Ebolum, </em>72 F.3d at 37. Defendant argues that the district court\u2019s statement that it was \u201cnot in the foreign policy business\u201d indicated the court\u2019s failure to consider whether this nation\u2019s war on terrorism and Defendant\u2019s status as a deportable alien would be appropriate considerations that might mandate a departure from the \u201cheartland\u201d of illegal alien reentry cases. (Defendant\u2019s Br. at 17). The government, on the other hand, argues that it was \u201cclear\u201d from the district court\u2019s comment that it was \u201cnot in the foreign policy business\u201d that the court considered Defendant\u2019s departure argument and \u201cfound that the declared war on terrorism did not fall outside of the heartland of cases covered by the [Sentencing Guidelines].\u201d (Government Br. at 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Based on <em>Coleman </em>and the factual circumstances of this case, we agree with the government\u2019s conclusion that the district court considered the factual circumstances of Defendant\u2019s case and determined it was not outside the \u201cheartland\u201d of illegal alien reentry cases. The district court did consider Defendant\u2019s factual circumstance and concluded that Defendant\u2019s circumstance was contemplated by the sentencing com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>mission. Application note one of the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines support the district court\u2019s view that the sentencing commission considered the war on terrorism when it drafted that guidelines provision. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application n. 1. (defining terrorism broadly). Moreover, as Defendant concedes, deportable alien status must have been considered by the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 commissioners when they drafted guideline sections that invariably applied to illegal aliens. <em>See Ebolum, </em>72 F.3d at 37-38. We therefore agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the factual circumstance of this case brings it within the \u201cheartland\u201d of cases of illegal alien reentry contemplated by \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s most recent opinion in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>-U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), expanding Apprendi\u2019sreach, does not alter our conclusion. In that case, the court determined that an \"exceptional circumstance\u201d aggravating (sentencing) factor in a state statute that increased the petitioner\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum of the crime to which the defendant pleaded guilty was unconstitutional because a jury did not determine the defendant's guilt as to that aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. In the instant case, the sentencing factor that increased Defendant\u2019s sentence was a <em>prior conviction </em>for trafficking illegal aliens in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. Therefore, this case is excepted from Apprendi\u2019s and, ergo, <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>dictate that a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt every fact that increases a defendant's sentence beyond the statutory maximum. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490; <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">. It is important for a district court to consider whether a particular factual scenario is outside the \"heartland\u201d of cases that the sentencing guidelines considers typical because if the facts are atypical for the particular offense under the sentencing guideline, then the district court would be mandated to depart downward consistent with guideline provisions and case law. <em>See Coleman, </em>188 F.3d at 358-362.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
