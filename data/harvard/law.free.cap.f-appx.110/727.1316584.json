Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 915, 917-19 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">Abdirahman raises numerous challenges to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings, relying often on statements- \u2014 some of which are taken out of context, or are incorrect \u2014 - from a manual prepared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for training asylum officers. We find such reliance misplaced. <em>Cf. Prokopenko v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 941, 944 (8th Cir.2004) (it is doubtful that internal agency memorandum could bind INS or confer substantive legal benefits on aliens). We agree with the BIA that the IJ\u2019s reasoning is \u201cnot without its weaknesses,\u201d but nonetheless we find that the IJ gave multiple valid reasons for finding Abdirahman\u2019s testimony not credible and for discounting the affidavits offered by Abdirahman from two Somalis. <em>See id. </em>at 945 (when IJ has articulated specific and cogent reasons for discrediting petitioner, credibility determination deserves deference; IJ may properly request corroborating evidence if alien\u2019s credibility is in question); <em>cf. Escudero-Corona v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 608, 612 (8th Cir.2001) (finding no reversible error in decision to grant little weight to affidavit because, inter alia, no other evidence existed corroborating petitioner\u2019s assertions about living in California during period at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>issue, and petitioner could have called her mother as witness on issue but did not).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Because we defer to the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, Abdirahman\u2019s arguments about the IJ\u2019s alternative findings regarding the merits and discretionary denial of asylum need not be considered; and because his asylum claim fails, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well. <em>See Lopez-Zeron v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>8 F.3d 636, 638 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (standard for withholding of removal is more difficult to meet than standard for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-15\">. Abdirahman does not raise the denial of his application for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Hasalla v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 799, 805 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-19\">.
