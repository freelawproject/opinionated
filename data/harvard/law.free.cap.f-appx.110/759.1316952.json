Because the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1074 (9th Cir.2004). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition in part, deny the petition in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">Adverse credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>evidence. There are numerous inconsistencies in Hannan\u2019s testimony that, in addition to his non-responsive answers to simple questions regarding his biographical history, undermine his credibility. Moreover, Hannan was unable to answer basic questions regarding his religion.s</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Hannan necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Claims under CAT may not be dismissed solely on the basis of an adverse credibility determination in asylum proceedings when evidence on the record suggests the petitioner may face torture if returned to his home country. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283-84 (9th Cir.2001). There is evidence in the record that Iraqi\u2019s who did not support the Ba\u2019ath party were tortured and put to death and that Chaldean Christians were subjected to human rights abuses. Thus, the IJ\u2019s failure to consider this \u201cprobative evidence in the record of country conditions\u201d and the IJ\u2019s denial of the CAT claim solely on the basis of the adverse credibility determination in the asylum proceedings was an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. We remand the petition for review under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Petition GRANTED in part, DENIED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b789-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
