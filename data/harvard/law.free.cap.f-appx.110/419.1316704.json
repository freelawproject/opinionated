Espinoza challenges as \u201carbitrary and irrational\u201d the IJ\u2019s determination that he had failed to establish either the statutory requirement of 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States or that his four children would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if the family were removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-24\">Because this case involves the granting of relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae is implicated. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). The jurisdiction-stripping provision eliminates jurisdiction over those decisions that involve the exercise of discretion. <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s determination that Espinoza\u2019s children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Espinoza were deported to Mexico involved the exercise of discretion. <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.Bd 831 (5th Cir.2004), 380 F.3d 831, 2004 WL 1747388 at *1. Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination on hardship, and Espinoza\u2019s petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
