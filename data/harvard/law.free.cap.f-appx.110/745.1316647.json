Quidachay contends that (1) a new trial is necessary on the basis of exculpatory post-conviction statements by a recanting witness and (2) the imposition of restitution was illegal under Guam law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">A motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence must meet the following requirements: (1) the motion must make clear that the evidence was discovered after the trial; (2) the motion must allege facts from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the moving party; (3) the evidence relied upon must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence must be material to the issues involved; and (5) the evidence would probably produce an acquittal. <em>See United States v. Cervantes, </em>542 F.2d 773, 779 (9th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The purportedly exculpatory evidence satisfies the first four prongs of the analysis. As to the fifth, Quidachay argues that, because the testimony the recanting witness \u2014 his brother \u2014 was the key to the prosecution\u2019s case, such evidence would probably produce his acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">\u201cThe decision, when based upon the proper legal standard, to grant or deny a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Krasny, </em>607 F.2d 840, 845 (9th Cir.1979) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Montilla-Rivera, </em>115 F.3d 1060, 1067 (1st Cir.1997) (\u201cIn considering [a motion for a new trial], the [trial] court has broad power to ... assess the credibility of both the witnesses who testified at trial and those whose testimony constitutes \u2018new evidence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Wright, </em>625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir.1980))).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">The trial judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding as to the testimony of Quidachay\u2019s brother at the hearing for a new trial is unassailable. To begin, the notion that Quidachay\u2019s brother engaged in a sudden flurry of criminal activity with a stranger (of unknown surname and residence) whom he met at a bar is implausible. As the trial judge noted, Quidachay\u2019s brother testified in a \u201ctentative\u201d manner at the hearing for a new trial, and \u201chis answers to questions were unsure.\u201d Furthermore, there is no evidence that Quidachay\u2019s brother ever attempted to implicate his unnamed accomplice during the initial questioning following his arrest. As aptly put by the district court, the testimony of Quidachay\u2019s brother at the hearing for a new trial seems \u201can attempt by one broth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>er to save the other after the former thought he had reaped the benefits of his cooperation [with the government].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Thus, the district court did not err in denying Quidachay\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Quidachay also submits that, since he has been sentenced to a 120-year term of imprisonment and will not be eligible for release before 75 years of imprisonment, it will be impossible for him to pay restitution. Therefore, his argument goes, the imposition of restitution violates the Guam restitution statute providing that a trial court may not order a defendant to pay restitution \u201cunless the offender is or, given a fair opportunity to do so, will be able to pay the fine or restitution.\u201d 9 Guam Code Annotated \u00a7 80.52(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Since Quidachay did not raise this issue in his first appeal to the district court, we review the imposition of restitution for plain error. Under the plain error standard, relief is unwarranted unless there has been (1) error (2) that is plain (3) and affects substantial rights. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 389, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Given the trial court\u2019s broad discretion in ordering restitution, <em>see United States v. Laney, </em>189 F.3d 954, 966 (9th Cir.1999), and lack of a substantial right at issue, the trial court\u2019s restitution order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">We AFFIRM the judgement of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b776-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
