He argues that his sentence should have been reduced based upon a 2002 amendment to the background commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 640 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-24\">Because Amendment 640 is not an amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), p.s. and because Burton is seeking relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), he is not entitled to take advantage of the amendment whether it contained substantive changes or merely clarified the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Davidson, </em>283 F.3d 681, 684 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217 (5th Cir.1996). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Burton\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence based upon Amendment 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-25\">Because Burton has not demonstrated a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, he cannot proceed IFP. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a); <em>see Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Because his appeal is without arguable merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Burton that further frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-26\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
