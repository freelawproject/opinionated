We agree with the district court that this provision calls for the payment of simple interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The policy contemplates interest only on accrued benefits or the amount of the claim. It says nothing of any interest owing on that interest or of any interest owing on the balance due. <em>Cf., Exxon Corp. v. Crosby-Mississippi Resources, Ltd., </em>40 F.3d 1474, 1488 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that a contract provision that \u201cthe unpaid balance shall bear interest monthly at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum\u201d (emphasis added) required compound interest). We note that this is in accord with the general common law preference for simple interest absent express authorization otherwise. <em>See Stovall v. Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Co., </em>722 F.2d 190, 192 (5th Cir.1984). We have no reason to believe the Mississippi Supreme Court would not follow the general common law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-19\">. Because this is a diversity case, we apply Mississippi substantive law. <em>Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). No Mississippi court has ruled on the precise issue here, so we make an Erie guess as to what the Mississippi Supreme Court would likely do. <em>Herrmann Holdings Ltd. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>302 F.3d 552, 558 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
