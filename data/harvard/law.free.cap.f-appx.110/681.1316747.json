The district court granted summary judgment for Ver-A-Fast, finding that verifiers were independent contractors, not employees, and therefore were not covered by the anti-discrimination laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-22\">On appeal, the plaintiff first complains that the district court misapplied the summary judgment standard required by Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c), because the judge dismissed the action after \u201c[wjeighing all the above factors.... \u201d \u2018Weighing,\u201d the plaintiff insists, \u201cis impermissible in the summary judgment situation.\u201d This statement is correct, of course, but only as far as weighing <em>factual matters </em>is concerned. In this case, however, the factors mentioned by the district court were the <em>legal aspects </em>of the analysis necessary to determine whether the defendant\u2019s \u201cverifiers\u201d were employees or independent contractors. The district court decided, after applying the correct standard, that they were the latter rather than the former and, therefore, not covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-23\">Having had the benefit of oral argument, and having studied the briefs and the record on appeal, we are not convinced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint against the defendant. Because the reasons why summary judgment should be granted to the defendant have been thoroughly and correctly articulated by the district court, the issuance of a detailed opinion by this court would be superfluous. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court based on the reasoning set out in that court's memorandum of opinion dated May 15, 2003.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
