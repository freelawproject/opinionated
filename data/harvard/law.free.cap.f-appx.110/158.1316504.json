Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">McCullough seeks damages pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), arising from the misdelivery of his mail by the Clerk\u2019s Office. The gravamen of McCullough\u2019s complaint is that the misdelivery resulted in an invasion of his privacy by whomever received and (presumably) opened his mail. To state a cause of action under the FTCA, McCullough was required \u201cto establish that, under New York law, a private actor could be found hable in tort for the unauthorized opening of another\u2019s mail.\u201d <em>Hurwitz v. United States, </em>884 F.2d 684, 686 (2d Cir.1989). New York does not recognize a cause of action for such a tort, thus the district court correctly dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction. And even if New York courts recognized a privacy tort arising from the misdelivery or unauthorized opening of mail, the FTCA exempts from its waiver of sovereign immunity \u201cany claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b), a classification broad enough to encompass the claims raised here, <em>see, e.g., Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>378 F.2d 812, 813-15 (2d Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
