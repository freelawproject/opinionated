Plaintiff Benny Watson alleged that Officer Stromeyer used excessive force in handcuffing Watson following his arrest for stealing a beer from a convenience store and that he wrongfully sprayed Watson with mace while Watson was incarcerated in a police station holding cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">Officer Stromeyer argues that the magistrate judge<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> misapplied the burden of proof in evaluating his claims of qualified immunity; that both excessive force claims are barred under the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey</em><footnotemark><em>***</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>and that he did not violate Watson\u2019s constitutional rights. He argues in the alternative that his conduct was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">We find no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s analysis of Officer Stromeyer\u2019s claims of qualified immunity. Watson\u2019s excessive force claims are not barred under <em>Heck </em>because a resolution of the claims in Watson\u2019s favor would not necessarily implicate the validity of any of his criminal convictions. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87 fn. 6-7. Our review of the undisputed material facts leads us to conclude that Watson has defeated summary judgment based on qualified immunity by alleging the violation of a constitutional right and because the undisputed material facts do not show that Officer Stromeyer\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable. <em>Spann v. Rainey, </em>987 F.2d 1110, 1115 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Gutierrez v. City of San Antonio, </em>139 F.3d 441, 447 (5th Cir.1998). The magistrate judge did not err in denying Officer Stromeyer\u2019s motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b422-20\"> The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b422-21\">512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
