Milton requests that we review the order of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims granting the motion of the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to dismiss Mr. Milton\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a). Because we lack jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, we <em>dismiss </em>the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">On May 3, 2003, Mr. Milton sent a letter to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that he described as his notice of appeal from the Board\u2019s December 15, 1980 decision. The Department of Veterans Affairs (\u2018VA\u201d) Regional Office wrote back to Mr. Milton on July 18, 2003, advising him that any notice of appeal from the Board decision \u201cshould have been submitted directly to the Court of Veterans Appeals,\u201d within \u201c180 days\u201d of the date of his notification letter. On August 25, 2003, Mr. Milton filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, listing \u201cJuly 18, 2003\u201d as the date of the Board decision appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">On October 10, 2003, the Secretary moved to dismiss Mr. Milton\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that there was no record of any Board decision on July 18, 2003 concerning Mr. Milton. After the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reviewed Mr. Milton\u2019s submissions and granted Mr. Milton\u2019s motion for reconsideration of its November 21, 2003 grant of the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court ultimately dismissed Mr. Milton\u2019s appeal on January 21, 2004. It found that \u201cthere is no final [Board] decision concerning [Mr. Milton] dated July 18, 2003,\u201d and explained that \u201c[b]ecause there is no final decision of the [Board] to review, [the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] does not have jurisdiction to address these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is highly circumscribed. The order dismissing Mr. Milton\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction did not address or depend on any issue of validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation, and Mr. Milton raises no such issues. His challenge is directed to the court\u2019s interpretation of facts, which we are not authorized to review. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) (\u201cExcept to the extent that an appeal under this chapter presents a constitutional issue, the Court of Appeals may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d). Whether or not there was a Board decision on July 18, 2003 is a matter of fact in our view. Even if, in a particular case, the issue of whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Board decision exists turns on the content and characteristics of an opinion, here it does not. The finding of no July 18 decision in this case rested on the affidavit of an employee who reviewed all Board decisions involving Mr. Milton and found none dated July 18, 2003. Therefore, in this case, there can be no doubt that the issue is purely factual. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the dismissal decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and thus dismiss Mr. Milton\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
