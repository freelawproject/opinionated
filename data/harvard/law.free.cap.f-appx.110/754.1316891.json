See Fed.

By leaving the United States, Villalvaso withdrew his appeal, thereby rendering his deportation order final and terminating his legal permanent resident (LPR) status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1001.1(p). Without LPR status, Villalvaso is ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of deportation. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 295, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Our decision in <em>Aguilera-Ruiz v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 835, 836 (9th Cir.2003) confirms this conclusion. In <em>Aguilerctr-Ruiz, </em>we held that \u201c8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4 has no exception for \u2018brief, casual, and innocent\u2019 departures. No basis appears for engrafting one onto it[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838. Thus, \u201c[v]oluntarily leaving the country under an order of deportation amounts to self-deportation because it executes the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And because \u201cthe plain language of the regulation controls ... <em>any </em>voluntary departure from the United States following entry of an order of deportation will be deemed to withdraw a pending appeal and to render the order of deportation final[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839. (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">We recognize that we recently held in <em>Martinez-de Bojorquez v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 800 (9th Cir.2004), that \u201cthe application of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4 without any notice whatsoever constitute[s] a violation of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806. Unlike the petitioner in <em>Martinez-de Bojorquez, </em>however, Villalvaso did not raise a constitutional argument on appeal, and does not contend that he was never warned about the severe effect of even a brief departure from the United States. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 803. Consequently, <em>Martinez-de Bojorquez </em>is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">Villalvaso\u2019s reliance on <em>Butros v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 1142 (9th Cir.1993) (en banc) is also misplaced. In <em>Butros, </em>we held that \u201cas long as the [BIA] may reconsider or reopen [a] case, the status of the petitioner in that case for purposes of section 212(c) relief has not been finally determined for purposes of action by the Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1145 (citation omitted). In this case, however, the BIA erroneously granted Villalvaso\u2019s Motion to Reopen \u2014 an understandable mistake given that Villalvaso\u2019s August 1993 departure remained undiscovered at that time. But under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2, the BIA could not, in fact, reopen Villalvaso\u2019s case. Thus, by temporarily leaving the United States, Villalvaso withdrew his appeal, which rendered his deportation order final, terminated his LPR status, <em>and </em>barred him from filing a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Villalvaso also contends that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4 is a legislative, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>than an interpretive, rule and is thus subject to the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. The INS\u2019s failure to comply with these procedures, he argues, renders \u00a7 1003.4 invalid. Given Villalvaso\u2019s failure to raise this argument before the IJ or the BIA, we cannot reach the merits of this claim. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir. 2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Lastly, Villalvaso contends that he raised new issues before the BIA, and that, therefore, summary affirmance was inappropriate in this case. However, the \u201cnew\u201d issues he identifies were raised before <em>both </em>the IJ and the BIA. Moreover, recent cases foreclose Villalvaso\u2019s claim that the BIA violated his due process rights by summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Knezevic v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1206, 1214 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
