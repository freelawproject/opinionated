Youngblood did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-26\">Approximately four years later, Young-blood moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that his conviction under \u00a7 924(c) should be reversed based on <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>- U.S. -,-, 116 S.Ct. 501, 505-06, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-28\">The district court held that <em>Bailey </em>was not applicable because Youngblood had been convicted of carrying, not using, a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense and that there was ample evidence that Youngblood \u201ccarried\u201d the firearm. The district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief. Youngblood appealed and the district court granted leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP). Youngblood did not move for a certificate of appealability (COA) in the district court, and the district court did not <em>sua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number><em>sponte </em>grant or deny a COA. Youngblood now seeks a COA in this Court. DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">In <em>Muniz v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 43, (5th Cir.1997) a \u00a7 2254 case, this Court determined that the district court must rule on a motion for COA before a petitioner can request one from this Court and the manner in which the district court must rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-5\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 102 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-18 (1996) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253), a habeas petitioner had to receive a CPC to appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253 (West 1994). Section 2253, as amended by the AEDPA, now requires the petitioner to receive a COA, and this requirement applies to petitioners who did not receive a CPC prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of the AEDPA. <em>See Drinkard v. Johnson, </em>97 F.3d 751, 755-56 (5th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>[- U.S. -], 117 S.Ct. 1114 [137 L.Ed.2d 315] (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-8\">The standard for obtaining a COA is the same as for a CPC. <em>See id. </em>at 756. There is, nonetheless, at least one significant difference: A COA, unlike a CPC, must \u201cindicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required-\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\"><em>Muniz, </em>at 44. <em>Muniz </em>also interpreted Rule 22(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure as providing that \u201c[a] district court <em>must </em>deny the COA before a petitioner can request one from this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Further, the court concluded \u201cthat when a district court issues a CPC or COA that does not specify the issue or issues warranting review, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(3), the proper course of action is to remand to allow the district court to issue a proper COA, if one is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46 (footnote citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">This case presents the question whether <em>Muniz\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 2253 and Rule 22(b) applies to \u00a7 2255 cases. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-14\">Rule 22 is entitled \u201cHabeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings.\u201d Rule 22(b) addresses a \u201cCertificate of Appealability\u201d and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-15\">In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate of appealability pursuant to section 2253(e) of title 28, United States Code. If an appeal is taken by the applicant, the district judge who rendered the judgment <em>shall </em>either issue a certificate of appealability or state the reasons why such a certificate should not issue. The certificate or the statement shall be forwarded to the court of appeals with the notice of appeal and the file of the proceedings in the district court. If the district judge has denied the certificate, the applicant for the writ may then request issuance of the certificate by a circuit judge. If such a request is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate. If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to constitute a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals. If an appeal is taken by a State or its representative, a certificate of appealability is not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">(emphasis added). The following cases demonstrate the questions that have arisen in applying Rule 22(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">In <em>Hunter v. United States, </em>101 F.3d 1565 (11th Cir.1996) (en banc) (a \u00a7 2254 case), the court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the amendments to \u00a7 2253 and Rule 22(b) apply to pending \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2255 cases in which the notice of appeal was filed after the effective date of the AEDPA. <em>Id. </em>at 1573. The Eleventh Circuit noted the reference in Rule 22(b) to habeas corpus proceedings arising out of process issued by a state court and the absence of language, except in the title, concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>\u00a7 2255 federal prisoner proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1575 n. 8. The court went on to disagree with the proposition that district courts lack the authority to issue certificates of appealability in \u00a7 2255 proceedings, stating that \u201cthere is no indication at all that Congress intended to distinguish between \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2255 proceedings relating to this issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1575-76 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">This Court, in <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>103 F.3d 389 (5th Cir.1996) (a \u00a7 2255 ease),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that the amendments to \u00a7 2253 and Rule 22(b) apply to pending appeals in which the notice of appeal was filed after the effective date of the AEDPA and that \u201ca notice of appeal constitutes a request for the certificate if the request is not filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">In <em>Lozada v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 1011, 1017 (2nd Cir.1997) (emphasis added) (a \u00a7 2255 case), the court concluded \u201cthat an appellant seeking to appeal from the denial of either a section 2254 or a section 2255 petition <em>must </em>apply to a district court for a COA.\u201d The Second Circuit recognized that it was arguable that amended Rule 22(b) suggests that application to a district court is not required \u201cbecause the Rule states that \u2018[i]f no request for a certificate [of appealability] is filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to constitute a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1016-17. However, the court reasoned that, \u201cread in context, this language is properly understood not to dispense with required district court consideration of a COA request, but only to spell out the procedure applicable after a district judge has denied such a request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1017. \u201cRather than dispense with an application to a district court, the amended Rule simply sets forth the sequence of applications \u2014 first to the district court and then to the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">We conclude that the reasoning of <em>Muniz </em>is equally applicable in \u00a7 2255 cases. Unlike <em>Muniz, </em>Youngblood did not file a request for COA in the district court. Although the district court granted leave to appeal IFP, a grant of IFP is not the equivalent of a grant of a COA The standard for issuance of COA, \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d has a higher threshold than the IFP standard, that the appeal is not frivolous. <em>See Clements v. Wainwright, </em>648 F.2d 979, 981 (5th Cir.1981) (district court\u2019s grant of IFP based on \u201cgood faith\u201d is not the equivalent of a grant of a CPC). Under <em>Muniz, </em>jurisdiction is not vested in this Court because the district court has not yet considered whether COA should issue. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45. We therefore remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of considering whether COA should issue in accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 22(b) and \u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-13\">. A limited exception applies where the petitioner presented only one issue to the district court. In such a case, we do not require the technicality of specifying that lone issue. <em>See Else v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 82, 83 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (on reconsideration) (footnote in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1221-18\">. <em>Orozco </em>was decided before <em>Else, </em>in which the court held \"that district courts retain the authority to issue certificates of appealability for \u00a7 2254 petitions under the AEDPA.\" <em>Else, </em>104 F.3d at 83 (footnote citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
