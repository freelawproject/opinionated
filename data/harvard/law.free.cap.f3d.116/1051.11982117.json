The district court dismissed Gasery\u2019s first habeas petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies as to certain, but not all, of the claims presented. <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 520-21, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1204-05, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982) (holding that district court should dismiss, without prejudice, habeas petition containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims). Gasery has since attempted to exhaust his state remedies,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and now seeks leave to refile his petition, asserting the same claims as before.</p>\n<p id=\"ACv9\">Gasery\u2019s motion presents an issue of first impression in this circuit \u2014 whether a petitioner seeking to refile a habeas corpus petition after prior dismissal without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies must comply with the new provisions of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), Pub.L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). The AEDPA amends 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 to forbid any \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition for collateral relief without the consent of the court of appeals, which may be granted only in limited circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Section 2244(b) does not define \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. The specific language in the Act is derived from Rule 9(b), Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, 28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2254, which states that \u201c[a] second or successive petition may be dismissed if ... it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief and the prior determination was on the merits or, if new and different grounds are alleged, ... the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ.\u201d Although the AEDPA\u2019s amendment to \u00a7 2244 imposes stricter requirements for \u201csecond or successive\u201d petitions than the pre-AEDPA \u201cabuse of the writ\u201d standard in Rule 9(b), nothing in the AEDPA affects the determination of what constitutes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. <em>Benton v. Washington, </em>106 F.3d 162, 164 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">Prior to passage of the AEDPA, we consistently concluded that petitions that were refiled after dismissal for failure to exhaust state remedies were not \u201csecond or successive\u201d petitions for Rule 9(b) purposes. <em>Woods v. Whitley, </em>933 F.2d 321, 322 (5th Cir.1991) (disregarding prior petition that had been dismissed without prejudice); <em>Jones v. Estelle, </em>722 F.2d 159 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc) (noting that \u201c[a] petitioner who has both exhausted and unexhausted claims faces no ultimate barrier to the federal prosecution of all his claims [and] can obtain dismissal of his federal writ, completely exhaust his claims, and, if unsuccessful, return to federal court\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 976, 104 S.Ct. 2356, 80 L.Ed.2d 829 (1984); <em>cf. Pryor v. Beto, </em>460 F.2d 306, 306 (5th Cir.1972) (holding, prior to adoption of Rule 9(b), that refiling of \u00a7 2254 petition that had been dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies was not barred as \u201csuccessive\u201d). Moreover, since passage of the AEDPA, the First, Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have concluded that a habeas petition refiled after dismissal without prejudice is neither second nor successive. <em>Benton, </em>106 F.3d at 164-65; <em>In re Turner, </em>101 F.3d 1323, 1323 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Dickinson v. Maine, </em>101 F.3d 791, 791 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Camarano v. Irvin, </em>98 F.3d 44, 46-47 (2d Cir.1996). We agree and conclude that Gasery\u2019s refiled petition is merely a continuation of his first collateral attack, not a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(b). <em>See Benton, </em>106 F.3d at 164 (\u201cThe sequence of filing, dismissal, exhaustion in state court, and refiling ... might generate multiple docket numbers, but it would not be right to characterize it as successive collateral attacks.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Gas-ery\u2019s motion as unnecessary. Gasery may file his petition directly in the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A_G\">. We offer no opinion as to whether Gasery has in fact exhausted his remedies in state court. <em>See Dickinson v. State of Maine, </em>101 F.3d 791, 791 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996) (citing <em>Hatch v. State of Oklahoma, </em>92 F.3d 1012, 1016 (10th Cir.1996), for proposition that exhaustion is not precondition to consideration of motion to file successive petition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A0HO\">.
