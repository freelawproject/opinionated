Whether the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) decision and order is final and ripe for review by this court, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1556-10\">2. Whether the ALJ\u2019s order is to be upheld or vacated?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1556-11\">Under the provisions of the Department of Labor Appropriations Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Department is prohibited from using appropriated funds after September 12, 1996, to review eases such as this appeal to the Board of Review which had been pending for more than a year as of that date. Those pending for that time and not acted upon are required to be considered affirmed and final on September 12, 1996 for purposes of judicial review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the Courts of Appeal are to review awards of ALJ\u2019s without the benefit of the conclusions of the experienced members of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-12\">The Congress has the power to amend the substantive law governing review of these cases through an appropriations bill. <em>Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society, </em>503 U.S. 429, 440-41, 112 S.Ct. 1407, 1414-15, 118 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992) and it has done so in this instance. Petitioner\u2019s suggestion that the ALJ\u2019s order is not ripe for review is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-19\">While evidence was conflicting and, in view of the ALJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner lacked credibility, subject to different findings, the ALJ\u2019s decision is adequately supported and due to be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-20\">The Petition for Review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1556-13\">.
