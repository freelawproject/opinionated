Maliackal argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Maliackal\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. Maliackal argues that the district court failed to explain its sentence and placed \u201cundue reliance on [the need for] general deterrence,\u201d but the district court considered all the statutory purposes of sentencing. The district court explained that its sentence accounted for Maliackal\u2019s \u201cgraphic and ... vulgar\u201d statements during online conversations with an undercover agent to \u201cprocur[e] a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old [girl] for sexual gratification\u201d; the plans he made \u201cover many days\u201d; his trip to meet with the agent who was posing as the girls\u2019 father; the seriousness of his offense and the need to \u201c[p]romote respect for the law[ and to] provide a just punishment\u201d; the need to deter him from future similar conduct and to provide \u201cgeneral deterrence\u201d; his cooperation with authorities and his remorse; his lack of a criminal history; and his \u201cpotential to be a valuable participant in society.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Maliackal argues that the written statement of reasons differs from the oral findings made during his sentencing hearing, but we will not consider this argument because it is raised for the first time in Maliackal\u2019s reply brief. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1246 (11th Cir.2011). He also argues that the district court \u201crotely assumed the advisory guidelines sentence was a reasonable one,\u201d but the district court stated that the Sentencing Guidelines were not mandatory and failed to \u201caccurately\u201d account for all the sentencing factors. The district court provided a \u201creasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Maliackal\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. One minute after the undercover agent posted the advertisement \u201cDad with Dau in FI\u201d in an internet chat room entitled \u201cIncest,\u201d Maliackal, using the online name \u201cHorny_Indian\u201d said he was \u201cinto incest,\u201d and he proceeded to boast about his past sexual encounters with young minors and to describe graphically how he intended to abuse the two young girls. Maliackal joked about having the girls as \u201cgirlfriends\u201d; asked \u201chow often [he could] f * * k\u201d them\u201d; joked about \u201cgetfting] [one of the girls] pregnant\u201d; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>asked for naked photographs of the girls. Maliackal traveled from Tampa to Mait-land and, en route, called the agent and mentioned that he had forgotten to bring condoms. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence at the low end of Maliackal\u2019s advisory guideline range of 168 to 210 months was necessary to address the statutory sentencing factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion, particularly when it imposed a sentence well below Maliackal\u2019s statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We AFFIRM Maliackal\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
