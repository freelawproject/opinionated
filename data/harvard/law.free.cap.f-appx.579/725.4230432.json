In 2018, Starks moved to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG). The district court denied this motion, finding that Amendment 750 does not lower Starks\u2019s base offense level because his offense involved 104 kilograms of cocaine base. Starks now appeals, and the government has filed a motion for summary affirmance and a motion to stay the briefing schedule. After careful review, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. As a result, the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Summary disposition is appropriate either where time is of the essence, such as \u201csituations where important public policy issues are involved or those where rights delayed are rights denied,\u201d or where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d However, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Summary disposition for the government is appropriate here because Starks is clearly not entitled to be resentenced pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750. It is true that Amendment 750 reduces Stark\u2019s base offense level from 42 to 38. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (Nov.2010) (providing that the base offense level is 38 for offenses involving 8.4 kilograms or more of cocaine base). But Stark\u2019s total offense level and his guidelines range remain the same because of a four-level leadership role enhancement and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>USSG ch. 5, pt. A, comment, (n. 2) (\u201cAn offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.\u201d); <em>United States v. Starks, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 264, 265 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (explaining why Amendment 706 does not entitle Starks to be resentenced).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Starks responds that the factual findings at his original sentencing were clearly erroneous. He further argues that his sentencing court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing his sentence. But these arguments all miss the mark because a sentencing adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (stating that courts should substitute only the amendment and \u201cleave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\u201d). Thus, previous factual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>legal determinations from the original sentencing cannot be revisited at this stage in the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cAll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). For these reasons, the district court properly concluded that it lacked authority to reduce Starks\u2019s sentence pursuant to Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">.
