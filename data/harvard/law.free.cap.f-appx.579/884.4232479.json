For the first time on appeal, Melvin argues that the district court erred in treating his prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and enhancing his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) because, unlike its federal statutory counterparts, the Florida statute does not include knowledge of the illicit substance as an element.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Melvin also argues that his above-guideline sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable, partly because the district court improperly considered his prior arrest record.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">We review sentencing issues not raised before the district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251-52 (11th Cir.2006)(per curiam). To establish plain error, a defendant must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. \u201cWhen the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the base offense level for a defendant convicted of possessing a firearm as a felon is 22 if the offense involved a semiautomatic firearm capable of accepting a large capacity magazine and the defendant has a prior felony conviction for a crime of violence or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3). The guidelines that are in effect at the time of a defendant\u2019s sentencing should guide a district court\u2019s sentencing calculations and findings. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4). As used in \u00a7 2K2.1, the term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqsz\">an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 1 (providing that \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s definition of controlled substance offense applies to base offense level enhancements under \u00a7 2K2.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">Under Florida law, it is a crime to \u201csell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). Knowledge of the illicit nature of a substance is not an element of this offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.101(l)-(2). Where the offense involves cocaine, it is a second-degree felony and carries a 15-year maximum term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l), 893.03(2)(a)(4), 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">In <em>Donawa v. U.S. Attorney General, 735 </em>F.3d 1275, 1281-83 (11th Cir.2013), we held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a) did not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act \u2014 which defines the term, in part, as any drug trafficking offense listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) \u2014 because the federal law included knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance as an offense element. In <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2285-86, 2293, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s prior California burglary conviction did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Because Melvin did not dispute before the district court that his prior conviction qualified as a controlled substance offense, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See Castro, </em>455 F.3d at 1251. The district court did not plainly err, as it was only required to consider the version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) in effect at the time of Melvin\u2019s sentencing, which does not expressly require that a state law include knowledge of the illicit nature of a substance as an offense element. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4). Further, given that <em>Des-camps </em>and <em>Donawa </em>address other federal statutes and do not address whether an offense under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) is a controlled substance offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), their holdings cannot establish plain error in this ease. <em>See Descamps, </em>570 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2285-86; <em>Donawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence, including a sentence above the advisory guideline range, under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We will reverse only if we \u201care left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en bane)(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">We first ensure that the sentence is procedurally reasonable, determining whether the district court erred in calculating the guideline range, treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court should articulate enough to establish that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court is generally not required to explicitly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 its consideration of the defendant\u2019s arguments at sentencing and statement that it took the factors into account is sufficient. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d 918, 936 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Next, we examine whether a sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>fense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3558(a)(1), (3)-(7). The weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">We do not presume that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable, and \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (internal quotation marks omitted). Extraordinary justification is not required, but the district court should explain why the variance is appropriate, and the justification must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. <em>Id. </em>at 1186-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. When a defendant fails to object to allegations of fact in the PSI, he admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Melvin\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. The district court explicitly indicated that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the PSI, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in finding an upward variance to be appropriate, and directly responded to Melvin\u2019s argument that his sentence was unduly harsh. <em>See Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Melvin\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. The district court was free to consider Melvin\u2019s entire criminal history, including his unobjected to conduct described in his PSI that did not result in conviction or prosecution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; <em>Wade, </em>458 F.3d at 1277. The district court explained why the variance was appropriate, and Melvin\u2019s criminal history and record of threatening others with a firearm was sufficiently compelling justification, as this implicated \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as the need to promote respect for the law, protect the public from Melvin\u2019s future crimes, and deter criminal conduct. Although the district court may not have weighed Melvin\u2019s history of mental problems or purported non-blameworthy role in the offense as much as he desired, its decision to weigh other factors more heavily was within its sound discretion. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-9\">. Melvin\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI) identified the conviction as \"Cocaine Sell/Man/Del/Possession w/ Intent.\u201d The PSI did not identify the statute underlying the conviction, but the parties agree that it was Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
