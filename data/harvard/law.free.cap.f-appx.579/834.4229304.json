On appeal, Offord argues that the district court improperly applied a two-level aggravating-role increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because the government failed to prove facts to support it. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact, as well as the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is subject to an aggravating-role increase under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>United, States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>179 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.1999). Clear error review is deferential, and \u201cwe will not disturb a district court\u2019s findings unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s \u201cchoice between two permissible views of the evidence\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s role in the offense will rarely constitute clear error \u201c[s]o long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>739 F.3d 633, 653 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2317, 189 L.Ed.2d 195 (2014) (quotation marks omitted) (involving a denial of a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR \u00a7 3B1.1 ROLE INCREASE</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Under \u00a7 3B1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by four levels if he was an \u201corganizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). If the defendant was a \u201cmanager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader)\u201d then the increase is three levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">However, \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d that involved fewer than five participants and was not \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) and (b), then the increase is two levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c). A defendant\u2019s assertion of control over only one other participant is sufficient to sustain a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) two-level increase. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 2; <em>Glover, </em>179 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Factors considered in assessing a defendant\u2019s role include \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of the participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4. These factors are \u201cmerely considerations for the sentencing judge,\u201d and need not all be present. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">At a minimum, to impose an aggravating-role increase, \u201cthere must be evidence that the defendant exerted some control, influence or decision-making authority over another participant in the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 2. The government has the burden to prove the defendant\u2019s aggravating role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1026-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">III. OFFORD\u2019S ROLE</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Here, in Offord\u2019s sentencing, the district court did not clearly err in applying a two-level role increase pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). According to undisputed facts in his pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Of-ford and two codefendants, Terricka Randolph and Gina Josaphat, were involved in a scheme to use counterfeit Federal Reserve Notes (\u201cFRNs\u201d) to purchase items at Target stores, which they then would return to different Target stores for genuine U.S. currency. During the investigation, codefendant Josaphat gave a sworn statement that Offord recruited her into the counterfeiting scheme,' gave her counterfeit FRNs, and instructed her on how to use them at Target stores to obtain U.S. currency. Codefendant Josaphat also said that, when she bought $1,000 worth of Target items, Defendant Offord gave her $300 in genuine currency as payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">At the sentencing hearing, United States Secret Service Agent Earl Kornickey testified that, as part of an earlier counterfeiting investigation of Defendant Offord, he interviewed Randolph, and she admitted that Offord recruited her into that counterfeiting scheme because he believed that women were less likely to get caught. Randolph also told Agent Kornickey that Offord taught her how to commit the counterfeiting scheme. Agent Kornickey confirmed that, when he interviewed Josaphat as part of the instant investigation, she also said that Offord recruited her to participate in a counterfeiting scheme and explained the scheme to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Given the indicia of reliability, the district court properly relied upon Agent Kornickey\u2019s hearsay testimony about code-fendants Randolph\u2019s and Josaphat\u2019s state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>merits. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, Randolph\u2019s and Josaphat\u2019s statements to Agent Kornickey were consistent with each other and with the undisputed facts in the PSI. Further, Agent Kornickey was subject to cross-examination at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Although at sentencing Offord\u2019s counsel argued that Randolph and Josaphat were the ones who first approached Offord about the counterfeiting scheme, Offord presented no evidence to support this claim. An attorney\u2019s factual assertions, alone, do not constitute evidence upon which a sentencing court can rely. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.2013). Accordingly, the district court did not commit clear error when it credited Agent Kornickey\u2019s unrebutted testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In short, the government\u2019s unrebutted evidence showed that Defendant Offord: (1) approached his codefendants and invited them to become involved in a counterfeiting scheme; (2) provided them with the counterfeit obligations and taught them how to perform the scheme; and (3) kept the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds for himself after his codefendants completed the purchases and returns at Target stores. Further, Defendant Offord\u2019s recruitment and instruction demonstrated the necessary degree of control, influence, or decision-making authority over Randolph and Jo-saphat necessary to qualify for an aggravating-role increase pursuant to \u00a7 SB 1.1. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2010) (affirming application of a four-level role increase where the defendant, among other things, recruited another participant and gave instructions on how to commit the drug-smuggling crime); <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming the application of a four-level role increase where the defendant recruited and instructed others in an immigration-fraud conspiracy); <em>United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming application of a two-level role increase where the defendant recruited another participant into a terrorism plot, prompted him to purchase weapons, and briefed him on a bombing plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c)\u2019s two-level aggravating-role increase. Accordingly, we affirm Offord\u2019s 27-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
