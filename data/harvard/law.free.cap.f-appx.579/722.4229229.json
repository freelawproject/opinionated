Sarria argues that the administrative law judge gave insufficient weight to the opinions of her treating psychiatrist and a therapist that she was disabled; failed to state what weight was given to the opinions of two agency psychologists; failed to order an additional consultative evaluation; and posed an inadequate hypothetical question to the vocational expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the administrative law judge that Sarria has the mental residual functional capacity to respond appropriately to supervisors, coworkers, and the public and to perform unskilled work involving simple instructions and decisions unhampered by requirements for production pace. That finding is consistent with the treatment notes of Sarria\u2019s mental health physicians, her self-assessments, and assessments of agency physicians. Treatment notes recorded in October 2009 and in January 2010 by Sarria\u2019s doctors at Bayview Center for Mental Health state that, despite the depression caused by the death of her mother in August 2009, Sarria exhibited \u201cappropriate\u201d thought processes, thought content, insight, and judgment. During the last quarter of 2010, Sarria stated in an adult functioning report that her depression did not hamper her abilities to perform daily household chores, care for her brother, visit other people three to four times a week, or manage her finances, and in January 2010 she told a student therapist at Bayview, Minkyong Chung, that she was \u201cfeeling a little better.\u201d In February 2010, Dr. George Davigulus, a consultant, reported that Sarria\u2019s depression did not impair her organizational skills, her cognitive functions, or her short or long-term <em>memory. </em>In March 2010, Dr. Linda O\u2019Neal, an agency psychologist, reviewed Sarria\u2019s medical records and concluded that Sarria could remember work procedures and simple instructions, could adapt and interact socially, and had a moderate limitation on her ability to respond to work-setting changes. A state-sponsored psychiatrist reported that Sarris was moderately limited in her ability to complete detailed instructions and concentrate, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>she could otherwise comprehend and perform simple instructions, follow a schedule without special supervision or distraction, and interact with supervisors, coworkers, and the public. Dr. Joel Pabasa, a doctor at Bayview, reported that Sarria was sad, but she had fair insight and judgment and a mood and mental functioning of \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201c1\u201d on a ten-point declining scale. And Dr. Nathan Stahl, a board-certified psychiatrist, reviewed Sarria\u2019s medical records and testified that, although she had a major depressive disorder caused by grieving for her mother, the condition had not rendered her disabled and did not impede her ability to perform simple tasks. Although the administrative law judge did not state what weight she accorded Dr. Davigulus\u2019s or Dr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s opinions, that error was harmless because those opinions were consistent with the findings about Sarria\u2019s mental residual functional capacity. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Good cause supported the decision of the administrative law judge to discount the mental residual functional reports submitted by Sarria\u2019s treating psychiatrist at Bayview, Dr. Alphonse Hayeck, and a student therapist at Bayview, Vanessa And-reade. The administrative law judge gave little weight to Dr. Hayeck\u2019s report because it was inconsistent with his earlier treatment notes, Sarria\u2019s statements about her capabilities, and Dr. Stahl\u2019s expert opinion that Sarria could perform simple tasks. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004)); <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004). In March 2010, Dr. Hayeck reported that Sarria had poor to no ability to comprehend and complete detailed instructions, to function independently, to concentrate, and to interact with others. But in February 2010, Dr. Hayeck recorded in his treatment notes that Sarria had a \u201cfair\u201d overall mental status and exhibited \u201cappropriate\u201d thought processes, content, insight, and judgment, and in June 2010, Dr. Hayeck recorded that Sarria\u2019s mental status was normal except for her sadness and depression attributable to her mother\u2019s death. And the administrative law judge had good cause to disregard Ms. Andread\u2019s assessment, which essentially mirrored that of Dr. Hayeck, because she possessed a bachelor of arts degree and was not an \u201cacceptable medical source\u201d who could \u201cprovide evidence to establish an impairment.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.913(a)(2) (identifying licensed or certified psychologists as acceptable medical sources).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The administrative law judge was not required to order an additional medical examination to develop a full and fair record. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). We have remanded for further development of the evidentiary record when the claimant was proceeding <em>pro se </em>and the record contained \u201cevidentiary gaps which result in unfairness or clear prejudice,\u201d <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 931, 935 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), but Sarria fails to identify any gaps in the evidence. Sarria was represented during the administrative process and was responsible for producing evidence related to her disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(a), (c). Sarria\u2019s medical records, the reports of her treating psychiatrists and therapists, the assessments of agency physicians, and Sarria\u2019s self-assessments provided sufficient evidence for the administrative law judge to determine whether Sarria\u2019s depression was disabling. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 416.920b. Sarria\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of that evidence does not warrant a remand of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The administrative law judge posed a complete hypothetical question to the vocational expert about Sarria\u2019s mental functional limitations. The administrative law judge asked the vocational expert to identify jobs available to an individual of Sarria\u2019s age, education, and lack of past relevant work who could understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions; make simple work-related decisions; respond appropriately to supervision; interact appropriately with coworkers and the public; and deal with changes in a routine work setting that did not require a production-type pace or involve a quota. Sarria argues that the administrative law judge failed to incorporate in the hypothetical question the limitations identified by Dr. Hayeck and Ms. Andreade, but the administrative law judge was not required to include limitations that were not supported by the evidence. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Sarria\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
