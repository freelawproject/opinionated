We review his sentence under the plainly unreasonable standard. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Although Diaz-Ortiz argues that this standard is incorrect, he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed and he raises it only to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-21\">At the revocation hearing, the district court acknowledged Diaz-Ortiz\u2019s arguments. The district court expressed its concern with his four prior reentries following deportation, the speed with which he returned to the United States after his most recent departure, and his use of numerous aliases, false birth dates, drugs, and alcohol. These reasons echo the relevant sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly the need to deter future criminal conduct and protect the public from further crimes by Diaz-Ortiz, as well as the kinds of sentences available generally and for Diaz-Ortiz\u2019s situation in particular. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)-(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">We find no indication in the record that the district court failed to account for a factor that should have received significant weight, gave such weight to an improper factor, or clearly erred in balancing the relevant sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Diaz-Ortiz has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>accorded his sentence. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
