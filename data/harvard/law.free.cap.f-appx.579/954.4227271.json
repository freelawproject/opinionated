Williams argues that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-22\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-23\">Williams\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court, contrary to Williams\u2019s contention, did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory. The district court imposed Williams\u2019s sentence only after it had heard both Williams and the government make their respective arguments about what sentence would be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). And the record establishes that the district court considered the seriousness of the offense, the history of the defendant, and the guidelines range, and then determined that a sentence at the upper end of the range was adequate punishment. The district court committed no abuse of discretion by placing greater emphasis on the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the offense than on Williams\u2019s rehabilitative efforts and criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\"><em>Co </em>| KEY NUMBER SYSTEM &gt;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
