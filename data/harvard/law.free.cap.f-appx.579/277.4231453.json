The district court imposed this sentence after calculating Sweet\u2019s sentencing guideline range based in part on a 6-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. Sweet argues that the 6-level increase resulted from the district court\u2019s misapplication of the presumption regarding the number of victims affected by Sweet\u2019s possession of stolen mail. Because Sweet did not object to the sentence imposed or to the district court\u2019s calculation of the guideline range, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plain error does not arise unless the sentencing error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-23\">Citing our analysis in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>733 F.3d 161, 164-67 (5th Cir.2013), Sweet argues that he should have received a 4-level increase instead of a 6-level increase. The government responds that even if Sweet is correct, the sentence actually imposed would nonetheless have fallen within the correctly calculated guideline range. In other words, whereas Sweet\u2019s 15-month sentence falls at the bottom of the 15-to-21-month range calculated based on the 6-level increase actually applied by the district court, Sweet\u2019s sentence would have fallen in the middle of a 12-to-18-month range calculated based on the 4-level increase proposed by Sweet. Sweet, who is represented by counsel, offers no rebuttal and does not dispute the government\u2019s alternative calculation. Whether or not the government\u2019s alternative calculation is correct, therefore, Sweet has waived his opportunity to challenge it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Accordingly, Sweet\u2019s appeal is governed by the rule described in <em>United States v. Mudekunye, </em>646 F.3d 281, 290 (5th Cir.2011). In that case, we explained that \u201cwhen the correct and incorrect ranges overlap and the defendant is sentenced within the overlap, \u201cwe do not assume, in the absence of additional evidence, that the sentence affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sweet has neither identified any such evidence nor addressed the issue in his brief. The district court must therefore be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
