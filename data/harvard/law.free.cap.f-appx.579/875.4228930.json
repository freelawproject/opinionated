On appeal, Lovell argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for his role as an organizer or leader in the health care fraud conspiracy, given that he was merely a straw owner of the clinic operated by the co-conspirators. Lovell contends that, while he received a small sum for permitting the clinic to use his chiropractic license, his co-conspirators developed the idea for the clinic; performed the work to create the clinic\u2019s legal and physical existence; hired all of the employees and set their salaries; maintained all bookkeeping for the clinic; and received nearly all of the clinic\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">We review a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is subject to a \u00a7 3B1.1 organizer or leader enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1025 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWhere a fact pattern gives rise to two reasonable and different constructions, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 629, 184 L.Ed.2d 408 (2012). Further, we give deference to the district court\u2019s apphcation of a \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement on appeal. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), a defendant\u2019s offense level will be increased by four \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Here, Lovell does' not dispute that the conspiracy at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>issue involved five or more participants, only that he was not an organizer or leader in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">In assessing a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, district courts consider the following factors: (1) \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority,\u201d (2) \u201cthe nature of participation in the commission of the offense,\u201d (3) \u201cthe recruitment of accomplices,\u201d (4) \u201cthe claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,\u201d (5) \u201cthe degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,\u201d (6) \u201cthe nature and scope of the illegal activity,\u201d and (7) \u201cthe degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). All of these factors need not be present for the enhancement to apply, but \u201c[sjection 3B1.1 requires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted); <em>Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Because more than one person can qualify as an organizer or leader of a conspiracy, the defendant need not be the sole leader of the conspiracy for the enhancement to apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4); <em>Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1355 (quotation omitted). Moreover, the enhancement may apply where the defendant exerted influence or control over only one other person in the conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Lozano, </em>490 F.3d 1317,1323 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Finally, the government must prove the existence of a leadership role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). The government must also prove any facts in the PSI that are objected to by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1027. Once it proves such disputed facts, \u201cthe district court must either: (1) make an explicit factual finding as to the allegation; or (2) determine that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Reviewing for clear error, we find sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) organizer or leader enhancement because the government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Lovell had an aggravating role in the health care fraud conspiracy. <em>See Yeager, </em>331 F.3d at 1226. The evidence indicates that Lovell had a significant degree of participation in planning and organizing the conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). Lovell met with the other co-conspirators to discuss how to form the clinic, agreed to the continued use of his license to open and operate the clinic, incorporated the clinic and served as its sole legal owner, loaned the clinic $20,000 to fund its opening, signed the clinic\u2019s lease, and opened the clinic\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Moreover, Lovell appointed Jackson the clinic\u2019s office manager, and hired and paid the salary of the clinic\u2019s only chiropractor. His exertion of control over at least one other person in the conspiracy qualifies him as an organizer or leader. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>Lozano, </em>490 F.3d at 1323. Furthermore, Lovell exercised some decision making authority in the conspiracy, such as instructing his co-conspirators to form shell corporations to launder money without raising suspicion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4). The fact that coconspirators made daily business decisions for the clinic and controlled the clinic\u2019s finances did not negate Lovell\u2019s organizational or leadership role in the conspiracy, because there can be more than one organizer or leader of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4); <em>Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">That the district court could have come to another conclusion based on these facts does not demonstrate clear error, particularly when we give deference to the district court\u2019s application of a \u00a7 3B 1.1 enhancement. <em>See Almedina, </em>686 F.3d at 1315; <em>Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1355. Because Lovell exercised \u201csome degree of control, influence, or leadership\u201d in the conspiracy, even though others may have had a larger role, the district court\u2019s determination that Lovell\u2019s participation merited the four-level aggravating role enhancement was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1025; <em>Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d at 1304. Accordingly, we affirm his 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
