Coney, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which he filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Coney was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced in 2008 under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and received a statutory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. That same year, he filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, but the motion was denied and we declined to issue a Certificate of Appealability. He then filed a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to \u00a7 2241 and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), which the district court dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">On appeal, he argues that he was erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal based on a 1996 Florida state court cannabis conviction that was not a valid predicate offense. Therefore, he was sentenced in excess of the applicable statutory maximum, and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) allows him to bring a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). We read <em>pro se </em>litigants\u2019 briefs liberally, but will not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">A person convicted of knowingly violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) shall be imprisoned \u201cnot more than ten years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>\u00a7 924(a)(2). However, the ACCA enhancement imposes a 15-year (or 180-month) mandatory minimum sentence for any defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g) after having sustained at least 8 convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses committed on different occasions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). A state drug offense is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA if it has a maximum prison term of at least ten years and involves the intent to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Although \u00a7 2255 is the primary method of collateral attack for federal prisoners, \u00a7 2241 provides a limited, additional basis for habeas actions brought by federal prisoners. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. However, the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 provides that a \u00a7 2241 petition \u201cshall not be entertained\u201d if the prisoner has failed to apply for relief by a \u00a7 2255 motion, or has already been denied such relief \u201cunless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In <em>Bryant, </em>we held that the \u201csavings clause\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) permitted a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition where the petitioner\u2019s 235-month sentence following a conviction under 18 U.S.C. 922(g) exceeded the 10-year statutory maximum authorized by 18 U.S.C. 924(a). <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In that decision, we synthesized our pri- or savings-elause precedent and set forth five requirements that a petitioner must satisfy in order to demonstrate that his prior \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d such that he could proceed with a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the savings clause. <em>See id. </em>at 1274. Specifically, the petitioner must establish that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">(1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our Circuit\u2019s binding precedent had specifically addressed [his] distinct prior conviction that triggered \u00a7 924(e) and had squarely foreclosed [the] \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the 10-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">(2) subsequent to his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision ... overturned our Circuit precedent that had squarely foreclosed [his] \u00a7 924(e) claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">(3) the new rule announced ... applies retroactively on collateral review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">(4) as a result of [the] new rule being retroactive, [the petitioner\u2019s] current sentence exceeds the 10-year statutory maximum authorized by Congress in \u00a7 924(a); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">(5) the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his pure \u00a7 924(e) ... error claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">Coney\u2019s claim fails for two reasons. First, while Coney argues in his reply brief that several of his ACCA predicate convictions other than his cannabis offense were not valid, he did not make those arguments in his initial brief, and therefore we will not consider those arguments. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. The court relied on at least three other convictions besides Coney\u2019s 1996 cannabis conviction when enhancing his sentence, and therefore it is unnecessary to address whether the cannabis conviction properly \u201ctriggered\u201d the ACCA enhancement. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">Second, our Circuit\u2019s binding precedent had not specifically addressed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>marijuana conviction and squarely foreclosed his claim during his sentencing, direct appeal, and previous \u00a7 2255 proceedings. As such, no subsequent retroactive Supreme Court decision overturned any precedent that had foreclosed Coney\u2019s claim, Coney was not sentenced in excess of the applicable statutory maximum, and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) did not open the portal to \u00a7 2241 relief in his case. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Coney\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-2\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
