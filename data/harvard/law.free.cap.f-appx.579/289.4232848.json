On appeal, Ortiz Hinojo argues that the district court erred by failing to award him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), because the additional reduction cannot be withheld based on a defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his appellate rights. The Government concedes error in the district court\u2019s failure to award the additional one-level reduction but argues that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">Amendment 775 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which became effective November 1, 2013, provides that the Government should not withhold the additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) based on interests not identified in the guideline, such as whether the defendant agrees to waive the right to appeal. U.S.S.G. Manual, Supp. to App. C, Amendment 775, at 43-46 (2013). In <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>ed States v. Villegas Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 326 (5th Cir.2014), we applied Amendment 775 to a case on direct appeal in which the error was preserved and the Government conceded error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In light of the amendment to \u00a7 3E1.1, the holding in <em>Villegas Palacios, </em>and the Government\u2019s concession of error in the instant case, the district court\u2019s refusal to award Ortiz Hinojo the additional one-level for acceptance of responsibility was procedural error. <em>See Villegas Palacios, </em>756 F.3d at 326. The Government has not shown that this error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Accordingly, Ortiz Hinojo\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>due </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
