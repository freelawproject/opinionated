The district court also ordered her to pay $4,206,805.49 in restitution and a $100 special assessment. After the district court denied her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, Mason-Hobbs filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration and Sentence Reduction.\u201d The district court denied the motion, and Mason-Hobbs appeals from that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">A district court may modify the imposed term of imprisonment under limited cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>cumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Mason-Hobbs\u2019s\" motion does not fall under any of the provisions of \u00a7 3582(c), and she is precluded from obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, as relief thereunder is reserved only for direct appeals. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, the motion does not arise under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because the district court did not suggest that it was so construing the motion and it did not provide Mason-Hobbs notice. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-83, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). In sum, Mason-Hobbs\u2019s motion seeking a reduction of her sentence is an unauthorized motion without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. The district court\u2019s judgment denying the motion is AFFIRMED. Her motion for appointment is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
