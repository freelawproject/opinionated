In 1974, Guzman was convicted of murder in three cases and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-24\">In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Guzman challenged the most recent denial of his parole as unconstitutional. Guzman\u2019s claims arise out of changes made to the number of board members required to vote for parole. Prior to 1997, parole determinations were made by panels of three members of the Parole Board. Effective September 1, 1997, the law was changed to require that two-thirds of the entire 18-member Board vote for parole in certain cases. <em>See </em>Act effective Sept. 1, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S. ch. 165, \u00a7 12.01; Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.046 (Vernon 1998). In 2004, the Board\u2019s size was reduced from 18 members to seven members. In his complaint, Guzman argued that the retroactive application of \u00a7 508.046 by the Parole Board violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. He also contended that the process by which the Board operated violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-25\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim de novo. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a plaintiffs complaint must plead enough facts to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). The factual allegations must \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. In reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, the \u201ccourt accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Although Guzman- has proffered evidence that two members of the Parole Board voted in favor of his parole, such evidence is speculative at best and is not sufficient to raise a cognizable ex post facto claim. <em>See Wallace v. Quarterman, </em>516 F.3d 351, 354-56 (5th Cir.2008). Just as in <em>Wallace, </em>Guzman has not presented any evidence to indicate that the two Board members who voted in favor of \u201cfurther investigation\u201d of his parole suitability, \u201cwould have been assigned to [his] three-person panel. [Guzman, therefore,] produced only speculative evidence that the new rules produced a risk of increased confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356; <em>see also Hunter v. Owens, </em>375 Fed.Appx. 427, 428-29 (5th Cir.2010). Thus, while \u201c[increasing the number of board members who must vote on parole may \u2018create more than a speculative, attenuated risk of affecting a prisoner\u2019s actual term of confinement\u2019 in certain circumstances,\u201d the facts here do not state a claim of relief that as applied to Guzman, \u00a7 508.046 violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See id. </em>at 355-56. As to Guzman\u2019s due process claim, because there is no liberty interest in parole under Texas law, Texas inmates cannot mount challenges against state parole review procedures on procedural or substantive due process grounds. <em>See Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 308 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 32 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-26\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
