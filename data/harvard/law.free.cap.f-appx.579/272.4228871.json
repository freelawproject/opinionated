The Watsons appeal the district court\u2019s decision granting Aurora\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Watsons\u2019 Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) claims. The Watsons raise two issues on appeal. First, the Watsons argue there was a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. The Watsons point to Aurora\u2019s summary judgment filings in which Aurora erroneously identified April 14, 2011 as the date Aurora sent notice of the foreclosure sale. In fact, Aurora sent the notice on March 13. Aurora corrected this error in supplemental briefing before the district court. But on appeal, the Watsons characterize the initial misstatement as a binding \u201cjudicial admission.\u201d Second, the Watsons argue the district court misconstrued their request for an accounting as a request for an equitable remedy. The Watsons contend this request was, instead, a separate claim for a declaratory judgment under Texas law. Aurora responds arguing <em>inter alia </em>that the Watsons waived these two issues because they did not present either argument to the district court. After careful review of the record and the applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The following factual background is essentially undisputed. The Watsons defaulted on their home loan. Instead of foreclosure, the Watsons discussed a loan modification with their mortgage holder, Aurora. In October 2010, the Watsons and Aurora agreed to a loan modification. Under the terms of the agreement, the Watsons agreed to pay $6,000 up front to Aurora and to make five monthly payments. Aurora agreed not to foreclose. The Watsons missed the third payment, and Aurora initiated foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">A. Aurora\u2019s Debt-Collection Efforts</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The Watsons\u2019 FDCPA claims at issue in this appeal turn on Aurora\u2019s efforts to collect the debt and foreclose on the Wat-sons\u2019 home. On appeal, the Watsons contend Aurora sent notice and posted the Watsons\u2019 home for foreclosure sale after the Watsons disputed the debt in violation of the FDCPA. Under the FDCPA, a debt collector must cease collection efforts as soon as the consumer informs the debt collector in writing that the consumer disputes the debt. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b). Thus, timing is key. It is undisputed that on March 13, 2011, Aurora sent notices of foreclosure sale scheduled for April 5, 2011. Eleven days later, on March 24, 2011, the Watsons disputed the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">The Watsons sued Aurora in Texas state court asserting various claims for violations of Texas law and the FDCPA, and Aurora removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds. In its initial motion for summary judgment, Aurora erroneously said it sent notice of the foreclosure sale on April 14, 2011 when, in fact, it sent the notice on March 13, 2011. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>court initially denied the motion, reasoning that by sending the notice of foreclosure <em>after </em>the Watsons disputed the debt, there existed a genuine dispute of material fact. The court then asked for supplemental briefing whether Aurora was a \u201cdebt collector\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Aurora filed a supplemental brief clarifying that it sent the notice of foreclosure sale <em>before </em>the Watsons disputed the debt \u2014 on March 18, 2011. This time, the district court granted Aurora\u2019s motion for summary judgment against the Watsons on all claims. The Watsons timely appealed. They only appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on their FDCPA claims and their claim requesting an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and this Court has jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., </em>249 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We vi\u00e9w all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor. <em>See Auguster, </em>249 F.3d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">On appeal, the Watsons argue the district court erred by granting Aurora\u2019s motion for summary judgment for two reasons: (1) Aurora judicially admitted that it posted the Watsons\u2019 property for foreclosure sale on April 14, 2011 in its motion for summary judgment, and (2) the Watsons\u2019 request for an accounting was actually a separate claim under the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. Aurora counters the Watsons\u2019 arguments on appeal \u201care completely different than their arguments before the district court.\u201d Aurora argues the Watsons have therefore waived these arguments. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">\u201cUnder this Circuit\u2019s general rule, arguments not raised before the district court are waived and will not be considered on appeal unless the party can demonstrate \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>AG Acceptance Corp. v. Veigel, </em>564 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cExtraordinary circumstances\u201d exist only if the appellant establishes \u201cthe issue involved is a pure question of law and a miscarriage of justice would result from our failure to consider it.\u201d <em>N. Alamo Water Supply Corp. v. City of San Juan, </em>90 F.3d 910, 916 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Review of the record in this case reveals that the Watsons did not present the arguments they now assert to the district court. In opposition to Aurora\u2019s initial motion for summary judgment, the Wat-sons did not argue that Aurora judicially admitted to notifying the Watsons about the foreclosure sale after the Watsons disputed the debt. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>noticed the erroneous date and denied summary judgment, at least at first. The district court said, \u201cit appears that Defendant, on April 14, 2011, filed a Notice of Accelerations and Notice of Trustee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>sale\u201d \u2014 based on the mistake in Aurora\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Aurora filed a supplemental brief correcting this mistake. The Watsons responded, but they did not dispute this fact or otherwise argue Aurora judicially admitted to sending the notice on April 14, 2011. Instead, they said, \u201cIt is undisputed that on March 13, 2011 Defendant sent Plaintiffs a Notice of Foreclosure.\u201d The Watsons also filed a motion for reconsideration in which they again reiterated it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that \u201cDefendant sent Plaintiffs a Notice of Foreclosure Sale dated March 13, 2011.\u201d Because these judicial-admission arguments were not made to the district court, they are presented for the first time on appeal, and we \u201cwill not disturb the district court\u2019s judgment\u201d on these grounds. <em>See Pluet v. Frasier, </em>355 F.3d 381, 385 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For the same reason, we reject the Wat-sons\u2019 argument that their request for an accounting was actually a separate claim under the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. This argument was also not fairly presented to the district court. In response to Aurora\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Watsons argued only that they were entitled to an accounting under section 809(b) of the FDCPA and under section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d). The district court rejected this argument because the Watsons never asserted a RESPA claim in their complaint, and because Aurora was entitled to summary judgment on the FDCPA claims, as discussed above. Moreover, in their reply brief, the Watsons do not identify extraordinary circumstances that would permit us to consider their waived arguments. In sum, the Wat-sons seek to try the accounting issue and FDCPA claim \u201canew because [they have] discovered ... more attractive theories],\u201d and this we do not allow. <em>McDonald v. Bd. of Miss. Levee Comm\u2019rs, </em>832 F.2d 901, 909 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">III.
