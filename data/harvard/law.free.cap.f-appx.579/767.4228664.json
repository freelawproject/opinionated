The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) imposed seven penalties for filing frivolous tax returns based on returns Fennel filed for tax years 1999 and 2001 through 2006 that claimed zero income and zero tax liability and also claimed a refund for the full amount of money withheld from his pay. At trial, Fennel acknowledged that he worked and received pay during tax years 1999 and 2001 through 2006. On appeal, he argues that: (1) the IRS presented insufficient evidence to impose penalties under \u00a7 6702(a); (2) he is not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 6702; and (3) the IRS failed to prove that the penalty assessments against him received written supervisory approval. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We review the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Creel v. Comrn\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>419 F.3d 1135, 1139 (11th Cir.2005). The IRS has the burden of proving the applicability of penalties for frivolous returns. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6703(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The Internal Revenue Code imposes a $5,000 penalty on a taxpayer who files a tax return that meets two criteria. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702(a). The first criterion is satisfied if the return \u201c(A) does not contain information on which the substantial correctness of the self-assessment may be judged, or (B) contains information that on its face indicates that the self-assessment is substantially incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6702(a)(1). The second criterion is satisfied if the filing of the return either \u201c(A) is based on a position which the Secretary has identified as frivolous under subsection (c), or (B) reflects a desire to delay or impede the administration of Federal tax laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6702(a)(2). Subsection (c) provides that the Secretary shall prescribe, and periodically revise, a list of positions that have been identified as frivolous for purposes of this subsection. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6702(c). The Code further provides that \u201c[n]o penalty under this title shall be assessed unless the initial determination of such assessment is personally approved (in writing) by the immediate supervisor of the individual making such determination or such higher level official as the Secretary may designate.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6751(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">IRS Notice 2007-30, released on March 16, 2007, and published on April 2, 2007, provided a list of positions identified as frivolous for purposes of \u00a7 6702(c). IRS Notice 2007-30, 2007-1 C.B. 883. Among the positions identified as frivolous was the position that a taxpayer has the option to \u201celect to file a tax return reporting zero taxable income and zero tax liability even if the taxpayer received taxable income during the taxable period for which the return is filed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Subtitle A of the Code sets forth the statutes governing the federal income tax. <em>See generally </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1563. Section 1 provides for the imposition of an income tax on all \u201ctaxable income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1. Section 63 defines \u201ctaxable income\u201d as \u201cgross income\u201d minus the deductions that the chapter allows. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 63(a). In turn, \u00a7 61(a) defines \u201cgross income\u201d as \u201call income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) ... [compensation for services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 61(a)(1). Under \u00a7 3402(a)(1), \u201cevery employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with tables or computational procedures prescribed by the Secretary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3402(a)(1). \u201cWages\u201d are defined in reference to that section as \u201call remuneration ... for services performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>by an employee for his employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3401(a). The Code defines employer as \u201cthe person for whom an individual performs or performed any service, of whatever nature, as the employee of such person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3401(d). Finally, the Code defines a \u201cperson\u201d as, among other things, \u201can individual,\u201d and this definition applies throughout the Code \u201cwhere not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7701(a). Section 6671 provides that, for purposes of applying assessable tax penalties, the term \u201cperson ... includes an officer or employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6671(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We have said that arguments that wages are not taxable income have \u201cbeen rejected by courts at all levels of the judiciary and are patently frivolous.\u201d <em>Stubbs v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue Serv., </em>797 F.2d 936, 938 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also Hyslep v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Madison v. United States, </em>758 F.2d 573, 574 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Here, Fennel fails to show that the Tax Court erred in upholding the IRS\u2019s penalty assessments under \u00a7 6702(a) or clearly erred in any of its underlying fact findings. To begin with, the record shows that the Tax Court did not err in determining that Fennel\u2019s returns, which listed zero income and zero tax liability in spite of the fact that he also stated that he worked a job and received pay that was withheld, contained information that on its face indicated that Fennel\u2019s self-assessment was substantially incorrect. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702(a)(1)(B). Moreover, Fennel\u2019s position that he had zero taxable income and zero tax liability even though he received taxable income during each of the relevant tax years was a position identified as frivolous for the purposes of \u00a7 6702(a) at the time Fennel filed his returns from June to November of 2007. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 6702(a)(2)(A), (c); IRS Notice 2007-30, 2007-1 C.B. 883; <em>see also, e.g., Stubbs, </em>797 F.2d at 938. Finally, Fennel\u2019s argument that the penalty assessments did not receive written supervisory approval is belied by the record, and he clearly qualifies as a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 6702. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6671(b), 7701(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
