Ali argues that the BIA erred in determining that he did not prove he is a member of a particular social group. Ali also challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We review findings of fact for substantial evidence, <em>see Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009), and we may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. In particular, we review for substantial evidence the conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant must show a clear probability that he will be persecuted upon his return to his home country. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cA clear probability means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A particular social group is one that \u201ccan be accurately described in a manner sufficiently distinct that the group would be recognized, in the society in question, as a discrete class of persons.\u201d <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[T]he BIA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u2018particular social group\u2019 \u201d and its use of the particularity and social visibility test are entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Ali has not shown that the BIA erred in determining that his proffered social group, \u201cSunni Muslims who are no longer devout,\u201d lacks the requisite particularity to be cognizable for purposes of withholding of removal. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518-21; <em>see also Castillo-Enriquez v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 667, 668 (5th Cir.2012) (providing that wealthy Salvadorans do not qualify as a protected social group). Additionally, Ali has failed to establish that his proffered social group is visible in Pakistani society. <em>See Matter of A-E-M-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1157, 1160 (BIA 1998); <em>Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 587 (BIA 2008). Ali\u2019s general fear of attack or harassment in Pakistan does not establish his membership in a particular social group. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Ali has not argued that he has suffered past persecution from Sunni extremists. Accordingly, no threat of future persecution is presumed. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 596 (5th Cir.2007). Ali also admits that his moderate Muslim family members who live in Pakistan have not been persecuted by Sunni extremists. This weakens his claim of likely future persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 193 (5th Cir.2004) <em>(citing A-EM-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1160). Ali\u2019s claim of persecution rests solely on a generalized fear of persecution by Sunni extremists, and he makes no showing of any particular likelihood of persecution of him personally. Ali\u2019s evidence fails to establish a clear and objective probability of persecution. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Eduard, </em>379 F.3d at 190. Much less does it \u201ccompel\u201d a decision in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Ali failed to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
