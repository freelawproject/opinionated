Jeanty\u2019s removal results from his prior state convictions, which were determined to constitute aggravated felonies and crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review an order of removal if it is based on such convictions, except for any constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) <em>&amp; </em>(D) (judicial review of orders of removal). We construe liberally a <em>pro se </em>appellant\u2019s briefs, but Jeanty must present and brief issues to preserve them, or, in this instance, to give the court jurisdiction. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Although he purports to present constitutional claims of denial of both due process and equal protection, they are insufficiently briefed, conelusory, and merely an impermissible attempt to cloak his request for discretionary review in \u201cconstitutional garb\u201d. <em>See, e.g., Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Pineda, </em>988 F.2d 22, 23 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir: R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
