Lopez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. He further argues that (1) the district court erred by applying a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), (2) the Government improperly declined to move for the third acceptance of responsibility level based on his refusal to waive his appellate rights, (3) the district court erred in requiring submission to plethysmograph testing as a special condition of supervision, and (4) the district court erred in requiring abstinence from alcohol and other intoxicants as a special condition of supervision. Because we VACATE Lopez\u2019s sentence in part, based on the Government\u2019s failure to move for the third acceptance of responsibility level, we do not reach the issue of the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">Lopez\u2019s argument regarding the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d 209, 212-14 (5th Cir.2013). We lack jurisdiction over Lopez\u2019s challenge to the condition of supervised release requiring submission to plethysmo-graph testing because the issue is not ripe for review. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 227 (5th Cir.2013). Furthermore, Lopez has not shown that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>trict court committed a clear or obvious error by prohibiting the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicants during his term of supervised release and has, therefore, not demonstrated plain error. <em>See United States v. Carrillo, </em>660 F.3d 914, 930 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As we held recently in <em>United States v. Villegas Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 326 (5th Cir.2014), the amended version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 is applicable in a case such as this one where the amendment was proposed at the time of sentencing and went into effect while the appeal was pending. Pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1, as amended, the Government may not withhold a \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) motion because the defendant refuses to waive his right to appeal, as it did in this case. Therefore, as the Government concedes, procedural error occurred when Lopez was not given credit for the full three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Villegas Palacios, </em>756 F.3d at 326. The Government has not shown that this error was harmless as to the imposed sentence. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Lopez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
