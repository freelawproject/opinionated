Now, Lenoir appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted of his pro se, in forma pauperis (IFP), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>Hale v. King, </em>642 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">Lenoir sought money damages, arguing that he was denied a fair trial because the judge and prosecutor allowed the witness who testified regarding the forensic pathology evidence to provide perjured testimony. The district court concluded that Lenoir\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). On appeal, Lenoir asserts that his success on the merits would not invalidate his conviction. He also asserts eonclusionally that success would only lead to DNA testing on a knife, which also would not invalidate his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">The test to determine whether a claim is barred by <em>Heck </em>is not whether success would invalidate the conviction, but whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. As found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>by the district court, Lenoir\u2019s claim that he was wrongly convicted based on constitutional violations at trial, namely the use of perjured testimony, necessarily implies that his conviction was invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>see also Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27-28 (5th Cir.1994) (concluding that a prisoner\u2019s claims that, inter alia, court-appointed counsel rendered ineffective assistance, the district court illegally indicted and sentenced him, and the named defendants conspired to violate his constitutional rights, were barred by <em>Heck). </em>Lenoir\u2019s assertion regarding DNA testing is deemed waived because he does not adequately brief the issue. <em>See Turner v. Quarterman, </em>481 F.3d 292, 295 n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, until Lenoir\u2019s conviction is overturned, expunged, or otherwise invalidated, his claims challenging the validity of his criminal trial are barred by <em>Heck. See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lenoir\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996) <em>Lenoir v. Palmer, et.al., </em>No. 1:10-CV-00119, slip op. at 1 (N.D.Miss. July 22, 2010) (unpublished). Accordingly, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g). Lenoir is also warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions. He should review all pending appeals to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
