Doc. 154, at 1-2. After investigator Doherty</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVuI\">saw what he thought was masturbation ... other police officers entered the bathroom and took Plaintiff to Kmart\u2019s loss control office and interviewed him. The police gave Plaintiff a misdemeanor citation for loitering for sexual purposes and Plaintiff left the Kmart. The charges against Plaintiff were later changed to public indecency.... After [Plaintiff] was cited by police, the GCPD.... issued a press release on behalf of the department ... [stating] that [Plaintiff] had been arrested and charged with loitering for the purpose of engaging in solicitation of sex acts in a public place and that Plaintiff had admitted that he was in the Kmart men\u2019s room for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 4-5. In granting summary judgment on Plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims, the court assumed that Plaintiffs detention was sufficient to support a \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest and held that inspector Doherty was entitled to qualified immunity \u2014 because he had arguable probable cause to believe that Plaintiff was engaging in the illicit activity with which he was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. The court therefore dismissed Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment claims against Doherty and the other defendants. It also found no merit in the officers\u2019 failure to inform him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights because the officers never took Plaintiff into custody. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Plaintiff challenges the court\u2019s summary judgment on a variety of grounds. We find that none has merit. Nor does his argument that the court should have sanctioned defendants for spoliation \u2014 specifically, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">Kmart deleted the videos from security cameras on the day that he was cited for loitering, the GCPD faded to secure copies of the videos, and the GCPD failed to collect evidence from the men\u2019s room, such as a piece of tissue paper that ... Doherty had seen on the floor and thought was a signal for solicitation as well as taking photographs of the graffiti on the men\u2019s room walls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-11\">. Plaintiff also appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his state law claims brought under the court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). In affirming the court\u2019s judgment on Plaintiff's federal constitutional claims, we affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>its dismissal without prejudice of his state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
