No petition for rehearing was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">On April 1, 2014, Judge Fay recused himself and directed the Clerk to inform the parties that he had just become aware that a conflict of interest existed at the time he participated on the panel in this case. In accordance with Advisory Opinion No. 71, 2B <em>Guide to Judiciary Policy, </em>Ch. 2 \u00a7 220 (June 2009), the parties were invited to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In a letter dated April 18, 2014, counsel for the defendants Wal-Mart and Hartford confirmed receipt of notice of the conflict and advised they do not seek any further relief. On May 1, 2014, plaintiff-appellant Peters filed a <em>pro se, </em>onepage letter (dated April 29, 2014), which response, liberally construed, asks this Court to reconsider and vacate its February 24, 2010 decision in light of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Upon reconstitution of the panel in light of Judge Fay\u2019s recusal and upon consideration of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s May 1, 2014 response, the Court recalls its mandate and vacates its prior February 24, 2010 opinion and judgment. And after having reviewed plaintiff-appellant\u2019s May 1, 2014 response, the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief filed on August 13, 2009, the defendant-appellee\u2019s brief filed on August 26, 2009, plaintiff-appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>reply brief filed on September 11, 2009, and the district court\u2019s decisions, the newly constituted panel finds no reversible error in the district court\u2019s decisions listed above. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decisions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
