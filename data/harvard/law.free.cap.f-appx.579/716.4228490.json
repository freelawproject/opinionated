On appeal, Allaben argues that: (1) that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because it improperly considered matters outside of the pleadings, and he sufficiently alleged a conspiracy between the Defendants and the judges; and (2) his post-judgment motion for reconsideration did not attempt to relitigate matters previously before the court, and supported the allegations in his complaint and demonstrated error in the court\u2019s findings. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of a Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Glover v. Liggett Grp., Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). General<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ly, the scope of review on a motion to dismiss is limited to the four corners of the complaint. <em>St. George v. Pinellas Cnty., </em>285 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration abuse of discretion. <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by Allaben\u2019s claim that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Although the complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, it must provide the grounds for relief, which \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to state a claim, the plaintiff must allege enough facts to make the claim \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. A complaint does not \u201csuffice if it tenders naked assertion[s] devoid of further factual enhancement.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn the case of a <em>pro se </em>action ... the court should construe the complaint more liberally than it would formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990). However, our \u201cduty to liberally construe a plaintiffs complaint in the face of a motion to dismiss is not the equivalent of a duty to re-write it for [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff must illustrate \u201cthat the conduct complained of (1) was committed by a person acting under color of state law and (2) deprived the complainant of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Harvey, </em>949 F.2d 1127, 1130 (11th Cir.1992). Private parties are generally not considered state actors for \u00a7 1983 purposes. <em>Id. </em>Private parties can be held liable under \u00a7 1983, however, if they act in concert with state officials in violating the plaintiffs constitutional rights. <em>Bendiburg v. Dempsey, </em>909 F.2d 463, 468 (11th Cir.1990). In order to succeed on a \u00a7 1983 claim for conspiracy, the plaintiff must show that the parties \u201creached an understanding\u201d to deny the plaintiff his rights, the parties\u2019 actions must actually impinge on a federal right, and the plaintiff must prove an actionable wrong. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The plaintiff need not produce a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d as nothing more than an \u201cunderstanding\u201d and \u201cwillful participation\u201d between private and state actors is necessary to show a joint action that would subject a private party to \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>Id. </em>at 469 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In <em>Harvey, </em>the plaintiff brought a \u00a7 1983 suit against four individual defendants and a private hospital based on their roles in her involuntary commitment for mental health treatment. 949 F.2d at 1129. We concluded that the plaintiffs complaint failed to allege a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy against three of the individual defendants because it did not sufficiently allege that the private and purported state actors had \u201creached an understanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1133. We also held that the plaintiffs complaint failed to allege a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy between two of the individual defendants and a state court judge because the complaint did not sufficiently allege that the judge was aware of the conspiracy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">In this case, the district court did not err in dismissing Allaben\u2019s complaint. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>begin with, the district court did not consider matters outside of the pleadings in dismissing the complaint. Rather, the court determined that Allaberis allegations were insufficient to demonstrate the judges\u2019 participation and knowledge of a conspiracy. The district court therefore was not required to follow summary judgment procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Moreover, Allaberis allegations of conspiracy were insufficient. Although private individuals who conspire with state officials can be held liable under \u00a7 1983, Allaberis allegations regarding a conspiracy between the Defendants and the judges were conclusory and failed to demonstrate that they \u201creached an understanding\u201d to deny Allaben his due process rights. <em>Bendiburg, </em>909 F.2d at 468. Additionally, Al-laberis allegations did not demonstrate \u201cwillful participation\u201d between the Defendants and the judges, <em>id. </em>at 469, or that the judges were aware of a conspiracy, <em>Harvey, </em>949 F.2d at 1133. Thus, Allaberis complaint failed to allege enough facts to make the claims \u201cplausible on [their] face.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We also find no merit to Allaberis claim that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting his post-judgment motion for reconsideration. To toll the appeal period, a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion must be filed within 28 days after the entry of judgment. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv);. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). A court may only grant a Rule 59 motion based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>500 F.3d at 1343. A Rule 59(e) motion cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise arguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Allaberis Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration. Al-laberis motion for reconsideration did not present newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors necessary for the grant of a Rule 59 motion for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>Instead, his motion improperly attempted to relitigate old matters by rehashing arguments he had previously made. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
