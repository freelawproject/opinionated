The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City of Port Orange, concluding that it did not violate either Title II or Section 504 because of the arrest of Geverzes. Gev-erzes now appeals, framing her sole issue on appeal as \u201c[wjhether the District Court erred by failing to find a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the City refused to give Gevarzes an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation leading to her arrest by failing to take her full statement and to provide qualified sign language interpreters, in violation of Title II and section 504.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Initial Br. at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-18\">There is arguably more than one ground for affirming the grant of summary judgment in favor of the City. The district court held that the City has demonstrated that failure to provide an interpreter was not unreasonable given Geverzes\u2019s \u201ceffective written communication and the totality of the circumstances. ...\u201d (District Court\u2019s Opinion, Doc. 74 at 9). We conclude that the district court did not err in reaching this conclusion in its well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-19\">We need not consider the other grounds for affirmance discussed in footnote 9 of the district court\u2019s opinion. (Doc. 74 at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
