Traylor argues that the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint violated his right to a jury trial and that his complaint was not frivolous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-24\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for frivolity for abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2001) (conducting frivolity review of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)). A district court has the inher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>ent authority to dismiss a frivolous complaint. <em>Fitzgerald v. First E. Seventh St. Tenants Corp., </em>221 F.3d 362, 363-64 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see also Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for S. Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 307-08, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 1821, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989) (\u201cSection 1915(d), for example, authorizes courts to dismiss a \u2018frivolous or malicious' action, but there is little doubt they would have power to do so even in the absence of this statutory provision.\u201d). We have reviewed the allegations in the complaint, and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Tray-lor\u2019s complaint as frivolous. As the district court properly noted, \u201c[n]one of the counts contain allegations that the defendants named in the action committed some wrong or violated some right of Tray-lor\u2019s .... \u201d (District Court Order at 2). The district court did not dismiss the complaint based upon its standing order. Thus, we need not address the propriety of the court\u2019s standing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-11\">. The district court had jurisdiction because the complaint, while frivolous, does purport to bring at least one claim under federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
