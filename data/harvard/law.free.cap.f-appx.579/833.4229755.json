In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Beckles claimed that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because his conviction for possession of a sawed-off shotgun was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court ultimately denied the claim, citing our decision in <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">On appeal, Beckles acknowledges that <em>Hall </em>forecloses his claim, but contends that the case was wrongly decided. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-25\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). We are bound by the opinion of a prior panel unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>overrules that opinion. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant who is convicted of a felony crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and who already had two prior such convictions, is subject to an enhanced sentence for being a career offender. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes \u201cany offense under ... state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The commentary to \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) explicitly states that \u201c[unlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) <em>(e.g., </em>a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1. Commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines that interprets a guideline \u201cis authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 37, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the Supreme Court concluded that an offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) \u2014 which defines the term using language nearly identical to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) \u2014 only if it is \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes of burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, or unlawful use of explosives. <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. at 1585. Applying <em>Begay, </em>in <em>United States v. McGill, </em>618 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2010), we concluded that a prior conviction for mere possession of a sawed-off shotgun, is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>McGill, </em>618 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In <em>Hall, </em>we decided that possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, as defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the ACCA. <em>McGill, </em>618 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In <em>Hall, </em>we decided that possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, as defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a), based on the commentary to that guideline provision. <em>Hall, </em>714 F.3d at 1273. We explained that the commentary was controlling over <em>Begay </em>and <em>McGill, </em>because the commentary did not violate the Constitution or a federal statute, and was not inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, the guideline text. <em>Id. </em>at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Here, Beckles\u2019s claim fails on the merits under <em>Hall, </em>and we are bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
