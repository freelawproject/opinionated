R. Friedman and Empire Construction Company (Empire) for breach of contract and of warranty. The declaration also sounded in negligence, but this was not considered below and will not be considered by us. From a judgment for $6,893.50 with interest and costs (there having been added to the costs $88.50 incurred in the taking of depositions), entered in Mrs. Clark\u2019s favor against both defendants, Mr. Friedman has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Mrs. Clark lives at 2440 Kalorama Road, in the District of Columbia. Sometime late in February or early in March 1966, Mr. Friedman, who was vice president and treasurer of Empire, came to Airs. Clark\u2019s house to discuss some work which Mrs. Clark wanted to have done. As Mrs. Clark explained, \u201c* * * [T]he house was going to be on a charity tour for the benefit [of] the Home for Incurables, and I wanted a professional all over job so it would be in tiptop shape for that tour.\u201d After Mrs. Clark had explained in detail what she wanted, Mr. Friedman prepared a contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">\u201cMarch 5, 1966</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">\u201cThis agreement made this 5 day of March 1966, by and between Empire Const. Co. and Mr. and Mrs. Clark hereinafter called the homeowner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">\u201cContractor agrees to furnish all labor and materials necessary to execute the following work on the premises located at 2440 Kalorama Road N.W. Washington D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">1. Repair all concrete on walls of stairs leading to house. Repair walls on driveway. Paint same areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>2.

Paint entire outside of home with special masonry-paint one coat only. Scrape stucco where necessary and patch. All bad trim to be scraped and two coats applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">7. The work shall be done in a good workmanlike manner, and with best quality materials. All standards guaranteed by manufacturers of materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">\u201cIn witness whereof the parties hereto have set their hands this 5 day of <em>March </em>1966.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">Total price (3790.00). To be paid on completion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">/s/ Deena Clark</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">OWNER (Mrs. Blake Clark) EMPIRE CONST. CO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">/s/ BY: I. R. Friedman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-15\">CONTRACTOR.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-16\">At this time, Mrs. Clark was not aware that Empire was a corporation with little or no assets, primarily engaged in estimating repair costs for insurance companies, nor did she know that Empire had neither the facilities nor the personnel which would be required to .perform the contract, and proposed to have all of the work done by subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-17\">According to Mrs. Clark, at the time the contract was signed, the following colloquy took place with Mr. Friedman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-18\">\u201c* * * I had to go with my husband to Hawaii on a business trip, therefore, couldn\u2019t supervise it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-19\">\u201cHe said, T will supervise it. I will be here. I will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>see everything they do. I will see that everything you want done is carried out.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In response to the question, \u201cDid you give him any consideration for that personal guarantee you just told us about?\u201d Mrs. Clark replied, \u201cOf my own volition I gave him a check for $1,000. He had assured me that he would do a first rate job, and to show my faith in him I volunteered to give him $1,000 in advance, and I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">When Mrs. Clark returned from Hawaii, she realized that the work had not been satisfactorily performed. This inspired a more significant conversation between Mrs. Clark and Mr. Friedman on 1 April. As she described it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201cQ. Now, immediately upon your return from Hawaii did you make a further payment to Mr. Friedman ? A. Yes. He admitted that all of these things were wrong on the third floor. He looked at the concrete and he said, \u2018That is terrible. We will just do that over.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201cAnd I showed him the sills that needed repainting. He said, \u2018That certainly will be done over. That is terrible.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">\u201cI took him on the second floor and showed him where it hadn\u2019t been painted. He said, \u2018That will be done over.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">\u201cAnd he sent a man to do it over. Everything I showed him he said it was quite right, that he agreed to do it over, that it was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">\u201cQ. Did you make a payment to him then? A. Yes, because he came to me. He said everything was going to he done correctly. I believed him. And so I said, \u2018Well, all right, I will give you another $1,000 if you personally guarantee that this is going to be done.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">\u201cHe said, T personally guarantee it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">\u201cSo, I sat down to make out the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-14\">\u201cAnd he said, \u2018Mrs. Clark, could you make that $1,700, and then it will be just an even $1,000 you will owe upon completion.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cQ. Subsequent \u2014 A. So, I made him a check for $1,700.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">During his pretrial deposition, later admitted as evidence in the case, Friedman admitted that he had guaranteed the work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201cQuestion: Did you orally warrant the work done under the contract ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cAnswer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cQuestion: And in addition you warranted it in the contract ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">\u201cAnswer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">\u201cQuestion: You personally ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">\u201cAnswer: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Mrs. Clark produced testimony that the exterior paint had peeled, the concrete work had disintegrated, the leaks in the house and the gutters had not been repaired, the plaster had cracked, and the interior painting and carpentry had not been properly done. The lower court concluded that a workmanlike job would involve an outlay of $5,000 for sandblasting, $1,400 for painting, $394 for repairs to concrete, and $99.50 for replacement of shrubbery and entered judgment for $6,893.50 against Empire and Friedman.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">Friedman assigns two reasons for the reversal of the judgment against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">1. A contract signed \u201cEmpire Construction Company by I. R. Friedman, Contractor\u201d imposes no personal liability on Friedman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-15\">2. Friedman\u2019s guaranty that the work would be done in a workmanlike manner. was not supported by consideration, and a claim based upon it is barred by the Statute of Frauds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">For the purposes of this opinion, we shall assume the correctness of Friedman\u2019s first contention, and consider the second, which we regard as the only issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">As we see it, Frie'dman\u2019s argument that his personal guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>anty was not supported by consideration is without merit. Clearly it was his agreement to supervise the work personally which induced Mrs. Clark to advance .$1,000 on 5 March and his personal guaranty which led her to pay $1,790 on 1 April. Under the terms of the contract no'payment was due until the work was completed. It is of no consequence that the advance payments were not received by Friedman. Consideration can be found in the detriment to Mrs. Clark. <em>Clay v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., </em>184 F. 2d 995 (D.C. Cir. 1950) ; <em>Owens v. Liff, </em>65 A. 2d 921 (D.C. Mun. App. 1949) ; <em>Belfiore v. B. J. Crivella, Inc., </em>60 A. 2d 542 (D.C. Mun. App. 1948) ; <em>Humbird v. Humbird, </em>162 Md. 582, 160 A. 623 (1932) ; <em>Hercules Powder Co. v. Harry T. Campbell Sons Co., </em>156 Md. 346, 144 A. 510 (1929) ; <em>Chicora Fertilizer Co. v. Dunan, </em>91 Md. 144, 156, 46 A. 347 (1900); Restatement, <em>Contracts </em>(1932) \u00a7 75. Under our decisions, the fact that the checks were received by Empire, of which Friedman was an officer and stockholder, was of sufficient benefit to him to support his promise. <em>Gordon v. State Nat'l Bank, </em>249 Md. 378, 384, 239 A. 2d 915 (1968) <em>; Foland v. Hoffman, </em>186 Md. 423, 47 A. 2d 62 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Friedman\u2019s argument that Mrs. Clark\u2019s claim on his guaranty is barred by the Statute of Frauds. In the first place, this question was not raised below. Maryland Rule 885, which provides that \u201cThis Court will not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court; * * *\u201d is enunciatory of long established practice. Chapter 117, Laws of Maryland (1825) ; Maryland Code (1951) Art. 5, \u00a7 10; <em>Gordon v. State Nat'l Bank, supra, </em>249 Md. at 383; <em>Schiller v. Lefkowitz, </em>242 Md. 461, 219 A. 2d 378 (1966). In <em>J. A. Laporte Corp. v. Pennsylvania-Dixie Cement Corp., </em>164-Md. 642, 165 A. 195, 168 A. 844, 108 A.L.R. 1474 (1933) our predecessors held that the Statute of Frauds could not be-raised for the first time on appeal. In passing, we note that Friedman would have shouldered a more onerous burden in the District of Columbia, where the Statute must be affirmatively pleaded as a defense. <em>Cavalier v. Weinstein, </em>80 A. 2d 918 (D.C. Mun. App. 1951) ; <em>Saunders System Washington Co. v. Kuffner, </em>75 A. 2d 136 (D.C. Mun. App. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The result would not, however, have been different had the Statute of Frauds been raised as a defense below. District of Columbia Code (1967) \u00a7 28-3502 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cAn action may not be brought * * * to charge the defendant upon a special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person * * * unless the agreement upon which the action is brought, or a memorandum or note thereof, is in writing, which need not state the consideration and signed by the party to be charged therewith or a person authorized by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">For the purposes of this case, there is no significant difference between the form of the Statute in force in the District and 29 Car. 2 (1676), Chapter 3, Section IV (2), 2 Alexander\u2019s British Statutes (Coe Ed., 1912) at 509, which is in force in Maryland. Consequently, there is no need for us to consider whether the Statute is of a substantive or procedural nature. <em>Simmons Co. v. Crew, </em>84 F. 2d 82 (4th Cir. 1936); <em>Lams v. F. H. Smith Co., </em>36 Del. (6 Harr.) 477, 178 A. 651 (Super. Ct. 1935) ; Restatement, <em>Conflict of Laws </em>(1934) \u00a7 334, comment b at 412, \u00a7 598, comment a at 715, \u00a7 602, comment a at 719; 2 Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>(1950) \u00a7 293 at 68. <em>Compare, </em>however, Fo<em>rt Worth Packing Co. v. Consumers\u2019 Meat Co., </em>86 Md. 635, 39 A. 746 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Decisions of this Court recognize that testimony recorded in open court will, under appropriate circumstances, take the case out of the Statute. <em>Janowitz v. Slagle, </em>250 Md. 140, 242 A. 2d 123 (1968); <em>Pollin v. Perkins, </em>223 Md. 532, 165 A. 2d 908 (1960); <em>Dove v. White, </em>211 Md. 228, 126 A. 2d 835 (1956) <em>; Kaufmann v. Adalman, </em>186 Md. 639, 47 A. 2d 755 (1946) ; <em>Sealock v. Hackley, </em>186 Md. 49, 45 A. 2d 744 (1946); <em>Trossbach v. Trossbach, </em>185 Md. 47, 42 A. 2d 905 (1945) ; 2 Corbin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 320 at 152. <em>Compare, </em>however, <em>Lambdin v. Przyborowski, </em>250 Md. 108, 242 A. 2d 150 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">As Judge (later Chief Judge) Markell, speaking for this Court in <em>Trossbach v. Trossbach, supra, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\u201cUnder existing procedure, the purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to protect a party, not from tempta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tion to commit perjury but from perjured evidence against him. The purpose of evidence is to prove facts. Admissions of a party in testifying, though in form evidence, are in essence not mere evidence, but make evidence against him unnecessary. * * * We think the Statute of Frauds requires no more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cFurthermore, admissions of a party in the form of testimony would constitute sufficient \u2018memoranda\u2019 under Section 4 or Section 17, or \u2018writings\u2019 under Section 7, of the statute. For this purpose we think recorded testimony should be regarded as equivalent to signed depositions.\u201d 185 Md. at 55, 56.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">So far as we have been able to ascertain, the courts of the District of Columbia have not addressed themselves to this question, and we assume that the District will follow Maryland law in instances where its courts have not spoken. <em>Seidenberg v. Seidenberg, </em>126 F. Supp. 19, 22 (D.D.C. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Had Friedman relied on the Statute of Frauds, we would have concluded that his admission that he had guaranteed the work took the case out of the Statute and would have amply supported the result reached below.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-18\">. This check, offered in evidence in the case, was actually for $1,790.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
