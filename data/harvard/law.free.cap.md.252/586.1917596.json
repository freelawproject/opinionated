The sea of matrimony became storm-tossed as soon as they embarked, and remained so until Mr. Baer left the marriage domicil on 19 December 1965, Mr. Baer says he was told to \u201cget out\u201d and contended that his wife\u2019s conduct amounted to constructive desertion; Mrs. Baer says that she was deserted by her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">On 22 December 1965, Mr. Baer brought suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a partial divorce charging Mrs. Baer with constructive desertion. On 29 December 1965, Mrs. Baer countered with a bill for permanent alimony, which she filed in Baltimore City. On 23 February 1966, she filed a complaint for separate maintenance in Florida, and on 3 March 1966, dismissed the action in Baltimore City. On 28 March 1967, she filed an answer and a cross bill in the <em>a mensa </em>action in Baltimore County. On 22 June 1967, Mr. Baer filed a supplemental bill of complaint in Baltimore County, praying a di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>vorce <em>a vinculo </em>on grounds of constructive desertion and adultery. Mrs. Baer responded with a supplemental cross bill, asking a divorce <em>a vinculo, </em>alleging desertion and adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On this state of the pleadings, the case went to trial. At the end of the fourth day of trial, when all the testimony was in, Mrs. Baer moved to amend her supplemental cross bill of complaint by striking out the prayer for an <em>a vinculo </em>divorce. From a decree granting Mrs. Baer a divorce <em>a vinculo, </em>alimony of $720 per month, counsel fees of $3,000 and costs, appeals were taken by both Mrs. Baer and Mr. Baer.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The only substantial question raised by this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit Mrs. Baer to amend her cross bill which Mrs. Baer assigns as an additional ground for her appeal. The allowance of alimony, counsel fees and costs ordinarily lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed. Mrs. Baer\u2019s conduct during the marriage did not, under the decisions of this Court, amount to constructive desertion, and Mr. and Mrs. Baer\u2019s charges and countercharges of adultery are not supported by proof of a character which we have consistently required. Since Mrs. Baer\u2019s cross bill contained no prayer for a-determination of property rights she cannot now complain that the decree was silent in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Maryland Rule 320 deals with, amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201ca. <em>Scope and Purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">1.

Marine Bank of Crisfield, </em>120 Md. 396, 87 A. 697 (1913), where abuse of discretion was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We regard as misplaced Mrs. Baer\u2019s reliance on <em>Wald v. Wald, 161 </em>Md. 493, 159 A. 97 (1931) where our predecessors set aside the granting of a divorce which had never been prayed. The chancellor was not impressed by Mrs. Baer\u2019s contention that she proposed to abandon the prayer for an <em>a vinculo </em>divorce in order to save the marriage, and under the facts in the record before us, we see no reason why he should have found this persuasive. There was ample evidence for him to find, as he did, that the attempt to amend was a tactical move, not dictated by a desire to promote justice. Under such circumstances, we cannot say that there was clear abuse of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
