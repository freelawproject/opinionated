One sister refused to perform the contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the prospective purchaser, who had been ready, willing and able to accept and pay for the stock of all the sisters, refused to vary the contract and accept and pay for the stock of the two sisters who tendered it against payment of two-thirds of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The two tendering sisters then sued a brother for having maliciously induced the breach of the contract to sell the stock. Judge Moore, hearing the case without a jury, found that the brother, not being privileged to do so, purposefully and maliciously for his own unjustified and selfish reasons had induced his sister not to perform the contract and therefore was guilty of tortious interference with contract rights, 4 Restatement <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 766; <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. v.
