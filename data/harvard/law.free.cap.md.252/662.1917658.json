Since that defense was unsuccessful he has appealed. His assignment of error arises out of counsel\u2019s <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201ccomment to the jury in closing argument\u201d in respect of his \u201cfailure to testify\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the subsequent refusal of the trial judge, Meloy, J., to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The case came on for trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County before Judge Meloy and a jury in May 1968. In his opening statement counsel for appellee told the jury he would show that, after 10 years of marriage and the birth of three children, she became separated from her husband in February 1964, that shortly thereafter she became Littreal\u2019s mistress, that as a result of their liaison twins (one of whom survives) were born in September 1965, and that in August 1967 she gave birth to another child. Appellee and her mother so testified. No testimony or other evidence was offered by Littreal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We have set forth the following excerpt from the opening statement of counsel for Littreal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cMadam juror and gentlemen of the jury, on behalf of the defendant we hope to show you that after this lady, Mrs. Redwine, separated from her husband in 1964 she took up with a series of young gentlemen, any one of which could have been the father of these children. We will show' you that she was living with a man \u2014 and I mean living with him as husband and wife, not as brother and sister \u2014 by the name of Bubby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Watts. We will show you that she had an affair with a police officer in No. 9 Precinct by the name of R. D. Green, and actually this man Green was the one she really separated from her husband over. We will show you that she also had an affair with another police officer from No. 9 Precinct in Washington by the name of Howard Hossler, and that in between those times she had an affair with a man named Gene Sales, she had an affair with a carpenter by the name of Johnny Hubbard, she took on two brothers named Bobby Kersey and Harry Kersey and she also finished .up with a fellow named Ken Gabrielson, who was also a police officer from No. 9 Precinct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">\u201cWe will show you that this is an attempt by this lady to attempt to \u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t use the term blackmail \u2014 but force extortion, to force Mr. Littreal to pay for these children, pay her support for these children, and Mr. Littreal, who is also a policeman from No. 9 Precinct in Washington, D. C., has been subjected by this lady, we will show you, to prosecution in the District of Columbia where she attempted to have him lose his job over this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">What follows is from the closing argument of counsel for appellee :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201cThere have been a lot of men who have been named here. Mrs. Redwine freely admits that she either knew them or went for a ride with one, or casually knew who they were. They were all somehow attempted to be connected with this, but we haven\u2019t seen any of them in here. And apparently it is not too difficult to find them because apparently, by her own testimony the ones that she knew were local people, they seemed to be rather local people, and not one of them has come in here to take the stand to say that, yes, he did know her in a more intimate way than the petitioner has testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cSo what have we really got in this case? We have got a situation where we have the petitioner here who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>did indeed have an affair, if you want to call it that, with Mr. Littreal. Her husband was not around and during the time that she was having the affair she became pregnant, pregnant by the person, the one person that she was having sexual relationships with at that time, Mr. Littreal. <em>And there is no testimony to contradict that.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Before proceeding with his closing argument counsel for Littreal moved for a mistrial. Although counsel for appellee exhibited a willingness to \u201cconcede * * * to a mistrial,\u201d Judge Meloy, correctly we think, denied the motion. The jury found Littreal to be the father of the surviving twin and the child born in August 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Littreal, in his brief, relied entirely on <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U. S. 609 (1965). At argument he cited <em>White v. United States, </em>248 A. 2d 825 (D. C. Mun. App. 1969), decided 8 January. In our judgment neither decision is persuasive here. In <em>Griffin </em>the petitioner was convicted of murder in the first degree by a California jury in a trial in which he did not testify. The court imposed the death penalty. He had been seen with the victim the evening before her death in the alley where her body was found. In argument to the jury the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cThe defendant certainly knows whether Essie Mae had this beat up appearance at the time he left her apartment and went down the alley with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201cWhat kind of a man is it that would want to have sex with a woman that beat up if she was beat up at the time he left ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">\u201cHe would know that. He would know how she got down the alley. He would know how the blood got on the bottom of the concrete steps. He would know how long he was with her in that box. He would know how her wig got off. He would know whether he beat her or mistreated her. He would know whether he walked away from that place cool as a cucumber when he saw Mr. Villasenor because he was conscious of his own guilt and wanted to get away from that damaged or injured woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201cThese things he has not seen fit to take the stand and deny or explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201cAnd in the whole world, if anybody would know, this defendant would know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cEssie Mae is dead, she can\u2019t tell you her side of the story. The defendant won\u2019t.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610-11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Despite the provision in the California Constitution, Art. I \u00a7 13, which permits such comment, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment, in its direct application to the Federal Government, and in its bearing on the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615. Of course, the statement of the California prosecutor, were it uttered in a court of this State, would likewise be proscribed. <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 182 A. 287 (1936). The comment in the case at bar, however, is a horse of quite another, shade. In <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>337 F. 2d 180, 203 (4th Cir. 1964), <em>aff\u2019d and remanded, </em>383 U. S. 169 (1966), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">\u201cEdlin claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to take the stand. The incident referred to occurred alt the end of the Government\u2019s closing summary to the jury. After pointing out asserted inconsistencies in the appellant\u2019s positions, the prosecutor spoke these words:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\u2018Members of the Jury, the defendant Edlin <em>has presented no defense in this case. He has presented no evidence to contradict the charges against him. He Itas \u00a1produced no</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> evidence to deny numerous statements </em>made by many, many government witnesses. <em>He has produced no evidence to deny the testimony of numerous witnesses of his various activities </em>which clearly indicate beyond any doubt, Members of the Jury, his guilt of the charges in this indictment.\u2019 [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">\u201cIn <em>Davis v. United States, 279 </em>F. 2d 127 (4th Cir. 1960), a similar argument was presented. The answer we gave applies with equal force here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u2018The United States Attorney\u2019s argument cannot be said to have constituted a forbidden comment on the failure of the defendants to testify. He merely reviewed certain testimony and added, truthfully, that there was no evidence in contradiction.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cThe prosecutor did not draw improper attention to Edlin\u2019s refusal to testify. He merely pointed out that the defense did not introduce evidence to contradict certain of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses. <em>Edlin was not the only person who could have refuted the Government\u2019s witnesses. Leathers v. United States, </em>250 F. 2d 159, 165 (9th Cir. 1957). The prosecutor addressed himself to the absence of any thing in the record to contradict the Government\u2019s version of the case. Under these circumstances his comment was not improper. <em>Davis v. United States, supra ; Garcia v. United States, </em>315 F. 2d 133, 137 (5th Cir. 1963).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">To the same effect <em>see King v. State, </em>190 Md. 361, 58 A. 2d 663 (1948) ; <em>United States v. Day, </em>384 F. 2d 464 (3d Cir. 1967) ; <em>United States v. Giuliano, </em>383 F. 2d 30 (3d Cir. 1967) ; <em>Miller v. State, </em>224 A. 2d 592 (Del. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">In <em>White v. United States, supra, </em>the defendant, convicted by a jury of assault, offered no evidence at the trial, nor did he testify. During final argument the prosecutor commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201c \u2018Who struck the first blows in this case after the defendant was arrested? Mr. White struck the first blows. That was the testimony of the two police officers. <em>You have heard nothing to the contrary.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">\u201cHe also said during his rebuttal argument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">\u201c \u2018The case really is one of credibility. Do you believe the police officers? I see no reason why you shouldn\u2019t believe the police officers. <em>There has been no testimony to the contrary.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 825.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>It was established in the Government\u2019s case that the defendant was the only person who could have contradicted the testimony of the two police officers. The court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments, in the circumstances, \u201cclearly called the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the appellant [defendant] had not testified and [that] * * * such comments were improper and prejudicial.\u201d How different is the situation in the case at bar! Here Littreal\u2019s counsel announced with rather startling precision that he would prove appellee had lain with Bubby Watts, R. D. Green, Howard Hossler, Gene Sales, Johnny Hubbard, Bobby Kersey, Harry Kersey and Ken Gabrielson. Except for an isolated tumble with Hossler, which she recalled took place on New Year\u2019s Day 1965, she denied having had anything to do with any of them. Presumably all of these men were known to Littreal; indeed, Green, Hossler and Gabrielson were fellow officers assigned to Precinct No. 9, yet none of them was produced as a witness. We think the applicable law was correctly stated in <em>United States v. </em>Johnson, <em>supra. </em>The statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibits comment <em>or </em>reference \u201cwith respect to defendant\u2019s failure to testify\u201d and it seems obvious to us that counsel\u2019s comment in the trial below was aimed, not at Littreal\u2019s failure to testify, but at his failure to produce the witnesses promised in the opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\">.
