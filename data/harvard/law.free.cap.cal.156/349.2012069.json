In view of the statement in the petition for the writ to the effect that a difference of opinion exists among the courts of this state as to the right of a court on <em>habeas corpus </em>to determine the question whether a complaint in a court of limited or inferior jurisdiction states facts sufficient to constitute a public offense, it appears proper to say that the rule in this state in that regard is correctly stated in <em>Ex parte Greenall, </em>153 Cal. 767, 770, [96 Pac. 804], in which case it is plainly pointed out that the rule is different from the one applied to courts of general jurisdiction, as in <em>Ex parte Ruef, </em>150 Cal. 665, [89 Pac. 605], An examination of the opinion in the case of Tobias Watkins, 3 Pet. (U. S.) 193, cited in the Greenall case, will disclose grounds for this distinction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
