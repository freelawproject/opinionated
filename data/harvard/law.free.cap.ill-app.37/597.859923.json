Hothing further was done in the case until February 20, 1890, when the appearance of the appellee was entered by one professing to be his attorney, and on the next day the case was called for trial, and the appeal dismissed for want of prosecution. Conceding this to be error, it can not be reviewed on this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b596-9\" pgmap=\"596\">March 18, 1890, which was in another term of the court, the appellant moved to reinstate the case, which, being denied, this appeal was taken, which brings up only that order. To bring up the order of February 21st, the appeal must have been taken at the February term; otherwise the remedy is by writ of error. Practice Act, Sec. 67. If it was error to dismiss the appeal at the February term, it was error in law\u2014the fact that the appellee had not been brought in or entered his appearance in pursuance of any of the provisions of Secs. 65 to 68 of the act concerning justices, being apparent of record, and therefore the error could not be corrected by the same court at another term.

It miy be admitted that if the fact had been made to appear that the appearance of the appellee was entered by one who was not an attorney at law, that the action of the court based upon the assumption that he was such an attorney would be error in fact. Robb v. Smith, 3 Scam. 46; Hopwood v. Adams, 5 Burr, 2660. But the burden was on appellant to show the fact. Iglehart v. Chi. M. &amp; F. Ins.
