Niehoff by the name and style of \u201c Directors of the Wahnaliton Association.\u201d They, and they alone, have the legal interest in the contract, the legal title under the bond; therefore, they alone can sue upon it at law.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-12\" pgmap=\"406(22) 407(36)\">\u201cThe action must be brought,\u201d says Cliitty, \u201cin the name of the party in whom the legal interest in such contract was vested.\u201d \u201c The right of action at law has been wisely vested solely in the party having the strict legal title and interest in exclusion of the mere equitable claim.\u201d 1 Chit, on Plead., *2, *3.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-4\" pgmap=\"407\">And this, too, notwithstanding \u201c the equitable right embrace the most extensive, or even the exclusive interest in the benefit to be derived from the contract or subject-matter of the litigation.\u201d Id. *p. 3.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-5\" pgmap=\"407\">The bond in suit is under the seals of all the signers, and in such case the common law, followed by the courts of this State, is thus laid down by Chitty:</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-6\" pgmap=\"407\">\u201cIf a bond be given to \u2018 A\u2019 conditioned for the payment of money to him for the use or benefit of \u2018 B,\u2019 or conditioned to pay the money to CB,\u2019 the action must be brought in the name of \u2018A,\u2019 and \u2018Bcan not sue for or release the demand. In such case 1A \u2019 is evidently a trustee, and the obligatory part of the instrument, and the acknowledgment of legal responsibility are to him.\u201d 1 Chitty on Pl., * 3, and ref\u2019s.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\" pgmap=\"407\">To the same effect, Gantzert v. Hoge, 73 Ill. 30; Sandowsky v. Neal, 2 Ill. App. 624; Scott v. The People, 2 Ill. App. 645.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A50\" pgmap=\"407\">The parties designated as \u201c directors\u201d in this bond, that is, the complainantsj and William C. Niehoff, are like A in the case last stated, evidently trustees, and the case stands just as if they had been called trustees in the bond instead of directors. It is vain to argue, as was done below, that associated individuals, unincorporated, can not have directors. As well argue that they can not have trustees.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-9\" pgmap=\"407\">That the directors in this ease, including William C. Niehoff, instead of all the members of the association, would be the proper plaintiffs in an action at law upon this bond, is clearly shown by Metcalf v. Bruin, 12 East, 400.</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-10\" pgmap=\"407(83) 408(132)\">This very instructive case holds that \u201c A bond given to trustees to secure the faithful services of a clerk to the Globe Insurance Company, who were no corporation, may be put in suit by the trustees for a breach of faithful service by the clerk, committed at any time during his continuance in the service of the actual existing body of persons, carrying on the same business under the same name, notwithstanding any intermediate change of the original holders of the shares, by death or transfer; and the intervention of the trustees removed all legal and technical difficulties to such a contract made with, or suit instituted by the company themselves as a natural body.\u201d Lord Ellenborough said there was \u201cno question as to the persons to whom the obligation was made\u201d (p. 402); \u201cno difficulty in suing upon it in their own names \u201d (405); \u201cnothing illegal in such a contract \u201d (407); \u201c a contract with the body itself would not have done, but a contract with the trustees, for the benefit of the body, gets rid of the difficulty \u201d (406). LeBlanc, Justice, recognizes that \u201c the trustees \u201d were \u201c the obligees of the bond in the place of the company \u201d (408). Metcalf v. Bruin, 12 East, 400-409.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\" pgmap=\"408\">The authorities already referred to establish that William C. Biehoff would be an indispensable plaintiff at law, as one of the directors, and he would be an equally indispensable plaintiff as one of the Wahnalitons, if such a suit could be brought on the bond by all the Wahnahton members, notwithstanding they are not obligees. In either case, William C. Biehoff would be both plaintiff and defendant, and this the common law will not tolerate for a moment.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\" pgmap=\"408\">\u201cThe same person can not be both plaintiff and defendant\u201d (either solely or with others).</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-8\" pgmap=\"408\">\u201cIt is clear, upon the acknowledged principles of pleading in the common law, that a party can not at once be a plaintiff and a defendant in the same action; or in other words, sue himself either alone or in conjunction with others.\u201d Dicey on Parties (Truman\u2019s Notes), 79, and ref\u2019s; Story on Partnership, Sec. 221; Jones v. Yates, 9 Barn. &amp; Cress. 537; Parsons on Partnership. 288, and ref\u2019s (Chap. 8, Sec. 3).</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-9\" pgmap=\"408\">But it will doubtless be contended that William C. Biehoff is no longer a director, and need not be one of the plaintiffs at law, and that the other directors only need be plaintiffs. This position is untenable. The bond was given, and so the bill alleges, to ten specified individuals, William C. Biehoff being one. Those ten became and still remain the obligees.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-10\" pgmap=\"408(30) 409(84)\">The term \u201cdirectors\u201d in the bond was mere \u201cdesorijptio personarwm (like \u201c trustees\u201d in the case in 12 East), pointing out who the ten individual obligees were. That once ascertallied, remains unalterable. The obligees were not one set of men at one time and another set at another. William C. Niehoff is just as much an obligee as he ever was, and would be an unexceptionable co-plaintiff but for the fact that he would have to sue himself. This, the bill alleges, he will not do; and the law will not let him do it, not because he is not still the obligee, but precisely because he is the obligee and also obligor.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-4\" pgmap=\"409\">Heither the death of William 0. BTiehoff, or the demise or abdication of his directorship, could legalize the suit if one were subsequently brought by his co-obligees on a bond in which he was both obligor and obligee; because, as no suit at law could be brought on such a bond in his lifetime, or in the life of his directorship, none can be brought afterward. This doctrine is clearly laid down in all the books:</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\" pgmap=\"409\">Dicey says: \u201c Where two or more persons must join as plaintiffs in an action, they can not bring any action in which it would be necessary to make one of them defendants. So, where an individual is a common partner in two houses of trade, no action can be maintained by the one house against the other upon any transactions which take- place between them while such individual is a common partner; and that whether the action be brought during his lifetime or after his death. Dicey on Parties, 75-80, and ref\u2019s.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\" pgmap=\"409\">\u201c The rule\u201d says Parsons, \u201c is applied with equal strictness after the death of the partner common to both firms, or of any other partner, and after the dissolution of the partnership in any way.\u201d \u201c The foundation of the rule is, that a party can not sue himself, because he can not contract with himself, and therefore there never was a valid contract at law between these two firms. Parsons on Partnership, 290; see, also, 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., Sec. 679, p. 690.</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\" pgmap=\"409\">This reasoning is obviously just as applicable to other cases where parties undertake to contract .with themselves, as to contracts between two firms having a common partner. It is not, in other words, a rule confined to the law of partnership. \u201cA, B and C can no more sue A, D and E than A can sue A,\u201d says Parsons (289), and this applies to suits on ,all contracts, whether between firms or otherwise.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-4\" pgmap=\"410\">Parsons says (290) that \u201c the entire sufficiency of equity in such cases has doubtless prevented courts or legislators from annulling or modifying this rule \u201d (preventing a party from being both plaintiff and defendant at law).</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\" pgmap=\"410\">The remedy in equity is also recognized in note 1 and references, Dicey on Parties, 79, and in Jones v. Yates, 9 Barn. &amp; Cress. 539, and in 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., p. 690, Secs. 679, 680, 681.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\" pgmap=\"410\">Courts of equity, in all such cases, look behind the form of the transactions to their substance, and treat the different firms for the purposes of substantial justice, exactly as if they were composed of strangers, or were in fact, corporated companies.\u201d Equity Juris., Secs. 679, 680.</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\" pgmap=\"410\">Haven v. Wakefield, 39 Ill. 519, furnishes another illustration of the jurisdiction of equity over cases where parties have no remedy at law, upon contracts in which they are at once obligor and' obligee. The contract in that case was a lease. \u201c In such cases,\u201d says the court, \u201c to prevent a failure of justice, equity takes jurisdiction and makes compensation for any injury that may have been sustained.\u201d 39 Ill. 519.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-8\" pgmap=\"410\">In McElhanon v. McElhanon, 63 Ill. 457, it was held: \u201c The rule that a party can not be both plaintiff and defendant in an action\u2014-that it is an answer to an action that a party is legally interested on each side of the question, will operate, although a party appears on one side in his personal, and on the other, in his official character.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-9\" pgmap=\"410\">In Church v. First National Bank, 87 Ill. 68, it was held : \u201c If a bank pays out the money of the partnership to one of the partners upon his check in fraud of the rights of the other partner, an action at law can not he maintained in the firm name against the bank. Resort must be had to a court of equity for the relief of those partners claiming to be injured.\u201d There was absolutely no remedy at law, but an acknowledged wrong which equity alone could redress. The same princi. pie governs the case at bar, and the authorities there cited are applicable. In support of equity jurisdiction over this cause we further cite: Bosanquet v. Ray, 6 Taunt. 695; 2 Ohio St. R. 30; 11 Me. 198; 13 Ga. 368.</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-3\" pgmap=\"411\">All proper and necessary parties are before the court. They need not be all individually named.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\" pgmap=\"411\">Complainants allege that they \u201cfiled this bill on their own behalf and on behalf of all the members constituting the Wahnahton Association \u201d numbering \u201c several thousand persons.\u201d The general rule is conceded that all persons materially interested in the subject-matter ought to be made parties to the suit. But one of the established exceptions to the rule is stated by Mr. Justice Story as follows (Equity Pleadings, Sec. 107):</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\" pgmap=\"411\">\u201c The second class of cases constituting an exception to the general rule is, where the parties form a voluntary association for public or private purposes, and those who sue or defend, may fairly be presumed to represent the rights and interests of the whole. In cases of this sort the persons interested are commonly numerous, and any attempt to unite them all in the suit would be, even if practicable, exceedingly inconvenient, and would subject the proceedings to the danger of perpetual abatements and other impediments, arising from intermediate deaths or other accidents, or changes of interest. Under such circumstances, as there is a privity of interest, the court will allow a bill to be brought by some of the parties on behalf of themselves and all the others, taking care that there shall be a due representation of all substantial interests before the court. And such a bill must be brought on behalf of all the parties in interest, for if it be brought for the plaintiffs alone it will not be sustained by the court for the want of proper parties.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-6\" pgmap=\"411\">And see also same author, sections 108 and 109, for illustrations entirely parallel with the case now before the court.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-7\" pgmap=\"411\">Section 95 of the same author lays it down, \u201c that the mere fact of numerousness \u201d is enough to dispense with a suit in the names of all the parties.

Armstrong, 3 Dev. L. 284.</p> <p id=\"b412-8\" pgmap=\"412\">If one gives his bond to another and himself it can not be sued at law, for a man can not be both plaintiff and defendant in the same action at law, whether others be associated with him or not. But' the defect in the instrument does not render it void. It is a teoluiiealand not substantial defect. \u201cIt applies to the remedy and not to the right; and may be obviated by resorting to a court of equity, in which a man can be both plaintiff and defendant in the same suit.\u201d Booth v. Kinsey, 8 Gratt. 560; Batchelder v. Wendelell, 36 N. H. 204; Jones v.

Metcalf v. Bruin, 12 East, 400. But because of the technical objection at law, there would be a failure of justice unless equity would enforce the obligation.</p> <p id=\"b412-10\" pgmap=\"412(12) 413(61)\">Says Mitford in Eq. Pl. 111: \u201c The jurisdiction of a court of equity is to be exercised (1) where the principles of law by which the ordinary courts are guided, give a right; but the powers of those courts are not sufficient to afford a complete remedy, or their modes of proceeding cure inadequate to the purpose.\u201d See, also, 1 Story Eq. Jur., Secs. 679, 80-81; Haven v. Wakefield, 39 Ill. 519.</p> <p id=\"Akz\" pgmap=\"413\">So far, therefore, as the court below,- in sustaining the demurrer, proceeded on the ground assigned, that there was a remedy at law and therefore equity had no jurisdiction, the view was erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b413-5\" pgmap=\"413\">The very case is presented where there can be no remedy at law, and that, if there is a right, is an adequate ground on which to ask the aid of a court of equity. 3STor do we think the objection that equity will not enforce a penalty will avail appellees as a defense. The bond is a joint and several undertaking, and upon the faith of it, one of the contracting parties obtained the money sought to be recovered. The contract is that William C. Niehoff shall, at the expiration of his term, turn over to his successor all moneys belonging to the association.</p> <p id=\"b413-6\" pgmap=\"413\">This is tlie contract of all the obligors, and equity will in its own method enforce it, not by giving judgment for the penalty of the bond, but by decreeing the payment of the money received. Equity regards not the form, but the substance.</p> <p id=\"b413-7\" pgmap=\"413\">It is strenuously urged, however, that the proper parties are not before the court; that all the members of this association must be made parties complainant. True, the general rule in equity is, that all parties in interest should be made parties to the suit, either as complainants or as defendants, but there are well established exceptions to this rule.</p> <p id=\"b413-8\" pgmap=\"413\">Here the parties who file the bill are in fact under the particular form of organization adopted by this voluntary association, representatives of all the members, and of the association.</p> <p id=\"b413-9\" pgmap=\"413(33) 414(64)\">In Taylor v. Salmon, 4 Mylne &amp; Craig, 134, the bill was filed by the directors of a joint stock company, on behalf of themselves and all other stockholders seeking to have the benefit of an agreement entered into by an agent of the company. There was a demurrer for want of parties, and the Lord Chancellor said: \u201c That where the parties interested are numerous, and the suit is for an object common to them all, some of the body may maintain a bill on behalf of themselves and of the others, is established.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b414-6\" pgmap=\"414\">The same rule was applied in Wallworth v. Holt, 4 Mylne &amp; Craig, 619, and in the notes to this last mentioned case, a case decided.by LordLangdale is cited, where one member of a club filed a bill on behalf of himself and other members, against two of the members, to recover money of the club and for other relief. There was a demurrer for want of parties. The demurrer was overruled. The court said the bill sought to recover the particular assets, \u201c not for the purpose of distribution by or through the means of this suit, but for the purpose of bringing them within the control of the governing body of the partnership, in order that they may be applied under their control according to the rights of the parties. *\u25a0 * * The plaintiff and all the other members except these two defendants must have an interest in having the money, which the demurrer admits to be in the defendants\u2019 possession, brought within the control of the club; that is the common interest of all. How this money when it is brought within the control of the club ought to be applied, is another matter. To ask to recover it and place it within the control of the club, and leave it there subject to litigation, is asking no more than was done in the case of Wallworth v. Holt, where matters were thus left. If, then, it is for the common benefit of all, except the two defendants, that those funds should be recovered, why should it not be done % \u201d Richardson v. Hastings, 7 Beav. 323.</p> <p id=\"b414-8\" pgmap=\"414(74) 415(110)\">Story\u2019s Eq. Pleading, Sec. 107, mentions as an exception to the general rule, cases \u201c where the parties form a voluntary association for public or private purposes, and those who sue or defend may fairly be presumed to represent the rights and interests of the whole. In cases of this sort the persons interested are commonly numerous, and any attempt to unite them all in the suit would be, even if practicable, exceedingly inconvenient. * * * Under such circumstances as there is a privity of interest, the court will allow a bill to be brought by some of the parties on behalf of themselves and all the others, taking care that there shall be a due representation of all substantial interests before the court. And such a bill must be brought on behalf of all the parties in interest, for if it be brought for the plaintiff alone, it will not be sustained by the court for the want of proper parties.\u201d See Fen v. Craig, 3 Y. &amp; Coll. (Exch.) 216; Manderville v. Riggs, 2 Peters, 483; Barb. on Parties, 501.</p> <p id=\"b415-4\" pgmap=\"415\">The cases in this State recognize this general rule. Whitney v. Mayo, 15 Ill. 255.</p> <p id=\"b415-5\" pgmap=\"415\">The allegations of the bill bring this case within the letter and spirit of the rule, and we must therefore hold that the complainants may maintain the bill without making the other members of the association parties complainant or defendant.</p> <p id=\"b415-6\" pgmap=\"415\">So much of the decree of the court below as overruled the demurrer of William O. Niehoff and decreed the payment of the money found due from him, will be affirmed, and so much of the decree as sustained the demurrers of Conrad L. Niehoff and Jacob Becker and dismissed the bill as to them, will be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to overrule the demurrers of the\" said last named defendants and require them to answer the bill.</p> <p id=\"b415-7\" pgmap=\"415\">Affirmed in part and reversed m part, and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
