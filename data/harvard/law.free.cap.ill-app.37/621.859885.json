Henry M. Shepard, Judge, presiding.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-9\" pgmap=\"620\">Mr. E. A. Sherburne, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-10\" pgmap=\"620\">Frink never made any contract to give complainant a note bearing eight per cent interest, payable annually, or any other time.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-11\" pgmap=\"620\">Mor does complainant show that he made any attempt whatever to see or know what the note he bought in fact provided, nor does he aver or pretend that Frink or any one in his interest made any representation as to what the note contained. He simply went in voluntarily, blindfolded, and bought the note. Under such circumstances a court of equity will not lend its aid to save a man from the results of his own negligence. 1st Story\u2019s Equity Juris., 10th Ed., Sec. 146, and note 1.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-12\" pgmap=\"620\">Suppose it were admitted that Frink \u201cintended to give\u2019\u2019 and said \u201ccompany to receive\u201d a note, \u201cbearing interest at eight per cent, payable annually,\u201d and that \u201cby mistake\u201d Frink made a different note, \u201c each being equally innocent, and there being no concealment of facts which the other party has a right to know, and no surprise or imposition exists, the mistake or ignorance, whether mutual or unilateral, is treated as no foundation for equitable interference. It is strictly damnum absque injuria.\u201d Botsford v. Wilson, 75 Ill. 132; 1st Story\u2019s Eq. Juris., Sees. 150, 151.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-13\" pgmap=\"620\">There is no evidence on which to support the decree, nor are the facts specifically found in the decree. In such cases the decree can not stand. Marvin v. Collins, 98 Ill. 510 (516-17).</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-3\" pgmap=\"621\">The court erred in decreeing that appellant pay solicitor\u2019s fees, etc. The trust deed, set out in the bill, authorized the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in case a bill was filed \u201c by the trustee, in his own name or otherwise, to obtain a decree of sale of the premises conveyed in the trust deed.\u201d This bill is not filed by the trustee, but by the cestui que trust; hence the agreement to pay attorney\u2019s fees does not apply in favor of the complainant. Fayette v. Free Home Association, 27 Ill. App. 308; Cheltenham Imp. Co. v. Whitehead, 128 Ill. 279.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-4\" pgmap=\"621(333) 622(70)\">And if the court please, it is respectfully contended that the same principle applies to another feature of this case. The bill alleges that it is provided by the said trust deed, that if default should be made in the payment of said note, or interest, in the manner in said deed specified, or in case of the breach of any of the covenants therein contained, etc., then, in such case, \u201con the application of the legal holder of said note, it should be lawful for the said grantee to * * * file a bill or bills in any court,\u201d Obtain a decree, etc. This bill is not filed by the \u201csaid grantee,\u201d but by the cestui que trust/ nor does it appear that the latter applied to the said grantee, either to file a bill or allow him to use the name of said grantee in filing one. This court said in the opinion first above cited, that \u201cstipulations in trust deeds or mortgages to pay attorneys\u2019 fees are always strictly construed, and are never enforced, except under the terms of the agreement they are clearly provided for.\u201d How the same reasoning applies to the filing of a bill under the provision in a trust deed or mortgage, and the court will please bear in mind that complainant has not placed his right to file a bill on any ground except that provided by the conditions of the trust deed; not on the ordinary equities of the holder of a security; and so he is here seeking to get a decree of sale on a note not due when his suit was begun. The note would be due in August, 1888, and complainant filed his bill on the 23d of February, 1887, a year and a half before it became due, and he relies on the conditions of the trust deed to make said note due when he files the bill, and upon the same foundation to support his right to file the bill, and it is respectfully contended that the conditions are not sufficient to support either claim. Equity never enforces a forfeiture unless compelled by the very terms of the instrument to do so, and a party must stand or fall by the case made in his bill. It is therefore respectfully submitted that in no view of the case can this decree be sustained.</p><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">Messrs. M. Blanchard and Robert S. Hill, for appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\">It will be seen that Brink now seeks under his first point\u2014 want of equity\u2014to raise the same question raised by and determined against him on his demurrer to the amended bill, which resolves itself into this, viz.: Whether the assignee of a note secured by a trust deed can maintain a bill to foreclose after condition broken.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-8\" pgmap=\"622\">To this it might be replied, that after answer filed it is too late to raise this question. Brill v. Stiles, 35 Ill. 306.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-9\" pgmap=\"622\">But the point was not well taken even on demurrer, because the assignee of a note, acquiring it before maturity, is clothed with all the rights, certainly, of the payee. Silverman v. Bullock, 98 Ill. 11.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-10\" pgmap=\"622\">And the purchase of the note while in escrow, without any of the parties to the note being aware of the mistake, does not change the rule. The purchaser of the note can have his bill to foreclose if the payee could, had the note never been transferred.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-11\" pgmap=\"622\">As to the second point\u2014want of evidence\u2014we reply:</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-12\" pgmap=\"622\">That the decree find's that the court had jurisdiction, that the equities were with the complainant, and that all the material allegations of the amended bill are true as therein stated. Moreover, the answer admits the execution of the note and deed and their transfer.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-13\" pgmap=\"622\">The decree specifically finds the amount due on the note together with the only other material facts not admitted, viz., that Frink intended to give, and the appellee and his assignors intended to receive, a note bearing interest from its date, and that a mistake occurred in drawing the note. Under our practice this is sufficient. Binkert v. Wab. R. R. Co., 98 Ill. 205; Morgan v. Corlies, 81 Ill. 72.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-3\" pgmap=\"623\">\u201cWhere the material allegations in a bill in chancery are admitted in the answer of the defendant and the court decrees accordingly, the case will not be reversed.\u201d Padfield v. Padfield, 64 Ill. 166; Bree v. Bree, 51 Ill. 367; Chickering v. Fullerton, 90 Ill. 521.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-4\" pgmap=\"623\">So, \u201cwhen a decree in chancery recites that the case was heard on proofs, and then finds the facts charged in the bill to be true, it will be inferred the facts were found upon the testimony. Such a decree will be sustained though it does not purport to set out the testimony, and it is not otherwise preserved in the record.\u201d Mauck v. Mauck, 54 Ill. 281; Secrist v. Petty, 109 Ill. 188.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\" pgmap=\"623\">\u201c Where a decree is justified by the pleadings and the facts recited in the decr'ee, it is the duty of the defendant to preserve the whole evidence in the record, by a bill of exceptions or certificate, if he questions its sufficiency, etc.\u201d Morgan v. Corlies, 81 Ill. 72.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-6\" pgmap=\"623\">\u201c When the record of a chancery suit shows that oral evidence was heard on the hearing and the finding of facts by the court is sufficient to support the decree, it will not be reversed.\u201d Rhoades v. Rhoades, 88 Ill, 139.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-7\" pgmap=\"623\">\u201cProof is not necessary as to any facts alleged in the bill which are admitted in the answer.\u201d Fergus v. Tinkham, 38 Ill. 407.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-8\" pgmap=\"623\">\u201c In the absence of a bill of exceptions or certificate of evidence, it will be presumed that the findings were warranted by the proofs heard by the court. In the absence of a certificate preserving all the evidence heard by the trial court, it must be presumed that there was sufficient evidence to warrant and sustain the findings.\u201d Brown v. Miner, 128 Ill. 156, and cases cited.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-9\" pgmap=\"623\">The case of Marvin v. Collins, 98 Ill. 510, is not in point. There the bill contained \u201c no allegation in reference to Marvin\u2019s tax title. In fact, the first time it appears in the record is in the decree holding it invalid. In this there was error.\u201d For that reason, and because the evidence preserved did not show that Marvin did not acquire a good title under an execution sale, the decree was Reversed.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\">It is contended, finally, that the trust deed authorizes the payment of solicitors\u2019 fees only when the bill is filed in the name of the trustee.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-6\" pgmap=\"624\">In Cheltenham Imp. Co. v. Whitehead, 128 Ill. 279, the court say (page 286): \u201cWe do not assent to this construction of the language used in the trust deed. The object in providing for attorneys\u2019 fees in the trust deed was, in the event that the mortgagor should fail to pay the debt, and the holder of the indebtedness should be compelled to foreclose the trust deed in order to collect the debt, then solicitors\u2019 fees should be allowed. What difference could it make with the mortgagor whether the bill was filed in the name of the trustee or in the name of the holder of the indebtedness? We do not see that the liability of the mortgagor could in any manner be changed, whether the bill was brought in one name or in the other. Moreover, the language of the deed of trust, giving it a fair construction, will not admit the meaning attempted to be placed upon it. \u201c The solicitors\u2019 fees are payable upon the filing of a bill in the name of the trustee, or otherwise,\u201d the same language as in the trust deed in question. The court further says: \u201c Some meaning must be given to the word \u2018 otherwise.\u2019 It can not be arbitrarily rejected, and we are of the opinion that a fair and reasonable construction of the contract will fully authorize the allowance of solicitors\u2019 fees, whether the bill was filed in the name of the trustee or some other person.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-8\" pgmap=\"624\">That the holder of the mortgage indebtedness may file a bill in his own name to foreclose a trust deed is well settled. Hahn v. Huber, 83 Ill. 243; Barker v. International Bank, 80 Ill. 96; Winkelman v. Kiser, 27 Ill. 21; Elder v. Jones, 85 Ill. 384.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-9\" pgmap=\"624\">But it is too late now to raise an objection for the first time as to parties. Conwell v. Watkins, 71 Ill. 488.</p> <opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b624-10\" pgmap=\"624\">Gary, J.</author> <p id=\"AIW\" pgmap=\"624(43) 625(51)\">August 1,1885, the appellant, being indebted to the Lindsley Portable House Company in a large sum, agreed for a part of it to give his note for $1,000, payable in three years, with interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum, payable annually. In execution of that agreement he made the note payable to his own order and by him endorsed, and a deed of trust in the nature of a mortgage, to secure the payment of the note, and deposited both with the trustee in escrow upon terms not shown.</p> <p id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">The company sold the securities, the appellee bought them from their vendee, and by the concurrence of everybody having any interest, they were delivered by the trustee to the appellee. Then it was for the first time discovered, that while the deed of trust recited a note bearing interest as agreed, the note itself, by mistake, was written with interest after maturity.</p> <p id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">The record contains no evidence of any of these matters extrinsic to the note and deed of trust, but the bill avers them, and the decree recites that \u201c the cause having come on to be heard upon the bill of complaint as amended herein, the answer of the defendant, Henry F. Frink, thereto, the replication of the complainant to said answer, and the proofs taken in said cause \u201d finds, \u201c that all the material allegations in the said bill as amended are true as therein stated.\u201d What the proofs were the record does not show.</p> <p id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">This recital supplies the place of\u2014perhaps is better for the appellee than\u2014the proofs. It imposes upon the appellant the burden of preserving the evidence, if he would question its sufficiency to sustain the findings.</p> <p id=\"b625-7\" pgmap=\"625\">The practice has been uniform ever since the statute of 1849 by which, in chancery, evidence orally was first permitted. White v. Morrison, 11 Ill. 361; Cooley v. Scarlett, 38 Ill. 316; Mauck v. Mauck, 54 Ill. 281; Secrist v. Petty, 109 Ill. 188. And the last two cases show that the finding in a general form, as above quoted, is enough. \u25a0</p> <p id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625(78) 626(23)\">When the appellee, without notice of the mistake, bought the securities, he acquired all the equities of the original creditor. Union Oil Co. v. Maxwell, 33 Ill. App. 421; Whitney v. Roberts, 22 Ill. 381; Smith v. Wright, 49 Ill. 403. The deed of trust in this case, as in Cheltenham Co. v. Whitehead, 128 Ill. 279, provided that the trustee \u201c in his own name or otherwise \u201d might file a bill, and that case answers the objections made in this, to the bill being filed by the holder of the indebtedness and to the allowance of solicitors\u2019 fees.</p> <p id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">The deed- provided that the whole debt might be declared due for default in payment of interest. - The appellant refusing to correct the mistake, and not paying the interest, the decree of foreclosure, on a bill filed before the three years the note had to run were out, is right.</p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
