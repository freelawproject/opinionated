J.</author> <p id=\"AL\" pgmap=\"298\">The plaintiff in error was indicted and convicted, for voting at an election, without possessing the qualifications of a voter. The indictment was framed on the 20th sec. of the 37th chap, of the Revised Statutes, which reads thus: \u201cIf any person shall voto at any election, who is not a qualified voter, he shall forfeit and pay any sum not exceeding fifty dollars, nor less than twenty five, to be recovered in the same manner as other penalties under this chapter.\u201d Upon a careful consideration of this section in connection with the other provisions of the chapter, we are clearly satisfied, that the penalty is not recoverable by indictment. By a reference to the other parts of the chapter, the intention of the Legislature will be apparent. There are five provisions in this chapter, in which penalties are imposed for the violation of particular duties connected with elections, in each of which it is declared, that the party offending, \u201cshall forfeit and pay\u201d a specified sum, \u201cto be recovered by an action of debt.\u201d The chapter also defines five distinct offences, which are punishable by indictment. Of one, it is provided that the offender \u201cshall be fined, in the sum of one hundred dollars, to be recovered by indictment;\u201d of three, \u201che shall be liable to be indicted,\u201d and fined and imprisoned; and of the other, he \u201cshall be liable to indictment,\u201d and \u201cfined in any sum not exceeding one thousand dollars.\u201d The penalty in question falls directly within the first class of eases, and is recoverable in an action of debt, in the name of the People. The same language is employed in imposing this penalty, as in those for the recovery of which the action of debt is specifically given; and the direction as to the mode of recovering it, must be understood as \u25a0referring to the remedy prescribed in these cases.</p> <p id=\"b298-8\" pgmap=\"298\">The judgment will be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b298-9\" pgmap=\"298\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
