The cause was there tried before Harlan, Judge, and a' jury, at March term, 1849, when a verdict was found and a judgment thereon entered for the defendants.\" The note sued on is set out in the opinion of the Court.\" The bill of exceptions taken in the' case, shows that the defendants resided together when the note'was given, that when the note became \"due they had over 400 bushels of corn- ready to measure, \"but no one came' to receive.it; that the'eorn was not measured out, but was in crib's' with other corn; that 'about a week before said note became dtie, Curry hauled one load of corn to the place where Crews, the payee of the .note, lived, which he refused to receive, and the corn was hatiled back by Curry. Plaintiff below told defendants, he would not \u25a0 receive said corn unless they would haul all the corn to the place where payee lived when note was given, which defendants- -refused to do. Plaintiff proved that he demanded the corn on the day the note became due,' that defendants offered to pay one half of corn at Crews\u2019 and one half at Owen\u2019s, which plaintiff refused; and demanded that it should all be paid at Crews\u2019: \" ' ' \u2019 \" - . \u2022</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\" pgmap=\"78\">The jury found a verdict for defendants; plaintiff moved for a new trial which was denied, and the plaintiff below brings the cause here for review, by writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-8\" pgmap=\"78\">E.

The place of tender was the debtor\u2019s residence or farm, inasmuch as the note was payable in farm produce. 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 508; Lobdell v. Hopkins, 5 Cowen, 516; Vance v.

A question of tender is a question of fact to be found by the jury, and unless clearly against evidence, their finding will not be disturbed; and if the jury had sufficient evidence before them, to satisfy them, that the defendants in error offered to deliver the corn as the plaintiff should direct, at their farm, the verdict was right and should not have been set aside.

The case has been twice tried by juries, once by a justice, and reviewed and adjudged in effect by the Circuit Court, and the result has always been against plaintiff in error, and this Court will not disturb the judgment, inasmuch as the burden of proof was on said plaintiff, Cunningham v.

S. declares, that instruments of writing \u201cfor1 the payment or delivery of personal property, other than money,\u201d when no place is specified for the payment or delivery of such property, may be discharged by a tender of the property, at the-place of residence of the payee;' at the time the instrument of writing was ex\u00e9ctited: Provided,'how\u00e9v\u00e9r, that' if the personal property be too ponderous to b'\u00e9\u2019reiaov\u00e9d, or the payee had not a known place of residence i\u00f1 th\u00e9'c\u00f3uniy at \"the time the contract Was executed;-then 'the property may be'te'hdered, at the place where 'the maker r\u00e9side'd wh\u00e9tt the contract' was entered-into. : '\u2022 1 \" ...... ' .</p> <p id=\"b80-7\" pgmap=\"80\">The-note in question is not, however, within the statute. It is not a n\u00f3te for -the payment of personal property other''than money, but a note for the payment of-money, with a privilege to th\u00e9\u2019makers to discharge it in corn at a certain price; ' : '.....</p> <p id=\"b80-9\" pgmap=\"80\">The right to have -the note paid' in-m\u00f3ney \u00f3r com, was not left; to the payee, but-'the makers reserved thatpnv'ile'ge' to themselves;. !\u25a0 ' '\u2022' - \"\u25a0 '\u2022 \u2022\" \" \" ''</p> <p id=\"b80-10\" pgmap=\"80\">Haduorn at the time the note fell due, been worth fifty cents to the bushel,-the payee -could': not have compelled it's delivery', while he- would have-'been compelled to 'take it; if tendered,1 though its value should'fall-'to'ten''cents.' \u2019</p> <p id=\"b80-11\" pgmap=\"80\">The note was payable at a particular time, and in such case no demand is necessary to 'entitle a party to sue. Th\u00e9 makers, to have discharged them'selves by the' payment of the money, would have had to seek1 the payee, or assignee ih this' instance, ' at his place of residence; -andthereis\u00fao -reason, Why tliey' should' \u201d be allowed to \"discharge'-themselves by \"' a'1 tender of the corn, which was a'privilege inserted'in th\u00e9 not'e-wholly for their ben-, efit, by atender at a .different' place, from the '\u00f3\u00f1\u00e9 where they. would have been compelled to tender the money\", had'the'note remainedintheRands of th\u00e9:pay\u00e9e; - -'v \u25a0 \u2022 \" *'</p> <p id=\"b80-12\" pgmap=\"80(22) 81(18)\">This note- isnot -like the'-oaSe; of-a contract payable in.trad\u00e9 generally, - without time or place, where it w\u00e1s held that '\u00e1 spe-' dial demand was necessary, and the property deliverable at the residence of the debtor. Woods v Dial\u2014post 72.</p> <p id=\"b81-5\" pgmap=\"81\">The general rule. is, that the person to he discharged from liability upon a .contract by the performance of a certain act, is impliedly bound to do the act which is to exonerate him. Chitty on Contracts, 727,</p> <p id=\"b81-6\" pgmap=\"81\">It was held in the case of Goodwin v Holbrook, 4 Wend. 377, that the place of payment, of a note payable in salt, was the residence of the creditor, when the-time of payment was fixed by the contract, but the place was not designated. That case is analagous to the present. To have discharged the note, the defendants should have tendered the corn at the time the note fell due, at the place where the payee resided when it was given, and as the record shews that no such tender was made, the verdict of the jury was wrong.</p> <p id=\"b81-7\" pgmap=\"81\">Judgment reversed -and cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b81-8\" pgmap=\"81\">\u25a0Judgment reversed.,</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
