From his decision, an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Jo Davies, and came on for trial, without the intervention of-a jury, before Sheldon, Judge, at the March term, 1850, of said Court. An issue was found for appellant, and a judgment was rendered against Foster, for the sum of thirty-three dollars, and seventy-three cents. A motion for a new trial was overruled.</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\" pgmap=\"368\">The bill of exceptions shows a note executed by Foster to Gilpatrick, as follows: \u201c one day after date I promise to pay John F. Gilpatrick or bearer, ninety-seven dollars and T\\\\, for value received,\u201d dated 3d January, 1848, which was the only evidence offered by the plaintiff. The defendant insisted upon the allowance of certain sums endorsed upon the note as credits \u2022, which endorsements are as follows :</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\" pgmap=\"368\">\u201cMay 17, 1848..

All the endorsements were read by the defendant, which was all the testimony offered. The error assigned was the allowance of a credit of fifty dollars by the Circuit Court upon the strength of the endorsement made on 4th August, 1848.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-10\" pgmap=\"368\">Higgins &amp; Strother, for Pltff in Error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-11\" pgmap=\"368\">The note constituted a good cause of action for the amount.

The only question in the case arises out of an endorsement on the back of the note which is as follows: \u201cAugust the 4th, 1848. Received on the within, 50\u201d There is no dot or mark of any kind either before or after the \u201c50\u201d to determine whether it means fifty dollars, fifty cents, or fifty something else.</p> <p id=\"b369-4\" pgmap=\"369\">There were some other credits upon the note, but not in any manner connected with the one in question, so as to afford the least clue to its meaning. The only evidence in the case was the note with its endorsements, and the Circuit Court held the endorsement in question to mean a credit of fifty dollars, which still left a balance due the plaintiff, after deducting the other credits about which there was no controversy. Nothing can be more uncertain than a credit of \u201c50\u201d on the back of a note. It may mean fifty pounds, fifty bushels, or fifty anything else, though it was most probably intended for fifty dollars or fifty cents, but which, if either, we cannot tell, and because it is wholly uncertain, the credit, unless explained, must be rejected as a nullity. \u201c If an agreement be so vague and indefinite, that it is not possible to collect the full intention of the parties, it is void; for neither the court nor jury can make an agreement for the parties.\u201d Chitty on Contracts, 73; Wainwright v. Straw, 15 Vt., 219.</p> <p id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">An endorsement of a credit upon the back of a note, is no part of the note itself. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, was made out by the production of the note, and though the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the credits endorsed upon it, if intelligible, yet it was no part of the plaintiff\u2019s case to explain them for the benefit of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b369-6\" pgmap=\"369\">The endorsement of the credit upon the note being in the nature of a receipt for money, is subject to explanation by parol, and if the defendant can explain what it means, he will be entitled to the benefit of it, otherwise, it must be rejected as a nullity.</p> <p id=\"b369-7\" pgmap=\"369\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b369-8\" pgmap=\"369\">Judgment reversed,.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
