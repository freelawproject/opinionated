But this rule does not apply to grants of land from the government.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\" pgmap=\"394\">McGhee sued Wilcoxon in the Stephenson Circuit Court, in an action on the case. The declaration contained three counts. The first count charged the defendant with having maintained, kept up and continued a mill dam across Eichland Creek since the first day of October, A. D. 1846, causing the water to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land, describing it. The second count charged the defendant with having obstructed the water of Eichland Creek, causing it to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land. The third count charged the defendant with having erected a mill dam on his own land across said creek on the 1st day of October, A. D, 1846, and with having continued it, thereby obstructing the natural course of the water of said creek, causing it to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\" pgmap=\"394\">To this declaration the defendant filed the general issue, and three special pleas. The first special plea, avers a purchase from the U. S. on the tenth day of July, A. D. 1844, of the land upon which the mill and dam are situated. That the dam and mill were erected before his purchase, and that the plaintiff purchased his land subsequently, and that the land purchased by the plaintiff as well as that purchased by the defendant, was overflowed at the time of the purchase.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\" pgmap=\"394\">The second special plea avers that on, and for a long time previous to the tenth day of July, 1844, there was and had been erected ,on the land of the defendant, a saw mill, and a mill dam across the said creek, which caused the .water of said creek to flow the land of the defendant and also the land of the- plaintiff, and that the water raised by the dam was used to carry the said saw mill; that on the 10th day of July, A. D. 1844, the defendant purchased of the U. S. the tract of land on which the rnill and dam stood, with all the rights, privileges, immunities, and appurtenances thereto belonging; that at the time he purchased the land, the U. S. owned the land of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff purchased of the IT. S. with notice of the above facts, and subsequent to the purchase of the defendant.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\" pgmap=\"394(11) 395(41)\">The third plea is substantially the same as the second, with the additional averment that the mill and dam had been lawfully erected, &amp;c., and also averring that the tracts of land covered by the mill pond had been surveyed and platted by the U. S. as a mill pond.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\" pgmap=\"395\">A demurrer was hied by the plaintiff to the special pleas of the defendant, which was sustained by the Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\" pgmap=\"395\">A trial was had upon the general issue, and a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $12 50. There was a motion for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment, which were denied. The cause was heard before Sheldon, Judge, and a jury, at November term, 1849.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\" pgmap=\"395\">The appellant assigns for error, the sustaining the demurrer of the appellee to the special pleas of the appellant, and in overruling the motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-8\" pgmap=\"395\">M.

If after the annexation of peculiar qualities, he alien one part of his heritage, it seems but reasonable, if alterations -thus made are palpable and manifest, that a purchaser should take the grant burthened or benefitted as the case may be, by the qualities which the previous owner had given to it. 8 Penn., 383,</p><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-8\" pgmap=\"396\">Thos.

Land is not appurtenant to land.</p> <opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b397-7\" pgmap=\"397\">Trumbull, J.</author> <p id=\"A52x\" pgmap=\"397\">This case presents the single question, of\u201d the right of a purchaser of a tract of public land, having upon it,, at the time of the purchase, a mill and dam, which cause the water of a stream running through it to flow back upon other-public lands, to continue the dam so as to overflow such other \u25a0 lands after they have been entered by individuals.</p> <p id=\"b397-8\" pgmap=\"397\">It does not appear from the record, that the person entering the land upon which the mill stood, paid anything additional on account of the mill, or for the privilege of flooding other lands;. but he made the entry and received a patent in the usual form..</p> <p id=\"b397-9\" pgmap=\"397(54) 398(59)\">The manner in which the public lands are disposed of, the character of the parties to the grant, and its subject matter, are all circumstances proper for consideration in arriving at the intention of the parties; and when we look to these circumstan.ces, there can be little difficulty in determining what rights -are acquired by a patentee of public land, especially when it is recollected that grants by the government are construed favorably for the grantor, and pass nothing by implication. , 2 Bl. Com., 347; 5 Cruise\u2019s Digest, Tit. King's grant, \u00a725 et sequeter; United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters, 738; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Peters, 545.</p> <p id=\"b398-5\" pgmap=\"398\">Although the general government in its liberality permits a person to enter upon and subsequently to purchase a tract of public land at the minimum price, yet- it could never have been its intentioq in granting this favor, to bestow also upon the settler, the privilege perpetually to inundate and render valueless, other tracts of public land, by damming up a stream running through the one which he might eventually purchase. The purchaser under such circumstances, pays nothing for the privilege of overflowing other lands, it is not a right necessarily or naturally appertaining to the land he purchases, and could never be presumed to have entered into the contemplation \u2018 of the government, in making the grant.</p> <p id=\"b398-6\" pgmap=\"398\">The subject matter of the grant, is the land, having a fixed .and definite description, and nothing passes as parcel of the .granted premises, but what is included within the boundaries expressed in the patent, or is naturally or necessarily annexed to the land.

Smith, 6 Conn., 289.</p> <p id=\"b398-7\" pgmap=\"398\">Regularly \u201cnothing can be appendant or appurtenant, unless it agree in nature and quality with the thing whereunto it is appendant or appurtenant.\u201d Bac. Ab., Tit. Grants, I, 4. The right to overflow adjoining lands, is not an appurtenance agreeing in nature or quality with land itself, and though perhaps a \u25a0.convenience, is not absolutely necessary, to the enjoyment of the land; but such an easement more properly appertains to something that has been put upon the land, as in this instance, to the mill.</p> <p id=\"b398-8\" pgmap=\"398(83) 399(14)\">In the case of the conveyance of a mill and its appurtenances, and where the subject matter of the conveyance and principal thing granted is the mill, the right to continue to overflow the lands of the grantor, to the same extent as when the grant was made, would pass with the mill, as necessary to its use and enjoyment; but here, the subject matter of the grant was the land, and the right to overflow adjoining lands belonging to the government, was not an appurtenance annexed to it by any natural or legal necessity.</p> <p id=\"b399-5\" pgmap=\"399\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b399-6\" pgmap=\"399\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
