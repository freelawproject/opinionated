At the March term, 1849, T. L. Dickey, Judge, presiding, Hoes, on behalf of himself and others, filed an affidavit, stating that a public road, leading from the town of Ottawa, in said county of La Salle, leading across the canal, had been laid out and established by'the County Commissioners, in March, 1835, which road\" was intersected by the canal, and had been used as a public highway since 1835, until it was obstructed by the opening of the canal in 1848. That a certain State road, authorised by an act of the Legislature of 1845, was laid out in that year, which was also obstructed by the canal at the same point. Also, that another road leading from Ottawa, which had been used and traveled since 1832, was also obstructed by the opening of the canal; all these roads were on section 10, T. 33 N., E. 3 east of 3d P. M. That an application had been made to the Canal Trustees, to remove the obstruction by the erection of a suitable bridge, which the trustees had neglected and refused to build. This affidavit was accompanied by exhibits, showing the laying out of said roads by the proper authorities. The Circuit Court thereupon directed that an alternative writ of mandamus should issue to the Canal Trustees, commanding them to construct a bridge, or show cause to the contrary, at the next term of the court.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\" pgmap=\"261\">A writ was issued in the form as set out in the opinion of the court, on the seventh of May, 1849, which was served on the trustees, by copy.

Mandamus is proper where the law has established no specific remedy, and where in justice and good government there ought to be one. Bacon\u2019s Ab., 418 ; 1 Cowen, 423. The highway is a public easement, the legal right vesting in the people, and any one may enforce and obtain a mandamus in such a matter. People ex rel. Case et al. v. Collins. 19 Wend., 64. In the case at bar, mandamus is the proper and appropriate remedy. 19 Wend., 56. The Canal Trustees had no right in cutting their canal across this highway, utterly to destroy it; and are bound to unite, for the public accommodation, the highway thereby divided, by a reasonably convenient thoroughfare over or under their canal. Leopold v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal Co. 1 Gill, 222. The case of Leopold v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal Company, 1 Gill, 229, was decided upon the Charter granted by State of Maryland, in 1823. See Laws Maryland, 1823, p. 85. This law contains no provision requiring Company to build Bridges.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\" pgmap=\"264\">The road laws of this State in force at the time of authorizing the construction of this canal, and those passed since, point out the method of vacating roads, and prohibit the obstruction of those established by \u201c placing any obstruction therein,\u201d or \u201cdigging any ditch across the same.\u201d Laws, 1835, \u00a72, 8. This is in reply to the reference on the other side. To the laws authorizing the Companies to take \u201clands, &amp;c.\u201d The ditch is as good as those laws.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\" pgmap=\"264\">The Legislature did not intend, in authorizing the construction and its numerous feeders, to repeal the Road Laws, or authorize the entire destruction of the numerous highways which must necessarily be crossed by them or they would have provided some remedy. Nor could they have intended to have imposed the heavy burthen of uniting the several highways thus divided, upon the people of the counties or districts in which they may chance to be. Th,e most the Legislature could have intended was to so far modify the Road Laws as to authorize the canal to intersect the roads; the public to be accommodated by a passage way over or under the canal to be provided by the canal authorities.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">That the Canal Trustees understood the law as requiring the erection of bridges by them, is a matter of public notoriety deemed proper to be referred to in presenting the case to the court. They have constructed bridges at nearly every point where the canal or its feeders intersect a highway, and are now maintaining them at the cost of the canal fund. Will the court discharge them from either building others where they have refused or neglected to build them, and where highways have been regularly established, and where the public accommodation requires them.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265\">The writ in this case is not substantially defective. The case referred to on the other side, (10 Wend., 25,) does not sustain the position that it is assumed to. The writ in this case contains all that is material. The command to do the particular thing required to be done, and the reason why \u201c the canal at that point obstructing the public highway,\" no reference to affidavits on file to help it out as in the case referred to. But admitting the writ to be defective, as is alleged. The parties have appeared, if that is necessary, it does not appear to be, and the peremptory writ has been awarded, and it is therefore now too late to take exception to the writ. 10 Wend., 25.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\" pgmap=\"265\">The only question now for the court to determine is, whether there was sufficient appearing upon the record, (10 Wend., 33,) to authorize the court to award the peremptory writ.</p> <opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b265-7\" pgmap=\"265\">Treat, C. J.</author> <p id=\"ARM\" pgmap=\"265(177) 266(61)\">This was a proceeding by mandamus to compel the trustees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, to erect a bridge over the canal in La Salle county. Upon a petition and accompanying papers, the Circuit Court directed an alternative mandamus to issue. The writ, after reciting the term of the Court and the names of the parties, proceeded to state, that the Court \u201cdid order that an alternative mandamus issue out of said Court, directed to and commanding the said trustees, that immediately upon the receipt of said writ, they cause a bridge of suitable dimensions to be built over the Illinois and Michigan Canal, at the centre east and west of section ten, township thirty-three north, of range three east of the third principal meridian, in said county, the said canal at that point obstructing a public highway; or that they show cause to the contrary, before our said Circuit Court. Mow, therefore, we, being willing that full and speedy justice be done in this behalf, as it is just, command you, the said Trustees, that immediately after the receipt of this writ, you cause the said bridge to be built, or that you show cause to the contrary,\u201d &amp;c. The writ was served on the Trustees, but they failed to make any return thereto, and the Court awarded a peremptory mandamus. The Trustees sued out a writ of error from this Court.</p> <p id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266\">It is insisted, that the alternative mandamus is too defective to sustain the judgment. An alternative mandamus becomes the foundation of all the subsequent proceedings in the case. It answers the same purpose as the declaration in ordinary actions. It must show on its face a clear right to the relief demanded by the relator. He must distinctly set forth all the material facts on which he relies, so that the same may be admitted or traversed. The defendant is called upon to perform the particular act sought to be enforced, or, by a return, deny the facts alleged in the writ, or state other matters sufficient to defeat the relator\u2019s application. He is not required to answer the petition on which the writ is ordered. This is the well established practice in the proceeding by mandamus. The King v. The Bishop of Oxford, 7 East, 345; The King v. The Margate Pier Company, 3 Barnewell &amp; Alderson, 220; Clarke v. The Company of Proprietors, 6 Adolplus &amp; Ellis, N. S., 898; The Commercial Bank v. The Canal Commissioners, 10 Wendell, 26; The State v. Jones, 1 Iredell, 129; Hoxie v. The County Commissioners, 25 Maine, 333; The People v. Ransom, 2 Comstock, 490.</p> <p id=\"b266-6\" pgmap=\"266\">In this case, the alternative mandamus is fatally defective. It does not set forth the facts on which the relators rely. It does not apprise the defendants of the grounds upon which the remedy is sought. They are not permitted to traverse a certain state of facts, or admit the same to be true, and set up new matter in avoidance. The writ simply commands them to perform a particular act, or furnish an excuse for not doing it. It is not sufficient to uphold the proceedings. The judgment has no basis on which to stand.</p> <p id=\"b266-7\" pgmap=\"266(69) 267(161)\">The usual mode of taking advantage of a defective alternative mandamus, is by motion to quash. And that may be the only mode of reaching mere formal defects. But objections to substantial defects may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. This is like the case of a writ of error brought to reverse a judgment entered on a declaration showing no cause of action; or of a conviction on an indictment that does not charge the commission of an offence. The proceedings fall for the want of a proper foundation to sustain them. The following cases are in point, if authorities are needed in support of so plain a proposition. In the case of The King v. Overseers of Mallett, 5 Modern, 421, the writ was held ill after return made. In The King v. The Margate Pier Company, supra, the defendants were allowed to take advantage of a material defect in the writ, after their return was made. In Clarke v. The Company of Proprietors, supra, it was held by the Court of Exchequer, that, on demurrer to a traverse of the return to an alternative mandamus, the defendant might impeach the validity of the writ. In the case of The Commercial Bank v. The Canal Commissioners, supra, a demurrer to the return was carried back and sustained to the writ.</p> <p id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">It is not necessary to express an opinion on the question, whether the Trustees are bound to construct and maintain bridges across the canal.</p> <p id=\"b267-6\" pgmap=\"267\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs, against the relators.</p> <p id=\"b267-7\" pgmap=\"267\">Judgment reversed,.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
