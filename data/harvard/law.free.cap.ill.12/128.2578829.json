W. Babb, and this appellant and others, in the Cass Circuit Court, to foreclose a mortgage, given by Babb to one John T. Jones who was school commissioner of Morgan county. Said mortgage is set out in this record and is upon a tract of land in T. 15 FT., E. 12 W.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-16\" pgmap=\"140\">The appellant was made a party to this suit, and it was charged that Babb, subsequently to the giving of the mortgage to Jones, had given a mortgage to appellant upon the same-land.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\" pgmap=\"141\">Appellant filed Ms answer to said Mil and alleged, that he had a mortgage given by Babb and set it out, showing that the land named in his mortgage was in T. 18 1ST., R. 12 W.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\" pgmap=\"141\">The hill filed by Saunders set out the same land described in McConnel\u2019s mortgage, and a decree was subsequently rendered in the case to sell the land described in McConnel\u2019s mortgage to pay the debt due to Jones, and no notice was taken of the fact that the land mortgaged to Jones was a different tract of land, and did not appear from Jones\u2019 mortgage to be situated in Cass county. A final decree to sell said land was made at the May term of the Cass Circuit Court in 1841, and one Edward Tull was appointed Master in Chancery to sell said land. At the October term, 1841, Tull reported that he had sold the land to one Lippincott for $950 00, and paid Jones\u2019 debt and costs with the money, hut had not made a deed to the purchaser. At the May term, 1848, one Atwater was appointed to complete said sale by making a deed to Lippincott At the May term, 1845, of said Court, Atwater reported that he had completed.said sale by the making of a deed, which report was approved -by the Court, and thus on the 19th of May, at said May term, the decree of sale was finally carried into effect, and the suit was ended. On the 7th of March, 1849, McConnel and Babb, .two of the original defendants in said cause, filed this bill, called by them a \u201cpetition,\u201d in the Cass Circuit Court, praying that .the orders of the Court, approving the making of the sale and of the deed be reviewed, and that they be set aside, for the following causes: 1st. Said petitioners, long after the 19th of May, 1845, and not before, ascertained that said Tull, who had been appointed by the Court to sell said land, had fraudulently and falsely reported to the Court, that he had advertised said land in the nearest newspaper, andhad sold it to Lippincott on the 27th of September, 1841, as the highest bidder, when in fact Tull was himself secretly the purchaser, and knocked it down to Lippincott fraudulently, and that the land was advertised in a paper out of the county 55 miles distant, when there was a nearer paper 25 miles distant ; and that no money was paid for the laud. 2'd, The laud was sacrificed at the sale by Tull, which was made at a different time and place than that specified in the notice of sala That these facts were unknown at the time and have been recently discovered.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\" pgmap=\"142\">The defendants severed in their defence, some of whom demurred, one moved to dismiss, and another pleaded, that more than five years had elapsed between the final decree, and the filing of the petition. The Circuit Court, Woodson, Judge, presiding, at March term, 1850, dismissed the hill.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142\">M.

Thomas, for Appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b142-10\" pgmap=\"142\">Caton, J.</author> <p id=\"AUu\" pgmap=\"142(80) 143(48)\">We must look at the substance of this bill, and the grounds of equity set up in it, to determine its true character. It commences in the form of a petition, but subsequently assumes the form and substance of an original bill or of a bill of review, and is by the pleader sometimes called one thing, and sometimes another; but we must look at the material averments of the bill and from them determine its true character. Although the pleader may have given it a wrong name, still if the averments show that the complainant is entitled to relief, and the prayer will admit of our granting that which he shows himself entitled to claim, he ought not to be turned out of Court unheard.</p> <p id=\"b143-5\" pgmap=\"143\">Although many of the supposed irregularities in the sale and report may be quite unimportant, so far as the validity of the sale is concerned, y et some of the facts stated in the bill are of a more serious character, and if true, must vitiate the sale and consequently the order of the Court confirming the report of that sale. The bill states substantially that Tull, the commissioner, was in fact the purchaser at his own sale. That although Lippincott was the ostensible purchaser, in fact he purchased not for his own benefit, but for that of Tull. This, if true, was a fraud in law, and will avoid the sale, at the instance of the party whose property was sold or of one holding under him, if their remedy is sought within a reasonable time after the fraud is discovered. The law will not allow a man, who acts in a fiduciary capacity, to be both buyer and seller at the same time. It is true that such a sale is not absolutely void, for it may be confirmed by the party whose interest is affected or title transferred by such sale; and this acquiescence may undoubtedly be presumed, by the absence of any complaint for an unreasonable length of time, after the mode of sale is known. The purchaser cannot avoid the sale, for he shall not be allowed to complain of his own fraud or misconduct. These principles are too familiar to require authority for their support.</p> <p id=\"b143-6\" pgmap=\"143\">There is a charge also, that the sale was fraudulently made on a day different from that stated in the notice, and different from the time stated in the report. If these things were done for a fraudulent purpose, then they would afford sufficient ground for setting aside the sale and vacating the order confirming the report.</p> <p id=\"b143-7\" pgmap=\"143(83) 144(179)\">The true, object of this bill, is to set aside the sale, and to review, reverse and vacate the order of the Court confirming the report of the sale, whereby the final sanction of the Court was given to the sale. This is asked upon the ground of fraud. The bill shows, that a fraud was practiced upon those interested in the mortgaged premises, and upon the Court, which, had it been known to the Court at the time, would have prevented that Court from making the order approving the report of the sale, and would have induced the Court to have set it aside. This bill comes precisely within the definition of an original bill in the nature of a bill of review, as laid down by this Court in the case of Gregg et al., v. Gear, 3 Gilman, 2; and in Story\u2019s Eq. P., \u00a7 426. The bill was filed in a reasonable time after the fraud was discovered. It was therefore not obnoxious to the demurrer. - The same relief substantially might, and undoubtedly would have been, obtained by a purely original bill, setting forth the fraud, and seeking to set aside the sale alone, without asking to have the final order of the Court approving of the report and confirming the sale to be reviewed and reversed; for a decree setting aside the sale, would necessarily have destroyed the effect of that final order. The difference between such a bill and the one before us, is only nominal when founded upon such facts as are stated here.</p> <p id=\"b144-5\" pgmap=\"144\">The authorities above referred to, show that the leave of the Court was not necessary to file the bill. It should not therefore have been dismissed for that reason.</p> <p id=\"b144-6\" pgmap=\"144\">So of the objection as to parties. The bill shows that all who could have had any interest adverse to the relief sought, or indeed in the question at all, were brought in.</p> <p id=\"b144-7\" pgmap=\"144\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed with costs and the suit remanded with leave to the- defendants to answer to the merits of the bill.</p> <p id=\"b144-8\" pgmap=\"144\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
