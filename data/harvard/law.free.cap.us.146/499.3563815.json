Herron, </em>for defendant in error and appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-5\">In <em>United States Bung Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>34 Fed. Rep. 94, Judge Jackson says: \u201c It is well settled that the mere existence of cross-demands, or independent debts, does not \u2019 create any right to an- equitable set-off. \u2022 There must exist a mutual credit between the parties, founded at the time upon the existence of some debt due by the crediting party to the other: . . . Mutual credits such, as would give rise to an equitable set-off apply only to that class of cases where-there has been mutual trust or understanding that an existing-debt should be discharged by a credit given upon the ground of such debt.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-6\">In this case there was no knowledge on either side <em>\u201c </em>of an existing debt due to one, founded on and trusting to such debt as a means of discharging it.\u201d It is true that the deposit resulted from the discount of the note- in controversy; but that did not change the character of the deposit unless com nected with an agreement that it could be used as a set-off -to the note. The transaction negatives in the strongest manner any such knowledge or intention. The parties did not occupy the relation usual between, bankers and their depositors, where-one party deposits a sum in a bank, and borrows money from that bank, and when .this loan is due pays it- by checks on the money so deposited. The State Bank borrowed this money not to let it lie in the Fidelity Bank, but to be used by it in its own business. It paid a discount upon the entire amount, for the entire time the. note had to run. The note and .the deposit account were therefore wholly independent claims and were not the subject of set-off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-7\">The question principally relied on in\u2019 the present case is, whether the national banking act modifies in any respect, and if so how far, any right of set-off which might on principles of law or equity be applicable in the case, of other classes of insolvents?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>I do.not claim that no cross demand can in any case be allowed by the court in the case of the insolvency of national banks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-4\">In the case of a current account existing between a national bank and another, the balance of the account due at the tim\u00e9 <em>o\u00ed </em>the act of insolvency only can be collected. In such a c\u00e1se both sides of the account constitute but'one account, and the excess of the larger over the smaller side of that account is the sum actually due between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">Where the debtor bank has on the faith of its indebtedness accepted or agreed to accept a draft drawn on that indebtedness, so as to render it liable to the holder of that draft, it may deduct- the amount of that draft from the account; not entirely on the doctrine of set-off, but as a payment made on the account. The agreement to pay the draft out of that fund, is treated the same as if it had actually been paid. This was the case in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Seventh National Bank of Philadelphia, </em>38 Fed. Rep. 883.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">An agreement to sell bonds of the debtor, and to credit the proceeds on the note of that debtor held by the bank, will be enforced when the bank holding the paper has received and sold such bonds, and not made the credit. This was the case in <em>The Venango Bank </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>56 Penn. St. <em>14.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">In this case Justice Strong allowed the credit, not as a set-off but because there had been an understanding that .the proceeds of such sale should be applied on the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-8\">Where the note held by the insolvent bank is past due at the time of the insolvency, -and it-, at the same time, held a deposit account of the debtor on the note, also due, a set-off will probably be allowed. In such cases set-off legally applies, and the bank has the right to charge the past due paper to the account, and the debtor ought to have given his check for the amount due him to pay such note in whole or part: no injury in such a case is done to the general creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-9\">But where a national bank at the time of an act of insolvency, holds a discounted note not due, and the debtor has in the same bank a deposit account not placed there on account of, or to meet that note, which the bank cannot take or hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>for its debt, the national banking law, as I claim, prohibits the receiver from receiving the deposit\u2019 as payment in whole or in part of the note. He must hold the note in trust for the general creditors, including the debtor, to collect it and divide the proceeds ratably among them. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 5234, 5236, 5242; <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>21 Wall. 609, 613; <em>Pacific National Bank </em>v. Mixter, 121 U. S. 721, 725; <em>Venango Bank </em>v. Taylor, 56 Penn. St. 16; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Schuchmann, </em>32 Mo. App. 333; <em>Snyders' Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>37 Fed. Rep. 18 ; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>21 Weekly, Law Bull. 136; <em>Yardley </em>v. <em>Clothier, </em>19 Fed. Rep. 337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN9\">As to the equity suit, I have argued that there was no legal set-\u00f3ff in this case which a court of law could recognize. Will .a court of equity go further than the legal rights of- the parties authorizes a court of law to do? Equity favors an equal distribution of the assets'of an insolvent national 'bank: Equity grants the same relief to all creditors alike. So far as this deposit is concerned the State Bank stands no higher, has been no more defrauded or injured, than every other depositor has, and is entitled to no higher consideration. That bank should stand or fall upon its legal rights. Equity will not stretch its rules to protect it, to the loss of other creditors. The question here is solely between the general creditors <em>represented </em>by the receiver, and the State Bank. It should suffer equally with them. The national banking act recognizes in the strongest language the equity of this equality. This court has fully recognized the justice of that equality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">I submit that the law case, No. 55, should be affirmed by this court, and the questions submitted by the Circuit Court of Appeals answered in such a manner as will authorize the receiver to, enforce- the judgment rendered in the action at law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b528-7\">Mr'. Chief Justioe Fuller,</author>\n<p id=\"A2T\">after stating the case, delivered , the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The Fidelity National Bank was closed by order of the bank examiner.'June 20, the receiver was appointed June 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and the charter of the bank was forfeited and the bank dissolved by the decree of the Circuit Court, July 12,1887. Title to its assets was necessarily thereby transferred to the receiver. <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>21 Wall. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">. The note in controversy did not mature until September 7, 1887, but the deposit to the credit of the Farmers\u2019 Bank was due for the purposes of suit upon the closing of the Fidelity Bank, as under such circumstances no demand was necessary. The receiver took the assets of the Fidelity Bank as a mere trustee for creditors, and not for value and without notice, and, in the absence of statute to, the contrary, subject to all claims and defences that might ha re been interposed as against the insolvent corporation before the liens of the United States and of the general creditors attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The right to assert set-off at law is of statutory creation, but courts of equity from a very early day were accustomed to grant relief in. that regard independently as well as in aid of statutes upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In equity, relief was usually accorded, says Mr. Justice Story, (\u00c9q. J\u00far. \u00a7 11-35,) \u201cwhere, although there are mutual and independent debts, yet there is a mutual credit between the parties, founded, at the time, upon the existence of some debts due by the crediting party to the other. By mutual credit, in the sense in which the terms are here used, we are to understand,' a knowledge on both sides of an existing. debt due to one party, and a credit by-the other party, founded on, and trusting to such debt, as a means of discharging it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">This definition is hardly broad enough to cover all the cases where, as-the learned commentator concedes, there being a \u201c connection between the demands, equity acts upon it, and allows a . set-off under particular circumstances.\u201d \u00a7 1131. Courts of equity frequently deviate from the strict rule of mutuality when the justice of the particular case requires it, and the ordinary rule is that where the mutual obligations have grown out of the same transaction, insolvency on the one hand justifies the set-off of the debt due upon the other. <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Windley, </em>95 U. S. 173, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">In <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>129 U. S. 252, 262, it was decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that, w\u00fcen a life insurance company becomes insolvent and goes into liquidation, the amount due on an endowment policy, payable in any event at a fixed time, may, in settling the company\u2019s affairs, be set off against the amount due on a mortgage-deed from the holder of the-policy to the company by way of compensation; and Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201cWe are inclined to the view that where the holder of a life insurance policy borrows money of his insurer, it will be presumed, <em>prima facie, </em>that he does so on the faith of the insurance and in the expectation of possibly meeting his own obligation to the company by that of the company to him, and that the case is one of mutual credits, and-entitled\u2019to the privilege of compensation or set-off whenever the mutual liquidation of the demands is judicially decreed on the insolvency of the company.\u201d And the case of <em>Scammon </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>92 U. S. 362, was referred to, where it was held that a bank, having insurance in a company which was rendered insolvent by the Chicago fire of 1871, had a right to set off the amount of his insurance on property consumed against money of the company in his hands on deposit, although the insurance was not a debt due at the time of \u2022 the insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Indeed natural justice would seem to require that where the transaction is such as to raise the presumption of an agreement for' a set-off it should be held that the equity that this should' be done is superior to any subsequent\" equity not arising out of a purchase for value without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the case at bar the credits between the banks were reciprocal and were parts of the sam\u00e9 transaction, in which each gave credit to the Other on the faith of the simultaneous credit, and the principle' applicable to mutual credits applied.It was, - therefore, the balance upon an adjustment of the accounts, which was the debt, and the Farmers\u2019 Bank had the right, as against the receiver of the Fidelity Bank, although the note matured after the suspension of that bank, to set Off the balance due. upon its deposit account, unless the provisions of the national banking law were to the contrary. Whether this was so or not is the question on which the opini\u00f3n of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>District Judge turned, and which was chiefly urged in argument upon our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Sections 5234, 5236 arid 5242 are the sections relied on. Section 5234 provides for the appointment of a receiver by the Comptroller of the Currency and defines his duties as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u201c Such receiver, under the direction of the Comptroller, shall take possession of the books, records and assets of every description of such association, collect all debts, dues and claims belonging to it, and, upon the order of a court of record of competent jurisdiction, may sell o\u00ed* compound all bad or doubtful- debts, and, on a like order, may sell all the .real and personal property of such association, on such terms' as the court shall direct; and may, if necessary to pay the debts of such association, enforce the individual liability of the stockholders.- Such receiver shall pay over all money so made to the Treasurer.of the United States, subject to the order of the Comptroller, and also make report to the Comptroller-of all his acts and proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Section 5236 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"AIv\">\u201c From time to time, after full provision has been first made for refunding to the United States any deficiency in redeeming the notes of such association, the Comptroller shall make a ratable dividend of the money so paid' over to him by such receiver on all such claims as may have been proved to his satisfaction or adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction, and, as the proceeds of the assets of such association are paid over to him,-shall make further'dividends on all claims previously proved or adjudicated; and the remainder of the proceeds, if any, shall be paid over to the shareholders of suph association, or their legal representatives, in proportion to the stock by them respectively held.\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Section 5242 reads :</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u201c All transfers of the notes, bonds, bills of exchange or other evidences of debt owing to any riational banking association, or of deposits to its credit; all assignments of mortgages, sureties on real-estate, or of judgments or decrees in its favor; all deposits, of money, bullion, or other valuable thing for its use, or for the use of any of its shareholders or creditors; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>all payments of money to either, made after the commission of an act of insolvency, or in contemplation thereof,, made with a view to prevent the application of its assets in the manner prescribed by this chapter, or with a view to the preference of one creditor to another, except in payment of its circulating notes, shall be utterly null and void; and no attachment, injunction or execution, shall be issued against such association or its property before final judgment in any suit, action or proceeding, in any state, county or municipal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The argument is that these sections by implication forbid this set-off because they require that after the redemption of the circulating notes has been fully provided for, the assets shall be ratably distributed among the creditors, and that no preferences given or suffered, in. contemplation of or after committing the act of insolvency, shall stand. And it is insisted that the assets of the bank existing at the time of the act of insolvency include all its property without regard to any existing liens thereon or setoffs thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">We do not regard this position as tenable. Undoubtedly, any disposition by a national bank, being insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, of its choses in action, securities of other assets, made to prevent their application to the payment of its circulating notes, or to prefer one creditor to another, is forbidden; but liens, equities or rights arising Tby express agreement, or implied from the nature of the dealings between the parties, or by operation of law, prior to insolvency and not in contemplation thereof, are not invalidated. The provisions of the act are not directed against all liens, securities, pledges or equities, whereby one creditor may obtain' a greater payment than another, but against those given or arising after or in 'contemplation of insolvency. Where a set-off is otherwise valid, it is not perceived how its allowance can be considered a preference, and it is clear that it is only the balance, if any, after the set-off is deducted which can justly be held to form part of the assets of the insolvent. \u2022 The requirement as to-ratable dividends, is to make them from what belongs to the bank, and that which at the time of the insolvency belongs of right to the debtor does, not .belong to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>There is nothing new in this view of ratable, distribution. As pointed out <em>by </em>counsel, the bankruptcy act of 13 Eliz. c. <em>7, </em>contained no provision in any way directing a set-off or the striking of a balance, and by its second section, commissioners in bankruptcy were to seize and appraise the lands, goods, money and chattels of the bankrupt, to sell the lands and chattels, \u201c or otherwise to order the same for true satisfaction and payment of the said creditors, that is to say, to every of the said creditors a portion, rate and rate alike, according to the quantity of his or their debts.\u201d 4 Statutes of the Nealm, Part I, 589. Tet, in the earliest reported decisions upon set-off, it was allowed under this statute. <em>Anonymous, </em>1 Mod. 215 ; <em>Curson </em>v. <em>African Co., </em>1 Vern. 121; <em>Chapman v. Derby, </em>2 Vern. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The succeeding statutes were but in recognition, in bankruptcy and otherwise, of the practice in chancery in the settlement of estates, and it may be said that in the distribution of the assets of insolvents under voluntary or statutory trusts for creditors the.set-off of debts due has been universally conceded. The equity of equality among creditors is either found inapplicable to such set-offs or yields to their superior equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We are dealing in this case with- an equitable set-off, but if on June 20 the note had matured and each party had a cause of action capable of enforcement by suit at once, upon the argument for the receiver the legal set-off would be destroyed just as effectually as it is contended the equitable set-off is. We cannot believe Congress intended such a result, or to destroy by implication any right vested at the time of the suspension of a national bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The state of case where, the claim sought to be offset is acquired after the act of insolvency is far otherwise, for the rights of the parties, become fixed as of - that time, and to Sustain such a transfer would defeat the object of' these provisions. The transaction must necessarily be held to have been entered into with the intention to produce its natural result, the pre: venting of the application of the insolvent\u2019s assets in the manner prescribed. <em>Venango National Bank </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>56 Penn. St. 14; <em>Colt </em>v. Brown, 12 Gray, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Our conclusion is that this set-off should have been allowed, and this has heretofore been so held in well-considered cases. <em>Snyders' Sons Co. </em>v. Armstrong, 37 Fed. Rep. 18 ; <em>Yardley </em>v. <em>Clothier, </em>49 Fed. Rep. 337; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>21 Weekly Law Bull. 136; 27 Weekly Law Bull. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The Ohio Code of Civil Procedure abolishes the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, requires all actions (with some exceptions) to be brought in the name of the 'real party in interest, and permits all defences, counter-claims and set-offs, whether formerly known as legal or equitable, to be. set up therein. Rev. Stats. Ohio, \u00a7\u00a7 4971, 4993, 5071.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Section 914 of the Revised Statutes in providing that the practice, pleadings and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes, in the Circuit and District Courts, shall conform, as-near as may be, to the practice, pleadings and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State within which such Circuit or District Courts are held, in terms excludes equity causes therefrom, and the jurisprudence of the United States has always recognized the distinction between law and equity as under the Constitution matter of substance, as well as of form and procedure, and, accordingly, legal and equitable claims cannot be blended together in one suit in the Circuit Courts of the United States, nor are equitable defences.permitted. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>11 How. 669; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Railroad Companies, </em>6 Wall. 134; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Neely, </em>140 U. S. 106; <em>Montejo </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>14 Blatchford, 324; <em>La Mothe Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>National Tube Works Co., </em>15 Blatchford, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We are of opinion that the Circuit Court had no power to grant the set-off in question in the suit at law. Judgment, however, was given in that case on the merits upon sustaining the demurrer to the defence of equitable set-off, and as we think that the set-off should have been allowed, we do not feel called upon, having the judgment before us and under our control for affirmance, reversal or modification, to sustain it upon a. jurisdictional ground not passed upon by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">We shall, therefore, reverse it without discussing the question whether if affirmed, it would or would not be a bar . to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>relief in the suit in equity. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>141 U. S. 240; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Searls, </em>130 U. S. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">It follows from what we have said that the first question certified from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit must be answered in the affirmative and the second in the negative, and that the other questions propounded require no reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\n<em>Judgment in No. 53 reversed and cause remcmded to the Circuit Court-with directions for further proceedings in con- \u25a0 fornvity with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>In Eo. 1025, the answers .to the first and second questions above indicated will he certified.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
