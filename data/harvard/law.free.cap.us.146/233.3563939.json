The Circuit Court, Lacombe, J., refused to direct the jury to find for the plaintiff, but on the contrary directed a verdict for the defendant. There was a verdict and judgment accordingly, and plaintiff sued out this writ of error. The opinion of Judge Lacombe will be found in 37 Fed: Eep. 197.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-5\"><em>Mr. Edwin B.

It will be perceived that there has always been a distinction maintained as to the condition of the rubber itself, whether crude or otherwise; between \u201c boots and shoes \u201d (and other specified things) and unspecified \u201c articles composed of india-rubber \u201d and \u201c india-rubber fabrics \u201d ; this marked difference between the last two being perpetuated \u2014 that the \u201c articles \u201d must be composed wholly of rubber, while the \u201c fabrics \u201d might be only in 'part of that material. 22 Stat. 513 ; Heyl. a. d. 1884, Paragraphs 453, 454, 455 and 724; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>96 U.

S. 197.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADP\">\u2022 (2) That a distinction is created, or recognized, between partially india-rubber \u201c fabrics,\u201d and those \u201c articles \u201d of wThich it is the sole component. That the word \u201carticles\u201d might \u25a0include alike those of a specified \u25a0 substance, manufactured or unmanufactured, .may be true (as, in \u00a7 2500, it includes everything capable of being imported); but such extended, comprehensive meaning, in the present- connection, is negatived by the immediately precedent use of the word \u201c fabrics,\u201d which might otherwise be lexicographically included therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">Neither is it at all pertinent to the construction of this paragraph that, in other parts of the statute, the context requires or indicates the comprehensive meaning. <em>United States </em>v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 387. Where lexicographers and common speech affix .several meanings to any word, that one must be adopted in construing a statute which best accords with the context, and with its ordinary use with relation to that subject matter. While all fabrics and all manufactures may be \u201c articles,\u201d some articles are neither, and many' manufactures are not fabrics. <em>Movius </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>95 U. S. 144, 147; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Schell, </em>107 U. S. 617, 621.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">Nobody has ever suggested that our importations were \u201cfabrics.\u201d' We did not so import, nor the Government so duty them. But we have elaborated\u2019 the distinction in order to show that \u201c articles \u201d in the next clause (wrongly applied to our importations) has not the general, comprehensive-meaning assigned to it by the collector and. the court. The specific designation of \u201cindia-rubber boots and shoes\u201d at the same rate as \u201carticles,\u201d shows that it-was not deemed possible to classify them as \u201cfabrics,\u201d nor to duty them as \u201carticles\u201d when not wholly of rubber \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 which for many years they have seldom been, although they?-were so originally. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>7 How. 785.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">(3) The manipulation and the combination of the several constituents left the resulting article still rubber. Independ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>exit patents, for the process and the product have both been declared valid, because the new process resulted in a new and useful article. <em>Goodyear </em>v. <em>Wait, </em>5 Blatchford, 468, 470; <em>Goodyear </em>v. <em>Day, </em>2 Wall. Jr. C. C. 283, 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">The cause at bar comes within the principle of <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>91 U. S. 570, and those in which the admixture has not substantially changed the character of the ingredients. In the Meyer case, lead had, by the mere application of heat, lost its metallic character. In ours, the same mysterious chemical ag\u00e9nt conferred upon the rubber and' sulphur a metallic character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">We do not assent to the proposition of the court below that the enumeration of \u201carticles of rubber\u201d must not be restricted to those substantially of rubber, though an immaterial addition of some other substance might be inconsequential. An article made of rubber and other ingredients cannot be said to be a manufacture of the one component any more than the other; especially (as already- noted) where the other substances fundamentally change the character of the -rubber, in its essential qualities. With or without the word \u201c wholly \u201d india-rubber is as much a designation \u201cof quality and .ma-. terial\u201d as is the word \u201ccotton.\u201d <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Schell, </em>107 U. S. 617, 621.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-7\">When \u2022 Congress does not intend that the import shall be entirely of the ^specified material, \"it indicates such intention by use of the words or of which it is a component,\u201d or (as in the clause relating to fabrics of india-rubber) by saying \u201c wholly or in part,\u201d or some such equivalent expression. The word \u201c wholly \u201d is superfluous except when used in connection with. \u201c or in part.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">Our goods were made either of rubber and sulphur, or of these materials with one-fourth value of coloring matter. The rubber (as a raw material) is free. This makes section 2513 of the act of 1883 applicable to our goods upon the reasoning of the court in <em>Hartranft </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>125 U. S. 337, 338.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-9\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Maury </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Mr. Chief Justice Fuller,</author>\n<p id=\"A_2\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><em>Itl Arthur </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>125 U. S. 70, 76, it was said by Mr.. Justice Field, speaking for the court: \u201c To place articles-among those designated as enumerated, it is not necessary that they should be specifically mentioned. It is sufficient that they are designated in any way to distinguish them from other articles.\u201d And this language was quoted with approval as defining the general scope of the similitude clause in the customs acts, in <em>Mason </em>v. Robertson, 139 U. S. 624, 627, in which it whs held that bichromate of soda was subject to the duty of twenty-five per centum ad valorem imposed under the act. of March 3j 1883, c. 121, upon \u201c all \u00f3hemical compounds and salts, by whatever name- known,\u201d and not subject, by virtue of the similitude clause, to the duty of three cents per pound imposed on bichromate of potash.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">If these importations should -be held \u00e1s \u2022 enumerated, within the rule thus laid down-, then sections 2499 and 2513 have no application. And this is no more than to inquire whether they came within the paragraph prescribing the.dax on \u201c articles composed of india-rubber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In common usage, \u201carticle\u201d.is applied to almost every separate substance or material, whether as a member of a class, or as a particular substance or commodity.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The learned Circuit Judge was of opinion that the wprd \u201c articles \u201d was used in this paragraph in a broad sense, and covered equally things manufactured,^things unmanufactured and-things'partially manufactured, and he sustained 'this view by reference to the us\u00e9 of the word elsewhere in the statute. Thus; in section 2500, relating to reimportations,- they are referred to as \u201c articles once exported of the growth, product or manufacture of the United States.\u201d Section' 2502 commences': \u201cThere shall be levied, collected and paid upon all articles imported from foreign countries, and mentioned in the schedules herein contained, the rates- of duty,\u201d etc. Section 2503 reads: \u201cThe following articles when imported shall be exempt from duty,\u201d and then fqllows the free list, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201carticles imported for the use of the United States,\u201d and ^-articles; the growth, produce and manufacture of the United States-.\u201d- -\u00a5e agree with the Circuit Court that the word must be taken comprehensively and cannot be restricted to articles put in condition for final use, but embmeo'Stas well things manufactured only in part, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"A22\">But it is said that this dental rubber is not \u201c composed of india-rubber \u201d within the intent' and meaning of the statute, because..of the admixture of sulphur and coloring matter, or, in other words, that it is not wholly so composed. The prior tariff act in \u00a7 250\u00e9 of the Bevised Statutes (Bev. Stat. 4T7) contained the same paragraph as that under consideration, except that it read, \u201c articles composed wholly of india-rubber.\u201d The preceding paragraph related to \u201c braces, suspenders, webbing or other fabrics, composed wholly or in part of. india-rubber.\u201d The act of .1883 retained the words \u201c wholly or in part \u201d as applied to fabrics, but omitted the word \u201c wholly \u201d in connection with articles. It is not t\u00f3 be doubted that this omission-, was advisedly made. The manifest intention was that articles. of india-rubber should not escape the prescribed taxation because of having been subjected to treatment fitting them for a particular use, but not changing their essential character.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Such is'the fact with the article in question. It has not lost its identity by a chemical change, and, become a new and different species. It is not crude rubber, nor milk of rubber, nor is it a fabric of rubber, but it is rubber rendered elastic and more attractive by coloring.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Nor are.we impressed with the argument that, being rubber itself, it must be regarded as a material and not an article composed of rubber, for its adaptation to dental purposes has differentiated it commercially. '\u2018Washing and scouring wool does not make' the resulting wool a manufacture of wool; 'cleaning and ginning \u25a0 cotton does not make the resulting cotton a manufacture of cotton; but sulphur and coloring matter, when applied as here, make the resulting rubber, while still remaining rubber, an .article of rubber' as contra-distinguished from rubber crude,or rubber merely cleansed of impurities. . \u25a0 \u2018 \"\u25a0 <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
