There is no law of Ohio authorizing the council of any city, in which there are gas-works in full operation and fully performing all the duties required by the laws of the State, to erect gas-works or to levy a tax for that purpose. <em>Hirn </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Ohio St. 15, 20; <em>State </em>v. <em>Franklin County, </em>20 Ohio St. 421, 424; <em>Pancoast </em>v. <em>Ruffin, </em>1 Ohio, 381, 386 ; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Parish, </em>3 Ohio, 187; <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>2 Ohio St. 147, 152; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>10 Ohio, 173; <em>State </em>v. <em>Darke County, </em>43 Ohio St. 311, 315; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>43 Ohio St. 447, 449; <em>Van Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>9 Ohio St. 406.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">While there might be some foundation for the claim that section 2486, if it stood as an independent act, by implication repealed the provisions of sections 2480 and 2482, there is now ho foundation whatever for any such claim; for, standing as they do, thei\u2019e is but one inference possible, and that is, that the several sections of the statute were each intended by the legislature to have full force and effect, and that no one should destroy or impair the force and' effect of any other one of said sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">Looking at the history of this legislation in the light of these decisions, the conclusion is irresistible that the several sections of this statute must be so construed as to give force and effect to each of said sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">Reading the whole statute together, there can be no doubt as to what was the scheme or system of the legislation upon the subject. of gas companies, and municipal regulations and control of the same, and that scheme being found, it is the duty of the court to so construe the statute as to make it effective as well as to harmonize each section with every other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">The establishment of a gas company requires the outlay of a considerable sum of money. It is a risk at least depending upon a great many contingencies as to whether it would be a success. While it is thus upon one hand, on the other it is a great advantage to the city. Among other things, it enables the city to enforce with greater security its police power. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>establishment is for the mutual benefit of both city and gas company. So the legislature in its wisdom has thrown safeguards and protection around both, preserving to the city the power to control, and to the gas company its life' and existence subject to this power of control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\">If a municipal corporation may at will erect gas-works and operate the same by public funds raised by taxation, how can it be said that the life and existence of a gas company are preserved subject to the control of the city, by the .provisions of these statutes ? '</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">It is'manifest that it is not competition but confiscation that is sought. No gas property can be successfully operated in' competition with the municipality in which it is located, and a desire to avoid any such contingency, and to remove every pretext for every such attempt as is here made, was the incentive to the provision in the statutes requiring, that in any contract the right should be reserved to the municipality to purchase the works.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">II. The appellant company was organized under a law which secured it against interference with its business on the part of the city so long as it faithfully, performed the duties undertaken by the acceptance of its charter ; and that charter was a contract with the State, which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation. <em>Fletcher </em>v.

The power vested by the statutes of Ohio in city councils to provide gas-works is a power conferred for a public benefit and to supply a public want, and when such benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>has been, conferred in a way recognized by the statute as sufficient, and the want does not exist, the power cannot be exercised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\">IY.

If this were conceded, we should feel obliged \u2014 the plaintiff and defendant both being corporations of Ohio \u2014 to reverse the judgment, and remand the cause with directions to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit. Court. The jurisdiction of that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>can be sustained only upon , the theory that the suit is one arising under the Constitution of the United States. But the suit would not be of that character, if regarded as one in which the plaintiff merely sought protection against the violation of the alleged contract by an ordinance to which the State has not, in any form, given or attempted to give the force of law. A municipal ordinance, not passed under supposed legislative authority, cannot be regarded as a law .of the State within the meaning of the constitutional' prohibition against State laws impairing the obligations of contracts. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>96 U. S. 432, 440; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bruffy, </em>96 U. S. 176, 183; <em>Lehigh Water Co. </em>v. Easton, 121 U. S. 388, 392 ; <em>N. O. Water Works </em>v. <em>Louisiana Sugar Co., </em>125 U. S. 18, 31, 38. A suit to prevent the enforcement of such an ordinance would not, therefore, be one arising under the Constitution of the United States. We sustain the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court because it appears that the defendant grounded its right to enact the ordinance in question, and to maintain and erect gas-works of its own, upon that section of the Municipal Code of Ohio, adopted in 1869 (now section 2486 of the Revised Statutes), providing that the city council of any city or village should have power, whenever it was deemed expedient and for the public good, to erect gas-works at the expense of the corporation, or to purchase gas-works already erected therein; which section the plaintiff contends, if construed as conferring the authority claimed, impaired the obligation of its contract previously made with the State and the city.-'-</p>\n<p id=\"AXZ\">What, then,, we must inquire, is the scope and effect of section 2486 ? This precise question has been determined by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State </em>v. <em>City of Hamilton, </em>47 Ohio St. 52, which was an action brought in the name of the State to determine whether the city had authority to erect its own gas-works. It was there contended, both by the Attorney General and the Hamilton Gas Light and Coke Company, that by sections 2480 and 2482 of the Revised Statutes (which are the same as sections 31 and 32 of the.act of March 11, 1853), the legislature specified the conditions under which the council might build gas-works; that in the absence of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>conditions, the city was without power to do what it proposed to do; and that such an expression of the legislative \u25a0will, excluded the right of the city to erect gas-works under any circumstances. Bufythe court said: \u201c Those two sections designate what refusal or neglect oh the part of gas companies to meet the requirements of law, would work a forfeiture of their rights under their charter,' and authorize the council to lay pipes, and erect gas-works, and exclude a gas company already in operation from occupying any streets not already furnished with gas pipes of such companies; but such authority is very different from the general power conferred upon the council by section 2486 to construct gas-works without reference to the manner in which the existing company may use its franchise.\u201d \u201c Section 2486,\u201d the court proceeds, <em>\u201c </em>in plain language gives the power to the council either to erect gas-works, or to- purchase such works already erected. The authority granted is not coupled with any conditions or contingency, but is to be exercised when the council may deem it expedient and for the public good. The language is free from ambiguity. The discretionary' power would hardly seem consistent with the limitation sought to be imposed, that the council can build\u2019gas-works~only - where there are no gasworks in the \"municipality, or where gas companies, already organized, refuse or neglect to comply,with the requirements of the law as to lighting or laying pipes,.or neglect to furnish gas to citizens. The interest of the city may demand' that a gas company established and doing business, although complying with all statutes and ordinances, she Id not continue to enjoy exclusive possession of the field' of operation.\u201d Again\u201c In its present form, section 2486 was passed many years after the two sections which are reproduced in section 2480 and section 2482. Between the earlier and later statutory provisions we discover no repugnancy, and the canons of statutory construction do not require that either should prevail over the other. The authority given to municipalities by the later section is distinct from and independent of. the power granted by the- two antecedent sections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Accepting, as we do, this decision of the highest court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the State as correctly interpreting the legislative will, and, therefore, assuming that the legislature intended by section 2486 to confer authority upon the city of Hamilton to erect gas-works at its expense, whenever deemed by it expedient or for the public good to do so, the next contention of the plaintiff is that such legislation is within the constitutional inhibition of state laws- impairing the obligations of contracts. This view is inadmissible. The statutes in force when the plaintiff became a corporation did not compel the citjr to use the gaslight furnished by the plaintiff. The city was empowered to contract with the company, for lighting streets, lanes, squares, and public \u00a1places within its limits, but it was under no legal obligation to make a contract of that character, although it could regulate, by ordinance, the price to be charged for gaslight supplied by the.plaintiff and used by the city or its inhabitants. It may be that the stockholders of the plaintiff supposed, at the time it' became incorporated, and when they made their- original investment, that the city would never do what ^evidently is contemplated by the ordinance of 1889. And it may be that the erection and maintenance of gas-works by the city at the public expense, and in competition with the plaintiff, will ultimately-impair, if not destroy, the value of the plaintiff\u2019s works for the purposes for which they were established. \u2022 But such considerations cannot control the determination of the legal rights of the parties. As said by this court in <em>Curtis </em>v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68, 70: \u201cNor does every statute which affects the value of a contract impair its obligation. It is one of the contingencies to which.-parties look now in making a large class of contracts, that they may be affected in many ways by state and national-legislation.\u201d If parties wish to guard against contingencies of that kind they must do so 'by such clear and explicit.-language as will take their contracts out of the established rule that public grants, susceptible of two constructions, must receive the one most favorable to the public. Upon this ground it was held in <em>Stein v. Bienville Water Supply Co., </em>141 U. S. 67, 81, that \u201cwe are forbidden to hold that a grant, under legislative' authority, of 'an exclusive privilege, for a term of years, of supplying a munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>pal corporation and its people with water drawn by means of a system of water-works from a particular stream or river, prevents the State from granting to other person^ the privilege of supplying, during\u2019 the same period, the same corporation and people with water drawn in like manner from a different, stream or'river.\u201d What was said in <em>Turnpike Company </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 Wall. 210, 213, is quite applicable to the present case. The State of Maryland incorporated a company with power to consti\u2019uct a turnpike between Baltimore and Washington; and subsequently incorporated a railroad company, with authority to construct a railroad between the same cities, the line of which ran near to and parallel with the turnpike. One of the questions in the case was, whether -the last act impaired the obligation of the contract with the turnpike company, it appearing that the construction of the railroad had rendered it impracticable for the company, out of its diminished income, to maintain the turnpike in proper order. This court said: \u201c The difficulty of the argument in behalf of the turnpike company, and which lies at the foundation. of the defence, is, that there is no contract in the charter of the turnpike company that prohibited the legislature from authorizing the construction of the rival railroad. No exclusive privileges had been.conferred upon it, either in express terms, or by necessary, implication; and hence whatever may'have been the general injurious effects and 'consequences to the company, from the construction and operation of the rival road, they are simply misfortunes which may excite our sympathies, but are not -the subject of legal redress.\u201d So, it tpay be said, in the present case, neither in the .statutes under which the plaintiff became a corporation, nor in any contract it had with the .city, after January 1st, 1889, was there any provision that prevented the State from giving the city authority to erect and maintain gas-works at its own expense, or that prevented the city from executing the power granted by the. section of the Code- of 1869 to which- we have referred. - .. .</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u2022 This conclusion is required by-'.other considerations. By the constitution of Ohio, adopted in 1851, it was declared-that \u201cno special privileges- or immunities shall.ever be granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the general \u00e1ssembly; \u201d that <em>\u201c </em>the general assembly shall pass, no special act conferring corporate powers; \u201d and that \u201c corporations may be formed under general laws; but all such laws may, from tipie to time, be altered' or repealed.\u201d Sec. 2, Art. 1; Secs. 1, 2, Art. 13. If the statute under which the plaintiff became incorporated be. construed as giving it the exclusive privilege, so long as it met the requirements of law, of supplying gas-light to the city of Hamilton and its inhabitants by means of pipes laid in the public ways, there is no escape from the conclusion that such a grant, as respects, at least, its exclusive character, was subject to the power of the legislature, reserved by the state constitution, of altering or revoking it. This reservation of power to alter or revoke a grant of special privileges necessarily became a part of the charter of every corporation formed under the general statute providing for the formation of corporations. A legislative grant to a corporation of special privileges, if not forbidden by the constitution, may be a contract; but where one of the conditions of the grant is that the. legislature may alter or revoke it, a law altering or revoking, or which has the effect to alter or revoke, the exclusive character of such privileges, cannot be regarded as one impairing the obligation of the contract, whatever may be the motive of the legislature, or however harshly such legislation may operate, in the particular case, upon the corporation or parties affected by it. The corporation, by accepting the grant subject to the legislative power so reserved by the constitution, must be held to have assented to such reservation. These views are supported by the decisions of this court. In <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Freight Co., </em>105 U. S. 13, 17, the question was as to the scope and effect of a clause in a general statute of Massachusetts, providing that every act of incorporation-passed, after a named day, <em>\u201c </em>shall be subject to amendment, alteration or repeal at the pleasure of the legislature.\u201d This court, referring to that clause, said: \u201c Such, an act may be amended; that is, it may be changed by additions to its terms or by qualifications of the same. It may be altered by the same power, and it may be repealed. What is it maybe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>repealed? It is the act.of incorporation. It is this organic law on which the corporate existence of the company depends which may be repealed, so that it' shall cease to be a law; or the legislature may adopt the milder course of amending the law in matters which need amendment, or altering it when it needs substantial change. All this may be done at the pleasure of the legislature. That body need give no reason for its action in the matter. The validity of such action does not depend on the necessity for it, or on the soundness of the reasons which prompted it.\u201d The words <em>\u201c </em>at the pleasure of the legislature\u201d are not in the clauses of the constitution of Ohio, or in the statutes to which we have referred. But the general reservation of the power to alter, revoke or repeal a grant of special privileges necessarily implies that the power. may be exerted at the pleasure of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><em>We </em>perceive no error in the record in respect to the Federal question involved, and the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
