That is her request. I informed the court of this. \u201d The commissioner responded: \u201cShe will keep her present attorney at least until the conclusion of the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Upon recommendation of the commissioner, the juvenile court thereafter entered the orders from which the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Minors, no less than adults, are \u201c \u2018persons\u2019 under our Constitution . . . possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect. ...\u201d <em>(Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines School Dist. </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 503, 511 [21 L.Ed.2d 731, 740, 89 S.Ct. 733].)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">It is the appeal\u2019s contention that constitutional error condemned by <em>Marsden (People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]) was committed by the commissioner, and that Ann was entitled to the protection of that authority\u2019s holding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\"><em>Marsden </em>teaches: \u201cA trial judge is unable to intelligently deal with a defendant\u2019s request for substitution of attorneys unless he is cognizant of the grounds which prompted the request. The defendant may have knowledge of conduct and events relevant to the diligence and competence of his attorney which are not apparent to the trial judge from observations within the four comers of the courtroom. . . . Thus, a judge who denies a motion for substitution of attorneys solely on the basis of his courtroom observations, despite a defendant\u2019s offer to relate specific instances of misconduct, abuses the exercise of his discretion to determine the competency of the attorney.\u201d (2 Cal.3d pp. 123-124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">We conclude that under <em>Marsden </em>the commissioner should have made inquiry into the causes of Ann\u2019s dissatisfaction with her court-appointed attorney and, if the complaint appeared valid, he should have taken corrective action in accordance with law. The complained of orders will accordingly be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">We have considered respondent\u2019s argument that: \u201cThe parents of a minor do not have standing to assert the minor\u2019s right to adequate counsel.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure section 902 provides that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved may appeal\u201d in civil cases such as this. We may not reasonably say, as a matter of law, that the parents of Ann are not here aggrieved. We have therefore entertained the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The orders from which the appeal is taken are reversed; the juvenile court will take further proceedings not inconsistent with the views we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
