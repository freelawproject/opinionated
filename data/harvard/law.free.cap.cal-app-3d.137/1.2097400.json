J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">Petitioner seeks writ of mandate compelling the trial court to grant petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of possession to recover telephone equipment leased to real party in interest. Real party\u2019s only defense to the claim of possession is that the equipment was defective. We conclude that real party\u2019s alleged right to damages based upon the defects is independent of petitioner\u2019s right to possession. Thus, petitioner is entitled to a writ of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">Real party in interest leased television and telephone equipment from petitioner and failed to make full payment on the lease agreements, alleging defects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>in the telephone equipment. On March 3, 1982, petitioner filed a complaint seeking repossession, followed by an application for a writ of possession (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 512.060). The trial court granted the writ regarding the televisions, but denied the writ insofar as it sought return of the telephone equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">Code of Civil Procedure section 512.060 provides in part: \u201c(a) At the hearing, a writ of possession shall issue if both of the following are found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">\u201c (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of his claim to possession of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">\u201c(2) The plaintiff has provided an undertaking as required by Section 515.010.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 511.090 defines \u201cprobable validity\u201d: \u201cA claim has \u2018probable validity\u2019 where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The facts of the instant case establish the \u201cprobable validity\u201d of petitioner\u2019s claim for possession. Petitioner did not sell, but merely leased, equipment to real party. Whatever real party\u2019s right may be to damages for the alleged defects in the equipment, it cannot defeat petitioner\u2019s ownership rights and right to reclaim the equipment. The claim for possession and the claim for damages are unrelated. Real party does not contend that either the contract or any legal theory establishes that the lessee may obtain ownership rights in the leased equipment in lieu of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">Real party no doubt would prefer to retain possession as a bargaining tool or to insure easy access to petitioner\u2019s assets in the event of a money judgment in favor of real party. However, real party is not without protection, in light of the requirement that petitioner file a written undertaking which will provide for payment to real party \u201cof any sum he may recover against plaintiff\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 515.010, subd. (a)) and in light of real party\u2019s opportunity to file an undertaking to prevent petitioner from taking possession (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 515.020).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">We have reached the foregoing conclusion after full briefing by the parties. An alternative writ would add nothing to the presentation already made and would only delay issuance of the writ of possession. We therefore issue a peremptory writ in the first instance. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1088; <em>San Diego Wholesale Credit Men\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 458 [110 Cal.Rptr. 657]; <em>Goodenough </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 692, 697 [96 Cal.Rptr. 165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the San Francisco Superior Court to (1) vacate that portion of its order which denies petitioner a writ of possession for the telephone equipment, (2) determine the amount of the undertaking required of petitioner, and (3) issue the writ of possession if petitioner meets the undertaking requirement and real party does not file an undertaking to prevent petitioner from obtaining possession (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 515.020).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Feinberg, J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
