Code, \u00a7 211), and 17 counts of false imprisonment effected by violence (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 236,237). As to most if not all of the offenses, he was found to have used a firearm in their commission. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5.) He was also convicted of possession of a concealable firearm by one previously convicted of a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021.) His base term (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (b)), on one of the robbery convictions, was fixed at six years. Believing Sequeira\u2019s remaining armed robberies to be \u201cviolent felonies,\u201d and therefore <em>not </em>subject to Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (f)\u2019s limitation that the total term of imprisonment \u201cshall not exceed twice the number of years imposed as the base term,\u201d the court ordered the remaining robbery terms to run consecutively. With its firearm use enhancements, the total term of imprisonment was fixed at 21 years, 4 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Sequeira\u2019s appeal from the judgment was assigned to this division of our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">On the appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sequeira </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 1 [179 Cal.Rptr. 249]), believing ourselves bound by the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396], we concluded that armed robbery was <em>not </em>such a \u201cviolent felony\u201d (as defined by Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667.5 and 1170.1, subd. (f)), as would allow the term of imprisonment to exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number><em>more </em>than twice the years imposed as to the base term. From our conclusion, it would appear that Sequeira\u2019s sentence should have been limited to 12 years. By our opinion and decision, filed November 25, 1981, we affirmed the judgment, but remanded the cause \u201cto the trial court for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Five weeks after the filing of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sequeira, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 1, the state\u2019s Supreme Court (Dec. 21, 1981), filed its opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 462 [179 Cal.Rptr. 239, 637 P.2d 706]. Distinguishing <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 754, upon which we had relied, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>concluded, as we read it, (1) that armed robberies are otherwise \u201cviolent offenses,\u201d and (2) that \u201cunlimited total subordinate terms for consecutive [\u2018violent felony\u2019] offenses [are] harmonious\u201d with related Penal Code provisions and <em>not </em>contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Our remittitur in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sequeira </em>reached the superior court <em>after </em>announcement of <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Upon the required resentencing, the People argued that Sequeira should be sentenced according to the law pronounced by <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez. </em>Sequeira insisted that the doctrine of <em>\u201claw of the case\u201d </em>applied, and that the court was bound thereby to follow the directions of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sequeira.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We observe that at the conclusion of arguments of counsel at Sequeira\u2019s resentencing the trial court stated: \u201cAt the time of sentencing in this case it was the intent of the court to impose the maximum sentence appropriate under the law, and it is still this court\u2019s intent. If I felt that the district attorney was correct regarding his interpretation of the <em>Hernandez </em>holding, I would then give the defendant, in accordance with the initial intent of the court, the 20 years. However, I have done considerable research on this matter and I feel bound by the law of the case and the ruling of the appellate court. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The court thereupon, applying the law of the case, and following <em>People </em>v. <em>Sequeira\u2019s </em>directions, resentenced Sequeira to a total term of 12 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The People thereupon appealed. It is that appeal which is presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The <em>only </em>issue of the appeal is whether the superior court erred in its application of the doctrine of law of the case, instead of applying the holding and rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">We note initially the settled rule of <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]: \u201cUnder the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>trine of <em>stare decisis, </em>all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction. Otherwise, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>makes no sense. The decisions of this court [i.e., the Supreme Court] are binding upon and must be followed by all the state courts of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In seeming conflict, at least in the context of the case before us, is the doctrine of law of the case, which has been stated by Mr. Wilkin as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\u201cThe decision of an appellate court, stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case, conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.\u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 633 p. 4552.) \u201cThe doctrine applies to criminal cases as well as civil cases.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 4553.) \u201cThe later decisions not only recognize several kinds of exceptions to the application of the doctrine [but also] treat the doctrine as merely one of policy and normal practice.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 636, p. 4555.) And: \u201c[T]here are two situations in which it is now clear that the doctrine will be rejected: <em>Where there is an intervening or contemporaneous change in law. </em>\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 650, p. 4568; italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of law of the case of course is not inflexible. . . . The principal ground for ignoring the doctrine ... is an intervening or contemporaneous change in the law.\u201d <em>(Davies </em>v. <em>Krasna </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 502, 507, fn. 5 [121 Cal.Rptr. 705, 535 P.2d 1161, 79 A.L.R.3d 807].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">\u201cWe recognize that an intervening or contemporaneous change in the law or the establishment of a new precedent by controlling authority is one of the recognized exceptions to the rule of the law of the case. ...\u201d <em>(Chase Brass &amp; Copper Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 457, 465 [138 Cal.Rptr. 901].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201cIt appears from the late California decisions that this doctrine [of law of the case] is one of policy only and that it will be disregarded when compelling circumstances call for a redetermination of the determination of the point of law on a prior appeal. . . . This is particularly true where an intervening or contemporaneous change in the law has occurred by the overruling of former decisions or the establishment of new precedent by controlling authority. ...\u201d <em>(Ryan </em>v. <em>Mike-Ron Corp. </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 91, 96-97 [66 Cal.Rptr. 224].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Under the foregoing authority we conclude that, because of the intervening change in the law followed by us in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sequeira, </em>by the later and higher authority of <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>the trial court erroneously applied the docrine of law of the case at Sequeira\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>As said in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 816, 818-819 [166 Cal.Rptr. 795]: \u201cImposition of \u2018a sentence not authorized by law . . . [is] subject to judicial correction whenever the error [comes] to the attention of the trial court or a reviewing court.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 763 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289].) \u2018 \u201c \u2018When a court pronounces a sentence which is unauthorized by the Penal Code, that sentence must be vacated and a proper sentence imposed whenever the mistake is appropriately brought to the attention of the court.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 . . . And such an unlawful sentence will be corrected even though the correction operates more severely against the defendant \u2018than the original unauthorized pronouncement.\u2019 \u201d (And see authority there collected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The judgment of conviction of defendant Sequeira is affirmed, except as to the sentencing thereon. The cause is remanded to the superior court for resentencing in accordance with <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 462, and in a manner not inconsistent with the views we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
