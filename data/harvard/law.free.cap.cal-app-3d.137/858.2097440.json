J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0o\">The facts pertinent to our disposition herein are not in dispute and may be summarized briefly as follows. In July of 1977, respondent Georgina Zapata applied for benefits under the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) welfare program. (Tit. IV-A of the Social Security Act of 1935, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq. (the Act).) That application was denied by the Los Angeles County Department of Social Services and, after hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>denial was sustained by appellant on the ground that the only child in the family unit, Georgina\u2019s son, was already receiving assistance under the supplemental security income for aged, blind and disabled (SSI) program. (Tit. XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Similar determinations were made by appellant respecting respondents Alfred Long, Eunice Holmes and Selma Haskins, except that in these cases AFDC aid was discontinued, upon a showing the dependent children of the parties started receiving SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Underlying appellant\u2019s decisions were the facts that (a) state law requires that in order to qualify for AFDC benefits each needy family must contain \u201cone or more needy children qualified for aid\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11450) and that (b) appellant\u2019s interpretation of this requirement, as reflected in its regulations, is that a child receiving SSI is not, i.e., cannot be, for purposes of the state statute, a \u201cneedy child.\u201d (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11202.) Put otherwise, it is appellant\u2019s position that if the only minor child in a family unit applies for and receives SSI, the child\u2019s parent or guardian is not entitled to benefits under the AFDC program as a \u201ccaretaker relative,\u201d such that disqualification of the child as an AFDC beneficiary likewise disqualifies the family unit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">That this is so, urges appellant, is manifested by certain decisions of the United States Supreme Court which make clear the question of need vis-a-vis the AFDC program is one to be resolved by the respective participating states. Thus, as was said in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 575 at page 578 [43 L.Ed.2d 469, 474, 95 S.Ct. 1180], \u201cThe Court has held that under \u00a7 402 (a)(10) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(10), federal participation in state AFDC programs is conditioned on the State\u2019s offering benefits to all persons who are eligible under federal standards. The State must provide benefits to all individuals who meet the federal definition of \u2018dependent child\u2019 <em>and who are \u2018needy\u2019 under state standards, </em>unless they are excluded or aid is made optional by another provision of the Act. <em>New York Dept. of Social Services </em>v. <em>Dublino, </em>413 U. S. 405, 421-422 (1973); <em>Carleson </em>v. <em>Remillard, </em>406 U. S. 598 (1972); <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Swank, </em>404 U. S. 282 (1971); <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>392 U. S. 309 (1968). ...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Respondents, on the other hand, maintain that the language used by the court in <em>Burns </em>cannot properly be understood as applying to a situation where the federal legislation involved is itself dispositive, since under such circumstances a contrary posture of a state is violative of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution. That this principle is at work under the facts present, respondents say, is evident from the provisions of 42 United States Code section 602(a)(24) to the effect that \u201c[I]f an individual is receiving benefits under Title XVI [SSI], then, for the period for which such benefits are received, such individual shall not be regarded as a member of a family <em>for purposes of determining the amount of benefits of the family under this title [AFDC] </em>and his income and resources shall not be counted as income and resources of a family under this title [AFDC] . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The conflicting contentions of the parties were presented below by the filing by respondents on January 27, 1978, of their class action for declaratory and injunctive relief and for peremptory writs of mandate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following trial on July 9, 1980, the trial court in a soundly reasoned and well articulated memorandum of intended decision, which with minor deletions and the addition of footnotes we adopt hereinafter as our own, set out its rationale for the judgment in respondents\u2019 favor entered April 20, 1981, from which this appeal is taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">So, the trial court opined that: \u201cThe principal substantive issue is whether federal statutes and regulations prevent the State of California from providing, as it does, that where the only minor dependent child or children in a family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>otherwise entitled to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (hereinafter \u2018AFDC\u2019) are receiving Supplemental Security Income (hereinafter \u2018SSI\u2019), such family is ineligible for AFDC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">\u201cWelfare and Institutions Code section 11450(a) states that in order to qualify for AFDC benefits, there must be \u2018one or more needy children qualified for aid under this chapter. \u2019 The state contends that a child receiving SSI benefits is not a \u2018needy child\u2019 and has carried this determination into its regulation 44-206, the effect of which is to categorically exclude from inclusion in the \u2018Family Budget Unit\u2019 a child receiving SSI. The state justifies this holding with the reasoning that a child receiving SSI is not \u2018needy\u2019 and, therefore, cannot be used to qualify an otherwise eligible family for AFDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs attack the state\u2019s determination, contending that under federal law a child receiving SSI is necessarily \u2018needy\u2019 and, therefore, that the state is without power to provide to the contrary. Plaintiffs seek a ruling declaring invalid, as in conflict with federal law, section 11450(a) (insofar as it implies a contrary conclusion) and regulation 44-206, insofar as it excludes from the \u2018Family Budget Unit\u2019 a child who Receives SSI. The issues are significant, involving by the state\u2019s estimate approximately 4,500 families who would otherwise be eligible for AFDC and approximately $16,000,000 per year of expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s principal defense is based upon its argument that, although a child receiving SSI is a \u2018dependent child\u2019 within the meaning of the federal government\u2019s AFDC statutes, nevertheless there is reserved to the states to determine whether such a child is \u2018needy.\u2019 The argument is that the state has determined that a child receiving SSI is not \u2018needy\u2019 so as to be counted in determining whether a family qualifies for AFDC.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] The net result of the state\u2019s position is that where a family eligible for AFDC contains only a child or children who are also eligible for SSI, the family must elect whether to accept the SSI benefits for the child or the AFDC benefits for the family, including the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\u201cAFDC is a cooperative federal-state welfare program established in Title IV(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 USC \u00a7 601, et seq. Under the program, federal and state sources of funds are used to provide aid to families who have dependent children. All states participate in the program. A basic concept of the program is that aid is provided not only for a child but to a family unit as described in the Act. Each state may provide its own eligibility requirements if consistent with federal law. Primarily, the program is used to provide welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>to split families where there is insufficient income to support the family unit. SSI (42 USC \u00a7 1381), on the other hand, is a program for aid to a handicapped child. It is funded by the federal government, although most states, including California, have a supplementary program. SSI is available to provide welfare for \u2018needy\u2019 handicapped children. The overlap which was the genesis of this lawsuit occurs where there is a child eligible for SSI in a family also eligible for AFDC. California agrees that a child in that situation is a \u2018dependent child\u2019- and, therefore, that requisite for eligibility under AFDC is satisfied. However, the state nevertheless contends that under Social Security law as interpreted by the U. S. Supreme Court, there is reserved to the states the power to determine the standards under which a child is \u2018needy.\u2019 It appears to the court that the state\u2019s contention in this regard is well-founded. The prime authority cited for this point is <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Alcala, </em>420 U.S. 575 (1975). Therein the court said (in dealing with a different factual situation) at page 578:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201c \u2018The Court has held that. . . federal participation in state AFDC programs is conditioned on the State\u2019s offering benefits to all persons eligible under federal standards. The State must provide benefits to all individuals who meet the federal definition of \u201cdependent child\u201d and who are \u201cneedy\" under state standards, unless they are excluded or aid is made optional by another provision of the Act.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\u201cOther U. S. Supreme Court decisions asserting that the state may determine who is \u2018needy\u2019 are <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 318-319 (1967), and <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 478 (1969.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\u201cTaking its clue from these cases, the State of California had determined that a child receiving benefits under SSI is not \u2018needy,\u2019 another requisite for AFDC eligibility. The court agrees with the essence of defendant\u2019s theory, that is, that a state may determine who is \u2018needy,\u2019 but believes that the state\u2019s power in this regard is subject to any limitations and qualification required by federal law. It is well established that a state participating in the AFDC program must meet the requirements of federal law. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, King </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Vowell, </em>472 F.2d 622, 624 (5 Cir., 1973), among other authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\u201cAccordingly, the state\u2019s power to determine whether or not a child receiving SSI is \u2018needy,\u2019 so as to qualify a family for AFDC, depends on whether federal law and regulation implementing that law circumscribe the state\u2019s power to declare as not \u2018needy\u2019 a child receiving SSI. It is necessary, therefore, to turn to federal statutory law and regulations interpreting that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\u201cThe principal statutory provision effecting [sic] this case is found in 42 USC \u00a7 602(a)(7) and (24). The pertinent statutory language appears to be as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>\u2018(a) A State plan for aid and services to needy families with children must. . . (7) . . . provide that the State agency shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children . . .; (24) provide that if an individual is receiving benefits under subchapter XVI of this chapter [SSI], then, for the period for which such benefits are received, such individuals shall not be regarded as a member of a family for purposes of determining the amount of the benefits of the family under this subchapter and his income and resources shall not be counted as income and resources of a family under this subchapter; . . . \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">\u201cIt is noted that subsection (7) gives power and direction to the state to count the child\u2019s income in with the rest of the family\u2019s income to determine eligibility for the AFDC program. It must be determined whether subparagraph (24) of section 602 has the effect of qualifying the state\u2019s ability to declare that a child receiving SSI is not \u2018needy.\u2019 The court is of the opinion that subsection (24) is ambiguous in this respect, but that the better interpretation is that the state\u2019s ability to declare as \u2018not needy\u2019 a child receiving SSI is preempted by subsection (24). In essence, subsection (24) states that a child receiving SSI \u2018shall not be regarded as a member of the family for purposes of determining the amount of the benefits of the family.\u2019 In short, if there was a family unit of two (consisting of a \u2018caretaker relative,\u2019 usually an impecunious mother) and a dependent and needy child, the grant of benefits shall be limited to a family unit of one (that is, the \u2018caretaker relative\u2019). The next clause seems determinative. It says that \u2018his (the SSI child recipient) income and resources shall not be counted as income and resources of the family under this subchapter. \u2019 The state argues that the effect of the just-quoted phrase is merely to cause the amount of any SSI payment not to be counted as income for determining eligibility, but has no effect on determining whether a child is \u2018needy.\u2019 Under the state\u2019s interpretation, the just-quoted phrase would only apply after there is first determined that there is an eligible AFDC family, which includes a \u2018needy child.,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Under the state\u2019s interpretation, therefore, the just-quoted clause only applies in determining the amount of any award under AFDC to an eligible family. However, it seems to the court that the more likely correct interpretation is that subsection (24) talks not only about calculation of the amount of an AFDC grant, but also about whether a child should be determined to be \u2018needy.\u2019 The latter interpretation is supported by HEW itself in two sources. First, in 1977, HEW published its own interpretation in \u2018Action Transmittal\u2019 AT-77-45, apparently a type of bulletin wherein HEW gives advice to state participants in the AFDC program. The \u2018Action Transmittal\u2019 expressly adopts plaintiff\u2019s interpretation, to wit, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>subsection (24) only requires the amount of SSI to be deducted, but does not prevent the \u2018family unit\u2019 from qualifying for AFDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\u201cThe defendant points out that the so-called \u2018Action Transmittal\u2019 interpretation is not embodied in regulations and is, therefore, not binding on the state. Defendant concedes that a properly adopted federal regulation would be binding on California were there one adopted. In this respect it may be noted that the Department of HEW has given notice that it does intend to publish regulations making it clear that the only child or children\u2019s receipt of SSI may not be taken to justify denial of AFDC (Exhibit C); however, the regulation has not yet been adopted. However, another regulation does affect the determination as to whether the federal government has occupied the field with respect to dependent children receiving SSI. Code of Federal Regulations, Title XXXXV, section 233.20(a), dealing with determination of need, affects the question. It provides in pertinent part as follows: \u2018A State Plan for . . . AFDC . . . must. . . [p]rovide that individuals receiving SSI benefits under Title XVI for the period for which such benefits are received, shall not be included in the AFDC assistance unit for purposes of determining need and the amount of the assistance payment. . . . [and must] specify a statewide standard, expressed in money amounts, to be used in determining <em>(a) </em>the need of the applicants and recipients and <em>(b) </em>the amount of the assistance payment.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\u201cThus the regulations make it clear that HEW has taken the position that sub-paragraph (24) set forth earlier in this memorandum deals with the determination of need as well as the calculation of benefits. The regulations further make it clear that a need standard must be expressed in a dollar amount and not a categorical exception based upon a status (i.e., receipt of SSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">\u201cIn addition, two federal trial court decisions, not published, bear on the question. They are <em>McGranahan </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>No. 76-377 (District Court for the District of New Hampshire); and <em>Udell </em>v. <em>Page, </em>No. 78-849 (District Court for the Middle District of Florida). ... In each case, the district court held that section 602(a)(24) was to be construed as preventing a state from making a family ineligible for AFDC where the sole or only children in the family were also receiving [SSI]. This court\u2019s decision is in accord with those federal court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\u201cAccordingly, this court\u2019s determination is that, while accepting defendant\u2019s major premise that a state may determine the definition of a \u2018needy child,\u2019 the state may only do so where not otherwise limited by federal law. The court finds that the proper construction of federal law does, in the circumstances of this case, preclude the state from denying AFDC to families where the sole or only children also receive SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>\u201cThe result of this determination is that mandate must issue in the cases of the individual plaintiffs requiring a redetermination of the individual plaintiff\u2019s right to AFDC based upon the above holding. In the class action aspects of this case, the court contemplates that declaratory and injunctive relief will be necessary prospectively, and has stated to counsel its determination as to the extent to which back benefits may be recovered by members of the class.\u201d (See fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Having in this fashion provided the reasoning supporting our determination to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, we address further that portion of the latter requiring retroactive application only insofar as to observe it is clear to us from both statutory and decisiona0l law that the named (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10961; <em>Bd. ofSoc. Welfare </em>v. <em>County of L.

It was the mandatory duty of the county to furnish aid according to the plan therefor which is laid down by the applicable provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code. [Citations.] The obligation to pay became a debt due from the county to the applicant as of the date the latter was first entitled to receive the aid. [Citation.].\u201d <em>(Bd. of Soc.
