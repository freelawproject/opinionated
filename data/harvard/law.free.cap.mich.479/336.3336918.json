We conclude that a letter that conveys a call to act is sufficient to constitute a demand. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 letters did constitute a demand as contemplated by MCL 129.61, we are required to consider whether plaintiffs have constitutional standing to pursue the lawsuit authorized by the statute. We conclude that they do not and hold that MCL 129.61 is unconstitutional to the extent that it confers standing on taxpayers who do not meet the three-part test for determining whether a party has constitutional standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Although we disagree with that part of the Court of Appeals opinion that determined that plaintiffs\u2019 letters did not constitute a demand under MCL 129.61, on the basis that the plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to sue, we affirm the lower court judgments that held that plaintiffs could not proceed with their lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">I. PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Plaintiffs are Ann Arbor public school district taxpayers who brought suit to challenge the school district\u2019s expenditure of public funds to provide health insurance benefits to same-sex domestic partners of school employees. Their complaint alleged that the expenditure of public funds for that purpose violates MCL 551.1, which defines marriage to exclude same-sex unions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before filing their lawsuit, several of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tiffs sent identical letters to various school board members and other local and state officials, including the county prosecutor, the Attorney General, and the Governor. Each letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">I [We] write to request that you investigate and halt the use of public funds to provide so-called \u201cdomestic partnership\u201d benefits to employees of the Ann Arbor public schools. I [We] believe that the School District\u2019s extension of these benefits to its employees exceeds its authority and violates the state law governing marriage. I [We] ask that you halt this illegal use of public funds at your earliest possible convenience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">After the Ann Arbor Education Association, MEA/NEA, intervened as a defendant on behalf of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>members, defendants moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(5) (The party asserting the claim lacks the legal capacity to sue.). The trial court granted the motion, determining that plaintiffs failed to bring their suit on behalf of the school district treasurer. The trial court also ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 letters failed to comply with the statute in that they did not make a \u201cdemand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a published opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the panel disagreed with the trial court that the plaintiffs had failed to bring suit on behalf of the treasurer, the Court nevertheless affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit because it agreed that plaintiffs\u2019 requests to the board of education and other governmental officials that they halt the \u201cillegal use of public funds\u201d were insufficient to satisfy the statute\u2019s specific-demand requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Plaintiffs filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court. We first ordered oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other peremptory action pursuant to MCR 7.302(G)(1), asking the parties to address only the issue of what constitutes an effective demand under MCL 129.61.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, we granted leave to appeal, asking the parties to brief whether plaintiffs had standing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">We review de novo a grant or denial of summary disposition. <em>Nastal v Henderson &amp; Assoc Investigations, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>Inc, </em>471 Mich 712, 720; 691 NW2d 1 (2005). Whether plaintiffs\u2019 letters constituted a \u201cdemand\u201d under MCL 129.61 is a matter of statutory interpretation. We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. <em>Miller v Miller, </em>474 Mich 27, 30; 707 NW2d 341 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">III. ANALYSIS OF MCL 129.61</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">As relevant to the question whether plaintiffs\u2019 letters constituted a demand under MCL 129.61,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the statute provides, in relevant part, \u201cBefore such suit is instituted a demand shall be made on the public officer, board or commission whose duty it may be to maintain such suit followed by a neglect or refusal to take action in relation thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The Court of Appeals noted that the term \u201cdemand\u201d is defined in the <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997) as \u201cto ask for with proper authority; claim as a right,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the statutory phrase \u201cmain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>tain such suit\u201d indicates that \u201cthe purpose of the demand requirement is to inform the appropriate party that legal action is forthcoming.\u201d 265 Mich App at 710. It then concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 letters did not constitute a \u201cdemand\u201d because they were \u201cmerely a request that the alleged misappropriation stop; they are not a demand for legal action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals analysis and conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201crequest\u201d was sufficient to satisfy the statute\u2019s \u201cdemand\u201d requirement. Indeed, a request that the Attorney General halt something asserted to be illegal can only be reasonably understood, in the context of a demand to the state\u2019s top legal officer, as a demand that he or she take steps to stop such actions up to and including bringing a lawsuit. While plaintiffs did not use the word \u201cdemand\u201d in their letters, their \u201crequest\u201d is properly considered a \u201cdemand.\u201d Plaintiffs were not required to use the word \u201cdemand.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All that is required is a communication that would reasonably be understood as a demand. We agree with plaintiffs that utilization of the more civil, polite term \u201crequest\u201d is more likely to secure the desired result of halting an unlawful expenditure than a more provocative \u201cdemand.\u201d After all, the apparent object of the statute is to halt unlawful expenditures, not to engender litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>We reject defendants\u2019 claim that the letters were insufficient because they failed to cite the statute. MCL 129.61 includes no requirement that the demand refer to the statute. Defendants also argue that plaintiffs\u2019 letters were insufficient to meet the demand requirement because the letters did not request either an accounting or the recovery of the funds expended. MCL 129.61 provides that a taxpayer may file a lawsuit \u201cfor an accounting and/or the recovery of funds or moneys misappropriated or unlawfully expended ....\u201d The statute, however, does not provide that the taxpayer\u2019s preliminary demand must specifically be for an accounting or the recovery of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Defendants further argue that plaintiffs\u2019 letters were insufficient to meet the demand requirement because they did not contain a sense of urgency, and plaintiffs did not act upon them by filing a lawsuit until almost three years later. But MCL 129.61 does not require that the demand be made with a \u201csense of urgency.\u201d Plaintiffs requested a halt to the expenditure of public funds \u201cat your earliest possible convenience.\u201d This phrase is a request that action be taken as soon as possible. It is sufficient especially because there is no requirement in the statute that the demand convey a sense of urgency.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">We also disagree with the Court of Appeals suggestion that MCL 129.61 requires a demand for litigation. The statute provides that before a taxpayer may institute a lawsuit, a demand must be made \u201con the public officer, board or commission whose duty it may be to maintain such suit\u201d for recovery of unlawfully expended funds. The statute does not expressly require that the demand be for a lawsuit. Further, just because the public body has the ultimate duty to bring a lawsuit if it is needed does not mean that the demand must be for a lawsuit. The taxpayer demand, at a minimum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>calls on a conscientious public body to reevaluate whether it is carrying out its duties properly and, in fact, this may result in the public body\u2019s acting in compliance with the demand. It may do this by any number of means, only one of which is to enter into litigation. In fact, when the statute uses the phrase \u201cwhose duty it <em>may be </em>to maintain such suit\u201d (emphasis added), it recognizes this. Moreover, the statute provides that after a demand, before the taxpayer may bring a suit, a precondition is that the public body must neglect or refuse \u201cto take action in relation thereto.\u201d This implies that the public body need not necessarily file suit, only that it needs to take some kind of action relating to the matter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We therefore conclude that the demand made in this matter was sufficient to satisfy MCL 129.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">IV CONSTITUTIONAL STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Having determined that plaintiffs\u2019 letters satisfied the requirements of MCL 129.61, we are required to decide whether plaintiffs have constitutional standing to pursue their lawsuit. That is, even though we have determined that plaintiffs are authorized by the Legislature to bring this lawsuit, we must determine whether the independent constitutional requirement of standing presents a separate bar to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>First, as we stated in <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">It is important, initially, to recognize that in Michigan, as in the federal system, standing is of great consequence so that neglect of it would imperil the constitutional architecture whereby governmental powers are divided between the three branches of government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of standing [is] a constitutional principle that prevents courts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches. It is the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 735-736, quoting <em>Lewis v Casey, </em>518 US 343, 349; 116 S Ct 2174; 135 L Ed 2d 606 (1996) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In <em>Lee </em>we adopted the test the United States Supreme Court uses to determine whether a federal court has standing to hear a lawsuit<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201c[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u201d \u2019 Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u2018fairly... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not... th[e] result [of] the independent action of. some third party not before the court.\u2019 Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Lee, supra </em>at 739, quoting <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555, 560-561; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992).][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">And, as we explained in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608, 622-623; 684 NW2d 800 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">If the Legislature were permitted at its discretion to confer jurisdiction upon this Court unmoored from any genuine case or controversy, this Court would be transformed in character and empowered to decide matters that have historically been within the purview of the Governor and the executive branch----Unless there is an individual who has personally been injured by the Governor\u2019s enforcement or administration of these laws, it is not normally the role of the judicial branch to monitor the work of the executive and determine whether it is carrying out its responsibilities in an acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>fashion. That the Legislature \u2014 perhaps even with the acquiescence of the executive \u2014 has purported to impose this role upon the judicial branch does not alter this constitutional reality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>we explained that but for a few enumerated exceptions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the definitions of \u201cjudicial power\u201d in the United States and Michigan constitutions are identical \u2014 both require an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is both concrete and particularized, as well as actual or imminent, in order to establish standing. <em>Id. </em>at 624-629. The Legislature may not confer jurisdiction upon the court \u201cunmoored from any genuine case or controversy ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622. If the Legislature were to do so, \u201cthis Court would be transformed in character and empowered to decide matters that have historically been within the purview of the Governor and the executive branch.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>We did, however, recognize in <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>that persons bringing qui tam actions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> were found to have standing by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v United States ex rel Stevens </em>529 US 765, 774-777; 120 S Ct 1858; 146 L Ed 2d 836 (2000). We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">Accordingly, the [ <em>Vermont </em>Agency] Court held that one who brings a relator suit has standing because he is the assignee of a claim and may assert the injury-in-fact suffered by the assignor, which is normally the government. <em>Id. </em>at 773. In such cases, the Court concluded, the government\u2019s injury-in-fact suffices to confer standing on the individual relators bringing the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 774.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">[T]he use of citizen suits or actions by private attorneys general does not undermine the application of traditional standing requirements. If anything, the use of such suits supports the application of those requirements, as citizen suits and actions by private attorneys general have always been grounded in a private injury, whether suffered directly or as a result of an assignment by another. <em>[Cleveland Cliffs, supra </em>at 646-647 (emphasis omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In sum, <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>holds that the Legislature may not confer standing on a party that does not otherwise meet the constitutional injury-in-fact test for standing. But, under <em>Vermont Agency, </em>the Legislature may create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>qui tam actions whereby a statute partially assigns the government\u2019s injury in fact claim to a private citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Thus, the question is whether MCL 129.61 creates a qui tam action or an action similar enough to a qui tam action to constitutionally confer standing. In arguing that MCL 129.61 does effectively create a qui tam action, the plaintiffs, drawing on <em>Vermont Agency, </em>point out the similarities between the federal False Claims Act at issue in <em>Vermont Agency, </em>31 USC 3729 to 3733, and MCL 129.61. These include, first, that both statutes allow a private citizen to bring a civil action on behalf of the government. Second, both statutes require the private citizen to give the government the opportunity to prosecute the claim on its own behalf, and, finally, that both statutes allow the citizen to go forward with the civil action if the government fails to do so. Yet, while the above similarities exist, the crucial difference between the False Claims Act and MCL 129.60 is that the False Claims Act gives a litigant a concrete private interest in the outcome of the suit, and thus constitutional standing, by providing a bounty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no similar provision in MCL 129.61, which has not only no bounty provision but no other mechanism that even conceivably could establish such a private interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">A second significant distinction between a typical qui tam action (like the one in <em>Vermont </em>Agency) and MCL 129.61 is that MCL 129.61 does not have a provision allowing the government to intervene and assume control of the suit. The <em>Vermont Agency </em>Court held that a qui tam relator under the federal False Claims Act has standing because he or she is properly considered a partial assignee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>to assert the injury in fact suffered by the government. This implies that the statute\u2019s assignment of claims must be partial rather than full to be valid.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because there is no assignment of any sort in MCL 129.61, this key aspect found in the False Claims Act is also missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Moreover, the state, again, unlike the federal government in a situation involving the False Claims Act, is not the real party in interest in a suit brought under MCL 129.61. Our statute does not require the plaintiff to follow procedural safeguards found in the False Claims Act as well as other modern qui tarn statutes to ensure that the government remains fully apprised of the litigation, has the opportunity to participate, and retains the power to make key decisions over the relator\u2019s objections.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>For these reasons then, we conclude that MCL 129.61 did not establish a qui tam action that would give plaintiffs constitutional standing to pursue their lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Plaintiffs argue in the alternative that even if MCL 129.61 does not establish a qui tam action, they nevertheless must have standing under <em>House Speaker v Governor, </em>443 Mich 560; 506 NW2d 190 (1993), because there the plaintiffs, who had no more of a claim to standing than plaintiffs in this case have, were found to have standing. We disagree. In <em>House Speaker, </em>the issue was whether the private nonprofit, corporate plaintiffs had standing to challenge the Governor\u2019s authority to transfer the powers of a legislatively created body to a new, gubernatorially created body. The Court, while acknowledging the general principle that standing requires a litigant to \u201c \u2018demonstrare] that [its] substantial interest will be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 572 (citation omitted), inexplicably neglected to actually apply that principle. What the Court did do, puzzlingly, was to conclude that because the civic groups met the requirements of MCR 2.201(B)(4),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a court rule that in essence gives qualifying persons or groups the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sue without an injury, they could sue. Yet, as <em>Lee </em>and <em>Cleveland </em>Cliffs made clear, no court rule or statute can eliminate the injury requirement for constitutional standing. Thus, <em>House Speaker </em>is not dispositive and is of limited value because the Court did not address whether the court rule (MCR 2.201) or the corresponding statute (MCL 600.2041) could constitutionally confer standing to an organization that did not have a concrete interest in the suit and did not suffer an injury in fact. To the extent one might read it as having silently done so, we disapprove of it as being inconsistent with <em>Lee </em>and <em>Cleveland Cliffs.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Plaintiffs admit that their injury is minute and generalized. Thus, it is not a concrete and particularized injury in fact. Indeed, any \u201cremedy\u201d they might obtain will not confer a financial benefit on them.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, any potential benefit plaintiffs might obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>if they prevailed in this lawsuit would not be any different than that which would be obtained by everyone else in the state. Under such circumstances, they do not have constitutional standing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">For all the reasons we have set forth, we conclude that although plaintiffs\u2019 demand under MCL 129.61 was sufficient, this statute is unconstitutional to the extent that it purports to confer standing on taxpayers who have not satisfied the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>standing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We reject that part of the Court of Appeals judgment that determined that plaintiffs\u2019 letters did not constitute a demand under MCL 129.61, but, on the basis that plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to sue, we affirm the lower court judgments that held that plaintiffs could not proceed with their lawsuit.

The circuit court did not reach the substantive issue but dismissed the suit, holding that the plaintiffs did not comply with the requirements of the statute that confers standing to sue, MCL 129.61. The Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling in a published opinion. <em>Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Schools, </em>265 Mich App 702; 698 NW2d 402 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">A majority of this Court has affirmed the Court of Appeals result on the basis that, although plaintiffs satisfied the statutory demand requirements, they lack constitutional standing to proceed with the suit. I disagree with the majority\u2019s standing analysis but agree with the decision to affirm, because I believe that plaintiffs did not satisfy the demand requirements of MCL 129.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Plaintiffs are 17 individuals who pay state and local taxes used to fund the Ann Arbor Public Schools (AAPS). Defendants are the AAPS, its board of education, the president of the board, and the treasurer of the board. Intervening defendant is the Ann Arbor Education Association (AAEA), the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the teachers and other school personnel of the AAPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In 2000, plaintiffs directed letters to the following public officials: (1) the Governor of the state of Michigan, (2) legal counsel for the Executive Office of the state of Michigan, (3) the Attorney General of the state of Michigan, (4) the Superintendent of Public Instruction in the state of Michigan, (5) the Assistant Superintendent of Public Instruction, (6) the Washtenaw County Prosecutor, (7) nine members of the AAPS board of education, and (8) the superintendent of the AAPS. All the letters read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>I [or We] write to request that you investigate and halt the use of public funds to provide so-called \u201cdomestic partnership\u201d benefits to employees of the Ann Arbor public schools. I [or We] believe that the School District\u2019s extension of these benefits to its employees exceeds its authority and violates the state law governing marriage. I [or We] ask that you halt this illegal use of public funds at your earliest convenience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The letters were sent by certified mail on December 15, 2000, and were received soon after. When no action was taken to halt the expenditure of public funds for benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of AAPS employees, plaintiffs brought suit in the Washtenaw Circuit Court under MCL 129.61. The crux of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that defendants improperly defined and recognized a new form of domestic relations and treated this relationship as the equivalent of marriage in violation of the Michigan defense of marriage act, MCL 555.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The circuit court did not reach the substantive issue, the validity of the domestic partner policy, but dismissed on the ground that plaintiffs did not have standing to sue under MCL 129.61. The court held that (1) plaintiffs had not sued on behalf of or for the benefit of the treasurer of the district as contemplated by the express language of MCL 129.61, and that (2) plaintiffs did not comply with the mandatory requirements of MCL 129.61 that they make a demand before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. It disagreed with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the suit was not filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>behalf of or for the benefit of the AAPS treasurer as required by MCL 129.61. However, the Court did agree that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the demand requirements of MCL 129.61. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">Pursuant to MCL 129.61, the party must contact the appropriate party (\u201cthe public officer, board, or commission whose duty it may be to maintain such suit\u201d) and make a demand that a lawsuit be brought by that party for an accounting or recovery of misappropriated funds. Consulting a dictionary to ascribe the term \u201cdemand\u201d its plain and ordinary meaning, we find that it provides the definition \u201cto ask for with proper authority; claim as a right.\u201d Moreover, the phrase \u201cmaintain such suit\u201d indicates that the purpose of the demand requirement is to inform the appropriate party that legal action is forthcoming. Plaintiffs\u2019 letters are merely a request that the alleged misappropriation stop; they are not a demand for legal action. Moreover, plaintiffs did not send a letter to the AAPS treasurer, the officer likely responsible for maintaining such a lawsuit. <em>[Rohde, </em>265 Mich App at 709-710 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Plaintiffs applied for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court, and we heard oral argument on what constitutes an effective demand under MCL 129.61. 474 Mich 1120 (2006). We then granted leave to appeal, requesting that the parties additionally brief the issue whether plaintiffs have standing under <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d 800 (2004). 477 Mich 924 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition. <em>Ostroth v Warren Regency, GP, LLC, </em>474 Mich 36, 40; 709 NW2d 589 (2006). This case involves a question of statutory interpretation, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>also reviewed de novo. <em>People v Tombs, </em>472 Mich 446, 451; 697 NW2d 494 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO SATISFY THE <em>DEMAND </em>REQUIREMENTS Of MCL 129.61</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The underlying issue in this case is whether the use of public funds for benefits to same-sex partners of public employees is illegal. But the issue before this Court on appeal is whether a request for an investigation and a halting of the use of funds for such benefits constitutes an effective demand under MCL 129.61. The Court of Appeals decided that it did not and, therefore, held that the circuit court had properly granted summary disposition to defendants. I agree with both lower courts\u2019 determination that plaintiffs have not satisfied the demand requirements of MCL 129.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">MCL 129.61 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">Any person or persons, firm or corporation, resident in any township or school district, paying taxes to such political unit, may institute suits or actions at law or in equity on behalf of or for the benefit of the treasurer of such political subdivision, for an accounting and/or the recovery of funds or moneys misappropriated or unlawfully expended by any public officer, board or commission of such political subdivision. Before such suit is instituted a demand shall be made on the public officer, board or commission whose duty it may be to maintain such suit followed by a neglect or refusal to take action in relation thereto. Security for costs shall be filed by the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any such suit or action and all costs and expenses of the same shall be paid by the person or persons instituting the same unless and until a recovery of such funds or moneys be obtained as the result of such proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The confusion in this case arises because the statute requires \u201ca demand ... on the public officer, board or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>commission whose duty it may be to maintain such suit followed by a neglect or refusal to take action in relation thereto\u201d but does not clearly define what action a plaintiff must demand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By reading the statute as a whole and giving effect to every word, phrase, and clause, however, this issue is easily resolved. See <em>Grimes v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>475 Mich 72, 89; 715 NW2d 275 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">MCL 129.61 authorizes a taxpayer to bring suit \u201cfor an accounting and/or the recovery of funds or moneys misappropriated or unlawfully expended.\u201d The statute requires that a demand be made on the party \u201cresponsible for maintaining such suit.\u201d The dictionary definition of \u201cdemand\u201d is \u201cto ask for with proper authority; claim as a right.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). It follows that, in order to make an effective demand, a plaintiff must ask the \u201cparty responsible for maintaining [the] suit\u201d to undertake the action that the suit would accomplish, which is \u201can accounting[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and/or the recovery of funds or moneys misappropriated or unlawfully expended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In this case, plaintiffs sent letters to the Attorney General, among others, requesting an investigation and a halting of the expenditure of future funds for benefits to same-sex partners of employees. The letters did not request any action with respect to past expenditures; it referred solely to the halting of future expenditures. Even assuming that those who received the letters included the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>proper party to maintain a suit, the demand requirement was still not satisfied. Plaintiffs never asked anyone, as MCL 129.61 requires, for an accounting of past expenditures or the recovery of funds wrongfully spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">Requiring plaintiffs to request the specific action that the suit would accomplish is consistent with the purpose of a demand requirement. The phrase \u201cbefore such suit is instituted\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended that the proper party be given notice and the first opportunity to act. See <em>Chicago ex rel Konstantelos v Duncan Traffic Equip Co, </em>95 Ill 2d 344, 353-354; 447 NE2d 789 (1983) (holding that the purpose of a demand requirement in taxpayer lawsuits is to allow the legislative body the first opportunity to decide whether to take the requested action). The letters involved in this case did not request the specific action that would be accomplished by the taxpayer suit. Hence, the proper party was not given the first opportunity to review the matter and decide on its own whether to take this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">THE STANDING ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">A majority of this Court decides that plaintiffs satisfied the demand requirements of MCL 129.61. But the majority affirms on the basis that plaintiffs do not have standing. Because I would hold that plaintiffs did not satisfy the demand requirements, the standing issue need not be pursued. I am compelled, however, to point out the flaws in the majority\u2019s analysis of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of </em>Commissioners,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this Court expressly adopted the standing test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lujan v Defend</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>ers of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The test has three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and Ob) \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u201cfairly... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d Third, it must be \u201clikely,\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cspeculative,\u201d that the injury will be \u201credressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>[Lee, </em>464 Mich at 739, quoting <em>Lujan, </em>504 US at 560-561.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In federal court, from which test articulated in <em>Lee </em>was derived, the general rule is that taxpayers do not have standing to object to a particular expenditure of funds. <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp v Cuno, </em>547 US 332; 126 S Ct 1854; 164 L Ed 2d 589 (2006). \u201cStanding has been rejected in such cases because the alleged injury is not \u2018concrete and particularized,\u2019 but instead a grievance the taxpayer \u2018suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>547 US at_; 126 S Ct at 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">However, exceptions to this general rule exist. The United States Supreme Court has found that the rule that taxpayers do not have standing to challenge a particular expenditure of funds does not apply to mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>nicipal taxpayers. In <em>Massachusetts v </em>Mellon,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court held that an individual\u2019s status as a federal taxpayer is insufficient to confer standing on that individual to challenge the constitutionality of federal action. <em>Mellon, </em>262 US at 487. But, the Court also held, that \u201c[t]he interest of a taxpayer of a municipality in the application of its moneys is direct and immediate and the remedy by injunction to prevent their misuse is not inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><em>Mellon </em>predates by several decades the United States Supreme Court\u2019s current three-part test for constitutional standing. Nevertheless, <em>Mellon </em>reconciles easily with the current standing inquiry. <em>Mellon </em>stands for the proposition that the economic injury of increased taxes suffered by a federal taxpayer is not enough to confer standing. By contrast, the allegedly illegal use of local tax dollars is a sufficiently direct and immediate injury to confer standing on municipal taxpayers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And although the United States Supreme Court has not subsequently specifically addressed the standing issue in connection with a municipal taxpayer, it has reiterated this federal/municipal distinction on several occasions, implicitly ratifying it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> E.g., <em>Cuno, </em>547 US at_; 126 S Ct at 1864-1865; <em>ASARCO v Radish, </em>490 US 605, 613; 109 S Ct 2037; 104 L Ed 2d 696 (1989); <em>Coleman v Miller, </em>307 US 433, 445; 59 S Ct 972; 83 L Ed 2d 1385 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Here, in deciding that plaintiffs, who pay local taxes, do not have constitutional standing to sue, the majority summarily rejects <em>Mellon </em>and its progeny. I believe that this is an error. These decisions are persuasive authority and deserve at least to be given serious consideration, if not followed. I am at a loss to explain why the majority previously advocated adopting the federal standing test, yet in this case the same justices summarily dismiss federal caselaw when applying the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s claims, I recognize that this Court is not bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mellon. </em>However, I point out that the majority ignores federal precedent in this case when it has followed in lockstep federal precedent in other recent standing cases. E.g., <em>Lee, </em>464 Mich at 740; <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>471 Mich at 628-629; <em>Michigan Chiropractic Council v Comm\u2019r of the Office of Financial &amp; Ins Services, </em>475 Mich 363, 377; 716 NW2d 561 (2006) (opinion by YOUNG, J.). I can see no reason why the majority would follow federal precedent in those cases but summarily dismiss it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The majority\u2019s assertion that it is simply following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller v Grandy </em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>raises other questions. To embrace that argument, the reader must accept that the majority has blindly embraced <em>Miller </em>as having been correctly decided, even though <em>Miller </em>conflicts with federal precedent. At the same time, the reader must accept that <em>House Speaker v Governor,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on which plaintiffs rely, should be overruled because the federal precedent from which <em>Lee </em>and <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>are derived is preferable to <em>House Speaker. </em>The majority should be consistent in its use of federal precedent. Or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>if not consistent, it should at least articulate a principled reason for rejecting <em>Mellon.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The majority affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals because plaintiffs do not have standing to sue. I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm, but I do so on separate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In order to make an effective demand under MCL 129.61, a plaintiff must ask the party responsible for maintaining the suit for an accounting or the recovery of unlawfully spent funds. Because, in this case, plaintiffs\u2019 letters requested only an investigation and the halting of the expenditure of future funds, plaintiffs failed to satisfy the demand requirements of MCL 129.61. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the circuit court decision granting summary disposition to defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> MCL 551.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">Marriage is inherently a unique relationship between a man and a woman.

As I explained above, the United States Supreme Court has stated on numerous occasions that <em>Mellon </em>established a federal/municipal distinction with respect to taxpayer standing. E.g., <em>Cuno, </em>547 US at_; 126 S Ct 1864-1865; <em>ASARCO, </em>490 US at 613; <em>Coleman, </em>307 US at 445. The Court does not treat the distinction as dictum. Given that the United States Supreme Court recognizes the distinction as a holding, it would seem that the majority would not characterize it as dictum. Also, the majority\u2019s position on this subject is inconsistent. By quoting <em>Mellon </em>for the proposition that a plaintiff must suffer a particularized injury, the members of the majority recognized, in <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>471 Mich at 615, 616, that the decision on the standing issue in <em>Mellon </em>was a holding. The members of the majority do not explain why they have changed their view here. Also, the fact that the United States Supreme Court recently recognized the distinction in <em>Cuno </em>illustrates an important point: federal courts today are of a mind that municipal taxpayers generally have standing to challenge an allegedly illegal expenditure of their tax dollars, whereas state and federal taxpayers do not. Considering that this Court\u2019s <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>standing test was derived from federal law, the United States Supreme Court position on standing should be persuasive when this Court applies Michigan\u2019s standing test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b412-4\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxZ\"><em>(concurring in the result only). </em>I concur only with the result reached by the majority because I do not agree with its rationale.

By basing its decision on faux constitutional principles of standing, the majority of four has further manipulated and eroded Michigan\u2019s traditional doctrine of standing. The majority\u2019s holding in this case is an example of the majority of four\u2019s misuse of the power of interpretation. The majority of four overturns long-established law to create new law, not based in our Michigan Constitution. I would hold that MCL 129.61 grants standing to parties when they meet the requirements set forth in the statute and that, because plaintiffs met the demand requirement of MCL 129.61, plaintiffs have standing to challenge the benefits offered by the Ann Arbor Public Schools. I would therefore reverse the Court of Appeals judgment holding that plaintiffs failed to meet the demand requirement of MCL 129.61. However, I would not remand this case to the trial court to decide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>substantive issues raised by plaintiffs. I would instead hold this case in abeyance for <em>Nat\u2019l Pride at Work, Inc v Governor, </em>a case in which this Court granted leave to appeal to determine whether public employers may offer benefits to same-sex partners of public employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Plaintiffs are individual taxpayers who filed suit under MCL 129.61 to compel defendant Ann Arbor Public Schools (AAPS) to halt the expenditure of public funds defendant used to provide benefits for same-sex domestic partners of school district employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plain-tiffs alleged that the expenditure of public funds to provide for same-sex domestic-partnership benefits violates MCL 551.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by recognizing same-sex relationships as the equivalent of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Before filing suit, plaintiffs sent letters by certified mail to various public officials,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> informing the public officials of the allegedly illegal activity. In the letters, plaintiffs stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">I [or We] write to request that you investigate and halt the use of public funds to provide so-called \u201cdomestic partnership\u201d benefits to employees of the Ann Arbor public schools. I [or We] believe that the School District\u2019s extension of these benefits to its employees exceeds its authority and violates the state law governing marriage. I [or We] ask that you halt this illegal use of public funds at your earliest possible convenience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">When no action was taken by the public officials, plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit. The trial court dismissed the case on motion for summary disposition, ruling that plaintiffs had failed to meet the requirements to bring a suit outlined in MCL 129.61.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the demand requirement of MCL 129.61.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Plaintiffs applied for leave to appeal in this Court, and we heard oral argument on whether to grant leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>appeal with respect to the issue of what constitutes an effective demand under MCL 129.61. See 474 Mich 1120 (2006). We then granted leave to appeal. 477 Mich 924 (2006). However, rather than asking the parties to brief only the issues decided in the lower courts, this Court also asked the parties to brief the issue whether MCL 129.61 could grant standing in light of the majority of four\u2019s holding in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron </em>Co.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">II. THE MAJORITY OF FOUR\u2019S ASSAULT ON STANDING IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The majority of four has taken this case, involving the important and controversial issue whether public employers can offer same-sex benefits to public employees, and turned it into a crucial step along its path toward the decimation of the traditional legal doctrine of standing in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Beginning with <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case involving the interpretation of MCL 35.21, the majority overruled Michigan precedent establishing prudential standing as the traditional doctrine of legal standing in Michigan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In place of Michigan\u2019s doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of prudential standing, the majority created for Michigan a constitutional doctrine of standing based on the federal courts\u2019 test for standing, as stated in <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>the majority of four, through lengthy dicta, attacked the Michigan Environmental Protection Act (MEPA) as unconstitutional, stating that MEPA granted too much power to the Court through its provision granting standing to any person.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Meanwhile, the majority held that the plaintiffs in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife </em>had standing because they met the federal constitutional standing doctrine adopted by the majority in <em>Lee. </em>Thus, despite the lengthy discourse by the majority on the subject, the issue whether the Legislature could grant standing to any citizen, under the test adopted by <em>Lee, </em>remained unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In my <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife </em>concurrence, I stated that by writing such extensive dicta on the subject of citizen-suit standing in a highly publicized case: \u201cThe majority can wait for a future case that has not drawn public attention to openly and directly declare the MEPA citizen-suit standing provision unconstitutional.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Although the underlying substantive issue of same-sex benefits in the instant case has stirred up controversy and publicity, the issue has already been decided by the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of Appeals in <em>Nat\u2019l Pride at Work, </em>an appeal that we will review in the coming term. Thus, for all practical purposes, the majority\u2019s procedural opinion in this case changes nothing for either side in the debate over same-sex benefits. By deciding that the Legislature cannot grant standing in this case, however, the majority has managed to slip in a major blow to Michigan\u2019s traditional doctrine of standing. The majority can now use this holding to declare that statutes such as MEPA unconstitutionally grant standing to citizens, and to avoid the inevitable firestorm that would follow by directly holding so in a case in which the opinion actually has significance to the parties involved. See <em>Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc, </em>479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007), in which the majority indeed applies the holding in this case to declare that MEPA unconstitutionally grants standing to citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Today, the majority not only declares that the Legislature cannot constitutionally grant standing to citizens, it does so by extensively quoting its dicta from <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife. </em>As the majority in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife </em>admitted, its discussion of the Legislature\u2019s ability to grant standing was \u201csimply dicta.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s manipulation of dicta to create quotable references designed to affect future holdings is truly indicative of the majority\u2019s assault on Michigan\u2019s traditional, prudential doctrine of standing. Starting with Lee, the majority set the stage to create its standing doctrine, slipping in pieces of dicta along the way in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>all so that it could quote itself in future opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The majority has manipulated its own opinions to create its own doctrine of law for standing in Michigan by overruling precedent and by replacing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>precedent with a doctrine it characterizes as being based on the Michigan Constitution. By making standing a constitutional concern, the majority has taken the area of legal standing out of the hands of the Legislature and the people and placed it exclusively at this majority\u2019s mercy. To make standing a constitutional concern when our Michigan Constitution is completely silent regarding which of the government\u2019s branches has power to grant standing represents judicial activism of the most objectionable sort. A power that was once available to all citizens of Michigan, the power to bring a lawsuit, can now only be reclaimed by constitutional amendment. The majority has created its own definition of \u201cjudicial power,\u201d based on the case-or-controversy <em>limitations of the judicial power </em>specifically enumerated by the United States Constitution for the federal courts,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and adopted it as some type of inherent quality of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The majority interjects the term \u201ccase-or-controversy\u201d into the Michigan Constitution in order to conclude that MCL 129.61 is unconstitutional. By interjecting the term \u201ccase or controversy\u201d into the Michigan Constitution, the majority obscures the plain language of the most important document in Michigan\u2019s legal system. Further, the majority holds a statute unconstitutional when, as this Court has long recognized, this Court must presume that the Legislature would not violate the constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The majority is adopting a term it infers from the Michigan Constitution and using that inference as a means to defeat the presumption of constitutionality inherent in all Michigan legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>As the majority points out, <em>ante </em>at 353-354, before the decision in <em>Lee, </em>this Court did not address standing as a constitutionally based test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The majority correctly states that in <em>House Speaker v Governor, </em>this Court concluded \u201cthat because the civic groups met the requirements of MCR 2.201(B)(4),[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] a court rule that in essence gives qualifying persons or groups the right to sue without an injury, they could sue.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 353-354. While the majority may find it \u201cinexplicabl[e]\u201d or \u201cpuzzling[ ]\u201d that this Court in <em>House Speaker </em>would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>use such an analysis to give citizens standing,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it is a puzzle that does not require much thought to solve and explain. This Court applied MCR 2.201(B)(4) in <em>House Speaker </em>because, at that time, Michigan followed a prudential standing test, rather than a constitutionally based standing test created by the majority of four. Court rules and statutes could, at that time, be used to grant standing even when the plaintiffs did not suffer a concrete injury to themselves or their representatives.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The majority in <em>Lee </em>overruled the traditional prudential standing doctrine and instead creatively adopted for Michigan the federal constitutional standing test, despite no relevant change in the Michigan Constitution or applicable Michigan codified law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In fact, in <em>Miller v Grandy,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an 1865 case cited by the majority for the proposition that taxpayers in Michigan do not have standing to sue, this Court applied the traditional prudential standing test. Until <em>Lee, </em>this Court analyzed standing without resorting to the Michigan Constitution, even though the Michigan Constitution has always included reference to the courts\u2019 \u201cjudicial power\u201d that the majority now cites as support for its creative conclusion that an implied constitutional power to determine standing belongs only to the judicial branch.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The most important difference between pre-Lee and post-Lee standing doctrine is that, post-Lee, standing is now a constitutional concern. Regardless of what stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ing test was used before <em>Lee </em>was decided, standing was never grounded in the Michigan Constitution. The Legislature could always confer standing on citizens without concern for violating the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">For the reasons stated, I cannot agree with the majority that MCL 129.61 unconstitutionally grants standing to citizens, because I cannot agree that standing is rooted in the Michigan Constitution. The majority has gone too far in creating its own standing test as a constitutional test. It has taken away a valuable power from the Legislature and the people of Michigan. I believe that, even when a plaintiff does not meet the three-part test adopted by the majority in <em>Lee, </em>the Legislature is not barred by the Michigan Constitution from granting standing to that plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">III. PLAINTIFFS SATISFIED MCL 129.61</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">While I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that plaintiffs lack constitutional standing, I agree with and concur in the majority\u2019s analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 compliance with the requirements outlined in MCL 129.61, contained in part III of the majority opinion, in which the majority holds that plaintiffs satisfied the demand requirement of MCL 129.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\"><em>IV. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">I would hold that MCL 129.61 grants standing to parties when they meet the requirements set forth in the statute and that, because plaintiffs met the demand requirement of MCL 129.61, plaintiffs have standing to challenge the benefits offered by defendant Ann Arbor Public Schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>I would reverse the Court of Appeals judgment that plaintiffs failed to meet the demand requirement of MCL 129.61.1 would not remand this case to the trial court to decide the substantive issues raised by plaintiffs. I would instead hold this case in abeyance for <em>Nat\u2019l Pride at Work, </em>a case in which this Court will determine whether public employers may offer benefits to same-sex partners of public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The holding by the majority in this case is a. victory for neither side in the contentious debate over the constitutionality of same-sex benefits for public employees. Rather, it is a defeat for all the people of Michigan, who now have to contend with the majority\u2019s unrestrained decision that the Legislature cannot grant legal standing to the citizens of this state.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> <em>Nat\u2019l Pride at Work, Inc v Governor, </em>478 Mich 862 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> MCL 129.61 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Any person or persons, firm or corporation, resident in any township or school district, paying taxes to such political unit, may institute suits or actions at law or in equity on behalf of or for the benefit of the treasurer of such political subdivision, for an accounting and/or the recovery of funds or moneys misappropriated or unlawfully expended by any public officer, hoard or commission of such political subdivision.

The <em>Lee </em>majority, quoting <em>Lujan, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201cFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u201d \u2019 Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u2018fairly... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019 Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Lee, supra </em>at 739, quoting <em>Lujan, supra </em>at 560-561.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The <em>Lee </em>majority adopted the <em>Lujan </em>test as a constitutionally based test for standing, under a theory that Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, which vests the state courts with \u201cjudicial power,\u201d granted the Michigan judicial branch only the same limited judicial power bestowed on the federal courts under article III of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\"> The majority concluded that MEPA was granting the judiciary the \u201cexecutive power\u201d to enforce laws, expanding the judiciary\u2019s power beyond the constitutional \u201cjudicial power.\u201d While the majority feigned judicial restraint, it was in truth engaging in judicial activism. The majority based its analysis on its self-adopted definition of the term \u201cjudicial power,\u201d a term contained in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. The Michigan Constitution does not define \u201cjudicial power,\u201d so the majority turned to federal law for a definition; specifically the majority relied on article III of the United States Constitution. But the majority of four\u2019s statement in <em>Michigan Chiropractic Council v Comm\u2019r of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Office of Financial &amp; Ins Services, </em>475 Mich 363, 369; 716 NW2d 561 (2006), reveals the United States Constitution\u2019s key variation from the Michigan Constitution. The majority stated: \u201cOur tripartite system of government is constitutionally established in both our state and federal constitutions. US Const, art III, \u00a7 1 confers upon the' courts only \u2018judicial power\u2019; US Const, art III, \u00a7 2 limits the judicial power to \u2018Mases\u2019 and \u2018Montroversies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The problem with the majority\u2019s comparison between the Michigan Constitution and the federal constitution is that only US Const, art III, \u00a7 2 sets out a case-or-controversy limitation. Similar to that contained in the Michigan Constitution, the general idea of judicial power contained in US Const, art III, \u00a7 1 is very broad. It is then specifically limited by US Const, art III, \u00a7 2. The Michigan Constitution contains no corresponding limitation. Thus, the majority misinterprets what the general federal judicial power entails, and instead defines the power by its own limitations set out in a subsequent section of the federal constitution. To make matters worse, the majority then defines Michigan\u2019s judicial power by the federal limitations, even though the Michigan Constitution lacks a similar limitation. The result is the majority\u2019s self-created, inferred case-or-controversy standard governing standing in Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\"> <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, supra </em>at 653-654 (Weaver, J., concurring in the result only).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, supra </em>at 649 n 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\"> See n 11 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\"> <em>People v McQuillan, </em>392 Mich 511, 536; 221 NW2d 569 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\"> As I wrote in my concurrence in <em>Lee:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">In <em>House Speaker </em>we stated that \u201cthis Court is not bound to follow federal cases regarding standing,\u201d pointing out that \u201c[o]ne notable distinction between federal and state standing analysis is the power of this Court to issue advisory opinions.
