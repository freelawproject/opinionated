A jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>found in favor of plaintiffs. Pursuant to MCR 7.305(B), the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas certified the following question to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">Whether, under Michigan law, Ford, as owner of the property on which asbestos-containing products were located, owed to Carolyn Miller, who was never on or near that property, a legal duty specified in the jury charge submitted by the trial court,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] to protect her from exposure to any asbestos fibers carried home on the clothing of a member of Carolyn Miller\u2019s household who was working on that property as the employee of an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Having granted the request to answer the certified question, and having heard oral argument, we answer the question in the negative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Michigan law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Ford, as the owner of the property on which asbestos-containing products were located, did not owe to Carolyn Miller, who was never on or near that property, a legal duty to protect her from exposure to any asbestos fibers carried home on the clothing of a member of her household who was working on that property as the employee of independent contractors, where there was no further relationship between defendant and Miller. Having answered the certified question, we now return the matter to the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas for such further proceedings as that court deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Plaintiffs allege that the decedent, Carolyn Miller, died from mesothelioma, an incurable and fatal form of lung cancer, that she contracted from washing the work clothes of her stepfather, Cleveland \u201cJohn\u201d Roland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From 1954 through 1965, Roland worked for independent contractors who were hired on various occasions by defendant to reline the interiors of blast furnaces used to melt iron ore at the Ford Rouge plant in Dearborn, Michigan. Plaintiffs allege that the materials used to reline the interiors of the blast furnaces contained asbestos. There is no dispute that Miller was never on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>near defendant\u2019s premises. Miller was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 1999 and died in 2000. After the Texas trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, a Texas jury awarded plaintiffs $9.5 million for Carolyn Miller\u2019s death on the basis of a theory of negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, defendaht filed an appeal in the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas. At defendant\u2019s request and over plaintiffs\u2019 objections, the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas certified the above-quoted question to this Court. We granted the request to answer the question and heard oral argument. 477 Mich 1277 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Whether a defendant owes a duty to a plaintiff to avoid negligent conduct is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Dyer v Trachtman, </em>470 Mich 45, 49; 679 NW2d 311 (2004), citing <em>Simko v Blake, </em>448 Mich 648, 655; 532 NW2d 842 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">A. LEGAL DUTY IN GENERAL</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">There is no dispute among the parties that the substantive law of Michigan governs plaintiffs\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Michigan, \u201cthe question whether the defendant owes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>an actionable legal duty to the plaintiff is one of law which the court decides after assessing the competing policy considerations for and against recognizing the asserted duty.\u201d <em>Friedman v Dozorc, </em>412 Mich 1, 22; 312 NW2d 585 (1981). That is, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[d]uty\u201d is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buczkowski v McKay, </em>441 Mich 96, 100-101; 490 NW2d 330 (1992), quoting <em>Friedman, supra </em>at 22 n 9, quoting Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 53, pp 325-326.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the ultimate inquiry in determining whether a legal duty should be imposed is whether the social benefits of imposing a duty outweigh the social costs of imposing a duty. The inquiry involves considering, among any other relevant considerations, \u201c \u2018the relationship of the parties, the foreseeability of the harm, the burden on the defendant, and the nature of the risk presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dyer, supra </em>at 49, quoting <em>Murdock v Higgins, </em>454 Mich 46, 53; 559 NW2d 639 (1997), citing <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The most important factor to be considered is the relationship of the parties. \u201c[A] duty arises out of the existence of a relationship \u2018between the parties of such a character that social policy justifies\u2019 its imposition.\u201d <em>Dyer, supra </em>at 49, quoting Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 56, p 374. \u201c \u2018The determination of whether a legal duty exists is a question of whether the relationship between the actor and the plaintiff gives rise to any legal obligation on the actor\u2019s part to act for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of the subsequently injured person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 101 n 5, quoting <em>Rodriguez v Sportsmen\u2019s Congress, </em>159 Mich App 265, 270; 406 NW2d 207 (1987). \u201cThe duty to protect others against harm from third persons is based on a relationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 103, citing Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 56, p 385. \u201cOnly if the law recognizes a duty to act with due care arising from the relationship of the parties does it subject the defendant to liability for negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Friedman, supra </em>at 22. \u201cDuty... \u2018concerns \u201cthe problem of the relation between individuals which imposes upon one a legal obligation for the benefit of the other.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 100, quoting <em>Friedman, supra </em>at 22, quoting Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 53, p 324. See also <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 100 (referring to \u201cduty\u201d as \u201cthe relational obligation between the plaintiff and the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In <em>Dyer, </em>this Court focused exclusively on the relationship between the parties to determine whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty. We concluded that because there was only a limited relationship between the parties, only a limited duty could be imposed on the defendant. More specifically, we concluded that because there was only a limited relationship between the defendant physician performing the independent medical examination (IME) and the plaintiff patient, the physician only owed a limited duty to the patient, i.e., a duty to perform an IME in a manner not causing physical harm to the patient. In reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>this decision, we explained that \u201cthe duty of care in a medical malpractice action has its basis in the relationship between the physician and the patient.\u201d <em>Dyer, supra </em>at 50. Because we found that only a limited relationship existed, we did not even address the other factors, i.e., the foreseeability of the harm, the burden on the defendant, or the nature of the risk presented. Consideration of the other factors was unnecessary because when there is only a limited relationship between the parties, only a limited duty can be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In <em>Buczkowski, </em>this Court similarly focused exclusively on the relationship between the parties to determine whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty. We concluded that because there was no relationship between the parties, no duty could be imposed on the defendant. More specifically, this Court concluded that because there was no relationship between the retailer who sold the shotgun ammunition to the intoxicated customer and the bystander who was injured by the use of the ammunition, the retailer owed no duty to the bystander. We explained, \u201cOur ultimate decision turns on whether a sufficient relationship exists between a retailer and a third party to impose a duty under these circumstances.\u201d <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 103. Because we found that no relationship existed, we again did not even address the other factors. This was unnecessary because when there is no relationship between the parties, no duty can be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On the other hand, even when there is a relationship between the parties, a legal duty does not necessarily exist. In order to determine whether a duty exists, the other enumerated factors must also be considered. The foreseeability of the harm is one of these. Just as the existence of a relationship between the parties is not dispositive, that the harm was foreseeable is also not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>dispositive. A defendant does not have a duty to protect everybody from all foreseeable harms. Although foreseeability is a factor to be considered, \u201cother considerations may be, and usually are, more important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201c[T]he mere fact that an event may be foreseeable does not impose a duty upon the defendant to take some kind of action accordingly. The event which he perceives might occur must pose some sort of risk of injury to another person or his property before the actor may be required to act. Also, to require the actor to act, some sort of relationship must exist between the actor and the other party which the law or society views as sufficiently strong to require more than mere observation of the events which unfold on the part of the defendant. It is the fact of existence of this relationship which the law usually refers to as a duty on the part of the actor.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>quoting <em>Samson v Saginaw Professional Bldg, Inc, </em>393 Mich 393, 406; 224 NW2d 843 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">When the harm is not foreseeable, no duty can be imposed on the defendant. But when the harm is foreseeable, a duty still does not necessarily exist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">To summarize, in determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a plaintiff, competing policy factors must be considered. Such considerations include the relationship of the parties, the foreseeability of the harm, the burden that would be imposed on the defendant, and the nature of the risk presented. Where there is no relationship between the parties, no duty can be imposed, but where there is a relationship, the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>factors must be considered to determine whether a duty should be imposed. Likewise, where the harm is not foreseeable, no duty can be imposed, but where the harm is foreseeable, other factors must be considered to determine whether a duty should be imposed. Before a duty can be imposed, there must be a relationship between the parties and the harm must have been foreseeable. Once it is determined that there is a relationship and that the harm was foreseeable, the burden that would be imposed on the defendant and the nature of the risk presented must be assessed to determine whether a duty should be imposed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">B. DUTY WITH REGARD TO ASBESTOS LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Because this Court has never addressed whether property owners owe a duty to protect people who have never been on or near their property from exposure to asbestos carried home on a household member\u2019s clothing, it is helpful to review the decisions of other courts that have addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In <em>CSX Transportation, Inc v Williams, </em>278 Ga 888, 891; 608 SE2d 208 (2005), the Supreme Court of Georgia, answering a certified question from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, held that \u201can employer does not owe a duty of care to a third-party, non-employee, who comes into contact with its employee\u2019s asbestos-tainted work clothing at locations away from the workplace.\u201d That court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201c \u2018[I]n fixing the bounds of duty, not only logic and science, but policy play an important role.\u2019 However, it must also be recognized that there is a responsibility to consider the larger social consequences of the notion of duty and to correspondingly tailor that notion so that the illegal consequences of wrongs are limited to a controllable degree. The recognition of a common-law cause of action under the circumstances of this case would, in our opinion, expand traditional tort concepts beyond manageable bounds and create an almost infinite universe of potential plaintiffs. Accordingly, we decline to promulgate a policy which would extend the common law so as to bring the ... plaintiff[s] within a class of people whose interests are entitled to protection from the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 890, quoting <em>Widera v Ettco Wire &amp; Cable Corp, </em>204 AD2d 306, 307-308; 611 NYS2d 569 (1994) (other citations omitted).][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In <em>In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, 5 </em>NY3d 486; 806 NYS2d 146; 840 NE2d 115 (2005), New York\u2019s highest court held that the defendant owed no duty to the defendant\u2019s employee\u2019s wife, who was allegedly injured from exposure to asbestos the employee introduced into the family home on soiled work clothes that the plaintiff wife laundered. That court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201c\u00a1Tjn determining whether a duty exists, courts must be mindful of the precedential, and consequential, future effects of their rulings, and limit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree\u201d____\u201cForeseeability, alone, does not define duty____\u201d ... A specific duty is required because otherwise, a defendant would be subjected \u201cto limitless liabiliiy to an indeterminate class of persons conceivably injured\u201d by its negligent acts.... \u201cMoreover, any extension of the scope of duty must be tailored to reflect accurately the extent that its social benefits outweigh its costs.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 493, quoting <em>Hamilton v Beretta USA Corp, </em>96 NY2d 222, 232; 727 NYS2d 7; 750 NE2d 1055 (2001) (other citations and internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The court was concerned about \u201climitless liability\u201d and questioned why, if a duty was owed to an employee\u2019s spouse, a duty would not also be owed to the employee\u2019s babysitter or an employee of a neighborhood laundry. <em>In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, supra </em>at 498.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">[W]e must consider the likely consequences of adopting the expanded duty urged by plaintiffs. While logic might suggest (and plaintiffs maintain) that the incidence of asbestos-related disease allegedly caused by the kind of secondhand exposure at issue in this case is rather low, experience counsels that the number of new plaintiffs\u2019 claims would not necessarily reflect that reality. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The court explained, \u201c[T]he \u2018specter of limitless liability\u2019 is banished only when \u2018the class of potential plaintiffs to whom the duty is owed is circumscribed by the relationship.\u2019 Here, there is no relationship between the [defendant] and [the defendant\u2019s employee\u2019s wife].\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Hamilton, supra </em>at 233. The court held that because there was no relationship between the defendant and the defendant\u2019s employee\u2019s wife, no duty could be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">In <em>Adams v Owens-Illinois, Inc, </em>119 Md App 395; 705 A2d 58 (1998), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals held that the defendant did not owe a duty to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>defendant\u2019s employee\u2019s wife who was allegedly exposed to asbestos from her husband\u2019s clothes. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">If liability for exposure to asbestos could be premised on Mary Wild\u2019s handling of her husband\u2019s clothing, presumably Bethlehem would owe a duty to others who came in close contact with Edwin Wild, including other family members, automobile passengers, and co-workers. Bethlehem owed no duty to strangers based upon providing a safe workplace for employees. <em>[Id. </em>at 411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In <em>Zimko v American Cyanamid, </em>905 So 2d 465, 482 (La App, 2005), the Louisiana Court of Appeals, \u201crecognizing] the novelty of the duty,\u201d held that the defendant owed a duty to the defendant\u2019s employee\u2019s son who was allegedly exposed to asbestos from his father\u2019s work clothes that he brought home. However, the Louisiana court relied exclusively on a New York intermediate appellate court decision that was subsequently reversed by New York\u2019s highest court. As explained by New York\u2019s highest court, \u201cThe <em>[Zimko] </em>court summarized [New York\u2019s intermediate appellate court\u2019s] decision . . . and, without providing an independent analysis, concluded that the father\u2019s employer owed a duty of care to the son.\u201d <em>In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, supra </em>at 496. Because the court in <em>Zimko </em>relied exclusively on a decision that has since been reversed, we do not find <em>Zimko </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">After New York\u2019s highest court reversed the decision by New York\u2019s intermediate appellate court in <em>In re New York City of Asbestos Litigation, </em>the Louisiana Court of Appeals reaffirmed its decision in <em>Zimko. Chaisson v Avondale Industries, Inc, </em>947 So 2d 171 (La App, 2006). However, \"(Louisiana relies more heavily upon foreseeability in its duty/risk analysis . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182. Unlike Louisiana, Michigan relies more on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>relationship between the parties than foreseeability in determining whether a duty exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In addition, in Louisiana, unlike in Michigan, \u201ca \u2018no duty\u2019 defense in a negligence case is seldom appropriate,\u201d <em>Zimko, supra </em>at 482; \u201cresolution of a negligence case based on a finding that a defendant has \u2018no duty\u2019 should be reserved for the exceptional situation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 482-483, such as \u201ccases involving \u2018failure to act, injuries to unborn victims, negligently inflicted mental anguish or purely economic harm unaccompanied by physical trauma to the claimant or his property,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 482 n 19 (citation and emphasis omitted). In Michigan, however, \u201c[o]nly if the law recognizes a duty to act with due care arising from the relationship of the parties does it subject the defendant to liability for negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Friedman, supra </em>at 22. See also <em>Murdock, supra </em>at 53 (\u201cOnly after finding that a duty exists may the fact-finder determine whether, in light of the particular facts of the case, there was a breach of the duty.\u201d). For these reasons, we do not find <em>Chaisson </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In <em>Olivo v Owens-Illinois, Inc, </em>186 NJ 394; 895 A2d 1143 (2006), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that if the defendant owed a duty to the worker, the defendant owed a duty to the wife of the worker who was exposed to asbestos when she washed the clothes of her husband, who was hired by an independent contractor to perform work at the defendant\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>as explained by the New York Court of Appeals, <em>\u201cOlivo </em>is distinguishable legally in that New Jersey, unlike New York, relies heavily on foreseeability in its duty analysis.\u201d <em>In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, supra </em>at 497. In <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 402, the New Jersey Supreme Court described \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d as \u201c \u2018 \u201ca crucial element in determining whether imposition of a duty on an alleged tortfeasor is appropriate.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) It further explained that, \u201cin respect of a landowner\u2019s liability, whether a duty of care can be owed to one who is injured from a dangerous condition on the premises, to which the victim is exposed off-premises, devolves to a question of foreseeability of the risk of harm to that individual or identifiable class of individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. However, as explained above, Michigan, like New York, relies more on the relationship between the parties than foreseeability of harm when determining whether a duty exists.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For this reason, we do not find <em>Olivo </em>persuasive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>C. APPLICATION TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">As explained above, under Michigan law, the ultimate inquiry in determining whether a legal duty should be imposed is whether the social benefits of imposing a duty outweigh the social costs of imposing that duty.

We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">[W]e have on occasion allowed for the development of the common law as circumstances and considerations of public policy have required. But as Justice YOUNG has recently observed, our common-law jurisprudence has been guided by a number of prudential principles.

Among them has been our attempt to \u201cavoid capricious departures from bedrock legal rules as such tectonic shifts might produce unforeseen and undesirable consequences,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 307, a principle that is quite applicable to the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Plaintiffs have asked us to recognize a cause of action that departs drastically from our traditional notions of a valid negligence claim.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] Beyond this enormous shift in our tort jurisprudence, judicial recognition of plaintiffs\u2019 claim may also have undesirable effects that neither we nor the parties can satisfactorily predict.

Plaintiffs are correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that under the \u201cinherently dangerous activity\u201d doctrine, property owners may owe a duty to a person who has never been on their property even though they owe no duty to their employees or the employees of their independent contractors. <em>DeShambo v Anderson, </em>471 Mich 27, 38; 684 NW2d 332 (2004).

In addition, the \u201cinherently dangerous activity\u201d doctrine only applies to persons on the defendant\u2019s property, passing by the property, or on neighboring property. See <em>Detroit v Corey, </em>9 Mich 165 (1861) (a passerby fell into a ditch); <em>Darmstaetter v Moynahan, </em>27 Mich 188 (1873) (a passerby ran into a wall of ice); <em>McWilliams v Detroit Central Mills Co, </em>31 Mich 274 (1875) (a passerby was run over by a railroad car); <em>Rogers v Parker, </em>159 Mich 278; 123 NW 1109 (1909) (a fire spread to neighboring land); <em>Inglis v Millersburg Driving Ass\u2019n, </em>169 Mich 311; 136 NW 443 (1912) (a fire spread to the plaintiffs adjoining land); <em>Olah v Katz, </em>234 Mich 112; 207 NW 892 (1926) (a neighbor\u2019s child fell in a hole); <em>Wight v H G Christman Co, </em>244 Mich 208; 221 NW 314 (1928) (sparks from a steam shovel started an adjacent house on fire); <em>Watkins v Gabriel Steel Co, </em>260 Mich 692; 245 NW 801 (1932) (a worker fell from third story as a result of improperly fastened steel joists); <em>Tillson v Consumers Power Co, </em>269 Mich 53; 256 NW 801 (1934) (excavation on property caused damage to an adjacent property); <em>Grinnell v Carbide &amp; Carbon Chemicals Corp, </em>282 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>509; 276 NW 535 (1937) (a boat exploded, seriously injuring its passengers); <em>Barlow v Krieghoff Co, </em>310 Mich 195; 16 NW2d 715 (1944) (a child fell into a bucket of hot tar on an adjacent lot); <em>McDonough v Gen Motors Corp, </em>388 Mich 430; 201 NW2d 609 (1972) (a boom fell on a worker); see also <em>DeShambo, supra, </em>at 33 (\u201c \u2018 \u201c[A] man who orders a work to be executed, from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences <em>to his neighbor </em>must be expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be averted, is bound to see the doing of that which is necessary to prevent mischief, and cannot relieve himself of his responsibility by employing some one else.\u201d \u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted; emphasis in the original); Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 71, p 514 (inherently dangerous activity doctrine is limited to activity that poses a \u201cspecific risk or set of risks to <em>those in the </em>vicinity\u201d) (emphasis added).

Here, the work contracted for was the relining of blast furnaces.

For these reasons, the \u201cinherently dangerous activity doctrine\u201d does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">rv. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In Michigan, \u201cthe question whether the defendant owes an actionable legal duty to the plaintiff is one of law which the court decides after assessing the competing policy considerations for and against recognizing the asserted duty.\u201d <em>Friedman, supra </em>at 22. The social benefits of imposing a duty must outweigh the social costs of doing so. The inquiry involves considering, among any other relevant considerations: \u201c \u2018the relationship of the parties, the foreseeability of the harm, the burden on the defendant, and the nature of the risk presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dyer, supra </em>at 49, quoting <em>Murdock, supra </em>at 53, citing <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 100. However, the most important factor pertains to the relationship between the parties. Because any relationship between Miller and defendant was highly tenuous, the harm was, in all likelihood, not foreseeable, the burden on defendant would be onerous and unworkable, and the imposition of a duty, under these circumstances, would \u201c \u2018expand traditional tort concepts beyond manageable bounds and create an almost infinite universe of potential plaintiffs,\u2019 \u201d <em>CSX Transportation, supra </em>at 890 (citation omitted), we conclude that a legal duty should not be imposed. For these reasons, we answer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>certified question in the negative. That is, we hold that, under Michigan law, defendant, as owner of the property on which asbestos-containing products were located, did not owe to the deceased, who was never on or near that property, a legal duty to protect her from exposure to any asbestos fibers carried home on the clothing of a member of her household who was working on that property as the employee of independent contractors, where there was no further relationship between defendant and the deceased. Having answered the certified question, we now return the matter to the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas for such further proceedings as that court deems appropriate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"> The jury was asked to decide whether defendant was negligent and was instructed that \u201c[n]egligence is the failure to use ordinary care.\u201d Therefore, the legal duty specified in the jury charge submitted by the trial corut was the duty to use ordinary care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> Justice Weaver restates her belief that this Court lacks the authority to answer certified questions, but she has not prevailed on this issue. See, e.g., <em>In re Certified Question (Kenneth Henes Special Projects Procurement v Continental Biomass Industries, Inc), </em>468 Mich 109; 659 NW2d 597 (2003); <em>In re Certified Question (Wayne Co v Philip Morris, Inc), </em>465 Mich 537, 543-545; 638 NW2d 409 (2002), involving certified questions in which Justice Weaver participated in this Court\u2019s substantive decisions. For one justice\u2019s response to Justice Weaver\u2019s constitutional arguments, see <em>In re Certified Question (Melson v Prime Ins Syndicate, Inc), </em>472 Mich 1225, 1231-1242 (2005) (Markman, J., dissenting). Moreover, we see no constitutional distinction in whether a certified question has come to this Court from another state\u2019s supreme court or from its court of appeals. See MCR 7.305(B) (allowing this Court to consider certified questions from a \u201cfederal court, state appellate court, or tribal court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Concerning Justice Cavanagh\u2019s solicitude for Justice Young\u2019s \u201cconstitutional conscience,\u201d <em>post </em>at 526, Justice Young, like Justice Weaver, has written that this Court lacks the authority to answer certified questions, but his position did not carry the day. See <em>Melson, supra </em>at 1226 (Young, J., concurring). Five justices, including Justice Cavanagh, disagreed. Just as Justice Cavanagh is within his rights as a supporter of certified questions not to answer a certified question in a particular case (his position here), Justice Young as an opponent of certified questions is within his rights to answer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>certified question, because this is now a part of our state\u2019s \u201cjudicial power.\u201d Indeed, Justice Young has previously answered certified questions and, in fact, authored a majority opinion responding to a certified question. <em>Kenneth Henes, supra. </em>Justice Young also joined Justice Cavanagh\u2019s opinion in <em>Wayne Co, supra. </em>This is obviously all well known to Justice Cavanagh, who made no similar objections to Justice Young\u2019s participation in these previous cases in which he and Justice Young were in agreement on the results. In respecting that the law is the law even where he disagrees with that law, Justice Young\u2019s determination to respect the majority position of this Court and to participate in certified questions is the only honorable position that could be taken by a justice of this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> Plaintiffs are the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate and the decedent\u2019s stepfather, husband, daughter, and mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\"> The jury awarded Miller\u2019s estate $4.5 million and Miller\u2019s husband, daughter, and mother a total of $5 million for Miller\u2019s death.

First, these statements immediately follow the statement that \u201c[ajctionable negligence presupposes the existence of a legal relationship between parties by which the injured party is owed a duty by the other, and such duty must be imposed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260-261. Although Justice Cavanagh quotes this sentence, he fails to give it any meaning. Second, the Court subsequently addressed whether a relationship existed between the parties before it concluded that a duty was owed. Therefore, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 and Justice Cavanagh\u2019s suggestion, <em>Clark </em>does not stand for the proposition that everybody owes a duty to everybody else.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\"> As in Michigan, \u201cmere foreseeability was rejected by [the Georgia Supreme] Court as a basis for extending a duty of care.. . .\u201d <em>CSX Transportation, supra </em>at 890.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\"> It is important to note that the court did not hold that the defendant owed the worker\u2019s wife a duty.

The Court of Appeals held that the defendant hospital owed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>plaintiffs son a duty because it had a physician-patient relationship with the plaintiff. <em>Shepard </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because in <em>Shepard </em>there was a physician-patient relationship between the plaintiff mother and the defendant, while in the instant case there was not even an employer-employee relationship between the stepfather and defendant. Because <em>Shepard </em>is distinguishable, we do not need to address whether it was decided correctly; however, we do note that the Court of Appeals concluded that a duty was owed solely on the basis of the existence of a relationship. See <em>Shepard, supra </em>at 246 (\u201cBecause defendant had a special relationship with plaintiff, we conclude that defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to [plaintiffs son].\u201d). As we explained above, although the nonexistence of a relationship precludes the imposition of a duty, the existence of a relationship does not require the imposition of a duty. Instead, where the existence of a relationship is found, the other factors must be considered before a duty can be imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> Justice Cavanagh contends that \u201cthe potential burden must be examined <em>in this limited context, </em>not extrapolated to all other imaginable potential litigants.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 531 (emphasis added). He contends further that this question \u201cshould also be viewed in the extremely narrow confines of this particular case.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 536. However, this is not how a court of law properly determines the existence, or nonexistence, of a legal duty, for such a determination will apply not only in the instant case but in the next 500 cases as well. One cannot assess \u201csocial benefits\u201d and \u201csocial costs\u201d by considering only a \u201cparticular\u201d case or without considering other \u201cpotential litigants.\u201d Unlike Justice CAVANAGH, we refuse to consider whether to impose a new legal duty without regard to the consequences of such a decision for future cases. As New York\u2019s highest court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Plaintiffs assure us that this will not lead to \u201climitless liability\u201d because the new duty may be confined to members of the household of the employer\u2019s employee, or to members of the household of those who come onto the landlord\u2019s premises. This line is not so easy to draw, however. For example, an employer would certainly owe the new duty to an employee\u2019s spouse (assuming the spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>lives with the employee), but probably would not owe the duty to a babysitter who takes care of children in the employee\u2019s home five days a week. But the spouse may not have more exposure than the babysitter to whatever hazardous substances the employee may have introduced into the home from the workplace. Perhaps, for example, the babysitter (or maybe an employee of a neighborhood laundry) launders the family members\u2019 clothes. In short, as we pointed out in <em>Hamilton, </em>the \u201cspecter of limitless liability\u201d is banished only when \u201cthe class of potential plaintiffs to whom the duty is owed is circumscribed by the relationship.\u201d <em>[In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, supra </em>at 498, quoting <em>Hamilton, supra </em>at 233.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_A\">Unlike Justice Cavanagh, the New York plaintiffs at least recognized that their burden in urging the creation of a new duty required an assessment of the consequences arising from such a duty for future cases. Moreover, Justice Cavanagh fails to offer any principled way of distinguishing the claims of household members from other potential claimants \u2014 for instance, a person who sat next to Roland on the bus every day after work \u2014 on the basis of \u201cthe social benefit of a healthy people.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 544.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> Justice CAVANAGH criticizes us for relying on <em>Altimore </em>rather than \u201cthe evidence produced at trial.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 532. However, he fails to point to <em>any </em>\u201cevidence produced at trial\u201d that suggests that the harm was foreseeable. He states that \u201cthe transcripts are repeatedly cut off during what appears to be testimony shedding further light on the question of foreseeability.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 535. If there are pages missing from the transcript that contain \u201ctestimony shedding further light on the question of foreseeability,\u201d plaintiffs obviously could have included those pages. This is a matter for the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas, not this Court. That court has certified a question of law, and we have answered that question of law on the basis of the information that has been presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Also, contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s contention, it should come as no surprise to the parties that we are addressing foreseeability given that it is well-established law in Michigan that foreseeability, is a factor to be considered in determining whether a legal duty should be imposed. Nevertheless, \u201cother considerations may be, and usually are, more important.\u201d <em>Buczkowski, supra </em>at 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b567-6\"> In response to the \u201casbestos-litigation crisis,\u201d this Court adopted an administrative order precluding trial courts from \u201c \u2018bundling\u2019 asbestos-related cases for settlement or trial.\u201d Administrative Order No. 2006-6, 476 Mich xliv. One of the purposes of this order was to ensure that asbestos litigants are subject to traditional legal standards. Therefore, it would be inconsistent for us now to suggest that traditional legal standards should not apply to asbestos litigants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\"> Justice Cavanagh would impose a duty here because the social benefit of compensating somebody for a loved one\u2019s death is \u201ctremendous.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 538. We certainly do not quarrel with him in this characterization. However, we do not believe that this automatically allows courts to ignore the social costs of imposing a duty. Although every death, or serious injury, is indeed \u201ctremendous,\u201d this is no warrant for placing responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>bility upon an inappropriate defendant. Not every death or serious injury, however genuinely \u201ctremendous,\u201d is legally compensable by someone else. Under Justice Cavanagh\u2019s approach, no matter how attenuated or remote the relationship between the parties, if a plaintiff has suffered a death, or presumably any kind of serious injury, he or she would prevail. This is simply not the law in Michigan or in any other state. Nor could it be the law in any reasonably functioning society that desires that its resources be devoted to something other than litigation. Justice CAVANAGH would impose liability here because Carolyn Miller died. One need not fail to recognize the gravity of this occurrence to recognize that additional analysis is required under traditional legal rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> Plaintiffs and Justice Cavanagh rely heavily on <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 405, which held that any duty owed to the members of a worker\u2019s household constitutes a \u201cderivative duty,\u201d i.e., one derived from the duty owed to the worker himself. Thus, even under <em>Olivo, </em>no duty is owed to a worker\u2019s household members unless a duty is owed to the worker himself. Justice Cavanagh, however, concludes that defendant owed Miller a duty without considering whether defendant owed Roland a duty. Because Roland was an employee of an independent contractor, defendant would have owed him a duty under Michigan law only if it could be shown that the \u201ccommon work area\u201d doctrine was satisfied <em>and </em>that defendant \u201cretained control\u201d over the work being performed. <em>Ormsby v Capital Welding, Inc, </em>471 Mich 45, 55; 684 NW2d 320 (2004). To our knowledge, there was no evidence presented establishing the \u201c \u2018unusually high degree of control\u2019 \u201d over the relining projects required by <em>Ormsby, supra </em>at 55 (citation omitted). Indeed, the jury instructions given on this point seem inconsistent with Michigan law. However, given that we conclude that defendant owed no duty to Miller regardless of whether defendant owed a duty to Roland, it is not necessary for us to decide whether defendant owed a duty to Roland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> Further, the \u201cinherently dangerous activity\u201d doctrine only applies to nondelegable duties. <em>DeShambo, supra </em>at 34 (the inherently dangerous activity doctrine is \u201cfounded on the existence of a duty on behalf of the landowner, or employer of an independent contractor, and the duty must be of the type that is nondelegable\u201d). The removal of asbestos containing materials is certainly not a nondelegable duty. Otherwise, a homeowner who hired a person to remove asbestos from his house could be held liable to somebody who that person exposed to asbestos. This cannot be the case. Homeowners must be able to delegate this duty to professionals who are specifically trained in removing asbestos without fear of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b572-7\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQnt\">(dissenting). I dissent from the majority opinion because I do not believe that this Court should substantively decide this appeal. In fact, without the participation of Justice YOUNG, who strongly believes that this Court lacks the constitutional authority to answer the certified question,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court would not have answered the question. I would point out the curiosity that Justice YOUNG\u2019S constitutional conscience would allow him to subordinate his deeply held belief to provide the fourth vote to answer the question in this case. Despite the fact that he has participated in answering certified questions before, the fact remains that had he not provided the deciding vote to answer <em>this </em>certified question, he would have caused the Court not to answer the question, which surely would have aligned much better with his view against providing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>foreign court with a \u201cdidactic exegesis on our law\u201d than answering it. See <em>In re Certified Question (Veliz v Cintas Corp), </em>474 Mich 1228 (2006) (YOUNG, J., concurring). This situation differs from the previous cases in which Justice YOUNG participated because in those cases there were enough votes to answer the question regardless of his participation. In other words, his vote in those cases had no impact on the fact that the question was answered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In any event, I further disagree that Michigan law compels the result the majority reaches. Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, defendant could be found to owe a duty to Carolyn Miller with respect to asbestos contamination through take-home exposure. Regarding our role in this case, it is my view that the question certified to us by the Texas court improperly asks us to decide the specific case pending before that court. The Texas court asked</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">[w]hether, under Michigan law, Ford, as owner of property on which asbestos-containing products were located, owed to Carolyn Miller, who was never on or near that property, a legal duty specified in the jury charge submitted by the trial court, to protect her from exposure to any asbestos fibers carried home on the clothing of a member of Carolyn Miller\u2019s household who was working on that property as the employee of an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">By this wording, the Texas court has asked this Court to decide the case without the benefit of examining it on direct appeal under an applicable standard of review. Moreover, in my view, this state\u2019s well-developed negligence precedents would enable the Texas court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>decide the case before it without resort to an advisory opinion or a substantive decision from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The answer to the Texas court\u2019s formulation of the certified question depends on the intricacies of this specific case, and because of these complexities I would decline to answer the question. I do not believe that we should entangle ourselves in an appeal pending in another state by determining whether this defendant owed a duty to Carolyn Miller. If anything, we should be determining only whether Michigan law would permit the Texas court to hold that defendant owed a duty to Carolyn Miller. But by deciding the case, this Court oversteps its advisory role and decides issues of fact without the benefit of full review.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">However, because the majority decides the case, I must register my disagreement with its analysis. Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, I would hold that a duty can be imposed in the present case. I am guided first and foremost by traditional principles of negligence set forth by this Court in <em>Clark v Dalman, </em>379 Mich 251, 260-261; 150 NW2d 755 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">Actionable negligence presupposes the existence of a legal relationship between parties by which the injured party is owed a duty by the other, and such duty must be imposed by law. The duty may arise specifically by mandate of statute, or it may arise generally by operation of law under application of the basic rule of the common law, <em>which imposes on every person engaged in the prosecution of any undertaking an obligation to use due care, or to so govern his actions as not to unreasonably endanger the person or property of others. This rule of the common law arises out of the concept that every person is under the general duty to so act, or to use that which he controls, as not to injure another. Pinnix </em>v. <em>Toomey, </em>(1955), 242 NC 358, 362 (87 SE2d 893).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Such duty of care may be a specific duty owing to the plaintiff by the defendant, or it may be a general one owed by the defendant to the public, of which the plaintiff is a part. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The majority ignores these fundamental principles, and I do not find its attempt to diminish their import, <em>ante </em>at 509 n 10, persuasive. Further, the majority misstates other aspects of Michigan law. For instance, although the majority spends considerable time opining that, in a duty analysis, \u201c[t]he most important factor to be considered is the relationship of the parties,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 505, 515, this is not a bright-line rule in this state, and it is not true in every factual situation. In <em>Buczkowski v McKay, </em>441 Mich 96, 101; 490 NW2d 330 (1992), this Court recognized that \u201c[c]ourts take a variety of approaches in determining the existence of a duty, utilizing a wide array of variables in the process. Frequently, the first component examined by the court is the foreseeability of the risk. However, other considerations may be, and usually are, more important.\u201d The fact that the relationship between the parties is a component of a duty analysis and may, at times, be given more weight than another of the components certainly does not mean that the relationship is the most important inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> How heavily to weigh each of the several factors depends on the precise situation at hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Many variables are considered in a duty analysis. As the <em>Buczkowski </em>Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Dean Prosser described the several variables that consistently go to the heart of a court\u2019s determination of duty as including: foreseeability of the harm, degree of certainty of injury, closeness of connection between the conduct and injury, moral blame attached to the conduct, policy of preventing future harm, and, finally, the burdens and consequences of imposing a duty and the resulting liability for breach. <em>[Id. </em>at 101 n 4, quoting Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 53, p 359 n 24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Each of these factors is significant, and the majority incorrectly represents the law in this state by asserting that the relationship between the parties is the most important. Only by subordinating these factors to that of relationship is the majority able to discount every opinion of another state in which a duty was found with respect to take-home exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">With respect to relationship, the majority states that because Carolyn Miller was never \u201con or near defendant\u2019s property,\u201d the relationship prong \u201cstrongly suggests that no duty should be imposed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 515. But the majority\u2019s severely curtailed view of \u201crelationship\u201d seems to be based on its view of premises liability law rather than on the principles of ordinary negligence. Under the latter (and the former as well, although that is not at issue here), a harmed person need not visit the property of the injuring party. This case involves an employer who exposed a worker to asbestos, knowing that the asbestos fibers were toxic and could be carried home, thus exposing the worker\u2019s family to asbestos. Under these circumstances, I have no difficulty concluding that the relationship that a jury found defendant had to Cleveland \u201cJohn\u201d Roland extended to Carolyn Miller. To conclude otherwise, as does the majority, ignores basic negligence principles and gives employers carte blanche to expose workers to communicable toxic substances without taking any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>measure whatsoever to prevent those substances from harming others. This I cannot do. Indeed, as discussed later in this dissent, our government also refuses to grant this free pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Moreover, I disagree that the burden defendant would bear by shouldering a duty with respect to Carolyn Miller is so great that innocent people must suffer without recourse. Our federal government has stated that it \u201cis aware of no instance in which exposure to a toxic substance has more clearly demonstrated detrimental health effects on humans than has asbestos exposure.\u201d 51 Fed Reg 22615 (1986). In assessing whether defendant should have a duty, I would find that the extreme toxicity of asbestos weighs heavily in favor of finding that defendant had a duty to protect those whom defendant put at risk by exposing them to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The majority also seriously overstates what the consequences of imposing a burden on defendant would truly be by asserting that, if a duty were imposed, businesses would have to \u201cprotect[] every person with whom a business\u2019s employees and the employees of its independent contractors come into contact, or even with whom their clothes come into contact. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 516. That is incorrect. The certified question is specific to this case in that it asks whether this defendant should be found to have a duty owed to Carolyn Miller. Thus, the potential burden must be examined in this limited context, not extrapolated to all other imaginable potential litigants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And again, as will be discussed in this dissent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>defendant now has a regulatory duty to minimize the potential for take-home exposure. Thus, holding that defendant had a duty to this particular person would not impose nearly the burden the majority claims. Questions of duty specifically entail drawing lines, and under a properly tailored rule, the duty could be appropriately limited. Thus, the majority mischaracterizes the burden and concludes, on the basis of unwarranted extremism, that the burden is too great. I would not conclude that the burden of imposing a duty on defendant, whose actions led to Carolyn Miller\u2019s exposure to a toxic substance, would be too large to bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I further take issue with the majority\u2019s conclusion regarding foreseeability. In its analysis, the majority commits three errors. First, it reasons that because foreseeability was not found with respect to Exxon Mobil in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp v Altimore, </em>unpublished opinion of the Texas Court of Appeals, issued April 19, 2007 (Docket No. 14-04-01133-CV), \u201cthe risk of \u2018take home\u2019 asbestos exposure was, in all likelihood, not foreseeable by defendant while [John] Roland was working at defendant\u2019s premises from 1954 to 1965.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 518. But the <em>Altimore </em>court based its holding on the evidence produced at trial, as it should have. See <em>Altimore, supra, </em>2007 Tex App LEXIS 2971 at *36. This Court\u2019s conclusion, too, should be based on the evidence produced at trial. It is improper for this majority to rely on another court\u2019s holding to determine whether this defendant in the present case knew or should have known of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>It may be of interest to the reader that in a different case involving Exxon Mobil, the evidence showed that Exxon Mobil was fully aware of the possibility of take-home exposure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">Exxon Mobil was aware by 1937 that exposure, of sufficient duration and intensity, to asbestos dust or raw asbestos was associated with ashestosis. Moreover, a report prepared in 1937 specifically for the petroleum industry, detailed the hazards associated with \u201coccupational dust,\u201d including asbestos particles, which was prevalent at petroleum plants. <em>[Olivo v Owens-Illinois, Inc, </em>186 NJ 394, 404; 895 A2d 1143 (2006).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The majority\u2019s mention of only the case in which Exxon was not found to know of the risk is curious.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">It is also worth noting that it has not proved unusual to find that an employer knew or should have known about the risk of take-home exposure at the times relevant to this case. In <em>Condon v Union Oil Co of California, </em>unpublished opinion of the California Court of Appeals, issued August 31, 2004 (Docket No. A102069), the court relied on expert testimony indicating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">in 1924 in the United States, it was recognized that workers handling toxic substances should have separate lockers for work and street clothes to prevent their families from being exposed to any toxic dust from the workers\u2019 clothes. [The expert] testified that in 1948, a leading industrial hygienist in the oil industry recommended that refinery workers change clothes prior to going home, and that the refinery launder the work clothes to avoid contaminating the worker\u2019s home with carcinogenic materials. <em>[Condon, supra, </em>2004 Cal App Unpub LEXIS 7975 at *13.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">In any event, it should be self-evident that a finding regarding foreseeability must be based on the evidence specific to a particular case. And here, plaintiffs presented evidence, which the jury clearly believed, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>this defendant knew of the hazards of asbestos at the relevant times. The focus should be on what this defendant knew, not on what Exxon Mobil was found to know in <em>Altimore. </em>By ascribing no weight to the evidence that plaintiffs produced at trial and relying on another court\u2019s findings regarding the evidence produced at a different trial involving a different defendant, the majority upends the jury\u2019s finding and improperly decides a factual matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Nor should the analysis hinge on what date the first literature connecting take-home exposure with clothes washing was published, the majority\u2019s second error. See <em>ante </em>at 518 (\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 own expert conceded that the first published literature suggesting a \u2018specific attribution to washing of clothes\u2019 was not published until 1965.\u201d). And defendant asserts that no foreseeability can be found before 1972 \u2014 the year the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) began regulating the taking home of clothing exposed to asbestos. But research on the dangers of exposure to asbestos had been going on for decades, and warnings appeared far earlier. In fact, \u201c[a]s early as 1916, industrial hygiene texts recommended that plant owners should provide workers with the opportunity to change in and out of work clothes to avoid bringing contaminants home on their clothes.\u201d <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 404. The question is not what year literature was published regarding the dangers of washing contaminated clothing or what year OSHA instituted regulations. Neither of those dates is dispositive if it can be shown, which it apparently was, that defendant had some other source of knowledge and information at the relevant time. Consequently, were the foreseeability inquiry properly conducted and limited to the evidence produced at this trial, this factor might have weighed in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Importantly, though, and this pertains to the majority\u2019s third error, the question of foreseeability is a question addressable only on full appellate review, of which we do not have the benefit. First, there is no stated standard of review under which to substantively review the jury\u2019s findings for correctness. Further, the parties have not submitted the entire trial transcript, but instead have provided only excerpts. While the portions that have been submitted contain some of plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s testimony regarding what defendant knew and what information was available to defendant, the transcripts are repeatedly cut off during what appears to be testimony shedding further light on the question of foreseeability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, a proper review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>whether this defendant knew of the risks posed by take-home exposure is impossible for this Court to conduct, and the majority errs by nevertheless conducting it. This is yet another reason why it is both irregular and improper for this Court to substantively decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Moving on, I differ greatly with the majority regarding the outcome of what it deems the \u201cultimate inquiry\u201d: \u201cwhether the social benefits of imposing a duty outweigh the social costs of imposing that duty.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 515. First, this question should also be viewed in the extremely narrow confines of this particular case. Specifically, the Texas court has asked whether this defendant had a duty to Carolyn Miller. Holding that this defendant had a duty to Carolyn Miller would not create a universal cause of action for every potential take-home exposure case. Thus, the majority needlessly invokes the sky-is-falling genre of arguments advanced by commentators who have been openly critical of asbestos litigation and tort recovery in general. See <em>ante </em>at 519-520. Quite simply, there has been no showing in this case that were defendant found to have a duty, \u201c \u2018a potentially limitless pool of plaintiffs\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018an almost infinite universe of potential plaintiffs\u2019 \u201d would be created. <em>Ante </em>at 521 (citations omitted). In fact, one of the very commentators the majority quotes recently wrote that \u201cafter years of downward spired, the asbestos litigation tide finally may be turning.\u201d Behrens &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Goldberg, <em>The asbestos litigation crisis: The tide appears to be turning, </em>12 Conn Ins L J 477, 478 (2006).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">And several courts have adequately addressed the majority\u2019s concern with reasoning I find persuasive. One explained that the public policy concerns would \u201cdissipate\u201d because it was only recognizing a duty based on \u201cthe particularized foreseeability of harm to plaintiffs wife, who ordinarily would perform typical household chores that would include laundering the work clothes worn by her husband.\u201d <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 405. Another recognized that a rule could be properly tailored so as to avoid creating this majority\u2019s feared \u201cinfinite universe of potential plaintiffs\u201d: \u201c[L]imitless liability would not be created in this case if we found a duty under these particular facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Chaisson v Avondale Industries, Inc, </em>947 So 2d 171, 182 (La App, 2006), clarified on reh 947 So 2d 200 (2007).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">But even so, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the social costs of imposing a duty outweigh the social benefits requires elevating corporate vitality over the health and well-being of humanity. The majority\u2019s statements re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>garding the social burden abound with tales of corporate bankruptcy, litigation crises, and the costs in dollars that have stemmed <em>from exposing workers to asbestos.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>ante </em>at 519-520. But the majority is strangely silent with respect to the toll that asbestos exposure has taken on human life. By focusing solely on the losses suffered by businesses, the majority fails to account for the social benefits that would ensue from ensuring that people who are exposed to detrimental substances and who, consequently, suffer ruined health, life-altering and life-ending diseases, and the loss of family members, are compensated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When workers are protected from deadly substances, society benefits. When corporations are held accountable for the consequences their processes have on those who toil to make the corporations viable, society benefits. When our justice system fairly places the burden of responsibility for dangerous products on the offending party, rather than the one who suffers, society benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Unlike the majority, I would find a tremendous social benefit in imposing corporate accountability, and I would conclude that the social benefits of corporate responsibility and a valued, healthy society easily out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>weigh the burden of imposing a duty on corporations to mitigate the risk of take-home exposure, especially in light of the fact that they have been required to do so anyway for the last 35 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">And the majority proclaims that \u201c[n]ot every death or serious injury, however genuinely \u2018tremendous,\u2019 is legally compensable by someone else.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 522 n 20. This is true, but with respect to this case, it is a direct consequence of the majority\u2019s holding that an employer who allowed a contaminated worker to expose his family to a deadly substance had no duty to act differently. It is not that the death is inherently not compensable. Rather, it is after such a holding that the death is not compensable. But the majority fails to comprehend that who must compensate this victim of harm is determined by its own creation and interpretation of the law. The majority should not disregard its singular role in preventing compensation and then shrug off the consequences of that role by saying, in essence, \u201cSorry, not everything is compensable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">And I would not impose liability simply \u201cbecause Carolyn Miller died\u201d or allow a plaintiff to prevail \u201cno matter how attenuated or remote the relationship between the parties, if a plaintiff has suffered a death, or presumably any kind of serious injury . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 522 n 20. Readers will see through these empty allegations simply by reading this dissent, in which it is thoroughly explained why each factor in the analysis of whether a duty should be imposed weighs in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. And readers perusing the opinions of other states that have found a duty in similar circumstances may reject out of hand the majority\u2019s assertions that \u201c[t]his is simply not the law ... in any other state. Nor could it be the law in any reasonably functioning society that desires that its resources be devoted to something other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>litigation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 522 n 20. For instance, a Louisiana court easily found a duty for reasons similar to mine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">In considering the moral, social, and economical factors of imposing a duty, we find that public policy also weighs in favor of finding a duty. First, the economic impact of imposing a duty on Zachry is minimal. The fact that this case presents <em>res nova </em>determinations for this Court demonstrates the small number of cases. Second, there is a public policy need to prevent future harm like this from occurring. If courts allow employers to turn a blind eye to potential work hazards simply because they are hired by someone else, companies may be more likely to rely upon others\u2019 representations and perform no safety inspections of their own. Third, the possibility of limitless liability is of no concern because finding a duty in this case would not create a categorical duty rule, but one based upon the facts and circumstances of this case. Fourth, the historical precedent and development of institutional guidelines show that courts are holding companies liable for negligence based on unsafe work conditions. This desire for accountability is also shown in the strengthening of OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] regulations to allow for minimal asbestos exposure to workers and none to household members. Finally, public policy favors a duty in this case where a \u201cconstruction contractor\u201d took no independent steps to protect its employees\u2019 family members from household exposure to hazardous materials. <em>[Chaisson, supra </em>at 183-184.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Indeed, not even our federal government believes that requiring employers to protect workers and their families from asbestos exposure is too cumbersome a burden. In fact, quite the opposite is true. OSHA has promulgated stringent requirements on employers whose employees encounter asbestos in the work environment. See 29 CFR 1926.1101. In no uncertain terms, OSHA has set forth strict procedures to decontaminate workers who handle asbestos on the job. These rigorous measures reflect OSHA\u2019s awareness that the deadly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>communicable nature of asbestos fibers merits mandating an involved process to prevent the spread of asbestos fibers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">(1) Requirements for employees performing Class I asbestos jobs involving over 25 linear or 10 square feet of TSI [thermal system insulation] or surfacing ACM [asbestos-containing material] and PACM [presumed asbestos-containing material].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">(i) <em>Decontamination areas. </em>The employer shall establish a decontamination area that is adjacent and connected to the regulated area for the decontamination of such employees.

Although these regulations were not in place when John Roland and Carolyn Miller were exposed to asbestos, their existence demonstrates how seriously our government considered the social <em>detriments </em>of asbestos exposure when it imposed these obligations on businesses. While the majority views the alleged projected financial costs of take-home exposure liability as too heavy a social burden, I would conclude that whatever those costs may be, they pale in comparison to the social benefit of a healthy people.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Further, in a duty analysis, the extremely toxic nature of asbestos and the fact that the risk of injury can be reduced must be given proper weight because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>duty is a function of the level of risk. As the Tennessee Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">The foreseeability of [the plaintiffs] injury is further buttressed by the severe gravity of the possible harm\u2014 mesothelioma and subsequent death. \u201c[T]he degree of foreseeability needed to establish a duty of care decreases in proportion to the magnitude of the foreseeable harm. \u2018As the gravity of the possible harm increases, the apparent likelihood of its occurrence need be correspondingly less to generate a duty of precaution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pittman v. Upjohn Co., </em>890 S.W.2d 425, 433 (Tenn. 1994) (quoting Prosser [&amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed)], \u00a7 31, at 171. <em>[Satterfield v Breeding Insulation Co, Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, issued April 19, 2007 (Docket No. E2006-00903-COA-R3-CV).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Although the majority states that the nature of the risk weighs in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, it seems to struggle with giving that factor the weight it deserves. The data, research, and studies definitively establishing a causal relationship are too numerous to mention, but I would point the majority to OSHA\u2019s final standards regarding asbestos in the workplace, in which the toxic ramifications of asbestos exposure were painstakingly detailed. See Occupational Exposure to Asbestos, Tremolite, Anthophyllite, and Actinolite, 51 Fed Reg 22612 (1986). The following are but a few of the conclusions explained in that lengthy document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">OSHA has followed these guidelines in making a determination that the risk of material health impairment resulting from occupational exposure to asbestos is significant. The epidemiological and toxicological evidence and testimony presented in the November notice and in Section IV (Health Effects) of this preamble clearly show that exposure to asbestos is carcinogenic to humans and additionally causes disabling fibrotic lung disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Clinical evidence of the adverse effects associated with exposure to asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite, is present in the form of several well-conducted epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed workers, family contacts of workers, and persons living near asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite mines. These studies have shown a definite association between exposure to asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite and an increased incidence of lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and asbestosis. The latter is a disabling fibrotic lung disease that is caused only by exposure to asbestos. Exposure to asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite has also been associated with an increased incidence of esophageal, kidney, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and buccal cavity cancers. [51 Fed Reg 22646, 22755.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In fact, \u201ca joint NIOSH-OSHA Asbestos Work Group stated that there was no level of exposure to asbestos below which clinical effects did not occur. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22616.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The severely dangerous character of asbestos should factor much more heavily in the analysis of whether defendant had a duty to mitigate the risk involved. The measures to prevent take-home exposure essentially boil down to ensuring that workers shower and change clothes after encountering asbestos. Just those simple actions have the potential to completely eliminate the risk of take-home exposure. But the majority makes this difficult to discern by grossly overstating the burden of imposing a duty. It concerns itself not with the gravity of the health risks or even with the relatively marginal costs of prevention. Instead, the majority\u2019s central focal point is this statement: \u201cAsbestos claims have given rise to one of the most costly products-liability crises ever within our nation\u2019s legal system.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>It is a sad day for our citizens indeed when, confronted with a substance that is so dangerous that compensating victims for their losses has had such hefty financial consequences, this Court tilts the scales of justice to <em>lessen </em>liability. The analysis should be the opposite. The more dangerous the product, the more critical it is to impose a duty of protection. If protection and accountability increase, litigation eventually decreases because, obviously, the protections reduce injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">I am persuaded by the reasoning from courts in our sister states that have held that imposing a duty on an employer to mitigate the risk of take-home exposure is reasonable. Like the court in <em>Zimko v American Cyanamid, </em>905 So 2d 465 (La App, 2005), I would conclude that, assuming defendant knew or should have known of the dangers of take-home exposure, \u201c fit is hardly a quantum leap to extend the duty of care owed to employees to members of the employee\u2019s household who predictably come into routine contact with the employee\u2019s clothing. Such persons would certainly fall within the \u201crange of reasonable apprehension\u201d created by defendant\u2019s alleged negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, quoting <em>In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, </em>14 AD3d 112, 121; 786 NYS2d 26 (2004). And as the court stated in <em>Olivo:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cThe inquiry should be not what common law classification or amalgam of classifications most closely characterizes the relationship of the parties, but... whether in light of the actual relationship between the parties <em>under all of the surrounding circumstances the imposition </em>... of a general duty to exercise reasonable care in preventing foreseeable harm ... is <em>fair and just.\" [Olivo, supra </em>at 402, quoting <em>Hopkins v Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 NJ 426, 438; 625 A2d 1110 (1993) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Fortunately, the majority does not foreclose the possibility of finding a duty with respect to take-home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>exposure under different circumstances. But I would hold that, under close examination of the circumstances of this case, and accepting the jury\u2019s finding that defendant knew or should have known of the risk of take-home exposure, imposing a duty on defendant would be, without doubt, fair and just. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b594-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> See <em>In re Certified Question (Veliz v Cintas Corp), </em>474 Mich 1228 (2006) (Young, J., concurring); <em>In re Certified Questions (Melson v Prime Ins Syndicate, Inc), </em>472 Mich 1225 (2005) (Young, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> Compare this to <em>Melson, supra, </em>wherein Justice Young could have provided, but did not provide, the fourth vote to answer the question.

See <em>ante </em>at 502-503 n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\"> It should be noted that in <em>Buczkowski, </em>the nature of the injured person\u2019s claim involved the criminal act of a third party. Here, no third-party conduct is involved. The analysis, therefore, will not be identical to that in <em>Buczkowski.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> For a recent case in which the relationship of the parties was hardly mentioned but in which foreseeability was this same majority\u2019s paramount focus, see <em>Brown v Brown, </em>478 Mich 545; 739 NW2d 313 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> In response to the majority, <em>ante </em>at 516 n 17, I did not write the certified question. The Texas appellate court wrote the certified question, and it wrote it in probably the most specific way possible. The majority oversteps the hounds of the question by considering factors that are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>at issue in this case. And there is nothing novel about deciding the legal question of duty as it pertains to a particular set of parties. Although duty is a question of law, it will always be answered in the context of a unique set of circumstances. The factors used in a duty analysis make that clear; for instance, the relationship of <em>these </em>parties and whether the harm was foreseeable to <em>this </em>defendant are considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b581-4\"> The majority asserts that because the transcripts do not contain the full discussion of foreseeability that occurred at trial, evidence regarding defendant\u2019s knowledge of the dangers of exposing workers to asbestos must not exist. <em>Ante </em>at 518 n 18.1 find this an extremely backward way to go about the analysis. First, I must mention again that <em>the jury found foreseeability. </em>I would not surmise, as does the majority, that this finding was based on nothing. The majority must believe that the jury was either unintelligent or deliberately failed to follow the jury instructions. I find both conclusions insulting and refuse to make them. Further, there is a perfect explanation of why the parties did not include the entire transcript: <em>this Court was not supposed to factually redecide the issue of foreseeability. </em>Rather, this Court should, if anything, consider what was found about foreseeability in the course of weighing the duty factors. The difference between weighing <em>the jury\u2019s finding </em>with respect to foreseeability in the duty analysis and reaching its <em>own </em>factual conclusions about foreseeability is a critical difference the majority fails to grasp. See <em>ante </em>at 518 n 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The majority is free to thoroughly review the trial testimony excerpts as I have done. On doing so, it would indeed find numerous instances of testimony that support the jury\u2019s findings. The record is far from devoid of such evidence. But I cannot in good conscience render a definitive conclusion regarding foreseeability for the mere fact that the transcript is incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The fact that the majority believes that other factors are more important than foreseeability, <em>ante </em>at 518 n 18, does not mitigate the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that the majority decides the question of foreseeability using an incorrect process. Moreover, I do not see anything left for the Texas court\u2019s determination, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]his is a matter for the Fourteenth District Court of Appeals of Texas, not this Court.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 518 n 18. In my reading, the majority decides that the risk was not foreseeable to defendant. See <em>id. </em>However, because this Court\u2019s answer to a certified question is purely advisory and does not constitute binding precedent, the Texas court is free to draw its own conclusions with respect to the meaning, or applicability, of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\"> Interestingly, this same article attributes the \u201casbestos litigation crisis\u201d not to those who, like plaintiffs\u2019 decedent, are or were truly ill, but to what the authors describe as healthy plaintiffs who have been \u201cunearth[ed]\u201d by profitable \u201cmass screenings programs.\u201d Behrens &amp; Goldberg, <em>supra </em>at 479.

This Court\u2019s decision to use MCR 7.305(B) to answer the certified question in this case exceeds how other states have answered certified questions. Although MCR 7.305(B) grants this Court the authority to answer a certified question from \u201ca federal court, state appellate court, or tribal court,\u201d the power is not constitutionally derived and goes beyond how any other state has ever applied certified question laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Forty-six states have adopted or created a modified version of the UCQLA, \u00a7 1-14 (1995) and not one single state has utilized the reach of its rule as broadly as the majority does here today.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By answering a certified question from an intermediate appellate court of another state, the majority does what no other state has done even when it has been explicitly granted the power to do so. Nineteen states, including Michigan, permit another state to certify questions of law to the supreme court of that state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Of those 19 states, eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>restrict the asking court to the \u201ccourt of last resort\u201d or the \u201chighest appellate court\u201d of another state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Five states, including Michigan, allow \u201can\u201d or \u201cany appellate court\u201d of another state to certify questions of law to the supreme court of that state \u2014 by reference an intermediate appellate court may be authorized to certify a question to the state supreme court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From my research, it appears that <em>no state has ever answered a question certified to it by another state intermediate appellate court. </em>The majority\u2019s decision today to answer a question certified by the Texas Court of Appeals is unprecedented. It leaves to another time for one to ponder why the majority chooses to reach so far \u201cdeep into the heart of Texas\u201d to answer a question posed by the Texas Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">I dissent from this Court\u2019s decision to answer the certified question in this case because MCR 7.305(B) goes beyond this court\u2019s constitutional authority to answer certified questions and the majority\u2019s decision to answer the certified question in this case is unprecedented and unnecessary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b599-6\">KELLY, J., concurred with part II of Justice WEAVER\u2019S opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-11\"> See, e.g., <em>Proposed Amendment of MCR </em>7.305, 462 Mich 1208 (2000) (WEAVER, J., dissenting); <em>In re Certified Question (Wayne Co v Philip Morris, Inc), </em>622 NW2d 518 (Mich, 2001) (Weaver, J., dissenting); <em>In re Certified Question (Kenneth Henes Special Projects Procurement, Marketing &amp; Consulting Corp v Continental Biomass Industries, Inc), </em>468 Mich 109; 659 NW2d 597 (2003) (WEAVER, J., concurring in the result only); <em>In re Certified Questions (Melson v Prime Ins Syndicate, Inc), </em>472 Mich 1225 (2005) (Weaver, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\"> The \u201cpower to answer\u201d section of the 1995 version of the UCQLA, 12 ULA, \u00a7 3, p 73, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">The [Supreme Court] of this State may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States or by [an appellate] [the highest] court of another State [or of a tribe] [or of Canada, a Canadian province or territory, Mexico, or a Mexican state], if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">The UCQLA suggests that \u201can appellate court of another State\u201d or \u201cthe highest court of another State\u201d may be the appropriate certifying body. Further, the UCQLA suggests that the answer to a certified question would be determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> As noted by Justice Levin in <em>In re Certified Question (Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co), </em>432 Mich 438, 467-471; 443 NW2d 112 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">In the instant case, the response to the certified question will not determine the controversy. No binding order or judgment will be entered. The response will not be made effective by a final judgment, decree or process of this Court. No decision of this Court that will be binding on the parties or that will be res judicata of an issue will be entered by the Court. The response does not end the controversy, and this Court has no way of enforcing its response to the certified question by appropriate means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">It appears that because the response to the certified question in the instant case would not be determinative of the cause or controversy and, even if it were, the response cannot be enforced through an order or judgment of this Court, that the response to this certified question is not the exercise of judicial power but closer to an advisory opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">The 1908 Constitution did not authorize this Court to issue advisory opinions. The 1963 Constitution authorizes the Court to provide the Legislature or the Governor with an advisory opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">Advisory opinions are not precedentially binding under the doctrine of stare decisis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\"> <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1975 PA 227, </em>396 Mich 465; 242 NW2d 3 (1976); <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), \u201cmodified\u201d on other grounds <em>DiFranco v Pickard, </em>427 Mich 32, 58; 398 NW2d 896 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><em> </em>See Alabama, ARAP Rule 18; Alas R App Proc 407; Ariz Sup Ct R 27; Arkansas, AR S Ct &amp; Ct App Rule 6-8; Cal Rule of Court 8.548; Colorado, CAR 21.1; Conn Practice Book \u00a7 82-1; Del Sup Ct R 41; Fla R App P 9150; Ga Sup Ct Rule 46; Hawaii, HRAP Rule 13; Idaho, IAR Rule 12.2; Ill Sup Ct Rule 13; Ind R App P 64; Iowa Code \u00a7 684A.1; Kansas, KSA \u00a7 60-3201; Ky CR Rule 76.37; La Sup Ct R XI; Me R App P 25; Md Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Ann \u00a7 12-603; Massachusetts, ALM Sup C Rule 1:03; Michigan, MCR 7.305(B); Miss, MRAP 20(a); Mont Code Ann, Ch 21, Rule 44; RRS Neb \u00a7 24-219; Nev RAP 5; NH Sup Ct Rule 34; NM RAP 12-607; ND R App P 47; Ohio S Ct R XVIII; 20 Okla St \u00a7 1602; Oregon, ORS \u00a7 28.200; PA Sup Ct Internal Operating Proc 10; RI Sup Ct Art I, Rule 6; South Carolina, SCACR 228; SD Codified Laws \u00a7 15-24A-1; Tenn Sup Ct R 23, \u00a7 1; Tex R App P 58; Utah R App P 41; Vermont, VRAP Rule 14; Va Sup Ct R Pt 5, 5:42; Wash Rev Code (ARCW) \u00a7 2.60.020; W VA Code \u00a7 51-1A-3; Wis Stat \u00a7 821.01; Wyoming, WRAP 11.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\"> See Cal Rule of Court 8.548; Conn Practice Book \u00a7 82-1; Del Sup Ct R 41; Ga Sup Ct Rule 46; Iowa Code \u00a7 684A.1; Kansas, KSA \u00a7 60-3201; Ky CR Rule 76.37; Md Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Ann \u00a7 12-603; Massachusetts, ALM Sup Ct Rule 1:03; Michigan, MCR 7.305(B); Mont Code Ann, Ch 21, Rule 44; NM RAP 12-607; ND R App P 47; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>20 Okla St \u00a7 1602; Oregon, ORS \u00a7 28.200; South Carolina, SCACR 228; Va Sup Ct R Pt 5, 5:42; W VA Code \u00a7 51-1A-3; Wis Stat \u00a7 821.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\"> See Cal Rule of Court 8.548; Conn Practice Book \u00a7 82-1; Del Sup Ct R 41; Ky CR Rule 76.37; Massachusetts, ALM Sup Ct Rule 1:03; Mont Code Ann, Ch 21, Rule 44; Va Sup Ct R Pt 5, 5:42; Wis Stat \u00a7 821.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b599-10\"> See Ga Sup Ct Rule 46; Md Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Ann \u00a7 12-603; Michigan, MCR 7.305(B); NM RAP 12-607; 20 Okla St \u00a7 1602.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
