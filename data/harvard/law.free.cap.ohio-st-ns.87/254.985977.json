Fieback, the defendant in error, commenced this action by a petition in the court of common pleas of Huron county, alleging that the defendant is a railroad corporation operating a railroad from Buffalo to Chicago and passing through the village of Bellevue in the county of Huron, and that on and prior to March 29, 1908, the defendant was using in' connection with the operation of its railroad a yard located in the said village of Bellevue; that on and prior to said date the defendant had in its employ one John Beattie whose duties were to patrol the said yard and eject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>or arrest trespassers found therein, in addition to other duties not enumerated; that on the evening of that date plaintiff went to the yard for the purpose of meeting one of the employes of defendant, passing along and by a place that is generally frequented by the public, and while he was in said place he was assaulted and injured by said John Beattie then in the discharge of his duties patrolling said yard for the purpose of finding trespassers and ejecting them, and said plaintiff was injured as hereinafter described; that at the time he did not know who said John Beattie was and did not know that he was in fact an employe of the defendant with authority to inquire into the plaintiff\u2019s business or with authority to eject the plaintiff from the yard of the defendant; that said John Beattie did not have any badge so that plaintiff could see it and did not in any way disclose to plaintiff the authority to eject plaintiff or order him from said yard; that said John Beattie asked him what he was doing there and that he asked Beattie who he was; that Beattie refused to tell him who he was or his authority and without any provocation whatever illegally and violently assaulted plaintiff, striking and wounding him and knocking him to the ground and otherwise ill-treating him, said Beattie claiming at the time that plaintiff was about to steal a ride upon one of the trains of the defendant and that he was trying to prevent the plaintiff from doing so; that plaintiff had no intention of stealing a ride upon the defendant\u2019s train and made no effort to do so; that Beattie used more force than was necessary to prevent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>plaintiff from getting aboard the train and more force than was necessary in ejecting him from said yard and that he struck and continued to beat the plaintiff after he got plaintiff to the ground and after he had the plaintiff under his complete control; that in the scuffle that ensued plaintiff\u2019s leg was broken and his ankle sprained. The plaintiff claims damages in the amount of five thousand dollars. Attached to his petition and filed therewith were certain interrogatories.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">The defendant for its answer to the petition admitted that it is a railroad corporation operating a railroad as alleged in the petition and that on and prior to the 29th of March, 1908, it was using in connection with the operation of said railroad a yard located in the village of Bellevue. It also admitted that said John Beattie asked the plaintiff on the occasion alleged in the petition what the plaintiff was doing there, and further answering the defendant denied all and singular the allegations in the petition contained except as herein-before stated to have been expressly admitted. The defendant attaches to its answer due answers to the interrogatories propounded by the plaintiff as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">\u201cNo. 1.

That was the issue; it could be determined only by the evidence. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that he could act in either capacity, would not his intention throw some light upon what he in fact did?

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW0\">It is clear to us that the court of common pleas erred in refusing to grant the motion, made at the close of all the testimony, to direct a verdict for the defendant; and that the circuit court erred in affirming the judgment of the court of common pleas. The process by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>we arrive at this conclusion is neither long nor intricate. It is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">By Sections 3427 and 3428, Revised Statutes, (General Code, Sections 9150 and 9151), the governor is authorized to appoint and commission, upon the request of a railroad company, such persons as the company may designate, or as many as he may deem proper, to act as policemen for and upon the premises of such railroad or elsewhere, when directly in discharge of their duties for such railroad; and it is therein provided that: \u201csuch policemen so appointed and commissioned shall severally possess and exercise all the powers, and be subject to all the liabilities of policemen of cities of the first class, in the several counties in which they are authorized to act while in the discharge of their duties for which they are appointed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">It appears that John Beattie, for whose conduct the defendant in error seeks to recover damages from the plaintiff in error, was so appointed, commissioned and sworn to perform the duties of a policeman for the plaintiff in error, The New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co., and was at the time of the acts complained of, authorized so to act. So that, although he was appointed at the request of the railroad company and although his salary was paid by it, he was in fact, at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, a public officer; and by the express terms of Section 3428, Revised Statutes (General Code, Section 9151), the railroad company would not be liable for his acts if a municipal corporation would not be liable. Police officers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>by whomever appointed or elected are generally regarded as public or state officers deriving their authority from the sovereignty, for the purpose of enforcing the observance of the law; and for their malfeasance, misfeasance or non-feasance in office the city is not responsible. 20 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2 ed.), 1204. But where the act complained of is outside of the public duties of a policeman, and were authorized or ratified by the corporation, the latter would be liable. It follows, therefore, that the only competent issue tendered by the defendant in error in his petition below, is whether the act of the policeman was outside of his public functions and was authorized by the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We start then with the clear presumption of the law that the policeman was acting officially and in the line of his duty. <em>Jardine </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>50 N. J. L., 486; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Erie Ry. Co., </em>69 N. J. L., 19; <em>Tolchester Beach Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Steinmeier, 72 </em>Md., 313; <em>Brill </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>115 Mo., 596, 605; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Grand Rapids Ry. Co., </em>140 Mich., 689. The foundation of this rule is that one who is invested with authority by the sovereign, commissioned and sworn to faithfully perform the duties pertaining to such commission, must necessarily be supposed to be acting in conformity thereto; and anyone who claims that the officer was not so acting must show affirmatively that such was the case. In the present case, there is no testimony whatever that any person competent to act for the railroad company, authorized or directed Beattie to in any way interfere with the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>error; and the circumstances as well as the testimony of all the witnesses are consistent with Beattie\u2019s own claim that he was acting as an officer of the law. A train was coming in and the defendant in error was pointed out to Beattie by a person not an officer or employe of the company as being in a position in the company\u2019s yards to excite suspicion. He went to the defendant in error and asked him what he was doing there. The answer was evasive and words followed which quickly ended in a combat, in which the defendant in error had his leg broken, by falling' or being thrown upon the railroad track. Beattie wore a policeman\u2019s badge, but it was pinned on his vest and his coat and overcoat were buttoned over it at the time of the fracas. He also had a policeman\u2019s club or \u201cbilly\u201d and a revolver, but these were not in view. He was then and had been for some time assigned for duty as a detective or railroad policeman in the Bellevue yards and reported to the chief of the railroad police or division superintendent. There is no proof that he performed any other duties there. This is the sum of all the testimony, which we have read from beginning to end; and it is in no respect incon- \u2019 sistent with the officer\u2019s claim, and the legal presumption, that he was attempting in the line of his duty as a policeman to arrest the defendant in error, or to eject him from the company\u2019s grounds. So the presumption prevails. If there was any excess of force used or any improper conduct by the officer, the railroad company is not liable for it. <em>Tolchester Beach Improvement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Steinmeier, supra; Tucker </em>v. <em>Erie Ry.
