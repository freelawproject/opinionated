This principle is so well-established that only a few of the multitude of cases which so hold bear citation. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 396, 397 [23 O.O.3d 358]; and <em>State, ex rel. Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 16 [58 O.O.2d 70]. We have also consistently adhered to the rule that where the record contains some evidence which supports the commission\u2019s factual findings, those findings will not be disturbed. Again, extensive citation is not required. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Allerton, supra, </em>at 397; <em>State, ex rel. GF Business Equipment, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 446 [20 O.O.3d 379]; and <em>State, ex rel. Dodson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 408 [16 O.O.3d 439].</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Here, the parties admit that the commission combined the five percent permanent partial disability referred to in Dr. Paloski\u2019s report with a finding that there was a seventy-five percent permanent partial disability as a result of Hayes\u2019 depressive neurosis to arrive at the eighty percent figure. At the outset, we agree with the court of appeals below when it stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u201cWhere it is clear that an award is for permanent partial disability from two recognized conditions, there is no abuse of discretion in joining the awards to find a single percentage of permanent partial disability so long as the percentage applicable to each condition can be ascertained with certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Thus, if there is some evidence in the record to support both the five percent and seventy-five percent findings of permanent partial disability, it necessarily follows that the commission\u2019s findings were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">Three doctors evaluated Hayes\u2019 psychological condition. Their reports can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">1. Dr. Nissim Benado reported that Hayes\u2019 psychological condition was a direct result of the industrial accident and that Hayes was sixty-five percent permanently partially disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>2. Dr. Bernard Greenberg placed Hayes\u2019 impairment at seventy to seventy-five percent, and described the disability as \u201clong term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">3. Dr. Michael Szauter diagnosed Hayes\u2019 condition as depressive neurosis but declined to place a percentage on the degree of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In performing their fact-finding duty, the commission evidently chose to accept the diagnosis of a permanent partial disability from Dr. Benado, the seventy-five percent figure of Dr. Greenberg\u2019s report, and Dr. Szauter\u2019s diagnosis that Hayes suffered from depressive neurosis. That being the case, we are satisfied that the commission did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Hayes suffered a seventy-five percent permanent partial disability as a result of depressive neurosis, there being some evidence to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Therefore, the crux of this case centers on the characterization of Dr. Paloski\u2019s report and his determination that Hayes was suffering a five percent permanent partial disability under R.C. 4123.57(B). The employer contends that Dr. Paloski\u2019s report indicates no conditions found that were not already compensated under R.C. 4123.57(C) for the fingers amputated and the loss of use of the right hand. On the other hand, both Hayes, and the commission maintain that Dr. Paloski found additional impairment above and beyond that which was previously awarded. Upon inspection of Dr. Paloski\u2019s report, it is unclear whether the diagnosis of a five percent permanent partial disability was for new conditions caused by the hand injury, or for injuries already compensated. Clearly, Hayes may not recover a scheduled award under R.C. 4123.57(C) in addition to recovering a percentage of permanent partial disability under R.C. 4123.57(B). However, if the five percent permanent partial disability figure in Dr. Paloski\u2019s report represents injuries in addition to those for which Hayes was already compensated, the five percent permanent partial disability award is allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Therefore, the limited writ of mandamus will issue and require the Industrial Commission to state whether the figure in Dr. Paloski\u2019s report represents additional physical impairment. If it is determined that Dr. Paloski\u2019s diagnosis represents additional disability, the commission\u2019s finding of eighty percent permanent partial disability will not be deemed to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

Because the <em>per curiam </em>opinion recognizes the continuing validity of 'the enigmatic \u201csome evidence\u201d rule (see dissents in <em>State, ex rel. Kilburn, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1982], 1 Ohio St. 3d 103, at 105-106; <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1982], 69 Ohio St. 2d 396, at 399-400 [23 O.O.3d 358]; <em>State, ex rel.

Comm. </em>[1981], 68 Ohio St. 2d 165, at 170-174 [22 O.O.3d 400]), I concur in the judgment only.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Krupansky, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHP\">concurring. I agree a limited writ of mandamus should issue to require the commission to determine whether Dr. Paloski\u2019s diagnosis pertaining to Hayes\u2019 five percent physical disability relates to a new condition or to a previously compensated condition. However, in addition, I would order the commission to reevaluate the propriety of any finding of permanent partial disability based on depressive neurosis in excess of sixty-five percent since the evidence necessary to support an award above sixty-five percent is ambiguous, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The award at issue contains two separate and distinct components to be evaluated on a permanent partial basis: (1) the psychiatric component for which the commission found Hayes to be seventy-five percent permanently partially disabled; and (2) the physical component for which Hayes\u2019 permanent partial disability was placed at five percent. Combining these two figures, the commission concluded Hayes was suffering from an eighty percent permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">While the majority opinion ostensibly affirms the judgment of the court of appeals, a closer look reveals this court is issuing only a limited writ of mandamus as to the five percent finding of disability pertaining to Hayes\u2019 physical condition. The majority simply ignores any problem with placing Hayes\u2019 psychiatric disability at seventy-five percent, despite the fact there is no evidence to substantiate such conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In granting the limited writ of mandamus, the court of appeals ordered the commission to \u201creconsider its order and to state the bases for its determination of eighty percent permanent partial disability. * * *\u201d It is obvious from this statement the court of appeals intended the commission to pay special attention not only to the five percent award relating to Hayes\u2019 physical disability, but also to the extent of the award for Hayes\u2019 psychiatric condition. As stated by the court of appeals:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u201c* * * [T]here is some confusion in the order of the commission and there is no clear evidence supporting the total award. * * * With respect to neurosis, the claimant\u2019s doctor states he has a sixty-five percent permanent partial disability. The statement of Dr. Greenberg that the disability is in the range of seventy to seventy-five percent is ambiguous. At one point he refers to the disability as Tong term\u2019 and at another he refers to it as \u2018temporary.\u2019 We are unable to determine from the record upon what basis the Industrial Commission awarded the claimant eighty percent permanent partial disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Therefore, while the majority may represent that it is affirming the judgment of the court of appeals, plainly this is not the case since the majority clearly ratifies the commission\u2019s conclusion relating to Hayes\u2019 psychiatric condition of seventy-five percent permanent partial disability. For the following reason, I feel the majority\u2019s conclusion is erroneous since it failed to follow the judgment of the court of appeals and order the commission to reconsider any award greater than sixty-five percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">In order to better understand this basic analysis it is important to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>amine the pertinent portions of the reports of Drs. Szauter, Benado and Greenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Dr. Szauter\u2019s report summarizes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cMr. Hayes is definitely suffering a Depressive Neurosis. I cannot say that his Neurosis is caused only by the accident at GF because the break up of his marriage has also caused him a great deal of depression. I do not think this condition is final, with proper treatment he can improve and work again. * * * Diagnosis: Depressive Neurosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201cP.S. In my opinion, at least 50% of Mr. Hayes\u2019 disability comes from the original injury which changed his basic personality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In Dr. Szauter\u2019s report he does not evaluate the fifty percent as applying to a permanent partial disability, nor does he relate this percentage solely to Hayes\u2019 psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Dr. Benado\u2019s report states unequivocally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u201c* * * The psychiatric disability is within the range of 65 percent partial and permanent. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Dr. Greenberg\u2019s report concludes with the very ambiguous statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auk\">\u201cMr. Haye\u2019s [sic] present psychological condition are [sic] the result of the industrial accident. Disability is within the range of 70-75% and will be long term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">In addition, Dr. Greenberg in a fee bill mailed to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation answered a series of questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">\u201cDoes claimant have a disability as a result of injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">\u201cYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">\u201cIf so, is it temporary or permanent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">\n<em>\u201c[Tjemporary.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">\u201cTotal or partial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">\u201c[P]artial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-18\">\u201cIf partial give percentage of physical disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-19\">\u201c70-75%\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">In reaching its decision on the psychiatric aspect of Hayes\u2019 award, it appears the commission extracted only portions from each of the reports of these three doctors and then took these portions out of context to conclude Hayes was suffering a seventy-five percent permanent partial disability due to depressive neurosis. As explained by the majority, \u201c* * * the commission evidently chose to accept the diagnosis of a permanent disability from Dr. Benado, the seventy-five percent figure of Dr. Greenberg\u2019s report, and Dr. Szauter\u2019s diagnosis that Hayes suffered from depressive neurosis.\u201d From this the majority accepted the commission\u2019s erroneous conclusions and stated, \u201c* * * we are satisfied that the commission did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Hayes suffered a seventy-five percent permanent partial disability as a result of depressive neurosis, <em>there being some evidence to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>that effect.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) I strongly disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">I would readily concede there is \u201csome evidence\u201d to support findings that: (1) Hayes was suffering from depressive neurosis (Dr. Szauter\u2019s report); (2) Hayes\u2019 psychiatric condition was a direct result of his work-related accident which rendered him sixty-five percent permanently partially disabled (Dr. Benado\u2019s report); and (3) Hayes was seventy to seventy-five percent disabled from his depressive neurosis, although it was unclear whether this disability was \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cpermanent\u201d (Dr. Greenberg\u2019s report). Conversely, there is <em>no evidence </em>to support the conclusion that Hayes\u2019 depressive neurosis rendered him seventy to seventy-five percent <em>permanently partially </em>disabled as a result of his psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">As stated above, the only doctor who places Hayes\u2019 disability to the extent of seventy-five percent is Dr. Greenberg; however, Dr. Greenberg never indicated Hayes\u2019 condition to be \u201cpermanent.\u201d To the contrary, in response to a question on the aforementioned fee bill asking whether the claimant Hayes\u2019 injury was temporary or permanent, Dr. Greenberg typed in the response \u201ctemporary.\u201d In fact, the only time Dr. Greenberg even arguably indicated a belief that Hayes\u2019 condition was \u201cpermanent\u201d is found in his \u201cSpecialist\u2019s Report\u201d wherein he states his opinion that \u201c[disability is within the range of 70-75 percent and will be <em>long term.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Clearly, Dr. Greenberg\u2019s statement can not be said to constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d that Hayes is seventy-five percent <em>permanently </em>partially disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In the absence of Dr. Greenberg\u2019s conclusions, the maximum percentage of permanent partial disability for which there is \u201csome evidence\u201d is Dr. Benado\u2019s assessment that Hayes is <em>sixty-five percent permanently partially </em>disabled. Therefore, while I agree with the majority that the commission should reevaluate Dr. Paloski\u2019s determination, I also believe any finding relating to Hayes\u2019 psychiatric condition which exceeds sixty-five percent is ambiguous and should be reassessed. Accordingly, unlike the majority, I would affirm the court of appeals in all respects, thus issuing the limited writ of mandamus and extending it to encompass an order that the commission reexamine any award of disability greater than sixty-five percent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-9\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
