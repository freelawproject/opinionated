In <em>In re Bond Hill-Roselawn Hebrew School </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 70 [38 O.O. 527], the court declined to adopt a literal construction of these words under the predecessor to R.C. 5709.07, and held that property qualified for exemption if it was used primarily for public worship. Relying on <em>Bond Hill, </em>appellant argues that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Appellee argues that the holding in <em>Bond Hill </em>is no longer applicable, having been rendered prior to the enactment of the split-listing statute. We can find no authority, however, which would support appellee\u2019s contention that the enactment of the split-listing statute diminished the viability of the primary-use test enunciated in <em>Bond Hill. </em>Therein, at pages 72-73, the court relied upon the following rationale in refusing to adopt a literal construction of the words \u201cused exclusively\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cSuch a literal construction could prevent any exemption being given under these words of the Constitution. It would not be difficult to show some slight use of any church building for a purpose other than public worship.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u201cThere are many activities conducted in church buildings which do not constitute public worship but which are designed to encourage people to use the church for public worship. The use of a room in the church to entertain young children while their parents attend church services is not a use for public worship. The use of the church building for meetings of boy scouts is not a use for public worship. The use of part of the building for the preparation of food for a church supper and the eating of such food are not uses for public worship. Certainly it was not the intention of the people that their words, used exclusively for public worship, should be so literally construed that any such uses would prevent tax exemption of a church building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We find this rationale equally applicable whether- the focus of inquiry is the whole building, as in <em>Bond Hill, </em>or a portion thereof as now authorized by the split-listing statute. Moreover, decisions rendered since the enactment of R.C. 5713.04 have not abandoned the primary-use test, and rooms similar to the parish hall have been granted exempt status. In <em>New Haven Church of Missionary Baptist </em>v. <em>Bd., of Tax Appeals </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 53, 54 [38 O.O.2d 129], \u201c* * * a basement area approximately 60 by 60 feet, which is used for religious instruction and other such purposes * * was granted exemption. In <em>Episcopal Parish </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 199 [12 O.O.3d 197], the fact that \u201c* * * [t]he first floor of the rectory is presently tax exempt due to the fact that it is used by parish groups for worship, adult education, and other programs of the church\u201d was not contested. Where exemption has been denied, the building or rooms in question were primarily used for a non-exempt purpose. See <em>Trustees of the Church of God of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 517 [50 O.O. 431]; <em>New Haven Church of Missionary Baptist </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals, supra; Episcopal Parish </em>v. <em>Kinney, supra; Operation Evangelize </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 346 [23 O.O.3d 315].</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Board of Tax Appeals found that the primary use of the parish hall was religious in nature and appellee concedes that such use constitutes \u201cpublic worship\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5709.07. Therefore, on authority of <em>Bond Hill, </em>appellant is entitled to a tax exemption for the parish hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b116-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
