Thus, a variance results in a deviation from the literal import of the ordinance or resolution and may be granted only upon a showing of practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>special permit, which is evidenced by a conditional zoning certificate, authorizes a use which is permitted by zoning regulations, subject to the issuance of such a permit or conditional certificate. Thus, the special permit results in the establishment or maintenance of a use in the location and under the circumstances mandated by the zoning ordinance or resolution, and such permit may be granted upon whatever terms are imposed by the zoning ordinance or resolution.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Montville Twp. Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(1972), 32 Ohio Misc. 118, 120-121 [61 O.O.2d 184].</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Considerations of practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships are not, therefore, commonly relevant to the granting of an exception. Rather, the authority of appellant to grant exceptions as permitted pursuant to R.C. 519.14 is limited by standards sufficient to contain the discretion of the board of zoning appeals. 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d Ed.) 371, Section 19.09; 6 Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls 44-37, Section 44.03; and 3 Rathkopf, Law of Zoning and Planning (4 Ed.) 41-35, Section 41.09. In the instant case, the discretion of appellant to grant exceptions for \u201c[yjacht clubs and public or private facilities for renting, docking, storage, and servicing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>pleasure boats\u201d is so severely constrained by Section ll-B-3(h), that appellant\u2019s function is reduced to one of determining whether Fleitz\u2019s proposed use comports with the definition of the terms used in the section. As such, the zoning resolution cannot be said to permit such discretion in appellant so as to permit it to grant exceptions in an arbitrary manner, and is, therefore, not an improper grant of legislative power.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">We find that the decision of appellant to grant an exception for Fleitz\u2019s proposed use is supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence and is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\"> Appellee raises the argument that an \u201cexception\u201d is not the same as a special permit or a conditional zoning certificate. As noted in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Montville Twp. Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(1972), 32 Ohio Misc. 118 [61 O.O.2d 184], a special permit is evidenced by a conditional zoning certificate. The terms special permit and exception have been used interchangeably in zoning codes, although special permit appears to be the preferred terminology. See 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d Ed.) 356, Section 19.01. \u201cSpecial exception\u201d was first employed in Section 7 of the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act (1926) to designate a species of administrative permission which allows a property owner to put his property to a use which the regulations expressly permit under conditions specified in the zoning regulations. This definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>is substantially similar to that of special permit announced in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Montville Twp. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, supra. </em>Accordingly, for the purposes of this decision, we will employ the term \u201cexception\u201d to mean a use permitted by a zoning resolution which may be authorized under the conditions specified in the resolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\"> Section ll-B-3(h) of the zoning resolution for Jerusalem Township, Reno Section.
