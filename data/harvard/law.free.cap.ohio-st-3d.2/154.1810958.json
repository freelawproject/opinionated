In particular, this court must determine the import of the word \u201cincluding\u201d as used in the statute, for the disposition of the instant matter is clearly contingent upon the meaning herein ascribed to that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">R.C. 2501.02(A) provides that the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">\u201cUpon an appeal upon questions of law to review, affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse judgments or final orders of courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district, including the finding, order or judgment of a juvenile court that a child is delinquent, neglected, abused, or dependent, for prejudicial error committed by such lower court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">The court of appeals, in the case at bar, ruled that only the classifications of juvenile court judgments specifically enumerated following the term \u201cincluding\u201d in R.C. 2501.02(A) are appealable. Appellant contends, however, that these classifications are merely examples of appealable juvenile court judgments. After carefully scrutinizing the disputed provision, we are convinced that appellant states the better case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">In discerning the meaning of \u201cincluding\u201d as the General Assembly intended to employ the term in R.C. 2501.02, the dictates of the codified rules of statutory construction and, in particular, R.C. 1.42, must be followed. R.C. 1.42 states, in relevant part, that: \u201cWords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">To ascertain the common usage of the word \u201cincluding,\u201d it is appropriate to consult Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Therein, \u201cinclude\u201d of which \u201cincluding\u201d is a participle is defined as meaning:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">\u201c[T]o place, list, or rate as a part or component \"of a whole or of a larger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>group, class, or aggregate. * * * To take in, enfold, or comprise as a discrete or subordinate part or item of a larger aggregate group or principle. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In short, \u201cincluding\u201d implies that that which follows is a partial, not an exhaustive listing of all that is subsumed within the stated category. \u201cIncluding\u201d is a word of expansion rather than one of limitation or restriction. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court, defining \u201cincluding\u201d within the context of Section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, stated that \u201cthe term \u2018including\u2019 is not one of all-embracing definition, but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle.\u201d <em>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Bismarck Lumber Co. </em>(1941), 314 U.S. 95, at 100. See, also, <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB </em>(1941), 313 U.S. 177, 189, where \u201cincluding\u201d was similarly defined in relation to Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d in R.C. 2501.02 can only be said to enumerate some, but not all, of the classes of juvenile court judgments subject to appeal. The employment of the term in no way denies those adjudged juvenile traffic offenders the right of appeal. Had the General Assembly intended to except juvenile court adjudications involving such offenders from the treatment accorded adjudications relating to delinquent, neglected, abused or dependent children, it could easily have done so by adopting the necessary exclusionary language. This, it chose not to do. Consequently, the court of appeals has jurisdiction over the subject judgment just as it does, pursuant to R.C. 2501.02, over other final judgments rendered by inferior courts of record. For us to hold otherwise would be to construe \u201cincluding\u201d as a term of limitation and exclusion, in direct contravention of clear legislative intent and common word usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The case at bar offers what is for this court a novel legal question. The United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, previously addressed virtually the same issue when it was asked to define \u201cincluding,\u201d as the word was used in a federal statute delineating the jurisdiction of the Customs Court. <em>Argosy Limited </em>v. <em>Hennigan </em>(1968), 404 F. 2d 14. In holding that the term was to be read within the context of Section 1583, Title 28, U.S. Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in an expansive rather than restrictive manner, the court stated that \u201cincluding\u201d conveys the conclusion that there are other items includable, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>not specifically enumerated by the statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. We can but agree with the logic expressed in <em>Argosy </em>and follow it in reaching our decision today. See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Huber </em>(C.A. 2, 1979), 603 F. 2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Finally, this court finds R.C. 2151.01 to compel the herein ruling. This statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cThe sections in Chapter 2151 of the Revised Code, with the exception of those sections providing for the criminal prosecution of adults, shall be liberally interpreted and construed so as to effectuate the following purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>i </em>(* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u201c(D) To provide judicial procedures through which Chapter 2151 of the Revised Code is executed and enforced, and in which the parties are assured of a fair hearing, and their constitutional and other legal rights are recognized and enforced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">For us to hold that juvenile court judgments relating to juvenile traffic offender proceedings are not appealable would scarcely constitute the liberal construction mandated by R.C. 2151.01. Absent explicit authorizing language, the juvenile courts may not wield unilateral, non-reviewable power to adjudicate juvenile traffic offender complaints. This court cannot award to juvenile courts by judicial fiat that which was not endowed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Accordingly, the appellate court\u2019s judgment dismissing, <em>sua sponte, </em>appellant\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-12\">W. Brown, Sweeney and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AlV\">Celebrezze, C.J., Holmes and Krupansky, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> Former Section 1583, Title 28, U.S. Code, read:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u201cThe Customs Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review on protest the decisions of any collector of customs, including all orders and findings entering into the same, as to the rate and amount of duties chargeable and as to all exactions of whatever character within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury; decisions excluding any merchandise from entry or delivery, under any provision of the customs laws; and the liquidation or reliquidation of any entry, or the refusal to pay any claim for drawback or to reliquidate an entry for a clerical error as provided by the customs laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">In <em>Argosy Limited </em>v. <em>Hennigan, supra, </em>the court ruled that the Custom Court\u2019s jurisdiction was not limited only to reviewing the collector\u2019s decisions as to the rate and amount of duties assessed imports, but also included the right to review his underlying decision as to whether an article was indeed an import.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b219-13\">Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADs\">dissenting. Because I would affirm the court of appeals, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">In my view, the majority incorrectly reads into R.C. 2501.02 the right to appeal a finding of a juvenile court that a child is a juvenile traffic offender. As a result, I feel that the court of appeals below correctly dismissed the instant appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">R.C. 2501.02(A) grants the courts of appeals jurisdiction only over an \u201corder or judgment of a juvenile court that a child is delinquent, neglected, abused, or dependent.\u201d Plainly absent is a grant of jurisdiction to the court of appeals over an order of a juvenile court that a child is a juvenile traffic offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">The majority seizes upon the word \u201cincluding\u201d as used in R.C. 2501.02(A) to justify its determination that such a right to appeal exists. While I have no quarrel with the majority\u2019s extensive treatment of the definition of \u201cincluding,\u201d I am convinced that the word\u2019s placement in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>does not lead to the result reached by the majority. \u201cIncluding\u201d in R.C. 2501.02 clearly modifies \u201cjudgments or final orders of courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d It does not modify, as the majority reasons, \u201cjudgment of a juvenile court.\u201d Consequently, it is a strained interpretation of R.C. 2501.02(A) that would hold that the list of appealable juvenile court orders in the above statute is non-exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Moreover, as I stated in <em>In re Becker </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 84 [68 O.O.2d 50], a case interpreting R.C. 2501.02(A), \u201c* * * specifically, absent a finding that a child is delinquent, neglected, or dependent, no appeal is available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">At the time of the decision in <em>Becker, supra, </em>R.C. 2501.02(A) only listed \u201cdelinquent, neglected, or dependent.\u201d The statute has since been amended to include \u201cabused\u201d children cases. Thus, a majority of this court has previously expressed its opinion that the list of juvenile court judgments which are appealable under R.C. 2501.02(A) is <em>exclusive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The majority states, \u201c* * * [t]his court cannot award to juvenile courts by judicial fiat that which was not endowed by statute.\u201d Ironically, the majority disregards its own admonition by awarding appellate jurisdiction to the courts of appeals over matters specifically excluded from the grant of jurisdiction by the General Assembly. Often we walk a fine line between judicial interpretation and judicial legislation. In the cause <em>sub judice, </em>the majority has wandered across that line into the realm of the General Assembly to achieve its result. I cannot countenance such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the court of appeals below.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b220-9\">Krupansky, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnE\">dissenting. The majority adopts the position advanced by appellant and determines the four categories listed in R.C. 2501.02(A) comprise examples of appealable juvenile court judgments, rather than comprising an exhaustive list of those judgments. Consequently, the majority concludes lower court findings relating to juvenile traffic offenders, although not specifically enumerated in R.C. 2501.02(A), are appealable to the court of appeals. I feel this construction of R.C. 2501.02(A) is erroneous and I must, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The majority states \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018including\u2019 in R.C. 2501.02 can only be said to enumerate some, but not all, of the classes of juvenile court judgments subject to appeal.\u201d In support of its conclusion the majority explains \u201c \u2018including\u2019 implies that that which follows is a partial, not an exhaustive listing of all that is subsumed within the stated category.\u201d However, the majority\u2019s analysis conveniently ignores the fact that only <em>one </em>category of a mere five possible categories is missing from the \u201cpartial\u201d list in R.C. 2501.02(A). While I would agree with the majority\u2019s assessment that \u201c \u2018 [i]ncluding\u2019 is a word of expansion rather than one of limitation or restriction,\u201d this generalization must be tempered by the context in which the word is found. In the instant situation reading the word \u201cincluding\u201d in context seems to disclose that the list of four categories found in R.C. 2501.02(A) was intended to be complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The majority also attempts to bolster its conclusion with its contention that had the General Assembly intended to exclude juvenile traffic offenders from the ambit of R.C. 2501.02(A), \u201cit could easily have done so by adopting the necessary exclusionary language.\u201d I feel the opposite deduction is the more compelling position to assume, <em>i.e., </em>it would have required the addition of a mere three words to include juvenile traffic offenders within the scope of R.C. 2501.02(A). The absence of these three words seems to indicate a conscious decision on the part of the legislators to exclude such offenders from the guise of the section, rather than an oversight to include them.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Therefore, dissecting R.C. 2501.02(A) reveals that this section specifically extends its coverage to four categories of juvenile court judgments, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe finding, order or judgment of a juvenile court that a child is delinquent, neglected, abused, or dependent.\u201d Conspicuously absent from this list, however, is the only remaining category of juvenile court judgments \u2014 judgments relating to juvenile traffic offenders. Unlike the majority, I feel the most logical explanation for this deletion is that it is the result of a conscious decision by the General Assembly to exclude juvenile traffic offenders from the scope of R.C. 2501.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Support for affirming the court of appeals can also be found in <em>In re Becker </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 84 [68 O.O.2d 50], wherein this court, in an earlier analysis of R.C. 2501.02, stated at page 86: \u201cSpecifically, absent a finding that a child is delinquent, neglected, or dependent, no appeal is available.\u201d In 1974, when <em>Becker </em>was decided, R.C. 2501.02 explicitly listed as appealable to the court of appeals only findings, orders or judgments \u201cof a juvenile court that a child is delinquent, neglected, or dependent. * * *\u201d The decision in <em>Becker </em>reveals a prior conviction by this court to accept the list of appealable orders found in R.C. 2501.02 as complete and exclusive. There is no reason this court should change its position at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Furthermore, contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion, I also perceive no constitutional problems inherent in refusing juvenile traffic offenders an appeal to the court of appeals. As provided in Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u201cCourts of appeals shall have jurisdiction <em>as may be provided by law </em>to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">R.C. 2501.02(A) implements Section 3(B)(2), Article IV as it relates to juvenile court proceedings and, as stated above, this section does not provide for an appeal for juvenile traffic offenders. Therefore, \u201cas * * * provided by law\u201d only the juvenile proceedings specifically enumerated in R.C. 2501.02(A) are appealable to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">There is also no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that denying juvenile traffic offenders an appeal to the court of appeals rises to the level of a constitutional deprivation of an individual\u2019s inalienable right to defend life and liberty, and protect his property. Clearly, the operation of a motor vehicle is a privilege which is conferred and not a constitutionally protected right. Just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>as clearly, the possible sanctions which can be imposed on a child found to be a juvenile traffic offender can not be characterized as threatening to life or liberty. As stated in R.C. 2151.356:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cIf the child is found to be a juvenile traffic offender the court may make any of the following orders of disposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u201c(A) Impose a fine not to exceed fifty dollars and costs;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201c(B) Suspend the child\u2019s operator\u2019s license or the registration of all motor vehicles registered in the name of such child for such period as the court prescribes;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201c(C) Revoke the child\u2019s operator\u2019s license or the registration of all motor vehicles registered in the name of such child;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\u201c(D) Place the child on probation;</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\u201c(E) Require the child to make restitution for all damages caused by his traffic violation or any part thereof. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The possible sanctions facing a juvenile traffic offender are not of such magnitude as to require that these decisions be appealable to the court of appeals. Our state\u2019s courts of appeals are faced with tremendously crowded dockets and this court should refrain from extending their jurisdiction without explicit statutory or constitutional authority. This authority is glaringly absent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-13\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
