The language of the statute, therefore, indicates that volunteers were intended to benefit from the protection granted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">When the wording of a statute is clear and unambiguous on its face, judicial interpretation is not required; rather, the court must give effect to the words used. \u201cIn ascertaining the legislative intent of a statute, \u2018It is the duty of this court to give effect to the <em>words used </em>[in a statute], not to delete words used <em>or to insert words not used. \u2019 \u201d </em>(Citations omitted.) <em>Bernardini </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 1, 4 [12 O.O.3d 1].</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">By holding volunteer fire fighters are outside the scope of R.C. 701.02, the court of appeals went beyond the plain language of the statute and injected a meaning which is not apparent from the words used in the statute. In so doing, the court of appeals reasoned as follows: Since numerous other sections of the Revised Code distinguish between volunteer and other fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>fighters for various other purposes, \u201ca clear delineation between firemen and volunteer firemen exists\u201d; the absence of the term \u201cvolunteer firemen\u201d from the language of R.C. 701.02 evidences \u201ca legislative intent not to include volunteer firemen within the grant of immunity provided by the statute.\u201d We cannot subscribe to this line of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Although some sections of the Revised Code classify fire fighters as volunteer or paid, part-time or full-time and temporary or permanent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> other sections of the code, including R.C. 701.02, merely use the generic terms \u201cfiremen\u201d and \u201cmembers of the fire department.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Apparently, the General Assembly uses the particular classifications when it seeks to differentiate among the various categories of fire fighters and the general terms when differentiation is not desired. The word \u201cfiremen\u201d would, therefore, include volunteer as well as paid fire fighters, unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellee contends that even if appellant were not precluded from immunity by virtue of his status as a volunteer, a fireman driving a personal vehicle to the firehouse may not claim immunity because (1) the private vehicle of a fireman is not fire-fighting equipment, and (2) driving to a fire station in a private vehicle does not qualify as the performance of a governmental function within the meaning of R.C. 701.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">These issues were raised by appellee in his assignments of error and brief filed in the court of appeals. The court of appeals, however, failed to address all assignments of error as required by App. R. 12(A), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u201c* * * All errors assigned and briefed shall be passed upon by the court in writing, stating the reasons for the court\u2019s decision as to each such error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Inasmuch as the court of appeals did not rule on all errors assigned, the cause is remanded. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 389 [23 O.O.3d 354].</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The judgment of the court of appeals is, therefore, reversed insofar as it held volunteer fire fighters are not qualified for the immunity granted pursuant to R.C. 701.02, and the cause is remanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-13\"> See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 737.22, regarding training and physical requirements; R.C. 737.26, regarding exemption from jury duty for volunteer firemen; and R.C. 505.41, regarding workers\u2019 compensation insurance for members of volunteer fire companies and part-time employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-14\"> See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 737.21, regarding hours of labor for members of the fire department; R.C. 737.23, regarding schools of. instruction for firemen; and R.C. 737.09, regarding stationing and transferring of firemen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aac\">concurring. Although I concur in this court\u2019s construction of R.C. 701.02, the majority opinion fails to mention <em>Haverlack </em>v. <em>Portage Homes, Inc. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 26, recently decided by this court. In <em>Haverlack, </em>sovereign immunity for a municipal corporation, unless provided by statute, was abolished. Consequently, the liability of a municipal corporation, absent a statute, now depends on the merits instead of the often difficult and inconsistent classification of municipal functions as governmental or proprietary to determine liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In this case, a statute does provide immunity for firemen engaged in the operation of a motor vehicle in the performance of a governmental function. Because there is a statute providing immunity, this decision is consistent with <em>Haverlack. </em>However, it is important to emphasize that today\u2019s decision merely gives volunteer fire fighters the possible defense of immunity when their actions meet the statutory requirements. Consequently, it is yet to be determined, when this cause is remanded, whether the fire fighter\u2019s action in driving a private vehicle to a fire station qualifies for the statutory immunity provided in R.C. 701.02.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-5\">W. Brown and C. Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
