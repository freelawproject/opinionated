Thus, there is a clear legal duty on the part of respondents to \u201cprovide suitable accommodations\u201d for the Delaware Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Respondents, in their answer, admit that the existing facilities of that court \u201care inadequate in many respects.\u201d Respondents state also that they are willing to comply with the statute and that, in fact, a contract has been entered into between the city and an architectural firm for a space study report of the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Inasmuch as the facilities of the Delaware Municipal Court admittedly are not adequate and R.C. 1901.36 places a mandatory duty on respondents to provide suitable accommodations, this court concludes that the writ of mandamus should be allowed in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The court is encouraged by the efforts already undertaken by respondents to comply with the statute. Regrettably, those efforts to this time have not yielded results to satisfy the requirements of the Delaware Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">In their answer, respondents indicate that they are willing to comply with the provisions of M. C. Sup. R. 17 \u201cincluding those standards which are suggested as desirable, but not mandatory.\u201d This court, pursuant to the superintending powers over all courts in the state granted in Section 5, Article IV, of the Constitution of Ohio in 1968, adopted M. C. Sup. R. 17 in 1975. That rule is intended to provide basic guidelines for facilities of municipal and county courts. Although not all of the provisions of the rule are mandatory in character, the standards set forth in the rule should be taken into consideration in measuring the adequacy of existing court facilities and in the planning of new facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">Relator\u2019s request for costs and attorney\u2019s fees in this cause, being predicated upon R.C. 733.61, which provides for costs and attorney\u2019s fees in suits brought under R.C. 733.59 by taxpayers in their own name on behalf of a municipal corporation, is denied. The complaint shows on its face that the action was filed by relator in his capacity as judge of the Delaware Municipal Court. For a definition of the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d as used in R.C. 733.59, see <em>State, ex rel. Nimon, </em>v. <em>Village of Springdale </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St. 2d 1 [35 O.O.2d 1]; <em>State, ex rel. White, </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 37, 40 [63 O.O.2d 79].</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">In holding that the writ of mandamus should be allowed in this cause, this court is not unmindful of the present financial problems being experienced by political subdivisions in the state. Of necessity, those problems must be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>into account by both relator and respondents in satisfying the mandatory obligations imposed by R.C. 1901.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Parrino, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b81-6\">Parrino, J., of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting for Sweeney, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
