He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his \u201cmotion to sever\u201d the various counts and to the trial court\u2019s order that he pay restitution and compensatory fines as part of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Defendant was a licensed professional counselor. Part of his therapy included a series of \u201crelaxation exercises\u201d that involved placing his hand, or the hand of a client, on various bodily \u201canchor points,\u201d including the client\u2019s genitals. The grand jury returned an indictment against defendant for sexual abuse in the third degree based on an incident involving one of defendant\u2019s clients. Several months later, it returned a second indictment charging defendant with multiple counts of sexual abuse in the first, second and third degrees based on incidents involving five other clients. The state moved to consolidate the two indictments, and the trial court granted the motion. Defendant then moved to set aside the consolidation order, and the trial court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The jury returned a verdict as set out above, acquitting defendant on one of the charges and splitting 10-2 and 11-1 on several other charges. At sentencing, the prosecution requested that defendant be ordered to pay restitution and compensatory fines. Defendant objected, contending that he had entered into civil settlements with the victims, which barred the imposition of compensatory fines. Defendant did not introduce the settlement agreements into the record, nor did he detail the terms of those agreements. He did refer the court to several \u201cwritten acknowledgments of satisfaction,\u201d by which the victims declare receipt of \u201cfull satisfaction\u201d for their injuries. The same documents, however, declare that they were executed \u201conly for the purposes of plea negotiation,\u201d and that they are not to be used \u201cin any form during the criminal trial.\u201d The trial court concluded that it was appropriate to require defendant to pay both restitution and compensatory fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>We first address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in failing to sever the various counts of sexual abuse. At the outset, we note that defendant has failed to preserve his argument that the trial court should have severed all of the counts of sexual abuse. The only motion that defendant presented to the trial court was a motion to set aside the trial court\u2019s order to consolidate the two indictments. That is the only issue that we review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">ORS 132.560(1)(b) provides that a charging instrument may include two or more offenses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\u201cif the offenses charged are alleged to have been committed by the same person or persons and are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201c(A) Of the same or similar character;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201c(B) Based on the same act or transaction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201c(C) Based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">ORS 132.560(2) further provides that, if two or more charging instruments satisfy the foregoing requirements, the court may order those charging instruments consolidated. If the defendant is \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the joinder or consolidation, the court may order an election, separate trials or other relief as justice requires. ORS 132.560(3). Because consolidation always produces some risk of adverse effect on a defendant, we have held that the \u201cprejudice\u201d required to warrant severance must be \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>State v. Meyer, </em>109 Or App 598, 604, 820 P2d 861 (1991), <em>rev den </em>312 Or 677 (1992). We further have held that, when evidence on the various charges would be \u201cmutually admissible\u201d in separate trials or is \u201csufficiently simple and distinct to mitigate the dangers otherwise created by such a joinder,\u201d substantial prejudice has not been established. <em>Id., quoting United States v. Werner, </em>620 F2d 922, 927 (2d Cir 1980). On appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s decision to consolidate charges for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Rood, </em>118 Or App 480, 482, 848 P2d 128, <em>rev den </em>317 Or 272 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">In this case, we find no abuse of discretion. The evidence was uncomplicated, consisting largely of the testimony of the victims and of defendant as to what happened during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>their counseling sessions. It certainly was not so complex that the jury could not sort through the testimony and determine what happened in each case. Moreover, the jury was instructed to consider each count separately. From the fact that defendant was acquitted on at least one of the charges, it appears that the jury took its instructions to heart. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court acted beyond the bounds of discretion in denying the motion to set aside the order consolidating the two indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court also erred in requiring him to pay restitution and compensatory fines. ORS 137.101(1) provides that the trial court may impose a compensatory fine for the commission of a crime resulting in injury for which the victim has a civil remedy \u201cunless the issue of punitive damages has been previously decided on a civil case\u201d arising out of the same act or transaction. In a similar vein, ORS 137.106(1) provides that restitution may be ordered when the victim of a crime has suffered \u201cpecuniary damage,\u201d defined as \u201call special damages, but not general damages, which a person could recover against the defendant in a civil action\u201d arising out of the facts that constitute the crime. Defendant contends that, because he entered into a civil settlement with each of the victims for his or her injuries, neither compensatory fines nor restitution may be imposed in this case. According to defendant, the settlement satisfied all claims against him, including those for punitive damages. The state argues, and we agree, that on the record in this case we cannot say one way or the other whether that is so. The settlement agreements themselves were not made part of the trial court record, and their terms were not disclosed to the trial court. There was, therefore, no way to determine whether claims for punitive damages survived the settlement of the victims\u2019 civil claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Defendant insists that we should draw inferences from \u201cwhat was not said\u201d to the trial court, namely, that no victim suggested that punitive damages were <em>not </em>included in the settlement. Defendant also relies on the \u201cwritten acknowledgments of satisfaction,\u201d which declare that the victims received \u201cfull satisfaction.\u201d Without the terms of the settlement agreements themselves, however, we do not know what properly may be inferred from either the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the victims or their acknowledgments of \u201csatisfaction.\u201d Defendant\u2019s assignment is not reviewable on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
