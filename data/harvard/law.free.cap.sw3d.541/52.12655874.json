In his sole point on appeal, he claims the evidence showed that if his counsel had investigated and presented relevant evidence that there is a reasonable probability the outcome of his case would have been different. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided\n   to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
