ARDINI, JR., JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jessica Williams (Williams) brought this cause of action in the Circuit Court of Boone County alleging fourteen separate claims against Bayer Corp. (Bayer) related to its Essure contraceptive device along with a variety of counts against her treating physicians. Bayer filed a Motion to Dismiss on the basis that the claims directed against it were preempted under federal law which was granted by the trial court. Williams now appeals arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing those claims on preemption grounds and in not granting her leave to file an amended petition. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Williams became pregnant with her fifth child sometime in late 2012. After consulting with her physicians, she made the determination to undergo a tubal ligation in conjunction with the delivery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in late April of 2013, Williams's physicians determined the umbilical cord had prolapsed around her fetus and she required an immediate caesarian section. Due to the emergency nature of the caesarian section, the tubal ligation was not performed. Following the birth, her physicians recommended Williams consider using Essure as an alternative to tubal ligation. Essure is a medical device manufactured and sold by Bayer that is implanted in a woman's fallopian tube for the purpose of causing inflammation and promoting the growth of scar tissue. This scar tissue blocks the fallopian tube, thereby achieving sterilization. After considering the recommendations of her physicians and reviewing the information provided on the Essure website, Williams agreed to undergo the Essure procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the procedure to place the Essure device, Williams began to experience severe abdominal pain and requested her physicians stop. As a result, the procedure was abandoned after only one of the two devices was inserted. Williams continued to experience significant pain following the procedure and, after several months, requested her physicians remove the Essure device. An x-ray performed during the attempt to remove the Essure device revealed that it had broken apart and perforated Williams's uterine wall. Consequently, pieces of the Essure device were left in Williams's body. Williams continued to experience pain and underwent further surgery to remove one of her fallopian tubes along with a hysterectomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 29, 2015, Williams filed a petition alleging multiple claims against Bayer as well as additional claims directed at several of her physicians. One month after filing her initial petition, Williams filed an amended petition that included the same causes of action against Bayer. Bayer thereafter filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing, among other things, that all of Williams's claims were expressly or impliedly preempted by federal law. After extensive briefing, the trial court heard oral argument before taking the matter under advisement. On March 17, 2016, the trial court issued an order granting Bayer's Motion to Dismiss finding all of the claims asserted against Bayer were preempted under federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams subsequently filed Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Judgment that included a request for leave to amend her petition along with a proposed Second Amended Petition, which the trial court did not grant. Williams appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Williams's First Amended Petition included fourteen counts directed against Bayer: (Count 1) violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (MMPA), (Count 2) fraudulent misrepresentation, (Count 3) negligent misrepresentation, (Count 4) breach of express warranties, (Count 5) breach of implied warranty of merchantability, (Count 6) negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , (Count 7) strict product liability-defective manufacturing, (Count 8) negligent manufacturing, (Count 9) strict products liability for failure to warn-off-label use, (Count 10) failure to warn-post premarket approval risks, (Count 11) negligent training, (Count 12) negligently supplying a product for use, (Count 16) civil conspiracy, and (Count 17)\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur.\n   </em>\n   The trial court found that each of these claims were expressly or impliedly preempted by the federal Medical Device Amendment of 1976, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and dismissed each with prejudice.

This claim does not set forth requirements \"different from, or in addition to,\" those set by the MDA and the Essure PMA, but rather, alleges that Bayer failed to adhere to the requirements of the MDA and the Essure PMA.

It is not logical to suggest that the attempted removal of a contraceptive device meets this definition.

Unlike the previously\n   asserted breach, this argument does not arise out of training Bayer allegedly provided, but instead asserts Bayer was negligent for\n   <em>\n    failing\n   </em>\n   to train Williams's treating physicians on matters beyond what the FDA required. Nothing in the FDA approved training requirements necessitates that each placement procedure be supervised by Bayer. Therefore this claim would effectively add a requirement that was \"different than, or in addition to,\" those set by the FDA and is thus expressly preempted.\n   <em>\n    Riegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/#p315\">\n    552 U.S. at 323-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/#p315\">\n    128 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, Williams contends that Bayer breached its duty by failing to train her physicians in the use of the hysteroscopic equipment it supplied to them. Much as with the asserted breach for failure to supervise, this claim rests not on the training Bayer provided but on what Williams alleges Bayer\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   to provide.

Unfortunately, it is unclear from Williams's petition the extent to which the surgical devices she now alleges to be defective would be considered entirely separate from the Essure device or instead were a component of the Essure system.
