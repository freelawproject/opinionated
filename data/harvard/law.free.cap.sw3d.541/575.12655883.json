Minze (\"Minze\") appeals from the judgment entered by the Circuit\n   Court of Cole County, Missouri (\"trial court\"), after a jury verdict on retrial after remand, in favor of the Missouri Department of Public Safety (\"Department\") on Minze's petition for retaliation under the Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"). Minze asserts that the trial court: (1) erred in admitting evidence and permitting the Department to use that evidence to impeach her; (2) erred in overruling her objections to the Department's closing argument; and (3) lacked jurisdiction to hear retrial of the case. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 22, 2009, Minze filed a petition against the Department, the Missouri Capitol Police Department, and Todd Hurt, individually and in his official capacity as Chief of the Missouri Capitol Police, alleging that while employed as a Capitol Police Officer, she was subjected to unlawful discrimination based on sex (Count I) and retaliation in violation of the MHRA (Count II). A jury trial was conducted on August 21, 2012. The jury returned a verdict for the Department, the Missouri Capitol Police, and Todd Hurt on Minze's sex discrimination claim (Count I) and for Minze against the Department on Minze's unlawful retaliation claim (Count II). The jury awarded her $70,000 in actual damages and $70,000 in punitive damages. The trial court entered judgment for Minze and against the Department in the total amount of $500,113.42, which included $360,113.42 for attorney's fees and costs. The Department appealed. On April 8, 2014, this court issued its opinion, reversing the trial court's judgment due to instructional error and remanding the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Minze v. Mo. Dep't of Pub.

Within a day or two after receiving the letter, Minze went to the Capitol Police office to clean out her office. She testified that she met with Chief Hurt and asked him if she could have her leave extended until she could come back to work full duty, but he refused to keep Minze's position open. Minze testified that Chief Hurt's denial of her request to remain on unpaid leave in lieu of termination was one of four acts of retaliation in response to her sex discrimination claim against the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On cross-examination, counsel for the Department asked Minze whether Chief Hurt's statement to her that he was not going to grant her any additional unpaid leave was significant with regard to her retaliation claim; Minze replied that it was. Counsel for the Department then questioned Minze about the Charge she filed. In the Charge, Minze alleged that the Department and the Missouri Capitol Police discriminated against her based on her sex and disability and in retaliation for her having filed a formal grievance with the Director of the Department. By way of example, she described in detail eleven \"specific acts of discrimination.\" Not included in the Charge was her allegation that Chief Hurt denied Minze's request that her leave be extended until she could come back to work full duty. Counsel for the Department cross-examined Minze about the Charge she filed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: ... And it's pretty detailed. It talks a lot about your issues with Chief Hurt.

Right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: But that's one of your four major acts of retaliation that you're claiming here. Right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: That I was-yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: But this document includes all of the acts of discrimination and retaliation that you experienced from the Department of Public Safety. Right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: I don't think it includes all of them. This is a summary, my understanding of this is a summary to create the charge, and then the Commission on Human Rights would do an investigation into this and get more information as it went.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q: And then where in here did you put anything about asking Chief Hurt for leave?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A: I don't think that that is one of the things that mentions specifically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q: But you knew it was an act of retaliation when he turned down the leave.

Right? The leave as an act of retaliation, it's not in your charge of discrimination?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: You were writing down all the acts of discrimination and retaliation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q: And one of the last things that happened to you is that you were cleaning out your office and Todd Hurt told you you cannot have any more leave. Right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A: He told me he would not hold my position, which was a Capitol Police policy as well as a personnel rule, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q: And you knew immediately when he told you that that was because of your grievance; that was further retaliation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: But even though you knew it immediately, this is further retaliation, [you] didn't include it in your charge of discrimination?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A: I did not. I did not put everything in there. Like I said, it was my understanding, this is the summary of the things and that once an investigation by the department-or the Commission on Human Rights, then I could go into any more detail that I needed to on anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Minze testified that she knew at the time she made her Charge that she believed Chief Hurt's denial of her leave was a major act of retaliation and that it was one of the four acts of retaliation in response to her sex discrimination complaint. The Department could properly impeach her credibility by challenging her testimony that she asked Chief Hurt for an additional leave without pay, and he denied her request for leave in lieu of termination, by cross-examining her concerning the omission of the incident from the Charge. For, the omission by a witness from prior statements of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of challenging the witness's trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence for the purpose of impeachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Point I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Point II-Closing Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In Minze's second point, she claims the trial court erred in overruling her objection to the Department's closing argument because the Department misstated the law concerning the standard of liability in retaliation cases under the MHRA. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Counsel on both sides of the bar are permitted wide latitude and discretion in referring to evidence and arguing inferences during closing argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Hemann v.

Therefore, we review the trial court's decision to overrule Minze's objection to this portion of the Department's closing argument for abuse of discretion; that is, \"we must determine whether [the Department's] counsel's comments, when interpreted in light of the entire record, were plainly unwarranted and clearly injurious to [Minze].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286648\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/127/706/#p710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the comments were neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Minze argues that by using words such as \"caused\" or \"because,\" in closing argument, the Department's counsel misstated the law as it relates to the correct causation standard in the present MHRA retaliation case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Under the MHRA, it is an unlawful discriminatory practice to retaliate \"in any manner\" against an employee who \"has filed a complaint ... pursuant to this chapter.\" \u00a7 213.070(2).

The trial court then interrupted counsel's closing argument and took a short recess because one juror fell ill.

Minze's counsel objected on the grounds that the argument misstated the law. The trial court overruled the objection.

In addition, in Minze's First\n   Amended Petition, she alleges that \"[a]\n   <em>\n    causal\n   </em>\n   relationship existed between Plaintiff's MHRA protected sex discrimination complaint and the denial of her light duty requests[,] ... the termination of her employment[,] ... the denial of her request for an unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination[,] ... and the adoption of the 'Minze policy' denying her the right to reinstatement with [Missouri Capitol Police] at the same rank and pay she held on the date of her termination.\" Hence, both the Missouri Supreme Court and Minze recognize words like \"cause\" or \"causal\" constitute broad terms that\n   <em>\n    encompass\n   </em>\n   the specific \"contributing factor\" standard for liability. In other words, the \"contributing factor\" standard is neither distinct from nor in tension with the requirement of \"causation.\" By specifically referencing the \"contributing factor\" standard in closing argument, followed by more general and generic terms, such as \"caused\" or \"because,\" the Department's counsel did not make statements that were \"plainly unwarranted\" in the context in which they were used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, Minze cannot demonstrate that any alleged misstatement of the law by the Department's counsel's closing argument statements were \"clearly injurious\" to Minze.

The jury was instructed on the \"contributing factor\" standard in Instruction Number 6:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Instruction No. 6, your verdict must be for plaintiff if you believe, first, plaintiff complained of employment discrimination based on sex and, second, defendant either denied plaintiff's light-duty request or denied plaintiff's request to remain on unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination or discharged plaintiff or changed Missouri Capitol Police policy number B-1 in order to make plaintiff ineligible for reinstatement as a lieutenant with Missouri Capitol Police and, third, plaintiff's complaint of employment discrimination based on sex was a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     contributing factor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in such denial of plaintiff's light-duty request, such denial of plaintiff's request to remain on unpaid leave of absence in lieu of termination, such discharge or such change in Missouri Capitol Police policy number B-1 in order to make plaintiff ineligible for reinstatement as a lieutenant with Missouri Capitol Police and, four, that as a direct result of such conduct, plaintiff sustained damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The trial court read the instruction to the jury, and the written instruction was available to the jury in the jury room. \"The jury is bound to follow the trial court's instructions[,] and we presume that it will even to the extent that doing so might require the jury to ignore specific argument of counsel in conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094198\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/399/850/#p861\">\n    399 S.W.3d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In light of the entire record, the Department's counsel's comments were not plainly unwarranted and were not clearly injurious to Minze. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Minze's objection to the Department's closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Point III-Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In Minze's third point, one needs a score card to figure out \"who's on first base.\" As we understand the less-than-straightforward argument of the point relied on, though she never complained to this court\n   that we lacked jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   , apparently due to an alleged defect in the Department's notice of appeal in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   , she now claims that, in fact, our court had no jurisdiction to issue our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   and it is void; likewise, all proceedings by the trial court upon remand are equally void. Hence, though the remedy sought by Minze in this point is unclear, we presume that she is presently: (1) requesting that we recall the mandate of\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   due to jurisdictional defect; (2) order that all proceedings in the retrial of this case be deemed void-including the judgment after the jury retrial; (3) order reinstatement of the original judgment prior to the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   ; and (4) dismiss the present appeal for a continuing lack of appellate jurisdiction. Aside from noting that there are a host of procedural anomalies and lack of substantive support for the claims made by Minze in this point, we find that wading into this discussion is unnecessary as the record refutes any claim of procedural defect in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   ; hence, the underlying basis for Minze's present jurisdictional complaint does not exist, and her point on appeal must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Rule 81.04(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   If an appeal is permitted by law from a trial court, a party may appeal from a judgment, decree, or order by filing with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal. No such appeal shall be effective unless the notice of appeal shall be filed not later than ten days after the judgment, decree, or order appealed from becomes final.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   When a party submits the notice of appeal to the trial court clerk, the clerk \"shall note the date a notice of appeal was received if it is accompanied by: (1) The docket fee; or (2) A statement citing specific statutory or other authority demonstrating a docket fee is not required by law; or (3) A motion to prosecute the appeal in forma pauperis.\" Rule 81.04(e). \"A notice of appeal received by the trial court clerk with a docket fee or with a statement demonstrating no docket fee is required is deemed filed on the date the clerk receives it.\" Rule 81.04(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The timely filing of a notice of appeal and the paying of the docket fee are jurisdictional requirements for an effective appeal,\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

On January 17, 2013, the Department filed its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial, which was denied on January 30, 2013. Within ten days of that date, on February 7, 2013, it is undisputed that the Cole County Circuit Court clerk received a letter from the Missouri Attorney General enclosing the Department's notice of appeal and advising that \"No docket fee accompanies this filing. No docket fee is required because this is an appeal by a Department of the State.\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

The Case.net docket entry for that date reflects that the notice of appeal was filed and that \"No Filing Fee Due.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The undisputed procedural history of the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   reflects that the Department timely filed its notice of appeal, which was accompanied by a letter\n   containing case authority demonstrating that a docket fee was not required by law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Department satisfied the jurisdictional requirements for an effective appeal in\n   <em>\n    Minze I\n   </em>\n   .
