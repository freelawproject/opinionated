Around this time, he began to use \"general pornography.\" He continued using \"general pornography\" exclusively until he became 19, at which time, the content's stimulating effects had greatly diminished. In response, \"he moved on to more deviant pornography, which included exposure to child pornography.\" Several years later, \"in the neighborhood of about 2002 or [2003],\" he began living with his sister, her partner, and her partner's daughter (\"K.W.\"). K.W. was five years old when J.D.B. began having sexual contact with her. Dr. Rick Scott, a licensed psychologist, described how the sexual contact escalated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   It progressed over two and a half years of putting his finger inside her vagina, having her kiss him, or he would kiss her. Having her masturbate him with her hand, and on one occasion, making her perform oral sex on him. This went on on a very regular basis, two to three times per week, when he was in the home ... he was routinely sexually abusing her ... until around 2005 when he was arrested for possession of child pornography and removed from the home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.D.B. was on probation from 2005 through 2008 for the possession of child pornography. During that time, K.W. disclosed that J.D.B. had committed sexual offenses against her. Ultimately, J.D.B. pleaded guilty to Child Molestation in the First Degree, resulting in him being imprisoned until 2011, when he was paroled. Before being paroled, J.D.B. completed a Missouri Sexual Offender Treatment Program. J.D.B.'s parole was revoked in 2012 due to using child pornography. J.D.B. admitted that he resumed masturbating to fantasies of children as recently as five months before the trial for the current case, despite receiving treatment beforehand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 16, 2013, the State filed a petition seeking the civil commitment of J.D.B. as a sexually violent predator under the SVPA, \u00a7\u00a7 632.480-632.525.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385030\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/229/#p231\">\n    521 S.W.3d at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A jury trial was held from March 28-30, 2016, in the Lincoln County Circuit Court, Probate Division. The jury concluded that J.D.B. qualified as a SVP under the SVPA, and the court ordered that J.D.B. be \"committed to the custody of the director of the Department\n   of Mental Health for control, case and treatment until such time as [J.D.B.'s] mental abnormality has so changed that he is safe to be at large.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court's judgment was initially appealed to our Court under Case Number ED104442 in May of 2016. On January 1, 2017, J.D.B. filed an application to transfer the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri pursuant to Rule 83.01, explaining that this case \"presents constitutional challenges to the statutory provisions of the SVP Act identical to the issues presented\" in two matters that were then-pending before the Court:\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12382330\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/520/443/#p448\">\n    520 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   443 and\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385030\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/229/#p231\">\n    521 S.W.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On February 8, 2017, our Supreme Court granted J.D.B.'s transfer request (case number: SC96221). On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court of Missouri retransferred the cause to our Court under Case Number ED104442-01 in light of its disposition of\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   . The retransferred cause is the focus of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Dr. Rick Scott\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, the State largely relied on the testimony of Dr. Rick Scott to make its case for the commitment of J.D.B. In fact, Dr. Scott was the only witness called by the State. Dr. Scott has a PhD in Clinical Psychology, and he has been a licensed Psychologist in Missouri since 1992. Dr. Scott interviewed J.D.B. for four hours on March 11, 2014. He also reviewed approximately 3,800 pages of records related to J.D.B.'s history. Dr. Scott noted that these are the types of records that are \"reasonably relied on by professionals in [his] field in assessing a person's mental condition and risk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Additionally, Dr. Scott used three types of \"instruments generally relied on by professionals in [his] field [for] assessing a person's future risk of sexual offending\": the Static 99, the Static 2002, and the Stable 2007. These instruments are \"actuarial assessments\" that try to measure an individual's risk of reoffending based on a variety of factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Sohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836494\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/225/#p228\">\n    473 S.W.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (Mo. App. E.D. 2015). On the Static 99, J.D.B. received a raw score of 6, which is classified as being in the \"high-risk\" of reoffending category and placed J.D.B. in the 94\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   percentile among sex offenders. Dr. Scott explained that this test could be interpreted as meaning, \"if you have 100 sex offenders in the room, 93 are less risky than [J.D.B.].\" On the Static 2002 assessment, J.D.B. received a raw score of 6, placing him in the 88\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   percentile and in the high-risk category. Dr. Scott noted that the Static 99 and Static 2002 had a lot of similarities, but the Stable 2007 was \"very different,\" in terms of which variables were used in computing a score.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the Stable 2007, J.D.B. scored a 14 out of 26, which also put him in the high-risk category. Dr. Scott also noted that the 5-year recidivism rate of someone with the same score as J.D.B. (from the Static 99 test) would be \"in the neighborhood of 20.5 percent,\" with the recidivism rate meaning the person was \"rearrested or reconvicted in five years.\" Nonetheless, Dr. Scott concluded J.D.B. was \"more likely than not\" to commit a sexually violent offense if he was not committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Scott explained the apparent discrepancy. First, Dr. Scott noted that \"sex offenders don't get caught, reported, arrested and convicted at a very high rate.\" Thus, the 5-year recidivism rate from the\n   assessment underestimates the number of sexually violent offenses that are actually committed during that 5-year period, as the data does not capture offenses that do not lead to arrests or convictions. Moreover, Dr. Scott explained that the score vastly underestimates the \"potential lifetime risk\" for reoffending, as the 20.5 percent metric only accounts for a 5-year period. He testified that although the likelihood of reoffending declines after the first 5-year period, the total likelihood of reoffending over the course of the offender's life is much higher than 20.5 percent on average. For example, he estimates the number would increase to about 30 percent likelihood of being rearrested or reconvicted if measured over a 10-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Taking everything into account, Dr. Scott explained his concern of J.D.B. repeating predatory acts of sexual violence if he was not committed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I believe that in [J.D.B.'s] mind right now he actually does not want to perpetrate against another child. I definitely believe that. But my concern, as I look at this case and I look at the risk factors and I look at his behavior when he had the opportunity to apply his treatment, I don't believe that he's going to be able to manage his behavior in a way that's going to protect potential victims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Scott noted that J.D.B.'s inability to avoid child pornography when he was on parole was a cause for concern. He had accessed the child pornography while he lived with his parents, which led to his parole being revoked. His parents kept the computer in their room and prohibited him from using the computer. Typically, the parents would lock their room when they were not in the house. J.D.B. found where the key was hidden, and he would unlock the door and use the computer to view child pornography while his parents were out of the house. Dr. Scott explained this was worrisome because it shows J.D.B. was unable to apply what he knew from the Missouri Sexual Offender Treatment Program to refrain from accessing such content. Additionally, the threat of parole revocation did not deter him from viewing child pornography. Dr. Scott also believed that child pornography was \"his path to a contact offense to a new victim,\" because he believed that J.D.B.'s viewing of such pornography was influential in the predatory acts committed against K.W. Dr. Scott noted that J.D.B. had continued to escalate his behavior to satiate his needs: he began by viewing child pornography, he then began fondling K.W. over her clothes, and \"it got more and more intrusive\" as time progressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Scott ultimately concluded, \"[i]t is my opinion to a reasonable degree of certainty that [J.D.B.] suffers from a mental abnormality and that that mental abnormality does make him more likely than not to commit predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined to a secure facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Testimony of J.D.B.'s Witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Four witnesses were called on J.D.B.'s behalf: Pastor Bob Ingle, J.D.B.'s father (\"Father\"), Dr. Louis Rosell, and J.D.B. testified on his own behalf. These four witnesses covered many of the same subjects, including the history and development of J.D.B.'s interest in children, his progress in controlling this interest, as well as his educational and social struggles throughout his life. As the evidence adduced at trial is most pertinent to our analysis under Point V (whether the State made a submissible case) and we disregard any evidence that does not support the jury's verdict, we will limit our discussion here and adduce the particulars of these witnesses' testimony as they become relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Point I-Burden of Proof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In J.D.B.'s first point on appeal, he claims the trial court erred in giving Instruction 5 to the jury because it only required a \"clear and convincing\" burden of proof, but SVP proceedings are \"punitive,\" and therefore require a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" burden of proof to satisfy due process. This argument has recently been addressed by the Supreme Court of Missouri in\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   , and it controls the outcome of Point I.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

Exhibits 31 and 33 are quarterly reports written by Clossum, which included his opinions on J.D.B.'s progress from October of 2011 through March of 2012. Section 337.540 generally defines when communications between a person and a licensed professional counselor\n   are considered privileged communications:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Any communication made by any person to a licensed professional counselor in the course of professional services rendered by the licensed professional counselor shall be deemed a privileged communication and the licensed professional counselor shall not be examined or be made to testify to any privileged communication without the prior consent of the person who received his professional services, except in violation of the criminal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The State contends that \"[t]he legislature, aware of this privilege and others, drafted a provision in the SVPA that abrogated this privilege [by enacting \u00a7 632.510].\" Section 632.510 reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   In order to protect the public, relevant information and records which are otherwise confidential or privileged shall be released to the agency with jurisdiction or the attorney general for the purpose of meeting the notice requirement provided in section 632.483 or 632.484 and determining whether a person is or continues to be a sexually violent predator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Whether the trial court properly interpreted and applied \u00a7 337.540 and \u00a7 632.510 is relevant to determining if the trial court erred. Nonetheless, to warrant reversal, J.D.B. bears the burden of establishing the trial court (1) committed an error and (2) said error was prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    Murrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329118\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/96/#p109\">\n    215 S.W.3d at 109-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We cannot find, and J.D.B. has not directed us to, any piece of non-cumulative information that may have changed the result if it had been excluded. Exhibit 27 merely provided a one-page summary of events relevant to the SVP proceedings, such as when J.D.B. became aware of his sexual attraction to children, his two prior criminal offenses, his receipt of parole and its subsequent revocation, and the like. The quarterly progress reports (Exhibits 31 and 33) were similarly duplicative. The reports discussed his church attendance, his limited social circle and support system outside of his family, his difficulty in taking lessons from treatment and applying them in a practical manner, his troubles with being honest during counseling sessions, and the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Evidence that reiterates the same point is \"cumulative.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

(\"DSM-5\"). After reviewing thousands of pages of J.D.B.'s history and interviewing him for four hours, Dr. Scott diagnosed J.D.B. with Pedophilic Disorder as it is defined in DSM-5. Dr. Scott testified that the DSM-5 had been adopted by the Department of Mental Health in 2015. He further testified that the DSM-5 is a manual generally accepted in the field of Psychiatry and Psychology for the purposes of diagnosing an individual's mental condition. Dr. Scott's testimony was sufficient to establish that J.D.B. suffered from Pedophilic Disorder, which \"alone satisfies the 'mental abnormality' standard\" of\n   \u00a7 632.480(2).\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   , 519 S.W.3d at 876.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Element 3-Likelihood of recommitting predatory acts of sexual violence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   J.D.B. contends that the State failed to show he would more likely than not commit predatory acts of sexual violence unless he is committed. J.D.B. notes that Dr. Scott relied on three actuarial instruments in forming his opinion, and although they may help assess future risk of \"sexual offending,\" they do not help capture \"the statutorily required risk of [committing] '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     predatory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   acts of sexual violence.' \" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Here, Dr. Scott provided great detail about why he concluded that J.D.B. is \"more likely than not\" to recommit predatory acts of sexual violence if not committed, as well as his bases for reaching an informed conclusion. For example, Dr. Scott testified that he reviewed thousands of pages of records related to J.D.B.'s history. Dr. Scott also noted that he interviewed J.D.B. for four hours on March 11, 2014. Moreover, Dr. Scott explained that he used three different risk-assessment instruments to aid him in reaching his ultimate conclusion: the Static 99, the Static 2002, and the Stable 2007. Dr. Scott testified that all three instruments are \"generally relied on by professionals in [his] field ... in assessing a person's future risk for sexual offending.\" Dr. Scott explained that all three tests returned consistent results, placing J.D.B. in the \"high risk\" category of reoffending. He further explained the level of risk by stating J.D.B. was placed in the 94\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   percentile among sex offenders according to the Static 99 and in the 88\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   percentile among sex offenders based on the Static 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Briefly, J.D.B. points out the actuarial instruments predicted there was approximately a 20.5 % chance of J.D.B. being rearrested or reconvicted within five years unless he was securely confined. However, J.D.B. does not challenge Dr. Scott's bases for concluding that number grossly underestimates the life-time potential risk of reoffending. Dr. Scott testified that reconviction and rearrest rates would continue to grow-albeit at a declining rate-after the initial 5-year period; for example, he estimated the average rate of reconviction or rearrest for someone with J.D.B.'s scores would increase to 30 % over the first 10-year period if he were not committed. Dr. Scott also explained that sex offenses are more likely to go unreported or unprosecuted than most offenses, which is especially true with \"child victims.\" He noted that victims are less likely to come forward and report the offense. Additionally, Dr. Scott explained \"sex offenses are hard to prosecute because of the consequence for the victim.\" Thus, Dr. Scott concluded that \"sex offenses ultimately get convictions at a ... substantially lower rate than they occur,\" and the disparity is even greater when the victim is a child. Therefore, the facts that the instruments estimated a 20.5 % 5-year probability of reoffending and Dr. Scott predicted J.D.B. was \"more likely than not\" to recommit predatory acts of sexual violence were consistent, not contradictory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   J.D.B. also contends that these future risk assessments look solely at the risk of reoffending, while \u00a7 632.480 requires risk to be assessed in terms of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     predatory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   acts of sexual violence. \"Predatory\" means \"acts directed towards individuals ... for the primary purpose of victimization.\" \u00a7 632.480(3). Missouri appellate courts have found that there must be evidence that the individual in question is more likely than not to commit predatory acts of sexual violence, and the submissibility of the case hinges on this predatory component.\n   <em>\n    In re Care &amp; Treatment of Morgan v.

Dr. Scott explained that Missouri law defines \"sexually violent predator\" as \"any person who suffers from a mental abnormality, which makes the person more likely than not to engage in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     predatory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   acts of sexual violence, if not confined in a secure facility ...\" (emphasis added).

Like the Western District found in\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   , the expert testimony provided in J.D.B.'s case was sufficient to support a finding that J.D.B. was more likely than not to commit predatory acts of sexual violence unless he was confined in a secure facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   J.D.B. also contends that\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   supports reversal.

Accordingly, the State had made a submissible case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In the present case, Dr. Scott also provided extensive testimony explaining the bases for his opinion. Dr. Scott testified that it was \"[his] opinion that as a result of [J.D.B.'s] mental abnormality, he is more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility,\" and he arrived at that conclusion \"within a reasonable degree of psychological certainty.\" Multiple times throughout his testimony, Dr. Scott explained that he concluded J.D.B. suffered from a mental abnormality (Pedophilic Disorder), and as a result of his mental abnormality, it was more likely than not that J.D.B. would commit predatory acts of sexual violence if he was not confined to a secure facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The jury was also presented with the opportunity to further evaluate J.D.B. when he took the stand. Throughout\n   J.D.B.'s testimony, he expressed that unfulfilled emotional and physical needs triggered his behaviors of viewing child pornography and offending against K.W. He also explained that certain \"lifestyle risk factors\" contributed to his offending, such as his difficulty in having healthy relationships or holding a job. He also testified that while he was in relationships with women, his interest in child pornography diminished; for example, during a one-year relationship with a woman in the early 2000's, he testified he did not view pornography at all. At the time of that relationship, he had been living in Iowa and not offending against any children. Upon deciding he wanted to end the relationship with the woman, he moved back to Missouri. After he returned, he began to reoffend against K.W. and use child pornography again. On cross-examination, J.D.B. conceded that if he was not committed, he would have a difficult time getting a job, establishing an intimate relationship with an adult, and having his emotional needs met in general because of his status as a convicted sex offender. J.D.B. further acknowledged that these issues were why he \"continued to turn to [both child and adult] pornography even when [he] was out on parole [.]\" J.D.B.'s own testimony could further support a reasonable jury's determination that he would be more likely than not to reoffend against a child if not committed to a confined facility.
