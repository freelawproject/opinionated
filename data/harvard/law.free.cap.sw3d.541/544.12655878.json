Wilson, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Matthew Fogerty (\"Fogerty\") filed a personal injury suit against his co-employee, Larry Meyer (\"Meyer\"), for injuries he sustained while they were working together to build a fountain. The trial court sustained Meyer's motion for summary judgment. Fogerty appealed, and this Court has jurisdiction under article V, section 10, of the Missouri Constitution. The circuit court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fogerty was employed by Wright Construction Company (\"Employer\"). In October 2011, Fogerty was assigned to work at Logan College. When he arrived for work, he was assigned to work with Meyer to install a fountain. Neither Meyer nor Fogerty knew how to install a fountain. Employer provided them with blueprints but no detailed instructions for how to construct the fountain. To install the fountain, Fogerty and Meyer were required to move large stones. Meyer decided to use a front loader to move the stones even though he had never used a front loader in that manner before. He suggested they use a strap to sling a stone beneath one of the front loader's forks. Meyer then asked Fogerty to walk beside the stone to keep it from swinging as Meyer drove the front loader up a roughly graded, muddy area of the construction site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While they were moving one of the stones, Fogerty stepped beneath the forks while steadying the stone. As he did so, Fogerty was looking forward and had his back to Meyer in the cab of the front loader. Unexpectedly, Meyer allowed the forks to drop. He yelled a warning to Fogerty, but a fork hit Fogerty in the back and drove him to his knees. Fogerty was able to continue working that day, but he was unable to return to work the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fogerty later filed and settled a workers' compensation claim for injuries he sustained to his back and right knee. Then Fogerty filed this personal injury suit against Meyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meyer moved for summary judgment, asserting he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Fogerty failed to show Meyer breached a duty separate and distinct from Employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace. The circuit court agreed and granted summary judgment in Meyer's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Parr v.

He chose to use the front loader in a manner with which he was both untrained and unfamiliar, and he put Fogerty in harm's way by allowing him to stand beneath one of the forks to steady the stone slung beneath the other fork while Meyer drove the front loader across the job site. Under these facts, because Employer failed to provide a safe manner and means to install the fountain, both Meyer's negligence in deciding how to do so and Fogerty's resulting injury were reasonably foreseeable to Employer. Accordingly, Meyer's negligence was a breach of Employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace, not a breach of some duty \"separate and distinct\" from Employer's duty.

The only direction Employer provided was a blueprint of the fountain. Employer did not provide a safe method of work to complete their work assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While I disagree with any foreseeability analysis, I concur the facts and circumstances in this case demonstrate Employer did not provide a safe method of work to complete the work assignment. There was nothing in the record demonstrating Meyer took any action outside of Employer's nondelegable duties. The injuries Fogerty received, while regrettable, were from the tools furnished by Employer and due to the manner in which Employer's work was done; hence, this was all subsumed within Employer's nondelegable duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184254\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/500/288/#p292\">\n    500 S.W.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, I concur in the result only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Fogerty also sued his supervisor, Rick Armstrong, but this claim was dismissed without prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
