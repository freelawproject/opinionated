We reverse the trial court's order dismissing the indictment and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Doyal, a member of the Montgomery County Commissioners Court, was indicted for knowingly conspiring to circumvent the provisions of TOMA by meeting in a number less than a quorum for the purpose of secret deliberations \"by engaging in a verbal exchange concerning an issue within the jurisdiction of the Montgomery County Commissioners Court, namely, the contents of the potential structure of a November 2015 Montgomery County Road Bond[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20551.143\">\n    Tex. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 551.143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). Doyal filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, asserting that section 551.143 is facially unconstitutional because it violates the free speech provisions of the First Amendment and is vague and overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Doyal\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserted that he, a county commissioner, and a political consultant met with representatives of a local political action committee (\"PAC\") to discuss placing a road bond referendum on the November 2015 ballot, and as a result of the meeting, a memorandum of understanding was produced, in which the Texas Patriots PAC promised its political support for putting a road bond proposal on the commissioners' special meeting agenda. According to Doyal,\n   he posted the agenda for a special meeting of the Commissioners Court, and citizens praised the commissioners' work at the special meeting and thanked them for putting a road bond on the ballot. Doyal asserted that the county attorney wrote him a letter stating that the commissioners had complied with the requirements of TOMA, and voters passed the bond in the November election. Doyal alleged that the discussions between himself, the other commissioner, the consultant, and the members of the PAC were not a meeting under TOMA and were not intended to be an agreement to conspire to avoid TOMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his motion to dismiss, Doyal argued that section 551.143 of the Texas Government Code burdens free speech and is subject to strict construction. According to Doyal, the statute facially \"does not make sense [ ]\" because \"[m]eeting in numbers of less than a quorum does not violate a statute that requires a quorum to meet in open session.\" Doyal contended that because TOMA applies only to specific speech by public officials, it is a content-based penal regimen subject to review under strict scrutiny. According to Doyal's motion to dismiss, section 551.143 is constitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech when judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. Doyal further asserted that section 551.143 is vague and confusing because the terms \"conspire\" and \"secret\" are not defined, and the statute fails to explain what kind of \"deliberations\" are covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's response in the trial court asserted that section 551.143 is \"both constitutional and enforceable.\" According to the State, section 551.143 is content neutral because \"it does not restrict speech based on specific content, but simply requires that the disclosure of the speech take place in an open forum.\" The State asserted that the purpose of section 551.143 is to control the effects of closed meetings, including decreased transparency, encouragement of fraud or corruption, and increased mistrust in governmental entities. In addition, although the State argued that intermediate scrutiny is the proper standard for reviewing section 551.143, the State contended that even if the strict scrutiny standard applied, section 551.143 meets that test because \"it is narrowly tailored and serves a compelling state interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court held a hearing, but heard no testimony regarding the underlying facts. Rather, Doyal's witnesses offered opinion testimony regarding their interpretations of section 551.143, the challenges it poses, and its constitutionality. The trial judge signed an order granting Doyal's motion to dismiss the indictment. No party requested the trial court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and none were filed. The State then filed this appeal, in which it raises two issues for our consideration: (1) the trial court erred by dismissing the indictment on the ground that section 551.143 is facially unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous, and (2) the trial court erred by dismissing the indictment on the ground that section 551.143 facially violates the First Amendment and is overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Whether a statute is facially constitutional is a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951634\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/10/#p14\">\n    424 S.W.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14 (Tex.

As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Poe\n   </em>\n   , the terms at issue have a plain meaning. \"Conspire\" is commonly understood to mean \"to make an agreement with a group and in secret to do some act (as to commit treason or a crime or carry out a treacherous deed): plot together[.]\" Webster's Third International Dictionary 485 (2002). \"Circumvent\" means \"to overcome or avoid the intent, effect, or force of: anticipate and escape, check, or defeat by ingenuity or stratagem: make inoperative or nullify the purpose or power of esp. by craft or scheme [.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793199\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/491/348/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793199\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/491/348/\">\n    at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Secret\" means \"kept from knowledge or view: concealed, hidden\" and \"done or undertaken with evident purpose of concealment[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Doyal asserts that because chapter 551 defines \"deliberation\" as a verbal exchange during a meeting between a quorum of members concerning an issue within the jurisdiction of the governmental body or any public business, yet section 551.143 refers to deliberations of less than a quorum, the statute is unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20551.001\">\n    Tex.
