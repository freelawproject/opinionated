Appellee Eric Cornelius Norris, Jr. was charged with capital murder in the course of a robbery. The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress his confession based on a finding that appellee had unequivocally and unambiguously invoked his right to counsel during questioning. Concluding that appellee did not, in fact, unequivocally and unambiguously invoke his right to counsel, we reverse the trial court's order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Interrogation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 31, 2014, appellee was interrogated by Detective Allen Mutchler and then by Detective Henry Garza, both of the Stafford Police Department, concerning a murder that occurred during the course of a robbery. At the beginning of the recorded interview, appellee answered Mutchler's standard booking questions, and Mutchler read appellee his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p479\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p479\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p479\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). Appellee stated that he understood his rights and agreed to talk to Mutchler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For over an hour, Mutchler questioned appellee about his links to other individuals, past criminal history, and ownership or possession of firearms. Mutchler also pressed appellee to tell him about the robbery, whose idea it was, how it transpired. Mutchler told appellee that he was not going to walk out a free man because they knew that appellee was involved but appellee might mitigate his punishment by cooperating. Appellee insisted that he did not know anything, but he also asked Mutchler questions, such as \"so, basically, if I can't come up with a story my charges go[ ] to capital?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   About an hour and twenty minutes into the interrogation, appellee mentioned wanting to make a telephone call, and he mentioned obtaining a lawyer. It is this part of the interrogation that formed the basis of appellee's motion to suppress, which the trial court granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At times, the audio quality of the videotape makes it\n   difficult to determine the precise words appellant used. The videotape and a transcript of it were admitted into evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress, but no witness testified. The most relevant portion of the transcript reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellee:\n   </strong>\n   Am I gonna be here all day doin' this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Mutchler:\n   </strong>\n   It looks like. I was hopin' you'd get tired of it and tell me the truth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellee:\n   </strong>\n   I'm just ready to make my phone call.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Mutchler:\n   </strong>\n   You don't like talking to me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellee:\n   </strong>\n   Oh, it's okay talking to you. I'm just sayin' I can talk to you. I just want to make a phone call and call my sister and see if she could-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Mutchler:\n   </strong>\n   Well, not 'til we're through here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellee:\n   </strong>\n   Well, give me a lawyer or something 'cause I'm not sure I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mutchler then asked appellee whether he would be able to post a bail bond and told appellee that he would be able to make a phone call when he returned to the jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his findings of fact, the trial judge found that the transcript accurately reflected the last line excerpted above: \"Well, give me a lawyer or something 'cause I'm not sure I have.\" And on the basis of that line, the judge concluded that appellee had \"unequivocally and unambiguously invoked his right to counsel.\" However, our review of the videotape reveals that the relevant exchange between appellee and Mutchler ended as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellee:\n   </strong>\n   Oh, it's okay talking to you. I'm just sayin,' I can talk to you, I just want to make a phone call and call my sister and see if she could-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Mutchler:\n   </strong>\n   Well, not 'til we're through here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellee:\n   </strong>\n   ... go get me a lawyer or something 'cause that's the only option I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As illustrated, Mutchler speaks over and interrupts appellee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sometime after this exchange and further questioning by Mutchler, Mutchler left the interrogation room. Garza entered the room shortly thereafter, and, ultimately, appellee acknowledged that he had caused a person's death during the commission of a robbery. In his motion to suppress, appellee complained of the continued interrogation after he mentioned obtaining a lawyer and that Garza did not again read appellee's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights when he began questioning appellee. The trial court granted the motion based on the alleged invocation of counsel and therefore suppressed all appellee's statements after he mentioned obtaining counsel. The trial court further found that the break between Mutchler's interrogation and Garza's did not warrant a new reading of appellee's rights. This State's appeal concerns only the alleged invocation of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Governing Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard.\n   <em>\n    Delafuente v.
