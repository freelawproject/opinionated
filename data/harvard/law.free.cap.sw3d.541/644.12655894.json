CLAYTON III, Judge\n   B.B. (\"Appellant\") appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Methodist Church of Shelbina, Missouri (\"the Shelbina Church\" or \"the Church\") and the Missouri Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church (\"the Conference\") (collectively, \"Respondents\") on Appellant's action seeking compensatory and punitive damages relating to sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of the Shelbina Church's former youth director. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Uncontroverted Facts Giving Rise to this Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal involves claims against two entities within the United Methodist Church. The first is the Shelbina Church, a local church which is comprised of an autonomous and self-governing congregation. The Church is a separate and distinct Missouri non-profit corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Conference, a Missouri non-profit corporation, provides structure for the practice of \"conferencing\" for the clergy and lay members of the United Methodist Church. Clergy and lay members of local churches are Conference members, not the local churches themselves. The Conference only manages and supervises activities that it organizes; it has no supervisory authority over local churches. Specifically relevant to this appeal, the Conference has no supervisory authority over hiring and firing decisions of local United Methodist churches, including those of the Shelbina Church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Shelbina Church's Hiring of Christopher Sprinkel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2003 or 2004, the administrative board for the Shelbina Church decided the Church needed to hire a full-time youth director. The position was advertised, and the Church received applications from several interested candidates. One of these applicants was Christopher Sprinkel, who provided the Shelbina Church with his resume and a reference letter. Although Sprinkel's most recent employer listed on the resume was the Sugar Creek United Methodist Church, the Shelbina Church did not contact his supervisor or any other member of that church. Further, the Shelbina Church did nothing to determine the accuracy of the information contained in Sprinkel's resume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the hiring process, the Shelbina Church's pastor, Virgil Clow (\"Pastor Clow\"), obtained a criminal background check on Sprinkel from a company called ScreenNow. The ScreenNow search revealed \"[n]o record found\" on a \"State Sexual Offender Search in [Illinois]\" and \"[n]o record found\" on a \"National Criminal File Search.\" The Church relied on the ScreenNow report although it included a disclaimer that accuracy was not guaranteed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After applications for the youth director position were collected and reviewed by Pastor Clow, they were passed along to the Church's Pastor-Parish Relations Committee. The Pastor-Parish Relations Committee then reviewed the applications, conducted interviews of three applicants, and ultimately selected Sprinkel for the job. The decision to hire a youth director, and specifically to hire Sprinkel, was made by members of the Shelbina Church without knowledge or involvement of the Conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Sprinkel's Employment with the Shelbina Church\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sprinkel began working as the Shelbina Church's youth director in approximately June 2004. Sprinkel was assisted in this position by the assistant youth director, Dee Ide, and was supervised by Pastor Clow on behalf of the Shelbina Church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sprinkel's duties included planning and coordinating children's and youth programs and activities with a goal towards growing the Church's youth ministry so as to ultimately expand its membership as a whole. Sprinkel's job as the youth director contained a religious component as it involved educating children on the religious doctrine of the United Methodist Church, planning literature for the youth to study, praying with the children, and reading scripture from the Bible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To effectuate the position's goals and duties, Sprinkel established an after-school youth program at the Shelbina Church that was held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during the school year. The after-school program was designed to give youth of the Church a place to go and \"hang out\" after school. Sprinkel also conducted a more formal youth group on Sunday evenings, which had a greater focus on religious studies than the after-school program. Additionally, every fifth Sunday of a month was designated \"Youth Sunday\" and Sprinkel gave the sermon to the full congregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Shelbina Church determined Sprinkel's continued employment as the youth director would be conditioned upon being \"Safe Sanctuaries\" certified. The Conference, which among other things, conducts statewide meetings and camping trips for youth, developed the Safe Sanctuaries certification program to screen and train adults who worked or volunteered at Conference events to help ensure the proper care and treatment of the children or youth who attend those events. The Safe Sanctuaries program was also offered as a model to local churches to help them develop their own policies and programs to prevent child abuse. While Safe Sanctuaries certification requires, in addition to training, that all persons participating in Conference events submit to a background screening, the screening \"was intended to only be used as a screening device for Conference activities.\" The Safe Sanctuaries program was not intended to be used by local churches to screen their own employees or volunteers for non-Conference activities, and the Conference instructed churches not to use it for non-Conference purposes. However, the Conference knew local churches were disregarding this warning and using the Safe Sanctuaries program to screen their own employees.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Sprinkel went through the Safe Sanctuaries program after he was hired by the Shelbina Church. His information was submitted to the Safe Sanctuaries program, and a background check was obtained by the Conference which disclosed: no criminal history or sex offender registration information on file with the Missouri State Highway Patrol; no employee disqualification list information on file with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services; no employee disqualification registry on file with the Missouri Department of Mental Health; and no child abuse or neglect information on file with the Missouri Department of Social Services. Sprinkel was also required to submit three reference forms to the Conference, including one from his employer and two additional references. Sprinkel submitted reference forms completed by Pastor Clow, who was his supervisor at the time he underwent the screening, as well as Allen Hickerson and Shawn Burnley. Each form submitted to the Conference rated Sprinkel as \"excellent\" or \"good\" in character, morality, ability to relate to youths, and ability to relate to children.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Conference\n    took no steps to follow up on the information contained in the reference forms, but instead accepted all positive or negative responses on the form and determined Sprinkel was Safe Sanctuaries certified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    In November 2004, the Shelbina Church adopted its own Safe Sanctuary policy (\"the Policy\"). Among other guidelines, the Policy included a provision that two adults should always be present during activities where youth or children were present. Pastor Clow took steps to enforce this Policy, such as checking on youth activities and questioning volunteers to ensure they were never alone with the children or youth. Sprinkel was aware of this Policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Appellant's Interactions with Sprinkel and the Incident Giving Rise to Appellant's Claims\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Sometime in the fall of 2005, Appellant began attending the Shelbina Church's after-school youth program, where Appellant would see Sprinkel approximately one or two times per week. Appellant, who was twelve years old at the time, attended the after-school program because his friends went, it was fun, and he could play video games and basketball.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    On the afternoon of January 6, 2006, Appellant's school was released early that day, so Sprinkel invited Appellant to come to his house to play video games until it was time to go to the Church's after-school program. Although Sprinkel's wife was present when Appellant first arrived, she left shortly thereafter to run an errand. During the time Sprinkel was alone with Appellant, Sprinkel showed Appellant pornography on the computer and touched Appellant's genitals. Immediately after, Appellant left Sprinkel's house, went home, and reported the incident to his father. Based on Sprinkel's actions against Appellant on January 6, 2006, Sprinkel was convicted by a jury of first-degree child molestation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Information Discovered after Sprinkel's Molestation of Appellant\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    After the allegations against Sprinkel came to light, Pastor Clow's wife, who also served as the Shelbina Church's secretary, conducted an internet search about Sprinkel. Ms. Clow found articles written before Sprinkel was hired by the Church that were about a prior criminal case filed against Sprinkel in the Circuit Court of Logan County, Illinois. Although Sprinkel was acquitted in the case, it involved an incident of sexual molestation of a child.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    After the incident involving Appellant occurred, Pastor Clow held meetings with some of the parents of children attending the Church's youth programs. As a result, Pastor Clow learned that in August 2005, Sprinkel invited at least two other boys from the Church's after-school program to his house and showed them pornography.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Relevant Procedural Posture\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Appellant filed his original petition alleging various claims against Respondents on January 7, 2013. During the course of the litigation, however, Appellant was twice granted leave of the court to file amended petitions. On December 10, 2015, Appellant filed his Second Amended Petition asserting the following ten claims: (I) child sexual abuse; (II) battery; (III) breach of fiduciary/confidential relationship; (IV) failure to supervise children; (V) negligent supervision of Sprinkel; (VI) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (VII) intentional failure to supervise Sprinkel; (VIII) breach of duty to adopt and implement preventative measures/failure to warn; (IX) fraud/misrepresentation;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    and (X) Restatement (Second) of Torts, section 324(A) (1965).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    <sup>\n     ,\n    </sup>\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Subsequently, Respondents each filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court ultimately granted and entered summary judgment in favor of Respondents on all of Appellant's remaining claims. This appeal followed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     II. DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Appellant raises six points on appeal, which we will discuss in the following order. In his third and sixth points on appeal, Appellant asserts the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to Counts III through VIII and Count X on First Amendment grounds.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    In his fifth point on appeal, Appellant maintains the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Count VII because the uncontroverted facts demonstrated Appellant could not establish an element of his claim. Then, in his first point on appeal, Appellant contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Counts I and II because it found the Church could not be held liable for Sprinkel's intentionally tortious acts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

Appellant advances four main arguments in support of this contention. First, Appellant argues the trial court erred in finding the Church was not liable for Sprinkel's acts because his misconduct was completely outside the course and scope of his employment with the Church. Second, he asserts the court erred in not imposing liability on the Church based on its employee, Dee Ide's failure to act on information given to her. Third, Appellant maintains the trial court erroneously found the Church could not be held liable for aiding and abetting Sprinkel's intentional torts under section 562.056.1 RSMo 2000.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    And fourth, he contends the trial court erred in finding the Church was not liable for aiding and abetting Sprinkel's child sexual abuse and battery under section 537.046 RSMo Supp. 2005.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    We address each argument in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Appellant's Argument about the Course and Scope of Sprinkel's Employment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Appellant argues the trial court erred in finding the Church was not liable because Sprinkel's misconduct was completely outside the course and scope of his employment with the Church. We agree with the trial court's finding without further explanation because the Missouri Supreme Court has specifically declared, \"intentional sexual misconduct ... [is] not within the scope of employment of a [church employee], and [is] in fact forbidden.\"\n    <em>\n     Gibson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11899328\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/952/239/#p246\">\n     952 S.W.2d at 246\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Appellant's Argument Relating to Dee Ide\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Appellant also maintains the trial court erred in not imposing liability on the Shelbina Church based on its employee, Dee Ide's failure to act on information given to her. Appellant argues the Church should\n    be held liable for aiding and abetting Sprinkel's child sexual abuse and battery because Ide \"had information concerning young boys being at Sprinkel's house, but she did nothing with that information.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Essentially, Appellant's true complaint is that Ide failed to act in a reasonable manner after hearing Sprinkel was inviting members of the Church youth to his house and if she had acted reasonably to report this information, Appellant would not have been molested. This argument does not describe an intentional act as alleged in Counts I and II but rather \"is nothing more than a reconstituted claim of negligence, the lack of cognizability of which we have already addressed and need not repeat.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ratigan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817590\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/481/36/#p41\">\n     481 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    54 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Section II.B. above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Appellant's Argument with Respect to Section 562.056.1\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Appellant additionally contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds Appellant could not establish the Shelbina Church was liable for aiding and abetting under section 562.056.1. This is the criminal statute under which Appellant pled his claims for Counts I and II,\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    alleging the Church was liable for aiding and abetting under section 562.056.1 for the following reasons:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    A. It failed to discharge the specific duty owed to [Appellant] to protect [Appellant] from harm while [Appellant] was a minor and in the custody and/or under the supervision of the Shelbina Church; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n    B. The childhood sexual abuse committed by Sprinkel was committed while he was an agent of the Shelbina Church and acting within the course and scope of his employment/agency relationship and on behalf of the Shelbina Church, and his offense was at least a misdemeanor under Missouri law.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Based on the uncontroverted facts before the trial court, it found the Shelbina Church could not be held civilly liable under this section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    On appeal, Appellant maintains the court erred in citing and relying on section 562.056.1 in granting summary judgment. However, we find that by framing his Counts I and II based on this statute, Appellant invited the error of which he now complains.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pierson v.

Appellant's Argument as to Section 537.046\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Lastly, Appellant argues the trial court erred in finding the Shelbina Church was not liable for aiding and abetting under section 537.046, which authorizes a civil action for damages related to injury or illness caused by a defendant's conduct of \"childhood sexual abuse.\" Section 537.046 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ratigan,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817590\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/481/36/#p41\">\n     481 S.W.3d at 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As defined by the statute, \"childhood sexual abuse\" is \"any act committed by the\n    defendant against the plaintiff which act occurred when the plaintiff was under the age of eighteen years and which act would have been a violation of [Missouri statutes criminalizing,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , rape, sodomy, or sexual abuse].\" Section 537.046.1(1);\n    <em>\n     see also, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , section 566.030 RSMo 2000; section 566.060 RSMo 2000; section 566.100 RSMo 2000. Appellant claims the Shelbina Church is liable under this section because it aided and abetted Sprinkel's sexual abuse of Appellant, and \"any civil action related to sexual abuse damages may be maintained pursuant to the language of [ section] 537.046.\" We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Ratigan\n    </em>\n    , the Western District was faced with a similar claim under section 537.046, in which a church parishioner alleged the Diocese was liable for aiding and abetting, or ratifying, a priest's violation of the statute.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817590\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/481/36/#p41\">\n     481 S.W.3d at 38-40, 52-54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In rejecting the claim, the Court found no authority existed to support the assertion that \"nonperpetrators\" could be held liable for a perpetrator's childhood sexual abuse under section 537.046.\n    <em>\n     Ratigan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817590\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/481/36/#p41\">\n     481 S.W.3d at 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court reasoned:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n    A 'nonperpetrator' defendant could not cause injury or illness by 'childhood sexual abuse,' as that term is defined, because such a defendant has not\n    <em>\n     committed\n    </em>\n    one of the enumerated acts. While Missouri law does hold an aider and abettor criminally liable to the same extent as the principal offender, section 537.046 does not enumerate the statute criminalizing aiding and abetting, [ section 562.041 RSMo 2000 ], as one of the acts that constitutes 'childhood sexual abuse.' Accordingly, we conclude that the Missouri legislature did not intend to subject nonperpetrator defendants to liability under section 537.046.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <em>\n     Ratigan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817590\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/481/36/#p41\">\n     481 S.W.3d at 53-54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis and quotations in original).
