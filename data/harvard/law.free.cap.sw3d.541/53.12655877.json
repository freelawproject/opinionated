He presents two points on appeal. First, he claims a reasonably competent attorney would have requested disqualification of the Cole County Prosecutor's Office or of a particular prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Second, he claims the trial court erred in finding that a particular prosecutor did not represent the State of Missouri at the guilty plea hearing. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
