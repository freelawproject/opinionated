Rubio Herrera (\"Father\"). Mother claims that the court erred in denying her request for an \"Order of Special Findings\" as to the parties' minor child (\"Son\") for purposes of applying for Special Immigrant Juvenile status with the federal government. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mother and Father were married on December 22, 1997, in El Salvador. The parties have two children, a daughter, born in 1996, and Son, born in 1998. Mother and Father separated in 2003, when Father abandoned the family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sometime in 2005, Mother left the children in the care of her mother in El Salvador and unlawfully entered the United States. She settled in Saline County, Missouri. Ten years later, in April 2015, Son unlawfully entered the country to reunify with Mother. Son was apprehended by immigration officials and placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. In May 2015, Son was released into Mother's custody pending disposition of his immigration case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nine months later, in February 2016, Mother filed a petition for dissolution of her marriage, pursuant to Chapter 452 RSMo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother, Father, and Son all are citizens of El Salvador. None are United States citizens, nor do they have any valid immigration status. At the time of the dissolution proceedings, Mother and Son were living in Saline County, and Father's whereabouts were unknown. Mother served Father by publication, and an appropriate affidavit of publication was timely filed with the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her petition, Mother requested sole legal and sole physical custody of Son, who was seventeen years old at the time. Mother alleged that Father had abandoned Son in 2003 and that she is the only parent willing and able to care for him. She also\n   alleged that Son \"is subject to removal proceedings\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , deportation) and \"may be eligible to file an application for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\" To facilitate that, Mother sought \"three Special Findings of Fact which will assist [Son] residing in the United States.\" In short, the findings Mother requested were (1) that Son is dependent upon the trial court, (2) that reunification with one or both parents is not viable due to abandonment, pursuant to state law, and (3) that it is not in Son's best interest to be returned to El Salvador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 14, 2016, Mother and Son appeared for a \"default\" dissolution hearing. Father did not appear. Mother testified that she was seeking sole legal and physical custody of Son as Father had not communicated with or supported him since 2003. She stated that it would be in Son's best interest to remain in the United States in her custody because Son would be in danger from gangs if he returned to El Salvador and because there is no one there to care for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Son testified that he was seventeen years old and a citizen of El Salvador.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that he did not want to return to his home country because of safety concerns and because there was no one to care for him there. Son confirmed that Father had abandoned him in 2003. He stated that he was currently living with his mother and wished to remain in her custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mother's counsel offered a proposed parenting plan that granted her sole legal and sole physical custody of Son on the basis that \"this arrangement [would] be in the best interest of the child due to [Father]'s abandonment and neglect of [Son].\" In addition, Mother's counsel filed a proposed Order of Special Findings of Fact and a memorandum in support. The memorandum explained that the order is a required predicate for Son to apply to the federal government for Special Immigrant Juvenile status and that the requisite findings could be obtained only from a state or juvenile court having jurisdiction over the minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 30, 2016, the circuit court issued its Judgment of Dissolution finding that service by publication was proper and that Father had abandoned both Mother and Son. The court granted Mother \"sole legal and physical custody and care of [Son]\" and incorporated Mother's proposed parenting plan into the judgment. The court denied Mother's request for an Order of Special Findings of Fact, however, noting that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [W]ithout personal service on [Father], a guardian-ad-litem for the minor child, the child being a party to the action, and one of the child's parents being a United States citizen, the requested special findings would be inappropriate....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mother thereafter obtained a sworn affidavit from Father, in which he attested that he refused to appear for any hearing on the matter and waived personal service. Father reaffirmed his abandonment of Son and attested that he would continue to abandon Son even if Son were returned to El Salvador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 13, 2016, Mother filed a motion to reconsider her request for the Order of Special Findings of Fact based on Father's waiver of personal service and sworn affidavit. Mother argued in her motion that an Order of Special Findings of Fact should have been issued because (1) it was established that the trial court has jurisdiction over Son, and (2) the court's granting sole legal and physical custody to Mother and adopting her parenting plan satisfied the\n   second and third requested special finding of facts, in that it was not in Son's best interest to return to his home country but to stay in the United States in her custody and care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At a hearing on Mother's motion, her counsel explained the purpose of the special findings of fact and why only a state court can issue such findings. Without receiving any further testimony, the court denied the motion to reconsider. The court also declined Mother's request for findings of fact and conclusions of law on that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mother appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Such findings could arise from a dissolution case in certain situations, such as, for example, where the court determines that placing a child in the custody of a third party is in the child's best interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 452.375.5(5). In the proper circumstances, a court exercising jurisdiction over an immigrant child may, while acting in\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   , find it necessary to make the findings at issue herein. That obligation arises neither from federal law or regulation, nor from the request of a litigant, but solely from that judicial officer's obligation to act in the best interest of that child. Depending upon the facts found by the state court to support its judgment in any of the above proceedings, such findings could arguably also support a decision to grant SIJ status, but, as noted, that is for the federal authorities to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Our reading of the SIJ statute is in accordance with the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Canales\n   </em>\n   , which is consistent with the idea that federal law cannot mandate a state court to make findings but may rely on state courts in the proper circumstances to make such findings that are in a child's best interest and required of the court while in the position of\n   <em>\n    in loco parentis.\n   </em>\n   We cannot convict this dissolution court of error in failing to make the requested special findings where it was not required to do so in the discharge of its duty to act\n   <em>\n    in loco parentis.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

While the court granted Mother custody of Son, this case is unlike the \"child-protective, juvenile-delinquency, or guardianship\n   proceedings, or any other 'juvenile court' intervention providing 'relief from abuse or neglect.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jose H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12298183\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/54/324/\">\n    40 N.Y.S.3d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a dissolution case, the child is not a party, the court does not exercise jurisdiction directly over the child, but over the parents of the child, and the child is not subject to sanction for non-compliance with any judgment. Here, Mother petitioned for dissolution and asked for sole physical and sole legal custody of Son. The dissolution court accorded full relief to Mother, granting both requests, and thereby did what it was required to do in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In some dissolution cases, certain written findings are mandated. For example, when the parties cannot agree on a custodial arrangement and the trial court chooses the arrangement, it must make written findings detailing the specific relevant factors as to why that arrangement is in the child's best interest. \u00a7 452.375.6. The same is true if the court rejects a proposed custodial arrangement, or where the court must rule on a sub-issue of custody, such as the parenting-time allocation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12298183\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/54/324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Speer v.

The same is true in a case, such as this, where the dissolution action (and, hence, the proposed custody arrangement) is uncontested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, the dissolution court made specific findings that Father \"affirmatively abandoned\" both Mother and Son in 2003 and that Mother was seeking sole legal and physical custody of Son, as she believed that it was \"in the best interest of [Son] due to Father's abandonment and neglect of [Son].\" The court ultimately decreed that \"it is in the best interest of [Son] that [Mother] be granted sole legal and sole physical custody and designated as the residential custodian for school and mailing purposes\" and adopted Mother's parenting plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The trial court determined that it was not required to nor capable of making the special findings requested by Mother. We conclude that the circuit court was, in fact,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not required\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to issue the special findings of fact that Mother sought, and, thus, the court cannot be convicted of error for failing to make such findings.

Point Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Mother also argues that the trial court erred in denying her request for special findings of fact because the trial court based that denial \"solely upon the party's nationality.\" In its written judgment, the court denied the request for special findings because there was no personal service on Father, no guardian-ad-litem was appointed, Son was not a party to the action,\n   and neither of the parents is a United States citizen. At the conclusion of the hearing on Mother's motion for reconsideration, the trial judge stated that he could not justify making arrangements for or suggesting that an undocumented minor should stay in the United States when that minor does not have a parent in the United States who is a legal citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mother claims that the court's use of her immigration status \"as the sole dispositive factor to deny ... an Order of Special Findings of Fact\" violated her and Son's due process and equal protection rights, citing\n   <em>\n    Plyler v.

First, it is abundantly clear that the trial court's decision was not based \"solely\" upon Mother's immigration status. But, in any event, we have already determined that the court was in no way required to make these findings in order to properly rule on Mother's dissolution petition.

While the court could have ordered an \"investigation and report concerning custodial arrangements\" under \u00a7 452.390, we cannot say that the court erred in concluding that it was unnecessary under these circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
