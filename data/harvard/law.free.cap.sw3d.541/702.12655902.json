Balbirnie raises two claims on appeal, both challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support\n   his convictions. In his first point, Balbirnie argues that the State failed to prove that the underlying felony of second-degree statutory rape caused Victim's death for purposes of his conviction of felony murder. In his second point, Balbirnie argues that the State failed to prove that he knew Victim was under the age of 17 to support his conviction of second-degree statutory rape. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 20, 2012, Victim (born on July 19, 1997) lived with her grandparents on their farm in Willard, Missouri. Around 4:00 p.m. that day, Victim asked her grandmother if she could invite a boy over to ride horses; when her grandmother said she could not, Victim left the home on foot. Grandmother thought Victim was simply blowing off steam, but when Victim was still gone the next morning, Grandmother grew concerned and tried to file a missing person's report. But, because Victim had been gone for fewer than forty-eight hours, the report could not be filed. Grandmother contacted as many people as she could, trying to locate Victim but to no avail, and Grandmother hung fliers all around. On September 30, 2012, Victim's body was found floating in Truman Lake in Warsaw, Missouri, near Mile Long Bridge; it was wrapped in a blanket with tape, zip ties, and orange electrical cord, with a white trash bag over Victim's face, and attached to a post-driver and part of a railroad iron rail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Grandmother identified Victim's body, and an autopsy was conducted the following day. The autopsy revealed a large volume of liquid in Victim's lungs that was not attributable to the lake in which she was found. Instead, the medical examiner believed the excess fluid to be evidence of pre-mortem pulmonary edema, a build-up of fluid in the lungs that results when a person is not breathing properly, whether from a brain injury or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A week or two before Victim disappeared, Gwenda Bradshaw (a friend of Balbirnie) received a call from Balbirnie, seeking a ride. When Bradshaw went to pick Balbirnie up, Victim was with him; Bradshaw had never met Victim before and asked her how old she was. Victim stated she was nineteen, but Balbirnie indicated she was twenty-one. Bradshaw took Balbirnie and Victim to a friend's house, where Balbirnie and Victim \"friended\" each other on Facebook. Victim's Facebook page indicated she was fifteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the early evening of September 20, 2012, a few minutes before 6:00 p.m. and after Victim left Grandmother's home, Richard Chamberlain, a resident of Springfield, Missouri (approximately five miles from Willard), encountered Victim-who appeared to be fourteen or fifteen years old-walking outside his home. Chamberlain had never seen Victim before, but she stopped at his house and asked to use his phone. Victim had the phone for a minute or two before handing it back to Chamberlain, stating that whomever she was trying to reach was not answering the phone. Victim then left Chamberlain's home, walking down the street. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Chamberlain received a return phone call from the number Victim had tried to reach; it was a male voice, wanting to know who had tried to contact him from Chamberlain's number. Chamberlain advised that it had been a young lady walking down the street. The caller asked Chamberlain where he was located and which direction Victim had\n   gone. The phone number was later identified as belonging to Balbirnie's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime around 2:00 a.m. on September 21, 2012, Larry Warner (another friend of Balbirnie) picked up Balbirnie and Victim in Springfield and drove them to Amy Hartley's house in Buffalo, Missouri, for the purpose of \"partying,\" which Warner defined as doing drugs and having sex. Though Warner had never met Victim, Balbirnie had spoken of her before and indicated that they had a sexual relationship. The group arrived at Hartley's home around 2:45 a.m. on September 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon their arrival, Balbirnie introduced Victim to Hartley and told Hartley that Victim was twenty-two years old. Victim asked Hartley to borrow a dress and then took a shower. While Victim was in the shower, Warner, Hartley, and Balbirnie got high on methamphetamine. After Victim got out of the shower, she went to the back bedroom and told Balbirnie, \"Come on, if we're going to do this,\" prompting Balbirnie to follow her. At some point, Balbirnie emerged from the bedroom, completely naked with an erection, and invited Warner into the bedroom to watch, saying, \"If you want to come back here, you can come back here, but you ain't touching her, you know what I'm saying?\" Warner declined the invitation and left shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After Warner left, Hartley went to her own bedroom. Balbirnie and Victim, both naked, then entered Hartley's bedroom and solicited Hartley to participate in sexual activities with them. Hartley initially refused but eventually assented, allowing Balbirnie and Victim to remove Hartley's pants and perform oral sex on her. Shortly thereafter, Hartley became uncomfortable, redressed, and went back into the living room. While in the living room, Hartley heard Balbirnie and Victim having sex against her bedroom door, causing it to make a banging noise. Hartley went back to the bedroom and told Balbirnie and Victim to go somewhere else, so they went into the living room, where Hartley observed them engaging in more sexual acts. Hartley encouraged them to go into the back bedroom, and she went to her own bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime later, Hartley heard a loud noise and left her room to investigate. Balbirnie came out of the bedroom, wearing only shorts and looking \"frazzled.\" Balbirnie kept going in and out of the back bedroom, and Hartley eventually followed him back there, where she saw Victim lying naked on the bed, shaking and seizing. Hartley approached Victim and asked if she was ok. Victim put her hands around her neck, \"like she was choking,\" while she continued to shake and seize. Hartley told Balbirnie to call for an ambulance, but Balbirnie responded, \"Fuck no, bitch.\" Hartley insisted they call, telling Balbirnie that Victim was dying. Victim eventually stopped shaking and seizing, at which point, Hartley checked her pulse and found that she had none. Hartley told Balbirnie to give Victim CPR, and when he did, Victim's body convulsed and water came out of her mouth. The CPR was unsuccessful, and Victim became still and unresponsive. Hartley asked Balbirnie, \"What have you done?\" Balbirnie responded, \"She's been doing that for hours.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Balbirnie told Hartley, \"We need to douche this bitch out\" because he had ejaculated inside Victim. He then redressed Victim in the dress she had borrowed from Hartley, wrapped Victim's body in a blanket from the bed, and asked Hartley to get him some tape and a rope or cord. Hartley complied and brought Balbirnie a white trash bag, some tape, and an orange electrical cord. Balbirnie put the trash bag over Victim's head and then wrapped the cord around the blanket to keep it in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Balbirnie carried Victim's body to the garage and put it in the trunk of Hartley's car. He then directed Hartley to \"get [him] something to weight her down.\" Hartley suggested Balbirnie look in the sheds outside the house. Balbirnie returned from one of the sheds with a post-driver and a piece of railroad track, which he tied to Victim's body before instructing Hartley to get in the car; the two then drove around, looking for a body of water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The pair first traveled to Pomme de Terre River, but, when they got there, Balbirnie remarked, \"There's not enough water here,\" so they drove to Mile Long Bridge over Truman Lake. After they stopped on the bridge, Balbirnie got out of the car and looked down at the water. He told Hartley, \"I'm going to throw her out.\" Balbirnie threw Victim's body off the bridge into the water, and he and Hartley drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Balbirnie and Hartley eventually returned to Hartley's home, where Balbirnie gathered up Victim's clothing, put it in a trash bag, and drove away with the items in Hartley's car. Before doing so, however, he requested some bleach and used it to wipe down the bed where Victim had died. Balbirnie also advised Hartley to wash the bedding and not to call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A few days later, Balbirnie was in a motel room, using drugs with Kayla Alexander in Springfield, Missouri. Balbirnie was behaving abnormally, prompting Alexander to ask him what was going on. Balbirnie then said that he had gotten high and had sex with a fifteen-year-old girl, during which he choked and killed her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Victim's autopsy revealed no drugs in her system and only a small amount of alcohol, which was attributable to decomposition. Though the medical examiner was unable to testify to a cause of death, he acknowledged that Victim's death could have resulted from cerebral asphyxiation occurring in a manner consistent with the events Balbirnie had described to Kayla Alexander. The medical examiner testified that compression of the veins in the neck prohibits blood from traveling to the brain, which then deprives the brain of oxygen and other nutrients, resulting in cerebral asphyxiation, a condition that can cause seizures and pulmonary edema.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury found Balbirnie guilty as charged, and the court sentenced him, as a prior offender, to thirty years for felony murder and fifteen years for statutory rape, to run consecutive to each other and to concurrent terms of five years for tampering with physical evidence and five years for abandoning a corpse, for a total sentence of fifty years' imprisonment. Balbirnie appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Our review is limited to determining 'whether sufficient evidence was presented at trial from which a reasonable juror might have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all the essential elements of the crime.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In his first point, Balbirnie challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his felony murder conviction, arguing that Victim's death did not come about \"as a result of the perpetration\" of second-degree statutory rape-the underlying felony. In his second point, Balbirnie argues that the State bore the burden and failed to prove that Balbirnie knew Victim was under the\n   age of 17, as required to support his conviction for second-degree statutory rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The evidence supported Balbirnie's conviction of felony murder.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his first point on appeal, Balbirnie argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his felony murder conviction insofar as the evidence did not establish that Victim died \"as a result of the perpetration\" of the underlying crime of second-degree statutory rape. Balbirnie reasons that Victim died as a result of choking (which he characterizes as an assault), rather than as a result of sexual intercourse (defined in \u00a7 566.010(4) as \"any penetration, however slight, of the female sex organ by the male sex organ\"). This claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A person commits the offense of murder in the second degree if he ... [c]ommits ... any felony, and, in the perpetration ... of such felony ..., another person is killed as a result of the perpetration ... of such felony....\" \u00a7 565.021.1(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Balbirnie reads the phrase \"another person is killed as a result of the perpetration ... of such felony\" to mean that the death must result from one of the elements of the underlying felony. He notes that the elements of second-degree statutory rape are: (1) a person age twenty-one or older; (2) having sexual intercourse; (3) with a person who is less than seventeen years old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 566.034.1. He then reasons that neither of the participants' ages can cause death, so, for him to be guilty of felony murder, Victim's death must have resulted from the second element-sexual intercourse. And, here, because there was no evidence that Victim's death was caused by the penetration of her vagina by Balbirnie's penis, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The felony murder rule derives from common law and permits a homicide to be classified as murder, even though committed unintentionally, if it occurred during the pursuit of a felony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is reasonably foreseeable that choking a person could cause that person's death. And, by Balbirnie's own words and theory on appeal-supported by the medical examiner's testimony at trial, his act of choking Victim was the likely cause of Victim's death. In other words, had Balbirnie not engaged in sexual intercourse with Victim, he would not have had occasion to choke her, and she would not have died as a result. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's determination that Victim died \"as a result of the perpetration\" of second-degree statutory rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Eastern District of this court recently addressed a challenge similar to that raised by Balbirnie here. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Harding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386132\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/362/\">\n    528 S.W.3d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. E.D. 2017), the defendant argued that his commission of the underlying felony-unlawful possession of a weapon-could not have caused the victim's death so\n   as to support the conviction of felony murder. The Eastern District disagreed, noting that \"[t]o test causation, Missouri courts will often look at the underlying felony, generally,\n   <em>\n    as well as at the facts of the particular case.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386132\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/362/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386132\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/362/\">\n    at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The court noted that \"the clear legislative intent restricts our courts from considering the inherent dangerousness (or lack thereof) of the underlying felony\"; instead \"we may only review the underlying circumstances to determine whether the murder was foreseeable and a proximate cause of the underlying felony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385747,12385742\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/649/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, while the commission of any felony \"is sufficient to\n   <em>\n    charge\n   </em>\n   a defendant with felony-murder, [it is] the underlying facts [that] dictate whether [the underlying felony] is sufficient to\n   <em>\n    convict\n   </em>\n   a defendant of felony-murder.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385747,12385742\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/649/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Harding\n   </em>\n   , because the weapon the defendant unlawfully possessed had been maintained, fully loaded, in a couch cushion in a home where he and the victim \"were prone to frequent domestic disputes,\" the court ultimately held that \"[i]t [wa]s the fault of Defendant that this weapon became a part of the altercation that resulted in Victim's death-i.e., his felony-possession was closely connected in time, place and causal relation to her death-and therefore completely foreseeable that such an incident would occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 371-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The same is true in Balbirnie's case. Because the sexual intercourse he chose to engage in with Victim included choking her, his commission of second-degree statutory rape was closely connected in time, place and causal relation to Victim's death, and it was therefore completely foreseeable that Victim might die as a result of Balbirnie's perpetration of statutory rape.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 562.026(2) provides that \"[a] culpable mental state is not required\" for a felony offense if \"no culpable mental state is prescribed by the statute defining the offense, and imputation of a culpable mental state to the offense is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of the statute defining the offense or may lead to an absurd or unjust result.\" Here, imputing a culpable mental state would lead to absurd or unjust results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court first determined that, inexplicably, \"paragraph 1 makes lack of good cause an element and paragraph 3 also makes good cause an affirmative defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 813. But, despite the strange drafting, the Court concluded that \"the most logical interpretation in the circumstances is to interpret it as requiring the State to prove lack of good cause while at the same time permitting the defendant to offer additional proof that he has good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 814.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In discussing the potential legislative intent, the Court noted that, \"had the legislature wished to remove 'without good cause' as an element but allow it as an affirmative defense, it could have removed the phrase 'without good cause' from paragraph 1 at the same time it added the affirmative defense to paragraph 3.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, if the definition of the offense did not contain the language at issue, it would no longer be an element that the State bore the burden to prove, and maintenance of the third paragraph, identifying \"good cause\" as an affirmative defense, would have had the effect of placing the burden on the defendant to prove\n   that his nonsupport was the result of \"good cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This appears to be exactly the case in the context of statutory rape. Historically, in Missouri, mistake-of-age was no defense whatsoever to a charge of statutory rape:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [I]t is argued by counsel for the state that the accused may not know that the girl was under the age of consent. That may be true; but that constitutes no defense to the charge for the reason that the law makes it his duty to know the age of a girl before he defiles her person, and, if there is any doubt about her age, he must determine that fact at his peril. It is a well-known fact that some girls at the ages of 10, 12, 14, and 15 years appear to be several years older than they really are; and a man who desires to have sexual intercourse with such a girl must take notice of that fact and solve the doubt in favor of the law and morality; otherwise he must suffer the penalties of the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

In such a case the only intent required is the intent to have carnal knowledge of that person; he acting at his peril as to her capacity to consent.\"). Thus, when the legislature added \u00a7 566.020 in 1977, it was changing the law by providing a defendant with an affirmative defense that was not previously recognized, though, in doing so, it limited the availability of that defense to cases involving victims between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 566.020.1 (\"Whenever in this chapter the criminality of conduct depends upon a child being less than fourteen years of age, it is no defense that the defendant believed the child to be older.\"). The fact that the legislature added this affirmative defense in a separate section, apart from the definition of the offenses to which it applied, coupled with the fact that the legislature specifically denominated it as an affirmative defense, demonstrates the legislative intent that a defendant's knowledge of a victim's age is not an element but is, instead, a defense available to a defendant charged with second-degree statutory rape upon which he bears the burden of persuasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Balbirnie alternatively argues that the State was required-and failed-to disprove his mistake-of-age defense. This argument ignores the plain language of \u00a7 566.020.2, identifying a defendant's reasonable belief that a child was seventeen years of age or older as an affirmative defense. An affirmative defense is one in which \"the defendant has the burden of persuasion that the defense is more probably true than not.\" \u00a7 556.056(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Contrary to the plain language of both \u00a7\u00a7 556.056(2) and 566.020.2, Balbirnie seeks to treat the mistake-of-age defense more like a claim of self-defense, wherein a defendant bears \"the burden of injecting the issue.\" \u00a7 563.031.5. \"When the phrase 'The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue' is used in the code, it means [that] ... [i]f the issue is submitted to the trier of fact any reasonable doubt on the issue requires a finding for the defendant on that issue.\" \u00a7 556.051(2).

The State's sole burden in this regard was to prove that Victim was, in fact, under the age of seventeen, which it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In any event, there was abundant evidence contradicting Balbirnie's defense, upon which the jury apparently relied. To begin, the evidence showed that Victim's Facebook page, which Balbirnie viewed approximately one week before her death, indicated that she was fifteen years old. Other witnesses testified that Victim appeared to be fourteen or fifteen years old. The State introduced Victim's photograph into evidence, allowing the jury to judge for itself what age she appeared to be at the time of her death. And Balbirnie not only gave inconsistent accounts of Victim's age (telling Bradshaw that Victim was twenty-one and telling Hartley that Victim was twenty-two) but also admitted knowing she was fifteen years old when he spoke with Alexander.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because Balbirnie's claim of insufficient evidence is legally flawed, it is without merit.
