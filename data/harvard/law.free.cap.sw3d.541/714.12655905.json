His sole point on appeal is the motion court erred in denying his Rule 29.15 motion because his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction for a lesser-included offense. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An opinion would have no precedential value nor serve any jurisprudential purpose. The parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this order pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
