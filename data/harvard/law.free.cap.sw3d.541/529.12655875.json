Bruner appeals his convictions on charges of first-degree murder and armed criminal action, alleging the circuit court erred by refusing to submit a self-defense instruction. This Court recently reaffirmed in\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880976\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/849/#p852\">\n     456 S.W.3d 849\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 852 (Mo. banc 2015),\n   </em>\n   that if substantial evidence is presented of the elements of self-defense, then the issue is injected and self-defense must be submitted by instructing the jury that the State has the burden of proving a lack of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, the circuit court determined Mr. Bruner failed to inject the issue of self-defense because self-defense was not supported by the evidence. While the burden of producing evidence sufficient to inject self-defense is a minimal burden, this Court agrees it was not met here. For that reason, the circuit court did not err in refusing the self-defense instruction. The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to submission of a self-defense instruction, the record shows Mr. Bruner and his wife, Michelle Hale, were estranged. Mr. Bruner testified that to his knowledge she was not seeing anyone else, though he was aware she had met a college football coach for a lunch date. He later learned the coach was Derek Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Bruner was convinced he and his wife would reconcile. They had been married more than 20 years, and she had several extramarital affairs, once filing for divorce. Following each affair, the couple reconciled and Ms. Hale pledged her fidelity to Mr. Bruner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although Ms. Hale moved out of their marital home two weeks earlier, Mr. Bruner sometimes visited her at her apartment, even spending the night and having sexual relations with her on occasion. The day before the shooting, Mr. Bruner met with his wife and asked if she would go out to\n   dinner with him the next night. She declined, saying she would have to work late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the day of the shooting, Mr. Bruner picked up his 14-year-old daughter after she and a friend watched a movie at a local movie theater. Mr. Bruner and his daughter went to eat at a nearby McDonald's. While there, the daughter saw a Facebook posting of her mother (Ms. Hale) with another man (Mr. Moore), apparently standing in front of the movie theater, captioned \"Date Night.\" The daughter showed her father the picture, and the image upset him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Bruner testified he decided to go directly to the movie theater to talk with his wife to fix his marriage and to save her from \"divine punishment;\" he believed \"what she was doing wasn't right\" and \"that God is going to punish her for what she's done.\" While Mr. Bruner and his daughter were on the way to the movie theater, he sent Ms. Hale two texts. One said merely, \"WTF,\" and the other, \"where are you at.\" Mr. Bruner received no response. The daughter told her father she wanted to go home because she did not want to see her mom and dad fighting. Mr. Bruner responded jokingly, \"It's not like I'm going to kill a man.\" He also jokingly said, \"I wouldn't put it past [your mother, a police officer,] to try to put me in jail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nonetheless, Mr. Bruner turned around and drove his daughter home. While there, he asked his daughter to display the Facebook post on the larger home computer screen, in part so he could ascertain whether the picture was taken at the same movie theater at which he just had picked up his daughter. He also grabbed two loaded guns (one gun belonged to Ms. Hale, which she carried while jogging) and an extra clip because he knew the man in the picture was very big and, \"if he tried to beat me up or something, that I would be able to back him off with it.\" Mr. Moore was around 6'4' or 6'5', and Mr. Bruner was 5'10' and weighed about 175 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Bruner drove to the movie theater but could not find Ms. Hale's vehicle in the parking lot. He then parked in the lot near the movie theater's only exit. While waiting for the couple to exit the movie theater, he texted back and forth with his daughter. He asked her whether there were any other Facebook posts and confirmed his wife was wearing a black dress. The record also shows Mr. Bruner attempted to call his wife, but the call went unanswered and was logged as a \"missed call.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Bruner saw Ms. Hale and Mr. Moore about to exit the movie theater. He left his car and approached the couple just after they exited the building as they were standing on the concrete sidewalk. Mr. Bruner stood slightly below the curb in the asphalt driveway, facing the movie theater, and addressed comments to his wife. Mr. Moore moved in front of Ms. Hale and approached Mr. Bruner. Mr. Bruner stepped backward and made clear he was not interested in speaking to Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore stepped toward Mr. Bruner repeatedly, and each time, Mr. Bruner stepped backward. At some point, Ms. Hale interposed herself and placed a hand on Mr. Moore's chest as if to restrain him. As the three approached the concrete median (another concrete sidewalk a step higher than the asphalt driveway separating the driveway from the parking lot), Mr. Bruner stopped backing up to avoid tripping on the median.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Hale and Mr. Moore then walked past Mr. Bruner, who pivoted to remain facing them. Mr. Moore was up on the median while Mr. Bruner remained down on the asphalt driveway. Mr. Bruner testified Mr. Moore was in a \"fighting stance,\" which he described as not facing him square on, but standing \"sideways looking\n   at [him],\" with one shoulder closer to him than the other. Mr. Moore did not move toward Mr. Bruner, nor attempt to hit him, but he did say, \"I'm not from around here, motherf* *ker, I'll have your throat slit in two hours.\" Mr. Bruner responded to Mr. Moore, \"Why are you threatening me?\" Mr. Moore replied, \"I don't play these redneck games,\" and then said, \"You don't know who the f* *k you are messing with.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Bruner did not testify that he then killed Mr. Moore in self-defense or that he did so because he feared for his life. Rather, his defense was that he did not act out of his own volition. Mr. Bruner testified that, immediately after Mr. Moore's last statement, the stress caused him to go into a dissociative mental state he described as feeling almost like passing out. He says he experienced something like tunnel vision, darkness, and seeing and hearing everything as if from a distance. It felt as if everything was \"closing in on [him].\" Mr. Bruner said he then took out the gun and shot Mr. Moore multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Bruner testified, that due to his dissociative state, he did not so much choose to fire the gun; rather, it was as if he was not acting with volition: \"I remember seeing the gun come out and I remember seeing one or two shots and I remember hearing three.\" On cross-examination, he mentioned for the first time that he had seen Mr. Moore's arm move just before the shooting, and he perceived Mr. Moore \"was trying to grab [him],\" although he says what he saw was blurry and indistinct due to his mental state, which he described as reducing his vision. Mr. Bruner described the shooting as something happening while he was in a surreal mental state: \"It's like it wasn't even me. I don't know how to explain it. I think I said it was kind of like your [sic] falling asleep and all of a sudden you flinch.\" Mr. Bruner did not remember, but did not deny, shooting Mr. Moore an additional three times or kicking him in the head after he went down, which is what witnesses testified occurred. Mr. Bruner did not testify he saw or thought Mr. Moore had a weapon. Rather, when asked if he remembered a weapon on Mr. Moore, he replied, \"No. I did not.\" He also never testified he was afraid Mr. Moore would cause him death or serious physical injury, or commit a forcible felony against him, or, indeed, that he feared Mr. Moore would punch him. He also said he did not consider leaving the scene, and testified, \"I wished I had thought to leave.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Bruner testified his next lucid moment was sitting behind the wheel of his vehicle in the parking lot. He said he then saw individuals in the crowd coming toward him, left the gun in the car and went back out, told those coming toward him he was unarmed, removed his coat, dropped it to the ground to show he was unarmed, and lay there until the police came. He did not remember anything he said to anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Bruner explained his conduct by presenting expert testimony that, at the time of the shooting, he suffered from acute stress disorder that caused him to experience dissociation and depersonalization in the face of trauma or life threatening situations, and this explained his confused memory of the shooting. The expert diagnosed Mr. Bruner with acute stress disorder, which he described as an early stage of post-traumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is characterized by an abnormal reaction to a stressful situation, and the expert testified that one of the diagnostic criteria is exposure to a life-threatening situation. Here, the expert testified it was Ms. Hale's infidelity that caused stress for Mr. Bruner, which, if internalized, \"can create a buildup that can ultimately result in an explosive reaction.\" On cross-examination, the expert said the diagnosis was not supported by any of the tests conducted but was based solely on\n   Mr. Bruner's own statements and the evidence and pleadings at trial, the latter of which he admitted are normally not considered by a clinician in making a diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Bruner's daughter also testified. Supportive of her father, she said he was angered by the Facebook post she showed him. They drove directly home from McDonald's (not toward the theater first). Her father said he was taking her home because he did not want her to see him kill a man. Her father also told her he would be going to jail that night and, by the end of the night, she would have neither a mother nor a father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A retired police chief and homicide investigator, who was at the movie theater attending a movie, testified that, while Mr. Bruner was lying on the ground, he said, \"They posted it all over Facebook. What's a guy supposed to do?\" Another movie patron testified that before the police arrived and while Mr. Bruner was lying on the ground, he said, \"Yeah. I did it. Twenty-one years of marriage and this is what it comes down to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The physical evidence and medical examiner's testimony showed the gun was fired seven times, and Mr. Moore was hit six times: once on the outside of the right shoulder, once on the thumb side of his left forearm, once on the front of the left forearm, and three times in the back. Wounds on the palm of one hand were consistent with at least one shot being fired while the palm was against the pavement. Multiple witnesses testified, after the first three shots were fired, they saw Mr. Moore go down, first to his knees, then to all fours, at which point Mr. Bruner stepped closer or leaned over Mr. Moore and fired the additional shots into him. Multiple witnesses also testified, after the gun was empty, Mr. Bruner kicked or stomped on Mr. Moore in the head and face or stomach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In accordance with the defense's opening statement and closing argument, the defense took the position that the stress of his wife's repeated infidelities and blind-siding him with the revelation that she had been dating another man caused Mr. Bruner to suffer from acute stress disorder that led to the dissociative mental state and inability to control his impulses. The defense argued, therefore, Mr. Bruner did not act with deliberation or upon cool reflection and should be found not guilty of first-degree murder, defined in section 565.020\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as \"knowingly caus[ing] the death of another person after deliberation upon the matter.\" The defense focused on evidence tending to show Mr. Bruner did not form the intent to kill Mr. Moore at McDonald's, at home, while waiting in the theater parking lot, or when initiating the conversation with his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State argued at trial the only element of first-degree murder at issue was deliberation, defined as cool reflection on the matter for any length of time, and Mr. Bruner began such deliberation the moment he saw the Facebook posting. The State emphasized evidence tending to show Mr. Bruner had already decided to kill a man at that point. The court submitted a verdict director for first-degree murder with lesser-included offense instructions for second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, and armed criminal action associated with conviction for one of the homicide crimes. The circuit court also submitted an instruction based on MAI-CR 3d 308.03, allowing the jury to consider whether Mr. Bruner had a mental disease or defect in deciding whether he acted with the state of mind required for first-degree murder. The defense also sought a self-defense instruction. It was denied on the basis there was no evidence\n   from the defendant's testimony or from any of the other witnesses that the defendant had any reasonable belief he was defending himself from imminent serious physical injury or death. The jury found Mr. Bruner guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Mr. Bruner appealed. Following an opinion by the court of appeals, the case was transferred to this Court under Rule 83.04.\n   <em>\n    Mo. Const. art.

This question is devilishly difficult when raised, as it is here, in the context of whether the evidence in a criminal case supports the giving of a self-defense instruction requested by the defendant. To be sure, there was very little evidence of self-defense in this case, and Bruner's version of the facts is distinctly unconvincing. But the question of what is believable and what is not is for the jury, not for the trial court or for this Court. It is difficult to articulate precisely where the line is in these cases, but I believe the Court's decision in this case steps across it. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Section 563.031.5, RSMo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides, \"The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue\" of self-defense. Section 556.051 explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   When the phrase \"\n   <strong>\n    The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue\n   </strong>\n   \" is used in the code, it means\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (1) The issue referred to is not submitted to the trier of fact unless supported by evidence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (2) If the issue is submitted to the trier of fact any reasonable doubt on the issue requires a finding for the defendant on that issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00a7 556.051 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Two readings of section 556.051(1) are plausible. First, it is possible to conclude the requirement in section 556.051(1) that the issue of self-defense should not be submitted to the jury unless it is \"supported by the evidence\" means only what the phrase \"supported by the evidence\" usually means, i.e., that the evidence must be sufficient for a reasonable juror to believe the defendant acted in self-defense. In other words, section 556.051(1) could be construed so that the question of submissibility is decided\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     as if\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the defendant had the burden of proof on self-defense. But this Court has never construed section 556.051(1) this way and does not purport to do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Even though it is clear this Court does not now construe (and never has construed) section 556.051(1) as though-for purposes of submissibility only-the defendant had the burden of proving self-defense, this Court's decisions construing section 556.051(1) are far less clear about what the phrase \"supported by the evidence\" actually means and, more importantly, how it is to be applied. The answer given by the Court today (and in its recent cases on the subject) is that there must be \"substantial evidence\" of self-defense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is the same test that would be applied if section 556.051(1) were interpreted-at least for purposes of determining whether a self-defense instruction should be given-as though the defendant had the burden of proof on whether he acted in self-defense. Qualifying the word \"evidence\" with the word \"substantial\" does not change the analysis any more than the qualified standards of \"any evidence\" or \"a scintilla of evidence.\" As long as the focus of the analysis is on whether the evidence establishes the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     presence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of self-defense, the Court\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     in effect\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is applying a construction of section 556.051(1) that it has never adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The other-and I believe proper-reading is to keep section 556.051(2) in mind when construing and applying section 556.051(1). Section 556.051(2) requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defense\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     was not present\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Therefore, when applying section 556.051(1), the question should be whether there is a basis in the evidence for a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     reasonable doubt\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   regarding the issue on which the state bears the burden of proof, i.e., that self-defense was not present. This construction, alone, is faithful to the language of section 556.051(1)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   section 556.051(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Admittedly, this is a fine distinction, but it is one that can and should be drawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doing so emphasizes that doubts as to whether to instruct on self-defense \"should be resolved in favor of including the instruction, leaving it to the jury to decide.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Derenzy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323038\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/89/472/#p474\">\n    89 S.W.3d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474-75 (Mo. banc 2002) (addressing requests for lesser included offense instructions). Failing to do so, on the other hand, risks having trial and appellate courts usurp the jury's role as factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This does not mean a self-defense instruction should be given every time the defendant requests it. Section 556.051(1)-even construed and applied in light of section 556.051(2)-neither requires nor allows this. No matter how favorably the evidence is viewed, there will be cases in which there simply is no evidence of self-defense at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, if the only evidence is that the defendant and the victim were unacquainted and the defendant-acting for hire-shot the victim in the back of the head with a rifle at long range, there is no suggestion of self-defense and certainly no basis in the evidence for a reasonable doubt that the defendant might have acted in self-defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the instruction should not be given in such a case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   These \"no evidence\" cases, however, are not the only (or even the primary) source of difficulty in this area. There is a second category of cases, i.e., the \"very little evidence\" cases. Focusing on whether there is a basis in the evidence for the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the state's burden to prove the defendant did not act in self-defense helps resolve this second category of cases because the applicable standard of review permits the court to consider only the evidence and inferences that support such doubt and instructs the court to ignore all evidence and inferences that do not. In such cases, the requirements of section 556.051(1) are satisfied-especially when construed in light of section 556.051(2)-and the instruction must be given. The present case belongs in this latter category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   There can be little doubt in this case that a juror could entertain a reasonable doubt as to self-defense if the only evidence and only reasonable inferences were: (a) Bruner was attempting to address his wife; (b) Moore (significantly larger and stronger than Bruner) repeatedly confronted Bruner and (with a concrete step exacerbating his height advantage) repeatedly backed Bruner away until Bruner could back away no further; (c) Moore threatened to cut Bruner's throat; (d) Moore then moved his arm\n   toward Bruner in an effort to grab him and could carry out the threat to cut Bruner's throat; and (e) Bruner pulled his gun, which he brought solely to defend himself if necessary, and shot Moore. Of course, as the principal opinion points out, this is not all the evidence in the case and there are other reasonable-perhaps far more reasonable-inferences to be drawn. But the standard of review requires that all of the contrary evidence and inferences must be ignored, and that only the evidence and reasonable inferences supporting the giving of the instruction may be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For example, the principal opinion lingers on the inconsistencies between Bruner's claim of acute stress disorder and his claim of self-defense. This inconsistency, however, disappears when such contrary evidence is ignored, as the standard of review instructs it must be. More importantly, the principal opinion holds the evidence supports a finding that Bruner-subjectively and reasonably-feared only Moore's \"unwanted or offensive contact,\" not that Moore was about to employ sufficient force to cause serious injury or death. This conclusion ignores-or at least minimizes-the threat Moore had just made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moore stated: \"I'm not from here mother f* *ker, I'll have your throat slit in two hours.\" When Bruner asked why Moore was threatening him, Moore replied: \"I don't play these redneck games. ... You don't know who the f* *k you are messing with.\" If Moore meant he would find some third party to cut Bruner's throat two hours in the future, the principal opinion is correct because-like the hypothetical in footnote 4 above-there is no basis in the evidence for any reasonable doubt as to whether Bruner subjectively and reasonably believed Moore's use of deadly force was imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But why must the jury understand Moore's threat this way? A faithful application of the standard of review requires this Court to draw the inference that Moore meant he, personally, was going to cut Bruner's throat\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and would do so sometime within the next two hours, including immediately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is not the only reasonable inference the evidence would support, but it is one of them-and the\n   only one permitted by the applicable standard of review. With that inference, there is a basis in the evidence for the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether the state succeeded in proving Bruner did not act in self-defense. Therefore, under section 556.051(1), the instruction should have been given. That there are other inferences-even more compelling inferences-negating such doubts is irrelevant under the applicable standard of review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The principal opinion holds, for the first time ever, that the standard of viewing the evidence in the \"light most favorable to the defendant\" does not-in the circumstance of determining whether a self-defense instruction should be given-require the court to give the defendant the benefit of all reasonable inferences and to disregard all contrary evidence.\n   <em>\n    O\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    p.\n   </em>\n   at 534n.2. The principal opinion offers no support for this, nor justifies why the phrase \"light most favorable to the defendant\" means less in the context of whether a self-defense instruction should be given than it does when deciding other questions of submissibility,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a verdict,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   If, when viewing the evidence in the \"light most favorable to the defendant,\" courts are not required to ignore all evidence to the contrary, then courts inevitably will begin to weigh the evidence and engage in credibility determinations as the principal opinion does in this case. Doing so runs afoul of the well-settled principle that courts \"cannot weigh the evidence in a criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10176892\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/328/656/#p659\">\n    328 S.W.2d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659 (Mo. 1959). If the jury truly is entitled to \"disbelieve all or any part of the evidence and refuse to draw needed inferences,\" as this Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p395\">\n    433 S.W.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and numerous other cases, then legal determinations as to what questions should and should not be submitted to the jury must be made without usurping that prerogative. Instead, they must be made only by viewing the evidence in \"the light most favorable to the defendant,\" and this requires granting the defendant all reasonable inferences and disregarding all contrary evidence. That is what the \"light most favorable to the defendant\" means. This Court has never held that \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\" was a standard of review separate and distinct from \"ignoring all reasonable inferences and evidence to the contrary,\" and it is error for the principal opinion to do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   It is easy to conclude, when viewing all of the evidence and drawing only the most likely and compelling inferences, that no reasonable juror would entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether Bruner acted in lawful self-defense in this case. But that is not the question. Instead, even (and, perhaps, especially) in the thinnest of cases, section 556.051(1) and the applicable standard of review leave such questions to the jury. Accordingly, I would vacate Bruner's convictions and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo Supp. 2013, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     State v.

The result is not a complete absence of evidence on the question of whether Bruner had a subjective fear of imminent deadly force, however, as such a belief can be inferred from his actions. The fact that the jury is not likely to pick and choose from among the evidence in this way is irrelevant to the question of submissibility.
