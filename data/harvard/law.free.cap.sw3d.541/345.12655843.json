The principal issue presented is whether Fryday was an employee of the City of Clear Lake Shores at the time he allegedly performed a faulty inspection of the rental home of appellee Linda Michaelski. Because the evidence establishes that Fryday was an employee of the City of Clear Lake Shores, we reverse the trial court's order and render judgment dismissing Michaelski's suit against Fryday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Michaelski sued Jack Fryday d/b/a Fryday Consulting Services, Inc. after Fryday allegedly performed \"faulty building inspection work\" when he inspected her rental home in Clear Lake Shores. In her original petition, she alleged claims for negligence and DTPA violations. She alleged that \"[o]n or about August 2014 the Defendant was hired by the City of Clear Lake Shores to inspect the Plaintiff's rental home located at 1019 North Shore, Drive, Clear Lake Shores, Texas 77565 by the City of Clear Lake Shores, Texas.\" Michaelski alleged that, because of Fryday's faulty inspection, she had to incur expenses to comply with higher building standard requirements, she was deprived of rental income for the lower level of her rental home, and the value of her rental home decreased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jack Fryday filed a motion to dismiss, contending that he is entitled to immunity from suit because Michaelski's claims against him \"involve conduct within the general scope of his employment as a building official employed by the City of Clear Lake Shores. Under Texas law, therefore, tort claims, such as Plaintiff asserts here must be brought, if at all, against the City of Clear Lake Shores, Fryday's governmental employer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101.002\">\n    Tex.

He stated that his inspection of Michaelski's home was \"entirely within the scope of Fryday's position as City Building Official\" and his \"responsibilities included reviewing all building permit applications and advising the City whether plans or proposals complied with applicable building codes, regulations, or ordinances.\" Fryday asserted that he \"was an officer in the paid service of a governmental unit, sued for conduct within the general scope of his employment and should be dismissed from this lawsuit under Section 101.106(f).\" To support these assertions, Fryday pointed to his written declaration attached to his reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Michaelski filed a sur-reply to the motion to dismiss, contending that Fryday was not an employee of the City of Clear Lake Shores because \"a d/b/a b [y] definition [is] not an employee as the d/b/a is not a person.\" Michaelski claimed that Fryday\n   was \"paid by the City of Clear Lake Shores through 1099's [sic] for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 not by W2's,\" and that there are \"three 1099's [sic] of the Defendant specifically identifying him as a d/b/a subcontractor only, not as a person, for 2014 and 2015.\" Michaelski also claimed that Fryday \"identifie[d] his work done for Clear Lake Shores as a part time job and not as an employee in a prior suit in the 10th Judicial District Court in Galveston.\" She argued that Fryday is therefore \"not entitled to governmental immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court denied Fryday's motion to dismiss on October 25, 2016.

He points to the declaration he attached to his pleading in the trial court, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECLARATION OF JACK FRYDAY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I, Jack Fryday declare, on June 22, 2016, under penalty of perjury as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2.

In August of 2009, the City of Clear Lake Shores contacted me regarding serving as Building Official for the City. Although the City and I discussed the possibility of entering into a contract for my company to provide service to the City, we never made a contract. Instead, I personally agreed to perform building inspection services for the City on a part[-]time basis, and the City agreed to pay me for the work assigned on a part-time basis. The City Administrator then appointed me personally as the City Building Official with the approval of City Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   4. I served as Building Official for the City of Clear Lake Shores from approximately August of 2009 through May 30, 2016. In this capacity, I was responsible for reviewing all building permit applications in the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   5. As City Building Official, I maintained an office at City Hall and shared an assistant with the City Secretary. The work did not take my full time but, whenever called upon to do so, I performed all of the responsibilities of the office of Building Official and reported directly to the City Administrator if any issues arose. My review and interpretations were subject to review by the Board of Adjustment, and the City Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   6. I was never retained to work for Ms. Michaelski. Any and all work I did was done to advise the City of my opinion of whether plans or proposals complied with applicable building codes, regulations, or ordinances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   7. I have never had a contract to work as an independent contractor for the City of Clear Lake Shores. Instead, I submitted timesheets for the hours I worked for the City, as the official Building Official, and I was paid at the rate of $50 per hour for each hour worked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fryday's declaration constitutes evidence that the City paid him between August 2009 and May 2016 for his services as a City Building Official performing building inspection services and reviewing building permit applications for the City. The City did not hire or pay his company \"J Fryday Consulting Services;\" nor did Fryday have a \"contract to work as an independent contractor for the City.\" He submitted timesheets and was paid for the hours he worked.

Fryday further explained in his affidavit that he advised the City of his opinion regarding \"whether plans or proposals complied with applicable building codes, regulations, or ordinances\" but that his \"review and interpretations were subject to review by the Board of Adjustment, and the City Council.\" Fryday's evidence establishes that he was an employee of the City as defined by the Texas Tort Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Michaelski argues that \"Exhibit A\" referred to in her sur-reply shows that Fryday was a subcontractor rather than a City employee. She argues that \"Exhibit A\" contains her business records affidavit and copies of three 1099 tax forms for years 2013 to 2015 showing that Fryday was paid by the City \"through 1099's for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 not by W2's,\" and that the tax forms specifically identify him \"as a d/b/a subcontractor only, not a person.\" Michaelski also argues that \"Exhibit B,\" which she attached to her sur-reply and filed in the trial court, shows that Fryday was not an employee of the City. According to Michaelski, \"Exhibit B\" shows that Fryday \"identifies his work done for Clear Lake Shores as a part time job and not as an employee in a prior suit in the 10th Judicial Court in Galveston.\" \"Exhibit B\" appears to be a one-page excerpt of an unidentified person's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Fryday contends that the evidence he presented is uncontroverted because any evidence Michaelski points to \"should not be considered by [t]his cou[r]t and is wholly insufficient.\" In that regard, Fryday first complains that he was never served with or ever saw Michaelski's \"Exhibit A\" during the trial court proceedings because Michaelski did not attach \"Exhibit A\" to her sur-reply or file it in the trial court. Fryday argues that there is no record of \"Exhibit A\" being filed during the trial court proceedings; he contends \"Exhibit A\" is \"not listed as a filing in the trial court proceeding on the Harris County District Clerk's website,\" and that \"neither party requested this Exhibit A when the parties designated the record on appeal.\" Fryday therefore asserts that this court cannot consider Michaelski's \"Exhibit A.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Michaelski does not join issue on Fryday's contentions that she never served him with her \"Exhibit A,\" never attached it to her sur-reply, and never filed it during the trial court proceedings.

Therefore, based on Michaelski's statement, \"Exhibit A\" was not before the trial court when it ruled on Fryday's motion to dismiss. We do not consider evidence that was not before the trial court at the time it made its ruling in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Austin Reg'l Clinic, P.A. v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). Accordingly, we cannot consider \"Exhibit A\" filed on February 8, 2017, because it was not before the trial court when it signed its order denying Fryday's motion to dismiss; we consider only Fryday's declaration and Michaelski's Exhibit B which was attached to her sur-reply as evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Contrary to Michaelski's assertion, Exhibit B does not constitute evidence defeating Fryday's claim to status as a City employee. Exhibit B is a copy of a one-page excerpt of what appears to be an unidentified person's testimony in an unidentified proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q.

This excerpt does not reveal (1) the identity of the testifying witness; (2) the proceeding in which the witness testified; (3) what work the witness performed; and (4) that the witness was not employed by the City of Clear Lake Shores. At most, the excerpt shows that the testifying witness at some point in time \"took a job with the City of Kemah\" on a part-time basis and was paid for the work performed. The excerpt does not mention Fryday or the City of Clear Lakes Shores. Thus, Exhibit B constitutes no evidence with respect to Fryday's status as a City employee when he inspected Michaelski's rental home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The only evidence of Fryday's employment status is Fryday's declaration. We already have concluded that Fryday's declaration establishes that he was an employee of the City as defined by the Texas Tort Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The trial court erred by denying Fryday's motion to dismiss under section 101.106(f).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20101.106\">\n    Tex.

Fryday's affidavit failed to present facts to establish that the City is a governmental unit under the TTCA, that Michaelski's claims could have been brought against the City under the TTCA, or that Fryday's conduct was within the general scope of his employment with the City. While Michaelski did not specifically argue these deficits in her brief, her silence did not relieve Fryday of his burden to establish every element of his defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lenoir v.
