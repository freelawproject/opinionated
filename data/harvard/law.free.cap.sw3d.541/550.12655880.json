His widow brought a wrongful death action against her husband's supervisory co-employees, Gregory Norfus and David Cheese (collectively, \"Co-employees\").

Because Appellant failed to establish Co-employees owed McComb a duty separate and distinct from his employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace, this Court affirms the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Edward R. McComb worked as a courier for a hospital and was tasked with delivering medical supplies and other materials to clinics. He was scheduled to work on a day when a severe winter storm moved through Missouri, causing the governor to declare a state of emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before McComb's shift began, his immediate supervisor, Gregory Norfus, was informed by other employees that a severe winter storm was approaching the area. Norfus called David Cheese, who supervised both Norfus and McComb, and asked if Cheese wanted McComb to drive his route. Cheese instructed Norfus to tell McComb to go on his route, but to drive slowly and carefully. Cheese did not consult with anyone or check the weather forecast before making the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During McComb's shift, Norfus called him to check on his status. McComb told Norfus the windshield of his vehicle was freezing. Norfus again contacted Cheese to ask if they should pull McComb from his route, but Cheese instructed Norfus that McComb, who was not delivering any vital organs or \"STAT\" items that needed immediate delivery, should continue as scheduled. Before the end of his shift, McComb's vehicle slid off the road, flipping several times down an embankment. He died as a result of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant sued Co-employees for wrongful death, arguing they were negligent in sending McComb on his route and declining to pull him off his route despite the weather conditions. Co-employees moved for summary judgment and claimed the suit was barred by the exclusivity provision in Missouri's workers' compensation statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   sec. 287.120. The trial court granted summary judgment.

According to Appellant, whether McComb's death was attributable to his employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace is a question of fact for a jury to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The workers' compensation statute applicable at the time of McComb's death provided the following exclusivity provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

As explained in\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , the definition of \"employer\" in the statute does not include a co-employee. 489 S.W.3d at 790. Because a co-employee is not an employer under the workers' compensation law, a co-employee is not covered in the exclusivity provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, section 287.120.1 does not release a co-employee from any common law liability resulting from the work-related accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Appellant is permitted to pursue common law remedies against Co-employees because the version of section 287.120.1 in effect at the time of McComb's death did not release Co-employees from common law liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 790.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To establish a cause of action for common law negligence, \"the plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant failed to perform that duty; and (3) the defendant's breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 793 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

In\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   , a truck driver was involved in a fatal single-vehicle accident. 489 S.W.3d at 777. His family claimed his medical condition-including his smoking habits, obesity, severe coronary artery disease, diabetes, and probable sleep apnea -made it unsafe for him to operate as a truck driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 777. They brought a wrongful death action against three of the driver's supervisory co-employees, claiming they had a duty to provide a safe working environment by monitoring the driver's physical condition to determine whether he was fit to drive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This Court concluded as a matter of law the duties allegedly breached by the supervisory co-employees \"[fell] squarely within the [employer's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   duty to provide a safe workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 779. The trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the supervisory co-employees was affirmed because the driver's family failed to show the supervisory co-employees owed a duty separate and distinct from the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Analogous to Appellant's argument that Co-employees owed a duty to McComb to pull him from his route when inclement weather created a danger, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   claimed the supervisory co-employees owed a duty to the driver to not allow him to drive because of his particular health problems. As a matter of law, both duties clearly fall within an employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace. It would be illogical to say a court may determine the employer had a nondelegable duty, but then allow the jury to decide whether the co-employee's conduct fell within that duty. Both determinations are questions of law for the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It was an employer's nondelegable duty at common law to provide a safe workplace, \"and it breaches that duty where it charged an employee with the responsibility to provide a reasonably safe work environment but the employee did not so provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 800.

McComb's employer had a procedure of what drivers should do in bad weather, and it relied on supervisors to ensure drivers followed the procedures to provide a safe workplace.

Although Appellant inartfully argues there are material facts in dispute regarding the duty owed to McComb that defeat summary judgment, I believe the pleadings established Co-employees' directive that McComb continue his route in increasingly dangerous weather conditions created a transitory risk in negligently carrying out the details of the work, resulting in a breach of duty beyond the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace.

In each of those cases, the co-employee or supervisor engaged in conduct that created a hazardous condition, or transitory risk, beyond the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace, resulting in injury or death. Although these cases set forth affirmative acts and purposeful conduct consistent with the \"something more\" doctrine, in\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   this Court stated cases applying the \"something more\" test \"can still prove instructive in a common law analysis\" when determining a co-employee's duty, even though an injured employee is not required to allege affirmative, purposeful, or inherently dangerous conduct or conduct directed at the injured employee to establish co-employee liability in cases in which the common law applies.\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 797-98.\n   <em>\n    Conner v.

Moreover, when McComb delivered or picked up life-saving medical supplies, organs, or other \"STAT\" items, driving in inclement weather was required as a part of his job description. McComb's job description required him to deliver \"STAT\" items immediately and to remove \"snow/frost from both [courier] vehicles for STAT runs in winter months.\" In those instances, Co-employees' directive to navigate the winter storm would not have breached a duty owed by Co-employees separate and distinct from the employer's duty to provide a safe workplace. Yet these are not the facts presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Appellant, it is clear McComb was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   delivering a \"STAT\" item when Norfus asked Cheese if he could pull McComb off his route after McComb reported his visibility was impaired. I would find Cheese's act of sending McComb out to drive his route and failure to pull McComb from the route was a transitory risk created by Co-employees' negligence in carrying out the details of the work beyond the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace as found in\n   <em>\n    Tauchert\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. The winter weather conditions were so severe that not only did the governor issue a state of emergency, but Norfus also called Cheese prior to McComb's shift to discuss whether McComb should be sent out on his route at all. Cheese did not check the weather forecast, failed to consult with anyone, and did not even deign to look out his office window before directing McComb to drive his route. Cheese knew it would take several hours to complete his route and McComb would be driving the route by himself in the dark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   When Norfus spoke with McComb later that evening, McComb told Norfus his windshield was freezing. A reasonable inference from McComb's disclosure strongly suggested the freezing windshield impacted his visibility while driving through the winter storm in the dark. Norfus again called Cheese and requested permission to pull McComb from his route. Cheese declined,\n   although he could have pulled McComb from his route, and he knew McComb's job duties did not require him to perform deliveries of nonlife-saving or non-STAT items in severe winter weather when a state of emergency had been issued. Tragically, Cheese's directive to Norfus to instruct McComb to continue driving during a severe winter storm, knowing McComb's visibility was impaired due to the storm, a freezing windshield, and darkness, was a transitory risk, which, resulted in McComb's death, just as occurred in\n   <em>\n    Tauchert\n   </em>\n   and the other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I also disagree with the principal opinion's proposition the duty allegedly breached in this case is similar to the one allegedly breached in\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   , the employee, who had a myriad of medical conditions, was involved in a fatal single-vehicle accident in the course of his employment.\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 777. The employee's family filed a wrongful death action against three co-employees, alleging they had a duty to provide a safe working environment, to monitor the employee's health to determine if he was fit to drive, and to determine whether the employee was in compliance with federal regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This Court held these allegations failed to establish the co-employees owed the employee a duty separate and distinct from the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 782.\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and the principle opinion's reliance on it is misplaced because\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   did not reach the issue of transitory risk, which squarely is at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Appellant established Co-employees' directive that McComb continue his route in the face of severe inclement weather and reduced visibility due to the darkness and an icy windshield created a transitory risk in negligently carrying out the details of the work, resulting in a breach of duty beyond the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace. I would reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in Co-employees' favor and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
