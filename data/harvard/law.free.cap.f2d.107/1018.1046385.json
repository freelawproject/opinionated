Mitchell, 269 U.S. 514, 46 S.Ct. 172, 70 L.Ed. 384, followed by us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>in Pease v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 83 F.2d 122; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">It being also the view of the court that the taxpayer\u2019s immunity from income taxation, even though not destroyed by the application of the rule of the above cases, must now be denied upon the authority of Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 58 S.Ct. 969, 82 L.Ed. 1427, announced since decision below; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">It being also the view of the court that the finding made below that the taxpayer was regular employee of a political subdivision of Ohio employed by statutory authority and engaged in the exercise of a governmental function and so that the taxpayer is immune to federal taxation is a conclusion of law based upon application of constitutional interpretation now rejected by the Supreme Court and is, therefore, not controlling even though the precise question upon which decision must depend was not argued at the trial and is not made the subject of an assignment of error; Now, therefore:</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment below be and it is hereby reversed and that the cause be remanded for new trial with decision to be governed by the conclusions herein set forth.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
