The term \u201cwhiskies\u201d was cancelled, however, by an amendment to the application, made subsequent to the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and while the appeal was pending before the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">It appears from the record that for approximately seven years prior to February 9, 1934, appellant and its predecessor were engaged in the manufacture and sale of non-alcoholic cordials, syrups, and extracts; that about two years prior to the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., December 6, 1933, appellant\u2019s predecessor, D. J. Bielzoff Products Company, o a partnership, used a trade-mark comprising the word \u201cIncomparable\u201d in white lettering immediately above a representation in red silhouette of a rearing horse with a rider thereon, and the initials \u201cD. J. B.,\u201d also in white lettering, in a circle in the upper left-hand corner of the label, all appearing on a black background, on its non-alcoholic cordials, syrups, and extracts; that the appellant company was incorporated in November 1933, and shortly thereafter acquired the property and good will of the D. J. Bielzoff Products Company; that shortly after the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, appellant commenced the manufacture and sale of the alcoholic beverages hereinbefore set forth; and that, on February 9, 1934, appellant changed its trade-mark by substituting the term \u201cRed Horse\u201d for the term \u201cIncomparable\u201d and omitting the initials \u201cD. J. B,\u201d and, on that date, proceeded to use the mark so changed on its goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">It further appears from the record that appellee, a British corporation, is the owner of the following trade-mark registrations : registration No. 101072, dated November 10, 1914, of a trade-mark comprising a pictorial representation of a white horse, together with the words \u201cWhite Horse Cellar,\u201d for use on Scotch whisky; registration No. 312106, dated March 13, 1933, of a trade-mark comprising a pictorial representation of a white horse, appearing on a black background, togeth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>er with the words \u201cThe White Horse,\u201d in white lettering, for use on whisky; registration No. 302117, dated March 28, 1933, of the term \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d for use on whisky; registration No. 310140, dated February 13, 1934, issued on an application filed October 7, 1933, of a trade-mark comprising the pictorial representation of a black horse and the words \u201cThe Famed Black Horse fine Old Highland Malt Whisky,\u201d the words \u201cfine Old Highland Malt Whisky\u201d being disclaimed apart from the mark as shown. It further appears from the record that since the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, December 6, 1933, to the time of the taking of the testimony for opposer in this case, May 1938, appellee has expended approximately $543,000 in advertising its product (advertised and Known as \u201cWhite Horse Scotch Whisky\u201d) and its white horse trade-mark, registration No. 101072, throughout the United States in newspapers, periodicals, trade papers, menus, catalogues, wine lists, programs, posters, Christmas cards, window displays, and in distributing miniature white horses; that miniature white horses are attached to the neck of each bottle 'of appellee\u2019s \u201cWhite Horse Scotch Whisky\u201d; that Browne Vintners Company, Incorporated, importer and distributor of wines and liquors, imports and sells in the United States appellee\u2019s \u201cWhite Horse Scotch Whisky\u201d; that the Browne Vintners Company has advertised appellee\u2019s product to the extent and in the manner hereinbefore stated; that it has not advertised appellee\u2019s \u201cBlack Horse\u201d whisky; and that it is not an uncommon practice in the liquor trade for a producer to market its products under closely related trademarks; such as, for example, Seagram\u2019s \u201cFive Crown\u201d and \u201cSeven Crown,\u201d Hiram Walker\u2019s \u201cKing of Clubs,\u201d \u201cQueen of Clubs,\u201d and \u201cJack of Clubs,\u201d and.Gooderham &amp; Worts\u2019 use of \u201cThree Star\u201d and \u201cFive Star.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">There is no evidence of record relative to the use of appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cBlack Horse\u201d in the United States, and, although counsel for appellant argue that it is not used in this country, it is sufficient to say that appellee\u2019s registration of the mark is prima facie evidence of ownership, section 16, Trade-mark Act 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96, and will be considered as presumptively valid in this proceeding. Ely &amp; Walker Dry Goods Co. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 24 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 1244, 1247, 90 F.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The goods bf the respective parties possess the same descriptive properties, and the sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the involved marks are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that as the witnesses for appellee had no personal knowledge of any confusion in trade as a result of the concurrent use by the respective parties of their marks, such fact is a circumstance to be seriously considered in determining whether or not the involved marks are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The issue here is whether the involved marks_ so nearly resemble one another as \u201cto be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers\u201d if used concurrently on the goods of the respective parties, and the failure to establish actual confusion in trade is not of vital importance. Section 5, Trade-mark Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85; Apex Electrical Manufacturing Co. v. Landers, Frary, &amp; Clark, 17 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 1184, 41 F.2d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">It is also argued here by counsel for appellant, as it is in many cases of this character, that even a child upon comparison would readily recognize the difference between the \u201cWhite Horse\u201d and \u201cRed Horse\u201d trade-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">We have repeatedly held that, in determining the question of confusing similarity, \u201cside-by-side comparison\u201d of trademarks is not a proper test. The test rather is whether a \u201ccasual purchaser\u201d would be likely to be confused by the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the respective parties. Furthermore, the marks should not be dissected, but should be considered as a whole. See Gilmore Oil Co., Ltd., v. Wolverine-Empire Refining Co., 21 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 943, 69 F.2d 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Of course, one served with a glass of \u201cRed Horse\u201d gin, cordial, liqueur, brandy, or rum would not likely believe that he was drinking a glass of \u201cWhite Horse Scotch Whisky,\u201d but those familiar with \u201cWhite Horse\u201d or \u201cBlack Horse\u201d Scotch whiskies might readily believe that \u201cRed Horse\u201d cordials, liqueurs, brandies, rums, cocktails, gins, and alcoholic bitters have the same origin, and that, as we understand it, is the argument made here by counsel for appellee. Furthermore, it appears from the record that appellee advertises \u201cWhite Horse\u201d cocktails, and it might well be that one served with a \u201cRed Horse\u201d cocktail (the ingredients of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>are not shown in the record) would believe that it was a \u201cWhite Horse\u201d cocktail.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Cases are cited and relied upon by counsel for each of the parties in support of their contentions here presented. In view of the fact, however, that in this case, as in all cases of this character, \u201cthe issues must be determined in accordance with the peculiar facts and circumstances of record,\u201d those decisions are not determinative of the issues here. Gilmore Oil Co., Ltd., v. Wolverine-Empire Refining Co., supra [21 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 943, 69 F.2d 535]. One of the cases relied upon by the Examiner of Interferences, and which was cited by counsel for appellee, is that of American Fruit Growers, Inc., v. Michigan Fruit Growers, Inc., 17 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 906, 38 F.2d 696. The issues in that case are somewhat analogous to the issues in the case at bar. We there held that a trade-mark \u201cconsisting of the word \u2018Michigander\u2019 and representations of two or three kinds of fruit inclosed within a double circle, together with an \u2018outline tracing of the lower peninsula of Michigan, and the representation of a <em>goose in white\u2019 </em>upon a black and white background, for use on fresh and canned fruits\u201d was confusingly similar with the trade-mark comprising \u201cthe words <em>\u2018Bine Goose,\u2019 </em>appearing immediately above the representation of a \u2018blue goose\u2019 enclosed within a double circle\u201d for use on fresh fruits and vegetables. (Italics not quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">It would seem to be clear that if appellant is entitled to register its \u201cRed Horse\u201d trade-mark for use on its alcoholic beverages in view of appellee\u2019s \u201cWhite Horse\u201d and \u201cBlack Horse\u201d trade-marks, other producers of alcoholic beverages might well argue that they were entitled to the registration of such trade-marks as \u201cBrown Horse,\u201d \u201cGray Horse,\u201d \u201cSorrel Horse,\u201d \u201cBay Horse,\u201d and possibly other similar marks for use on such beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">That the use and registration of such marks on alcoholic \"beverages would destroy the value of appellee\u2019s registered marks, is so apparent as to require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">We have given careful consideration to all of the arguments advanced by counsel for appellant, but are unable to concur in the view that the tribunals of the Patent Office erred in holding that the concurrent use of the marks of the parties on their respective goods would be likely to cause confusion in the trade and to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
