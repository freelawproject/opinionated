From August 1, 1934, to September 15, 1937, he was employed in various capacities in the administration and enforcement, first, of the provisions of Section 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> later of .the Connally Act. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From May 16, 1936, to September 15, 1937, he was Chief Investigator of the Federal Petroleum Agency No. 1 (herein called the Agency).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the latter date he resigned voluntarily from this position. A few days later he entered the private practice of law at Tyler. By his bill herein, filed May 10, 1938, he sought injunctions, temporary and permanent, restraining appellees from refusing to permit him t\u00f3 practice, appear or act as agent or attorney in proceedings before Federal Tender Board No. 1 (herein called the Board), which has headquarters at Kilgore, Texas, and is vested with authority to issue Certificates of Clearance for petroleum and its products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>moved in interstate commerce from the East Texas Oil Field.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He appeals from a final judgment, entered December 7, 1938, granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the bill and dismissing the suit. No claim is made for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">On March 24, 1933, appellee Ickes, as Secretary of the Interior, promulgated his Order No. 615, which so far as material here is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201c8-a. No person who has been employed or has held any office or place of trust or profit in the Department of the Interior shall be permitted to practice, appear, or act as an attorney or agent in any case, claim, contest or other proceeding before the Department or before any bureau, board, division or other agency thereof, until two years shall have elapsed after the separation of the said person, from the said service. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The bill alleges that prior to October 29, 1937, various persons sought to employ appellant to represent them in matters arising before the Board, and that he accepted such employment in matters mot pending before it or other agencies of the Government and upon which he had not passed while employed by it. There is no allegation that he accepted <em>only </em>such business.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">On October 29, 1937, the Board refused to permit appellant to appear or practice before it, and stated that it would continue to do so for a period of two years from the date of his resignation as Chief Investigator. The action was based on Order No. 615 and instructions received previously by the Board from appellee Holland, as Director of the Petroleum Conservation- Division, and approved October 27, 1937, by appellee Ickes, his superior officer. The instructions ruled that Order No. 615 applies to the operations of the Board and of the Agency, and to their employees. Appellant sought hearings on his alleged right to appear, both from the Board and from appellee Ickes, but these were denied, though by the latter only after a careful review of appellant\u2019s legal contentions on the undisputed facts. Those contentions were substantially the same as are here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">As presented in various forms they involve the validity of Order No. 615, and more especially its applicability to the Board and to appellant in relation to proceedings before it. Interesting questions are raised concerning the authority of appellee Ickes to issue the Order (whether by virtue of statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or inherent power), to extend it to the Board, the Agency, and their employees, and in regard to the manner of its application to appellant. It is argued that the Board and the Agency are riot subdivisions or parts of the Department of the Interior; hence that their employees are not its employees, and their proceedings are not its proceedings, so that Order No. 615 is not applicable to them, their proceedings or their employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The argument is based on the fact that the Connally Act vests in the President, independently of any executive department, the power to administer and enforce its provisions ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that his orders<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> delegating this authority to the \u201cSecretary of the Interior\u201d do so, not in appellee\u2019s capacity as such Secretary or as part of. the functions of that Department, but as an independent agent of the President, exercising functions unrelated to ,and unintegrated with the Department; that, therefore, the Board and the Agency, created and continued<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to assist in administering and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>forcing the Connally Act, are not subject to the Regulations of the Department, even if they are valid within it. It is asserted also that the Order is inherently unreasonable and arbitrary, and the manner of its application to appellant discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It is not necessary for us to pass upon these issues because the controversy is now moot for two reasons. Under the terms of Order No. 615 as it was applied originally to appellant, the period of his disability ended September 15, 1939. Furthermore, the appeal in this case was argued on June 12, 1939. On July 1, following, appellees filed herein a Memorandum setting forth an amended form of Order No. 615, promulgated by appellee Ickes on June 29, preceding, as a result of problems raised by the Executive Reorganization effective July 1, 1939. The material portions of the amended order are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As applied to the appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the effects of the amendments are that since June 29, 1939, he has been free, so far as the Regulation is concerned, to appear before the Board (1) as to matters not pending during his employment, at will; and (2) as to matters so pending, upon making the required affidavit and securing the Secretary\u2019s consent. One effect of the latter condition has been to prevent appellant\u2019s appearing in matters concerning which he or anyone associated with him in the claim or proceeding acquired knowledge of the facts or gave personal consideration, during employment by the Government. As to such matters appellant did not, nor could he well, ask relief. As to matters pending while he was so employed, but as to which neither he nor his associates in representation gave personal attention or acquired factual knowledge during employment, the terms of the amended order limit application of the condition to a period of two years from termination of the employment, which in the case of appellant also expired on September 15, 1939. It does not appear that appellant has been prejudiced in any way by application of the condition since the effective date of the amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Treating the Memorandum filed herein on July 1, 1939 (to which no opposition has been filed) as a formal motion to dismiss the appeal, it is ordered that the appeal be, and it is hereby, dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-16\"> Act of Congress of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 195, 200.

It appears to be admitted that the Division, supervising authority of the Board and the Agency, is part of the Department of the Interior proper.
