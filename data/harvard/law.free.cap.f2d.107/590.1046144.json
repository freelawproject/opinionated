The Examiner of Interferences \u25a0dismissed the opposition and adjudged appellee entitled to registration. The Commissioner of Patents affirmed his decision. From the decision of the latter the instant appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">On November 12, 1936, appellee made .application for registration, under the act \u2022of February 20, 1905, of the notation \u201cSo-White Hand Cleaner\u201d for use on a \u201cPowdered Hand Cleaner.\u201d There was disclaimer as to the words \u201cHand Cleaner.\u201d We note that the symbol representing what is referred to as the letter \u201co\u201d following the \u201cS,\u201d as shown on the specimen, is not, \u2022in fact, in the form of that letter but is a .solid white disk. However, it is assumed that in pronouncing the compound word the long \u201co\u201d sound is given. Use of the mark was claimed \u201csince September 15, 1936.\u201d The merchandise is described in a \u2022stipulation of counsel for the respective \u25a0parties as \u201ca slightly saponifying detergent \u2022containing no abrasives,\u201d and it is stated that it is marketed in bulk and in pack.ages. Samples of the packages were filed .as exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Appellant in due time filed notice of opposition to the registration, pleading its use and registration of the term \u201cOakite\u201d \u25a0on a product alleged, in effect, to possess the same descriptive properties as the pow\u2022dered hand cleaner of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Ownership of several registrations of the term \u201cOakite\u201d is alleged in the notice of \u2022opposition and the certificates of two of these are embraced in the record. The last \u2022of these, No. 330,255, bears date of November 26, 1935, which was prior to the date of appellee\u2019s application. So far as the certificate standing alone is concerned, it does not indicate that the product to which the mark was being applied was one for use upon the person. It recites that it is for \u201cchemical compounds having water-softening qualities\u201d recommended for \u201ccleansing, washing and polishing\u201d a variety of articles named. However, it is shown by the record that at least one of the Oakite company\u2019s products-to which the mark is applied has been widely advertised as being especially useful in removing grease and oil from hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">No oral testimony was taken but stipulations as to certain testimony and facts were entered into and filed on behalf of both parties. It is unnecessary to review those at length. In the decision of the Examiner of Interferences it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-15\">\u201cThe merchandise sold by the opposer is a non-saponaceous chemical cleaning preparation put up in granulated or powder form, which has been marketed in bulk and in retail packages for many years. As indicated by the exhibits referred to in paragraph 8 of the stipulated evidence, this preparation is recommended for a multiplicity of household and other uses, such as for cleansing dishes, cooking utensils, painted or varnished surfaces, clothing, etc. It is also recommended for washing hands. To summarize, it is believed' that the goods of the op-poser is a detergent material of general utility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">\u201cThe goods of the applicant is described as a \u2018powdered hand cleaner\u2019 and as such possesses a specifically different trade appeal from the goods of the opposer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">In both instances the goods are shown to have been sold for household use and the commissioner expressly held them to be of the same .descriptive properties. We are of the opinion that such holding was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">So, the issue is limited to the question of similarity of the marks \u2014 specifically whether they are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers as to origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Appellant points out that both marks comprise two-syllable words; that the letter \u201co\u201d is common to both and that each ends in the suffix \u201cite.\u201d It is not insisted, however, that in actual physical appearance there is any close resemblance; appellant stressing more especially the element of \u201cphonetic similarity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The principal court decisions cited by-appellant are one of this court in the case of Buckeye Soda Co. v. Oakite Products, Inc., 56 F.2d 462, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1034, where we held \u201cNovite\u201d and \u201cOakite\u201d to be confusingly similar, affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in that respect, and a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the case of Oakite Products, Inc. v. Boritz et al., 161 Misc. 807, 293 N.Y.S. 399, enjoining use by the latter of the word \u201cBorite\u201d on the ground that it infringed \u201cOakite.\u201d There were also cited several decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office in opposition and cancellation cases where appellant has prevailed against various marks, such as \u201cOzite,\u201d \u201cFlorite,\u201d \u201cColite,\u201d \u201cSoakwhite,\u201d and others wherein the letter \u201cO\u201d appeared, \u201cite\u201d constituting the suffix.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">We, in common with other courts, frequently have had occasion to point out that each trade-mark case where the issue involved is solely that of similarity of marks must, in the final analysis, be determined largely upon the basis of .opinion as to such similarity and not by comparison with other cases involving other words.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In the instant case we see practically no physical resemblance between the contesting marks, each considered as a whole, nor is there any resemblance in the per se meaning of the terms. \u201cOakite\u201d appears to be a purely arbitrary term. It is not suggestive of any quality of appellant\u2019s, hand cleaner nor of any result obtained from its use. \u201cSo-White\u201d may be somewhat suggestive of quality or result, but, as was said below in substance, it consists of a combination of two ordinary English words and its meaning is hardly capable of being misunderstood.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">It is true that because of the presence of \u201co\u201d (in appellee\u2019s case'of a symbol so pronounced), and the suffix \u201cite,\u201d a certain resemblance in sound may result from the pronunciation of the terms, and, as has been stated, this is stressed by counsel for appellant. We have taken note of phonetic similarity in many cases when it appeared that the conflicting words might easily be confused in pronunciation, but in the instant case we find no ground for believing that any such confusion might reasonably be anticipated. The rule of phonetic resemblance, if it may be so designated, should not be applied because of a mere possibility of occasional confused enunciation of words. There should be a reasonable probability at least. We do not think such probability may be assumed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
