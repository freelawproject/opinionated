Lay appeals the District Court\u2019s conclusion that her claims were time-barred under the Montana Human Rights Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding that Lay\u2019s claims were time-barred as a matter of law under the Montana Human Rights Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">\u00b64 On January 11,2012, Lay\u2019s position as public information officer for the Emergency Services Division (Division) of the State of Montana Department of Military Affairs was eliminated during implementation ofthe Division\u2019s reduction-in-force (RIF) policy. After elimination ofher position, Lay filed a grievance with the Department of Labor and Industry Hearings Bureau (Bureau) in accordance with the State of Montana\u2019s grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">\u00b65 Lay alleged the Division terminated her in retaliation for her complaint that sexual favoritism<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had occurred within the Division. Specifically, Lay contended she was discharged because she had complained that another Division employee, Jessica Davies, received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>favorable treatment for engaging in a sexual relationship with Division supervisor, Paul Grimstad. On March 21,2012, the Bureau conducted a hearing on Lay\u2019s claims and thereafter dismissed Lay\u2019s complaint, concluding that the Division terminated Lay solely for business reasons related to the RIF. The Bureau informed Lay she could appeal to district court. However, Lay chose not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">\u00b66 Instead, Lay filed a discrimination complaint with the Montana Human Rights Bureau of the Department of Labor and Industry (Department) in which she restated her allegations of sexual favoritism and retaliation. A Department officer conducted an investigation into Lay\u2019s complaint, and on August 13, 2012, the Department issued a decision order concluding that Lay\u2019s allegations were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In its written decision dismissing the complaint, the Department informed Lay that, if she wished to pursue her claim in district court, she had 90 days under the Montana Human Rights Act to commence a civil action. Lay did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b67 On January 9, 2013, Lay filed the present action in the First Judicial District Court. Lay\u2019s complaint alleged causes of action titled as follows: \u201cCount 1: Conspiracy to Violate Constitutional Rights\u201d; \u201cCount 2: State Constitutional Rights Deprivation\u201d; \u201cCount 3: <em>Monell </em>Claim\u201d; \u201cCount 4: Wrongful Discharge\u201d; and \u201cCount 5: Attorneys Fees.\u201d After both parties moved for summary judgment, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, concluding Lay\u2019s claims were time-barred as a matter of law under the Montana Human Rights Act. The court reasoned the Montana Human Rights Act provided the exclusive remedy for Lay\u2019s claims because, while Lay had attempted to re-characterize her claims within her complaint, the gravamen of her claims remained sexual favoritism and retaliation. The court determined that Lay was required to pursue these claims under the procedures provided in the Montana Human Rights Act, including the requirement that a party file a complaint in district court within 90 days of the Department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b68 Lay appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b69 We review orders of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria used by the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 449, 999 P.2d 1010. Summary judgment is only appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u00b610 The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing an absence of genuine issues of material fact. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14. If the moving party satisfies this initial burden, then the burden shifts to the non-moving party to set forth specific facts, not merely denials, speculation, or conclusoiy statements, in order to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does indeed exist. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding that Lay\u2019s claims were time-barred as a matter of law under the Montana Human Rights Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALi\">\u00b612 The Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA), codified in Title 49 of the Montana Code, protects the right of an employee to \u201chold employment without discrimination.\u201d Section 49-1-102(1), MCA. The MHRA declares that it is an \u201cunlawful discriminatory practice\u201d for an employer \u201cto discriminate against a person in compensation or in a term, condition, or privilege of employment because of... sex when the reasonable demands of the position do not require\u201d such a distinction. Section 49-2-303(1), MCA. The MHRA further prohibits any governmental entity from discharging or \u201cotherwise discriminating] against an individual because the individual has opposed\u201d unlawful discrimination. Section 49-2-301, MCA. If an employee complains of \u201cacts constituting an alleged violation\u201d of the MHRA, the MHRA provides the \u201cexclusive remedy,\u201d and the employee must seek redress in conformance with the procedures set forth in the MHRA. Section 49-2-512(1), MCA. The MHRA is explicit that a \u201cclaim or request for relief based upon the acts may not be entertained by a district court other than by the procedures specified in [the MHRA].\u201d Section 49-2-512(1), MCA. If the charging party\u2019s complaint is dismissed by the Department, the party is permitted to \u201ccommence a civil action for appropriate relief on the merits of the case in the district court in the district in which the alleged violation occurred.\u201d Section 49-2-512(3), MCA. However, if \u201cthe charging party fails to commence a civil action within 90 days after the dismissal has been issued, the claim is barred.\u201d Section 49-2-512(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b613 Lay argues that, despite her failure to commence a civil action in district court within 90 days following the Department\u2019s decision, her claims are not time-barred because the MHRA is inapplicable to her claims. Lay contends her claims are not based on allegations of discrimination or retaliation in employment. Lay argues that \u201cthe heart\u201d of her complaint is a violation of constitutional due process of law. She asserts the Division violated her right to due process when it failed \u201cto consider her skills, qualifications, experience, performance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>and length of continuous service\u201d prior to her termination, as required under the REF policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b614 The Division counters the \u201ccore of [Lay\u2019s] case is an allegation that she was retaliated against for objecting to the opportunities afforded to a colleague in exchange for sex,\u201d and that \u201csuch a claim \u2018may not be entertained by a district court\u2019 without following the procedures\u201d outlined in the Montana Human Rights Act. The Division argues \u201cthe law is clear that [Lay] had an avenue for pursuing her claim, and cannot now file a lawsuit under different legal theories to circumvent those provided procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b615 This Court is no stranger to attempts to characterize a claim in such a way so as to avoid the exclusive procedures set forth in the MHRA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Edwards v. Cascade Cnty Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t., </em>2009 MT 451, 354 Mont. 307, 223 P.3d 893; <em>Vettel-Becker v. Deaconess Med. Ctr. of Billings, Inc., </em>2008 MT 51, 341 Mont. 435, 177 P.3d 1034; <em>Saucier v. McDonald\u2019s Rests, of Mont., Inc., </em>2008 MT 63, 342 Mont. 29, 179 P.3d 481; <em>Arthur v. Pierre Ltd., </em>2004 MT 303, 323 Mont. 453, 100 P.3d 987; <em>Shields v. Helena Sch. Dist. No. </em>1, 284 Mont. 138, 943 P.2d 999 (1997); <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone Cnty, </em>272 Mont. 261, 900 P.2d 901 (1995); <em>Fandrich v. Capital Ford Lincoln Mercury, </em>272 Mont. 425, 901 P.2d 112 <em>(1995); Harrison v. Chance, </em>244 Mont. 215, 797 P.2d 200 (1990). In determining whether the MHRA is applicable, we look to the gravamen of the party\u2019s complaint, as opposed to the party\u2019s characterization of her claims. <em>Saucier, </em>\u00b6 56. We have recognized that \u201clitigants can frequently employ tort terminology to improperly re-characterize\u201d what is at the heart of their complaint, <em>Saucier, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont, at 223,797 P.2d at 205; <em>Arthur, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-27), and that permitting a party to bypass the MHRA\u2019s procedures in so doing \u201cwould be to eviscerate the mandate\u201d of the MHRA, requiring that it provide the exclusive remedy for acts constituting violations thereof. <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 223, 797 P.2d at 205. Thus, we undertake a gravamen analysis in which we focus on the \u201cnature of the alleged conduct.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>\u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b616 At the outset, we note that the parties do not contest the District Court\u2019s determination that sexual favoritism is unlawfiil sex discrimination. As noted above, while retaliation is prohibited by the MHRA, the retaliation must be in response to unlawful discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>in order to necessitate the applicability of the MHRA procedures. Section 49-2-301, MCA. Given the posture of this case, we assume, without deciding, that sexual favoritism is unlawful discrimination based on sex. It is well established that it is \u201cnot this Court\u2019s obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d <em>Cutler v. Jim Gilman Excavating, Inc., </em>2003 MT 314, \u00b6 22, 318 Mont. 255, 80 P.3d 1203 (citing In <em>re B.P., </em>2001 MT 219, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 430, 35 P.3d 291). We recognize the issue of whether, and in what circumstances, sexual favoritism may constitute sex-based discrimination has divided federal and state courts, contributing to much scholarly debate. <em>See </em>Meghan E. Bass, Note, <em>Dangerous Liaisons: Paramour No More, </em>41 Val. U.L. Rev. 303, 324 (2006) (describing the issue as an \u201cexpansive judicial battleground\u201d); Susan J. Best, Comment, <em>Sexual Favoritism: A Cause of Action Under a \u2018Sex-Plus\u2019Theory, </em>30 N. HI. U.L. Rev. 211,224 (2009) (discussing the \u201csplit among the federal circuits on whether widespread sexual favoritism is a cause of action under the hostile work environment theory of sexual harassment\u201d); Paige I. Bemick, Article, <em>You\u2019re Sending the Wrong Message: Sexual Favoritism and the Workplace, </em>7-1 Tenn. J. L. &amp; Pol\u2019y 141,145 (2011) (discussing the \u201cdivergent views on sexual favoritism\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b617  On that assumption, we conclude that Lay\u2019s claims are subject to the MHRA. The gravamen of the complaint is the factual allegation that Lay\u2019s employment was terminated because she objected to Davies receiving favorable treatment for engaging in a sexual relationship with Grimstad. Although Lay couches her claims in terms of the RIF policy, her complaint is premised entirely on an allegation of sexual favoritism and her employer\u2019s retaliation for her objection to the practice. Lay admits as much in the complaint, stating she \u201cwas discriminated and retaliated against <em>solely </em>because she objected to Grimstad\u2019s improper relationship with Davies and the overt favoritism that was being showed to Davies by Grimstad.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Lay\u2019s allegations of discrimination and retaliation are repeated throughout her complaint, which provides: (1) the \u201cDefendants unlawfully discriminated and retaliated against Lay by laying her ofF after she \u201ccomplained about favoritism that Grimstad was affording to Davies in exchange for sex\u201d; (2) Lay\u2019s employment was \u201ctaken in retaliation for Lay\u2019s complaint about the favoritism that Grimstad was providing to Davies in exchange for sexual favors, and Lay\u2019s testimony in the ensuing investigation\u201d; and (3) the Defendants \u201cdeliberately and intentionally eliminated Lay\u2019s position under the pretext of a reorganization and reduction-in-force with the specific purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>forcing Lay\u201d out of the Division \u201cin retaliation for [her] complaints about the favoritism.\u201d Lay\u2019s allegations of sexual favoritism and retaliation are, in fact, the only allegations contained in the complaint. If these allegations were removed from the complaint, Lay would have no actionable claim of any kind. Because the gravamen of the complaint is an allegation that the Division terminated Lay in retaliation for her objection to sexual favoritism in employment, the District Court did not err by holding that Lay\u2019s claims were subject to the procedures set forth in the MHRA, and as a result were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b618 We affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b395-5\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-14\"> Sexual favoritism is defined generally to denote the situation where \u201ca supervisor grants benefits and/or promotions to an employee with whom he or she is having a sexual and/or romantic relationship, and in turn denies these benefits and/or promotions to qualified third-party employees.\u201d Mary Kate Sheridan, Article, <em>Just Because It\u2019s Sex Doesn\u2019t Mean It\u2019s Because of Sex: The Need for New Legislation to Target Sexual Favoritism, </em>40 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 379,383 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> This has become less frequent since the Legislature\u2019s revision of the MHRA in 2007. <em>See Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. </em>1, 2010 MT 246, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321 (discussing effects of the 2007 revisions to the MHRA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> The District Court also determined that Lay could not recover separately under the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, \u00a7 39-2-901, MCA, et seq. Lay makes a passing reference to the court\u2019s determination in a single sentence, stating: \u201cNowhere in the causes of action alleged under <em>Dorwart, Monell, </em>or the Wrongful Discharge Act is there any kind of requirement that Lay go through the procedures identified in the Human Rights Act, or which provide that \u00a7 49-2-512, MCA constitutes the \u2018exclusive remedy for the civil rights violations visited upon her as complained in this case.\u201d As we explained above, it is not this Court\u2019s obligation to develop arguments for a party on appeal. <em>Cutler, </em>\u00b6 22. Nonetheless, with respect to the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, we have previously concluded that if the plaintiffs claim is properly subject to the MHRA, the plaintiff cannot currently file under the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act. <em>See Fandrich v. Capital Ford Lincoln Mercury, </em>272 Mont. 425, 432, 901 P.2d 112, 116 (1995) (where the plaintiff was \u201cbarred from bringing his claim pursuant to the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act because the Human Rights Act provide[d] his exclusive remedy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
