We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-14\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred by allowing Martin\u2019s Locomotive Inspection Act claim to be considered by the jury.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of heated platforms at BNSF\u2019s Whitefish and Essex depots.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence the specific amount of income Martin made from his non-railroad employment.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b63 Martin began working as a switchman/brakeman for BNSF on July 12,2004. A few months later, Martin was promoted to conductor after completing the required training and exam. In December 2008, Martin was permanently assigned to work on the conductors\u2019 extra board in Whitefish. The extra board is a list of conductors who fill in on an as-needed basis for absent workers. Conductors on the extra board are guaranteed a daily rate of pay for remaining on the extra board and are paid a higher rate for actual trips made. On January 1,2009, the guaranteed daily rate for conductors on the Whitefish extra board was $199.86; the trip rate was $364.98.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b64 On January 1,2009, Martin was called into work at 1:05 a.m. at BNSF\u2019s Whitefish yard to work a priority z-train to Havre. At the yard, Martin met up with his co-worker, locomotive engineer Randy Anderson. After completing the required pre-trip paperwork, Martin and Anderson walked across the platform from the crew shanty to the train. Anderson boarded the locomotive before Martin. Before stepping onto the locomotive, Martin observed a small amount of ice and snow on the locomotive steps. As Martin climbed the steps of the locomotive, his foot slipped. Martin asserts that as he fell back towards the platform, his left foot came down on a berm of snow which had accumulated between the platform and the locomotive steps, causing his knee to twist and resulting in a tear of his left anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Martin\u2019s injury required surgery and physical therapy and prevented performance of his duties as a conductor between January 19,2009, and June 15,2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b65 Before working for BNSF, Martin worked in law enforcement. Martin\u2019s law enforcement experience included working as a sheriffs deputy in Roosevelt County and in undercover drug investigations in Yellowstone County. Martin has a master\u2019s degree in criminal justice administration. From 2006 until 2010, Martin performed law enforcement related consulting work for the Chippewa-Cree Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b66 Martin filed suit against BNSF on December 8,2011, under the Federal Employers\u2019 liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 et seq., alleging negligence. The juiy returned a verdict in favor of BNSF on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>negligence and strict liability claims for violations of the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701. On November 20, 2013, Martin filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under M. R. Civ. P. 50, and, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59. On January 31, 2014, the District Court filed an order denying Martin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b67 Martin appeals the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, we apply the same standards as the district court. <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2011 MT 223, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984. Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. All such evidence, and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from the evidence, must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b69 The standard of review for discretionary trial court rulings is abuse of discretion. This standard may be applied to post-trial motions, such as motions for a new trial made pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59. <em>In re Johnson, </em>2011 MT 255, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 236, 262 P.3d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b610 \u201cThis Court reviews evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. A trial court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be overturned.\u201d <em>Mickelson v. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </em>2000 MT 111, \u00b6 35,299 Mont. 348,999 P.2d 985. A district court commits an abuse of discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. If we determine that a district court abused its discretion, we must next determine whether the abuse of discretion constitutes reversible error. No reversible error occurs unless a substantial right of the appellant is affected, nor does reversible error occur unless the evidence in question was of such character as to have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>United Tool Rental, Inc. v. Riverside Contr., Inc., </em>2011 MT 213, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 493, 260 P.3d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">\u00b611 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by allowing Martin\u2019s Locomotive Inspection Act claim to be considered by the jury. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u00b612 The FELA \u201crenders railroads liable for employees\u2019 injuries or deaths \u2018resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. </em>McBride,_U.S._, 131 S. Ct. 2630, 2634 (2011) (quoting 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51). Coupled with the FELA are numerous safety acts, including the LIA (previously the Boiler Inspection Act), and the Safety Appliance Act. <em>Urie v. Thompson, </em>337 U.S. 163, 189-90, 69 S. Ct. 1018, 1034 (1949). The safety acts do not operate as a separate cause of action themselves, but \u201csupplement^ the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act by imposing on interstate railroads \u2018an absolute and continuing duty* to provide safe equipment.\u201d <em>Urie, </em>337 U.S. at 188, 69 S. Ct. at 1034 <em>(citing Lilly v. Grand Trunk </em>W. <em>R.R. Co., </em>317 U.S. 481, 485, 63 S. Ct. 347, 351 (1943)). Thus, injured railroad employees may seek recovery under the FELA for violations of these safety acts. <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Dallas v. Burlington N., Inc., </em>212 Mont. 514, 520, 689 P.2d 273, 276 (1984)). A railroad may breach its duty under the LIAnot only by violating the statute itself, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701(1), but also by failing to comply with pertinent Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations. <em>McGinn v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>102 F.3d 295, 299 (7th Cir. 1996). An FRA defect may constitute a violation of the LIA, thus giving rise to strict liability under the LIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b613  To prevail on an LIA claim, a railroad employee must demonstrate both that the LIA has been violated and that the violation caused the employee\u2019s injuries. <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 22. The employee\u2019s burden of proof differs in a FELA case when the claim is premised on a violation of the LIA or an applicable regulation. The FELA requires a showing of negligence, whereas the LIA requires proof of a statutory or regulatory violation. <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">When a plaintiff alleges that a railroad has violated a federal safety statute, the Supreme Court has \u2018extended the reach of the principle of negligence <em>per se </em>to cover injuries suffered by employees as a result of their employers\u2019 statutory violations, even if the injuries sustained were not of a type that the relevant statute sought to prevent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\"><em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Consol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, </em>512 U.S. 532, 543, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 2404 (1994)). If the employee establishes a violation of the LIA, the negligence requirement of the FELA claim is established as a matter of law. <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">\u00b614 \u201cThe LIA should be liberally construed\u2019 in light of its primary purpose to protect employees and require the use of safe equipment.\u201d <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Lilly, </em>317 U.S. at 486, 63 S. Ct. at 351). The LIA states in pertinent part that \u201c[a] railroad carrier may use or allow to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances... are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessaxy danger of personal injury.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701(1). The applicable safety regulation at issue in this case requires that \u201c[flloors of cabs, passageways, and compartments shall be kept free from oil, water, waste or any obstruction that creates a slipping, tripping or fire hazard.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.119(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b615 Martin argues that because he proved the presence of ice and snow on the steps of the BNSF locomotive, which he argues is a slipping hazard and a violation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.119(c), BNSF is liable under the LIA as a matter of law. BNSF argues that whether ice and snow was a violation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.119(c) was a proper question for the jury, citing <em>Gregory v. Mo. Pac. </em>R.R., 32 F.3d 160 (5th Cir. 1994). In <em>Gregory, </em>there was conflicting testimony regarding the presence and amount of oil on a locomotive floor. The Fifth Circuit held that whether or not the oil constituted a slipping hazard was a question of fact, and therefore a question for the jury. <em>Gregory, </em>32 F.3d at 162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b616  It is axiomatic that if, in fact, Martin slipped on the ice and snow on the locomotive steps, then the ice and snow were a slipping hazard. However, even assuming Martin established, as he contends, the presence of the ice and snow on the locomotive steps, he did not conclusively establish that the ice and snow caused him to slip. Evidence was presented to the jxuy that the snow and ice on the locomotive steps did not cause Martin to slip. Martin himself testified at trial that he observed only \u201ca little bit\u201d of ice and snow on the steps, and he did not know if it contributed to him slipping on the steps. Martin\u2019s attorney conceded at trial that there was conflicting evidence about ice and snow on the locomotive steps, and that it was a proper jxuy question. Viewed in a light most favorable to BNSF, evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s determination that BNSF was not liable for Martin\u2019s injury due to the presence of ice and snow on the locomotive\u2019s steps. The District Court did not err by allowing Martin\u2019s LIA claim to be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b617 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of heated platforms at BNSFs Whitefish and Essex depots.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKVL\">\u00b618 At the time of Martin\u2019s injury, the Whitefish platform was not heated. After Martin\u2019s injury, Amtrak used federal stimulus money to install a heated platform at Whitefish. BNSF filed a motion in limine requesting the District Court exclude evidence that the Whitefish platform is now heated, arguing it was inadmissible as a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>remedial measure. The District Court granted BNSF\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b619  \u201cWhen, after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event, measures are taken that, if taken previously, would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence [or] culpable conduct.\u201d M. R. Evid. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b620 Martin argues that because the heated platform at Whitefish was installed by Amtrak, M. R. Evid. 407 does not apply, citing <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. </em>Corp., 2010 MT 282,358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244. In <em>Stevens, </em>we held: \u201cM. R. Evid. 407 does not prohibit evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by non-parties.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>\u00b6 93. In response, BNSF neither substantively addresses nor attempts to distinguish <em>Stevens </em>other than to argue that <em>Stevens </em>\u201cis a different situation\u201d because, in the present case: \u201c[T]he platform in question was BNSF\u2019s platform on BNSF\u2019s property used by BNSF\u2019s employees (the other end of the platform was used by Amtrak).\u201d Assuming for the sake of argument that this contention was sufficient to distinguish our holding in <em>Stevens </em>from this case, BNSF fails to cite to anything in the record in support of its contention. The only evidence in the record regarding ownership of the platform to which we are cited is the representations of BNSFs attorneys during arguments on this motion in limine, in which they represented to the District Court: \u201ctilt\u2019s an AmTrak [sic] platform\u201d and \u201c[I]t was AmTrak [sic] platforms, federal money. AmTrak [sic] was the reason that they got \u2014 that they [installed the heated platform].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b621  Moreover, irrespective of the ownership of the platform, there does not seem to be any dispute in the record that the act of installing the heated platform at Whitefish was taken by Amtrak and not BNSF.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, if in fact this did constitute a subsequent remedial measure, it was nevertheless a measure taken by a non-party \u2014 Amtrak. As Martin correctly noted, we have previously held that \u201cM. R. Evid. 407 does not prohibit evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by non-parties.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>\u00b6 93. The District Court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the heated platform at Whitefish as a subsequent remedial measure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>therefore, was in error. Because we remand for a new trial on Issue Three, we need not determine whether the exclusion of this evidence prejudiced Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b622 Martin next argues that the District Court erred when it excluded evidence of the heated platform at the BNSF yard in Essex. The heated platform at Essex would not constitute a subsequent remedial measure because it was already installed at the time of Martin\u2019s injury. Martin argues on appeal that evidence of the Essex platform was admissible to show feasibility of such measures and for impeachment. BNSF responds that the District Court properly excluded evidence of the Essex platform as irrelevant. BNSF further argues that notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence, it advised Martin\u2019s attorney that he was allowed to engage in \u201cfairly rough\u201d cross-examination of BNSFs witnesses on the feasibility of heated platforms, which Martin chose not to do. BNSF therefore argues: \u201cAny error created by the District Court in not allowing evidence of the heated platforms is harmless where, as here, the Court provided Martin an alternate method of gamering the information, and he simply chose not to pursue it.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b623 As it pertains to the Essex platform, we cannot fault the District Court for declining to prospectively rule that evidence of the heated platform at Essex was relevant before it could even assess the context in which the evidence might be offered. As BNSF correctly notes, when addressing the scope of Martin\u2019s cross-examination on the issue of heated platforms, the District Court specifically advised Martin\u2019s counsel that if may be proper grounds for cross-examination to ask \u201c[Cjouldn\u2019t you shovel better? Couldn\u2019t you use salt? <em>Couldn\u2019t you put in a heated </em>platform?(Emphasis added.) The District Court concluded: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a point where you can\u2019t take it any further, but I kind of let cross-examination be fairly rough.\u201d Although Martin\u2019s attorney conceded that the District Court\u2019s ruling was \u201cfair,\u201d Martin did not engage in any cross-examination of BNSFs witnesses regarding heated platforms. Thus, he did not afford the District Court the opportunity to assess whether he had reached the point where he could not \u201ctake it any further.\u201d Martin argued evidence of the heated platform at Essex was admissible to show the feasibiliiy of a heated platform being installed at Whitefish at the time of his injury. The District Court\u2019s ruling recognized that such evidence would only become relevant once BNSF contended such a measure was <em>not </em>feasible. This was the specific line of inquiry the District Court allowed Martin to pursue and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>he chose not to do.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b624 3. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence the specific amount of income Martin made from his non-railroad employment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b625 Before trial, Martin filed a motion in limine requesting the District Court exclude any references to his outside consulting employment and \u201c[a]ny reference to monies earned by Martin as a consultant with Tim Martin Law Enforcement.\u201d The District Court denied Martin\u2019s motion in limine on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b626 Martin argues that the District Court erred by admitting the specific amounts he earned from his non-railroad employment, when the proper measure of his economic loss was what he was earning at BNSF on the date of his injury, citing <em>Adskim v. Or-Wash. R.R. &amp; Nav. Co., </em>294 P. 605, 610 (Or. 1930) (in an FELA case, the wages plaintiff was receiving at the time of injury is the proper basis upon which to measure the amount of damages he was entitled to recover as lost wages). Martin also argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by the disclosure of the income he made from his consulting business.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b627 BNSF argues that evidence of Martin\u2019s non-railroad employment was admissible for two reasons: (1) Martin could not have made himself available to work on a train every day while simultaneously working 40 hours per week elsewhere; and (2) Martin had no motivation to make himself available to work every day of the week because he was earning $80,000 to $90,000 per year in his other job. To the extent that there may have been error, BNSF argues that any error was harmless because the evidence of Martin\u2019s non-railroad employment went only to damages and, since the jury did not find BNSF liable for Martin\u2019s injuries, damages were not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b628 To the extent that the demands on Martin\u2019s time from his non-railroad employment may have restricted his availability to work the conductors\u2019 extra board, evidence of this nature was admissible. Indeed, in his counsel's colloquy with the District Court on this issue, Martin\u2019s attorney conceded: \u201cIf they want to ask him, were you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>working outside, that\u2019s fine. But to bring up the dollar amount he\u2019s making out there? There\u2019s no reason that has to come in.\u201d Although acknowledging that the evidence of Martin\u2019s non-railroad income was \u201cvery prejudicial,\u201d the District Court nevertheless concluded that it was admissible to provide context for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b629 Assuming for the sake of argument that Martin\u2019s non-railroad income during the time he was off injured had some limited probative value, BNSFs use of this evidence at trial went far beyond this theoretically limited value. BNSF and Martin stipulated at trial that he was unable to physically perform his railroad duties from January 19,2009 to June 15,2009. Yet during trial, BNSF repeatedly brought up Martin\u2019s outside consulting business and the wages he earned from that business \u2014 not just during the months in 2009 when Martin was off injured \u2014 but also for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, all of 2009, including the months Martin was not off injured, and 2010. In his opening statement, BNSFs counsel told the jury that, from his consultingbusiness, Martin earned approximately $84,000in2008 (the year <em>before </em>his injury), that he earned almost $90,000 (it was actually $84,060) in 2009 (the year of his injury), and that he earned almost $90,000 in 2010 (the year <em>after </em>his injury). During trial, over Martin\u2019s objections, BNSF introduced invoices that Martin submitted to the Chippewa-Cree Tribe both for his hours worked and his expense reimbursements. The BNSF also introduced, over Martin\u2019s objections, Schedule C from Martin\u2019s 2008,2009, and 2010 tax returns. In closing argument, BNSFs counsel argued to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">I\u2019m not faulting him for having a job that pays him 80 to 90 thousand dollars. But there was no motivation for him to work as heavily as he claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b630 We have previously held that the introduction into evidence of outside sources of income for the purpose of suggesting to the jury that a plaintiff had a motive for not working was so prejudicial as to require reversal. <em>Mydlarz v. Palmer/Duncan Constr. Co., </em>209 Mont. 325, 682 P.2d 695 (1984); <em>Mickelson v. Mont. Rail Link, </em>2000 MT 111, 299 Mont. 348, 999 P.2d 985. Although <em>Mydlarz </em>and <em>Mickelson </em>both involved the plaintiffs receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we cannot reconcile disallowing evidence of wage replacement benefits being offered to show a lack of motivation to work \u2014 as we have consistently done in the past \u2014 with allowing evidence of wages from separate employment being offered to show a lack of motivation to work, as was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b631 BNSF argues that cases such as <em>Mydlarz </em>and <em>Mickelson </em>are inapposite to the case before us because they involved collateral source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>payments as opposed to earnings from separate employment. In seeking to distinguish these cases, BNSF contends: \u201cThe exclusion of collateral source benefits at trial serves the purpose of encouraging individuals to purchase and maintain liability insurance by eliminating the prejudicial impact of such evidence.\u201d This statement illustrates the infirmity ofBNSF\u2019s argument that Martin\u2019s non-railroad income was admissible. Certainly, encouraging individuals to seek and maintain gain-fill employment serves as important a purpose as encouraging them to draw on a collateral source benefit such as workers\u2019 compensation. It makes little sense, then, that we would exclude evidence of the latter because of its prejudicial impact, but allow evidence of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b632 M. R. Evid. 403 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d \u201cRelevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. It is questionable whether evidence of the amount of money Martin earned at his non-railroad employment \u2014 much less the amount he was reimbursed for his expenses \u2014 during extended time periods both before and after his irquiy, would have any tendency to make the existence of his wage loss during a discrete five month period in 2009 any more or less probable. Even if we were to assume some relevancy to such evidence, however, as the District Court recognized, this evidence was \u201cvery prejudicial.\u201d For similar considerations that we disallowed such evidence in <em>Mydlarz </em>and <em>Mickelson, </em>we conclude it was error to admit it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b633 Regarding BNSFs argument that the error was harmless because the jury found BNSF was not hable, we rejected this same argument in <em>Mickelson, </em>in which we recognized \u201cthat such evidence can have an impact upon a jury\u2019s verdict on the issue of liability, as well as <em>damages.\u201d Mickelson, </em>\u00b6 46. We have held: \u201cThe test of prejudicial error requiring reversal is whether there is a reasonable possibility the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the verdict.\u201d <em>Boude v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>2012 MT 98, \u00b6 21, 365 Mont. 32, 277 P.3d 1221 (quoting <em>Pacificorp v. Dep\u2019t. of Revenue, </em>254 Mont. 387, 398, 838 P.2d 914, 920 (1992)). In this case, much ofBNSF\u2019s argument to the jury was essentially that, irrespective of his injury, Martin suffered no damage because he had substantial outside income. We cannot say there is not a reasonable possibility the inadmissible evidence of Martin\u2019s non-railroad income contributed to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b634  The District Court did not err by allowing the issue of whether the BNSF violated the LIA to go to the jury. The District Court erred by excluding evidence of the installation of the heated platform at Whitefish as a subsequent remedial measure. The District Court did not err by excluding evidence of the heated platform at Essex. The District Court erred by allowing any evidence of Martin\u2019s income and expense reimbursements from his non-railroad employment.

I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue One, but nevertheless find parts of the Court\u2019s analysis troubling. Preliminarily, however, proper resolution of Issues Two and Three turns on adherence to the standard of review. A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is not whether this Court would have reached the same decision, but whether the district court \u201cacted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Colstrip Energy L.P. v. Nw. </em>Corp., 2011 MT 99, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 298, 253 P.3d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u00b637 Martin filed a motion in limine arguing against BNSF\u2019s use of evidence of earnings from his law enforcement consulting business for services provided to the Rocky Boy Tribe between March 2006 and February 2011. More specifically, BNSF maintained that Martin\u2019s employment with BNSF was secondary to his consulting services, and that this was demonstrated by examining the inverse relationship between an increase in earnings from consulting and a decrease in earnings from BNSF. BNSF also maintained that the earnings from Martin\u2019s consulting business demonstrated that Martin had no incentive to work for BNSF. Martin argued that BNSF should be limited to only his wage history with BNSF and that BNSF should not be allowed to use earnings from his outside employment to contest his wage-loss claim. However, Martin agreed that BNSF could use several years of BNSF wage history in disputing his wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b638 BNSF wanted to demonstrate a trend in Martin\u2019s work history and show that, based upon this history, his claim for earnings for the six-month period following his injury was inflated and exaggerated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Specifically, BNSF argued that: (1) Martin was not available to work full-time for BNSF because he was working full-time in his consulting business, and (2) Martin had an incentive, and indeed had actually chosen, to work for the more lucrative job, given the finite number of hours he was available to work. BNSF maintained that Martin\u2019s earnings from consulting demonstrated that he was actually working 40 hours per week in consulting and averaging 50,000 miles of travel for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. In each of those years, Martin earned $80,362, $84,060, and $90,663, respectively, fromhis consulting business. BNSF argued that, consequently, Martin could not have worked fiill-time for BNSF. Additionally, the most Martin ever earned from BNSF for any given year during this timeframe was in 2010, whenhe earned $30,613. BNSF sought to show that Martin\u2019s wage-loss claim of $31,500 for a six-month period in 2009 did not fairly represent this work history. BNSF maintained that the amount of Martin\u2019s earnings was very probative and relevant to establish that his claim was over-inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b639 The District Court considered these arguments and appreciated the unique circumstances of the case before it. Indeed, the court observed that Martin\u2019s earnings from his consulting business were \u201cincredible\u201d and commented \u201cthat [it was] a pretty good consulting job.\u201d The Court recognized that the evidence was \u201cvery prejudicial,\u201d but nevertheless concluded that the jury needed to place Martin\u2019s wage-loss claim in context, and the matter was best left for cross examination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">I understand you have an objection, but to me that is the context \u2014 the jury needs to understand this \u2014 I understand the prejudicial value, but I think we need to have the context. You know, we need to talk about the year or two prior, the consulting job, and how it affected his wages when he was off work because of this accident and whether it did or didn\u2019t, you argue it did; they argue it didn\u2019t, or maybe it didn\u2019t as much as you think it did. I think the jury has a right to know that, and including the dollar amount. I get the fact that, hey, the jury is going to go, geez, but I think they need to understand that, the big picture there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b640 The parties and the District Court appreciated that Martin\u2019s wage trend and work history were relevant in determining whether Martin was entitled to damages in the full amount of $31,500, which would reflect annual earnings of $63,000 at BNSF. Martin never argued to the District Court that evidence of BNSF wages earned, for example in 2008, were not relevant. At any point in time during which Martin had earnings from his consulting business, Martin\u2019s BNSF wages were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>higher than $30,613. The District Court appreciated this and allowed the evidence to be used to demonstrate this particular point, given the unique circumstances of Martin\u2019s \u201csecondary employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b641 The Court\u2019s decision that the evidence was nevertheless inadmissible is at odds with the standard of review we must employ in resolving evidentiary issues. The District Court appreciated the arguments of counsel and the unique relationship between Martin\u2019s employment history and his wage-loss claim. Similarly, the District Court was committed to letting the jury resolve the dispute and providing them with the evidence to place the claims in proper context. In my opinion, we construe the issue too narrowly and fail to appreciate the arguments made by BNSF as to the relevance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b642 The Court also is mistaken in drawing a comparison to the collateral source rule. Pursuant to the collateral source rule, when an injured plaintiffhas been compensated for his injuries from a collateral source, the defendant may not benefit from that recovery. <em>Mickelson v. Mont. Rail Link, </em>Inc., 2000 MT 111, \u00b6 38, 299 Mont. 348, 999 P.2d 985. However, Martin did not receive compensation from his consulting business for his iryury. Instead, he received compensation for hours and amounts billed, which arguably demonstrates that he was not available to work frill-time as required to substantiate his six-month wage-loss claim. Furthermore, the exclusion of collateral source benefits has the purpose of encouraging individuals to purchase and maintain liability insurance. This purpose does not extend to the current circumstances. The Court misapplies the collateral source rule to the facts of these proceedings and fails to recognize the subtleties, which the District Court appreciated, implicit in BNSFs argument regarding the relevancy of the evidence. Just because the evidence is prejudicial does not mean it should be excluded. I would affirm the District Court, finding that it did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to consider evidence of Martin\u2019s earnings from his consulting business.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b643 As I would affirm the District Court on Issue Three, it is necessary for me to set forth my position regarding Issue Two, concerning evidence of the heated platform. BNSF moved in limine to exclude evidence that the Whitefish platform was reconstructed after Martin\u2019s injury to include a heating element. BNSF argued two reasons for why the evidence ought to be excluded: (1) the evidence was impermissible as a subsequent remedial measure pursuant to M. R. Evid. 407, and (2) evidence of the heated platform was irrelevant because Martin had slipped off the steps and not the platform. BNSF also objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>references to another heated platform in Essex on the basis that it was irrelevant. Martin argued that Amtrak, not BNSF, installed the heated platform, and that BNSF lacked standing to seek exclusion of references to the heated platform as a subsequent remedial measure.</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">\u00b644 Prior to trial, the District Court indicated it would be granting BNSF\u2019s motion, stating that it thought the heated platform was a subsequent remedial measure. During a break in Martin\u2019s case, the District Court revisited its ruling after hearing further argument from counsel and considering testimony from several of Martin\u2019s witnesses, and issued the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">I guess it feels like we\u2019re getting far afield. I haven\u2019t heard Mr. Martin testify yet, but you know, from the first, I think it was his partner, Mr. Anderson, or the engineer, he didn\u2019t really talk about the berm being any real problem, and the slip and fall was actually from the step, so we\u2019re kind of removed from the step. We\u2019re talking about the berm; we\u2019re talking about an action after the incident in question. It, you know, occurs to me \u2014 I mean, the heated platform is after the incident in question.... [T]he bigger issue is the plowing or if you have to use hand shovels to take out \u2014 I mean, I understand if there\u2019s a big berm ... I can see the danger of that, but I\u2019m not getting any sense that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Following more discussion with counsel, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">And you can talk about that, and I think you can talk about that BNSF had an obligation to make sure the berm wasn\u2019t there or provide a reasonably safe workplace. It just seems like to me it\u2019s a big leap to get to heated platforms. That\u2019s one thing that BNSF potentially could have done, and if they had, apparently somebody is going to testify that there is no berms in that situation, but it just occurs to me that it\u2019s removed from the facts of our case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVs\">Following more argument and discussion with counsel, the court concluded that it was \u201cproper grounds for cross examination. You know, couldn\u2019t you shovel better? Couldn\u2019t you use salt? Couldn\u2019t you put in a heated platform?\u201d Martin\u2019s counsel agreed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s fair. They\u2019re sitting there saying, and I think you\u2019re [District Court] probably right to that extent, that if they\u2019re going to sit there and say we did all we could do, we\u2019ve done what\u2019s reasonable, then I have the right to cross.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b645 Martin\u2019s counsel never followed through with any cross examination regarding the topic of heated platforms. Assuming there was error created by the District Court in not allowing evidence of the heated platforms, the error is harmless where, as here, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>allowed Martin an alternate method of garnering the information. <em>Williams v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2013 MT 243, \u00b6 35, 371 Mont. 243, 308 P.3d 88. Nevertheless, the Court fails to appreciate that, while we observed in <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 93, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244, that M. R. Evid. 407 does not prohibit evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by non-parties, evidence nevertheless must still be relevant to be admissible. M. R. Evid. 402. It is clear from the District Court\u2019s discussion with the parties and its order that it did not believe the evidence was relevant and that it went \u201cfar afield.\u201d Although it appears unclear from the record the extent of BNSF\u2019s involvement with stimulus money apparently used by Amtrak to build the platform, the record is abundantly clear that the District Court determined the evidence was not relevant to the circumstances of Martin\u2019s slip from the locomotive steps. Given the standard of review to be applied and the record of the court\u2019s consideration and discussion of the issue, I cannot conclude that the District Court \u201cacted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Colstrip, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b646 As a final observation, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s declaration that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that if, in fact, Martin slipped on the ice and snow on the locomotive steps, then the ice and snow were a slipping hazard.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. This appears to contradict the remaining portion of the paragraph, wherein the Court observes all the reasons why ice and snow do not conclusively establish a slipping hazard. I agree that the District Court did not err in denying Martin\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law regarding Martin\u2019s LIA claim. The evidence clearly supported sending the issue to the jury for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b647 For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
