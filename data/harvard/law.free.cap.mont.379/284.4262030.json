We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b62 Hansen presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\u00b63 Issue One: Did the District Court err in denying Hansen\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Did the District Court properly grant summary judgment to the Bozeman Police Department?</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b65 Corey Hansen is a veteran who suffers from service-connected physical conditions, including a seizure disorder. He has a service dog that alerts him to oncoming seizures. In 2011 Hansen and a few friends planned a visit to the C\u2019Mon Inn, a hotel in Bozeman, Montana. Hansen had a reservation and had stayed at the hotel with his service dog in the past. He left copies of the certification papers for his service dog on file at the hotel. Those papers were still on file in September 2011 when Hansen arrived to check in, accompanied by his service dog wearing the appropriate identification vest.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b66 The CMon Inn staff refused to allow Hansen to register at the hotel because he was accompanied by his service dog. The hotel\u2019s reason for excluding Hansen was that dogs are not allowed on the premises. This refusal persisted after Hansen explained that he had a disability that required the presence of the service dog; that the presence of the service dog had been noted when the reservation was made; that he had stayed there in the past with his dog; and that the dog\u2019s papers were on file at the hotel. Eventually Hansen called 911 and complained that the hotel was violating his rights and discriminating against him by refusing him entry. A hotel employee also called 911 to ask that Hansen be removed from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b67 Three Bozeman Police Department officers responded. They first interviewed Hansen and his friends, and then the CMon Inn manager. The manager claimed that Hansen had become \u201cdisorderly\u201d when employees questioned him about his service dog and asked that Hansen be removed from the premises. The officers told Hansen that he would have to leave, but suggested other motels that would allow him to stay with his dog and obtained a CMon Inn business card so that Hansen could file a complaint if he wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b68 Hansen filed a complaint against the hotel with the Montana Human Rights Bureau. After an investigation and an evidentiary hearing, the hearing examiner determined that the CMon Inn had discriminated against Hansen and had violated his rights under the Montana Human Rights Act. The hearing examiner awarded Hansen $15,000 in damages against the CMon Inn.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u00b69 Hansen filed a separate Human Rights complaint against the Bozeman Police Department. The Human Rights Bureau investigated and concluded that the police did not discriminate against him. The Human Rights Commission upheld that conclusion and issued a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to sue notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hansen filed the present action against the Bozeman Police Department, contending that the responding officers themselves violated the Human Rights Act when they \u201caided, abetted and facilitated\u201d the CNIon Inn\u2019s discrimination against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b610 Hansen appeals from the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow him to amend his complaint and from the subsequent order granting summary judgment to the Bozeman Police Department. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b611 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a motion under Rule 15, M. R. Civ. P. to file an amended pleading to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Seamster v. Musselshell County Sheriffs Office, </em>2014 MT 84, \u00b6 6, 374 Mont. 358, 321 P.3d 829.</p>\n<p id=\"A6i\">\u00b612 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo, using the same criteria as the district court under Rule 56 M. R. Civ. P. <em>Passmore v. Watson, </em>2014 MT 287, \u00b6 9, 376 Mont. 529, 337 P.3d 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b613 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in denying Hansen\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00b614 Hansen filed the complaint in this action on October 18,2012, and moved for leave to file an amended complaint on June 3, 2014, proposing to include a new claim that the Bozeman Police Department negligently trained and supervised its officers. The deadlines for the close of discovery and for amendment of pleadings had been set in a stipulated scheduling order and had already passed. Hansen contended that he did not learn of the facts to support the new claim until he deposed the responding officers the last day of the discovery period. Bozeman objected to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u00b615 The District Court concluded that Hansen had unduly delayed both deposing the officers and filing the motion to amend. Further, Hansen\u2019s claims had been through two Human Rights proceedings, including investigations and a hearing. The District Court therefore concluded that Hansen\u2019s claim that he did not have information on a failure to train issue was \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d Additionally, while Hansen did not request a new pretrial scheduling order, the new claim would require additional discovery and designation of expert witnesses. The District Court determined that the motion for leave to amend was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>therefore untimely and prejudicial to Bozeman, and should he denied.</p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">\u00b616  We find that the District Court thoroughly considered the positions of the parties and the context of the case to determine that leave to amend should not be granted. Determining whether to grant leave to amend is within the discretion of a district court, which acts arbitrarily if it acts without employing conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason in view of all the circumstances. <em>Campbell v. Bozeman Investors, </em>1998 MT 204, \u00b6 34, 290 Mont. 374, 964 P.2d 41. Hansen has not demonstrated that the District Court abused its discretion, and the decision to deny leave to file the amended complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b617 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court properly grant summary judgment to the Bozeman Police Department?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b618 Hansen\u2019s complaint alleged two claims for relief: that the responding officers discriminated against him by violating \u00a7 49-2-302, MCA (part of the statutes referred to as the Montana Human Rights Act), and by violating the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act. The District Court granted summary judgment to Bozeman on both claims, concluding that neither Act required that the officers enforce Hansen\u2019s asserted rights against the C\u2019Mon Inn. The essential facts are not in dispute and therefore there is only an issue of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b619 Montana law provides that it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for a public accommodation to refuse service to a person \u201cbecause of a physical or mental disability.\u201d Section 49-2-304, MCA. As noted, the Human Rights Bureau, in a separate proceeding and after hearing, determined that the C\u2019mon Inn violated \u00a7 49-2-304, MCA, by refusing to provide a room to Hansen. Hansen contends that the Bozeman police officers were required to materially assist him at the scene in his dispute with the hotel personnel. At the hearing on summary judgment, Hansen\u2019s attorney argued that the officers responded to the situation with the wrong attitude, that they did not try to get the hotel to reconsider its position, and that they did an inadequate investigation. He did not contend that the officers should have forced the hotel to give Hansen a room. The officers, he said, were required \u201cto at least attempt to enforce his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b620 The District Court considered these arguments and the Human Rights statutes and was unable to find support for these contentions, concluding that officers responding to a 911 call are not required to force another to make a reasonable accommodation to a person with disabilities. Rather, Hansen\u2019s statutory remedy, which he utilized, was to pursue a claim under the Human Rights statutes. Montana law, \u00a7 49-2-501 to -504, MCA, provides that the duty to enforce the Human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Rights Act rests with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (Department). Persons \u201caggrieved by any discriminatory practice\u201d may file a complaint with the Department, \u00a7 49-2-501, MCA, which is the exclusive remedy to address unlawful discrimination in Montana. Section 49-2-512(1), MCA; <em>Edwards v. Cascade County Sheriff, </em>2009 MT 451, \u00b6 69, 354 Mont. 307, 223 P.3d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b621 When an aggrieved person files a complaint, the Department is required to investigate and attempt to informally settle the dispute. Section 49-2-504(1), (2), MCA. The Department must issue a finding based upon the facts of the case as to whether there is reasonable cause to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred. Section 49-2-504(7), MCA; <em>Reeves v. Dairy Queen, </em>1998 MT 13, \u00b6 28, 287 Mont. 196, 953 P.2d 703. The Department may determine that the facts either support the claim or that they do not. Section 49-2-504(7)(b), (c), MCA. If there is reasonable cause to believe that there was discrimination, the matter is referred to a contested case hearing. Section 49-2-505, MCA. The hearing officer issues a decision and either party may appeal to the Human Rights Commission. Section 49-2-505(3) to (5), MCA. The Human Rights Division hearings officer may provide appropriate relief to the aggrieved party, \u00a7 49-2-506, MCA, which may be enforced by petition to district court, \u00a7 49-2-508, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">\u00b622 The express allegation in Hansen\u2019s complaint was that Bozeman itself violated the Human Rights Act when it \u201caided and abetted\u201d the C\u2019Mon Inn\u2019s discriminatory conduct. Hansen\u2019s claim is based upon \u00a749-2-302, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">It is unlawful for a person, educational institution, financial institution, or governmental entity or agency to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of an act forbidden under this chapter or to attempt to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Montana Human Rights Act does not contain a definition of the terms \u201caid, abet, incite, compel or coerce\u201d as used in \u00a7 49-2-302, MCA. The District Court and the parties relied upon the Restatement of Torts for a definition of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">For harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">(a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">(b) knows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">(c) gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct, separately considered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 876. Assuming that this definition applies, Bozeman does not qualify as an aider or abettor of C\u2019Mon Inn\u2019s discrimination. Most obviously, the hotel had already discriminated against Hansen by refusing to register him before the officers arrived. There is nothing but speculation to support a contention that the C\u2019Mon Inn staff would have reversed its decision if only the officers had done or said something different. And, it is notable that the C\u2019Mon Inn organization continued its resistance to Hansen\u2019s claim through the investigation and the evidentiary hearing that resulted in an adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b623 There is also no material support for the contention that the responding Bozeman officers committed a discriminatory act \u201cin concert with\u201d or as part of a \u201ccommon design\u201d with the hotel, or that the officers gave \u201csubstantial assistance or encouragement\u201d to the hotel to discriminate against Hansen. While Hansen sees assistance and encouragement in the officers\u2019 ultimate request that he leave the hotel and seek a room elsewhere, there is no showing that this was anything more than their good faith effort to diffuse the impasse between Hansen and the hotel staff. Last, the officers did not discriminate against Hansen through their own separate conduct. Therefore, we find no evidence to support a contention that they aided or abetted C\u2019Mon Inn\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b624  We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Human Rights Act on its face does not make law enforcement officers responsible for remedying unlawful discrimination following the aggrieved party\u2019s call to 911. To the contrary, the law sets out clear procedures and remedies to address and correct discrimination. While \u00a7 49-2-601, MCA, makes engaging in willful discrimination a misdemeanor, nothing in that section evidences an intent to allow or require law enforcement officers to supplant the statutes providing for enforcement of protections against discrimination in Montana. Hansen is unable to concretely describe the parameters of a law enforcement officer\u2019s responsibility in a situation like the one in this case. <em>See McDonald v. DEQ, </em>2009 MT 209, 351 Mont. 243, 214 P.3d 749 (determining the parameters required for employer\u2019s accommodation of employee\u2019s service dog).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b625  Hansen sued under the Human Rights Act, and we find no basis therein to require law enforcement officers to investigate and determine the merits of discrimination disputes. Determination of whether there has been unlawful discrimination can involve intricate issues of law and proof. <em>Reeves, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-18, 21; <em>BNSF v. Feit, </em>2012 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>147, \u00b6 8, 365 Mont. 359, 281 P.3d 225. These are not the kinds of situations that are suited to resolution by officers responding to a 911 call. These are, however, the kinds of situations commonly considered and disposed of under the investigation, hearing and enforcement provisions in Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b626  We reach a similar conclusion under the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the ADA, 42 USCA \u00a7 12132, \u201cno qualified individual with a disability\u201d may be \u201cexcluded from participation or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d Like the Montana Human Rights Act, the ADA does not contain any express requirement that the officers enforce or vindicate whatever rights Hansen had against the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b627 The parties agree that Bozeman is subject to the requirements of that statute. <em>Sheehan v. San Francisco, </em>743 F.3d 1211 (9th Cir. 2014). This certainly prohibits Bozeman from itself unlawfully discriminating against citizens, but it does not also cany an obligation to enforce citizens\u2019 rights as against third parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">There\u2019s no dispute that police officers are subject to the ADA and that Mr. Hansen was qualified to participate or receive the benefit of the Bozeman Police Department services. But the Court does not find that, first of all, there are sufficient allegations either in the Complaint or as even supplemented through the briefing that he was denied the benefit of the Police Department services or that he was specifically discriminated against by the Bozeman Police Department by reason of his disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s assessment of the ADA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b628 There is no evidence that Bozeman denied any services to Hansen, aside from his contention that the officers were required to do something more than they did to assist him in his dispute with the CMon Inn. The officers responded promptly to Hansen\u2019s 911 call; they assessed the situation, interviewing Hansen first; and they tried to assist Hansen to find some other place to stay. While the officers did not do what Hansen says they should have done, they did not discriminate against Hansen because of his disability. They had no obligation to force the CMon Inn to provide him a room or to negotiate on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\u00b629  The District Court properly exercised its discretion in denying Hansen\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and properly granted summary judgment to the Bozeman Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b680 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\"> We have not located copies of these documents in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> Law enforcement agencies are subject to non-discriminatory requirements of Montana law.
