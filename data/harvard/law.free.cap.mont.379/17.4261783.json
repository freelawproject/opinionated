After months of litigation, the District Court entered judgment and sanctions against Serran\u00eda and her counsel, Terry Wallace. Serran\u00eda and Wallace appeal. We address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-24\">\n<em>1. Whether the appeal is justiciable.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\n<em>2. Whether the District Court correctly awarded LPH summary judgment on Serrania\u2019s Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in sanctioning Wallace.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b62 We affirm all aspects of the judgment properly before us, with the exception of one portion of the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b63 In 2009, Serrania went to DDG with a toothache. She signed a contract before receiving treatment. The contract states, \u201cPayment of all treatment and services rendered are my responsibility and I agree to pay collection and legal fees if any delinquent balance is placed with an agency or attorney for collection of suit.\u201d The contract also states, \u201cI understand that I am responsible for all costs and dental treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b64 In July 2011, DDG referred Serrania\u2019s account to LPH, a debt collection agency. DDG informed LPH that Serrania owed $1,112.13. The debt comprised costs for treatment rendered to Serrania, her then-husband, and her son, along with interest on unpaid amounts, and a fee for a bad check. LPH initiated steps to collect the debt. LPH mailed Serrania a letter that notified her of the debt and explained that if she did not dispute the debt within thirty days, LPH would presume the debt\u2019s validity. After thirty days passed without dispute, LPH mailed Serrania a collections placement letter with charges for additional interest and collection fees. Serrania did not immediately pay the debt, nor did she advise LPH of a dispute within thirty days. A few months later, LPH filed a complaint against her in Missoula County Justice Court, but the complaint was eventually dismissed after Serrania filed counterclaims that exceeded the Justice Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">\u00b65 In July 2012, Serrania sued LPH and DDG in the Fourth Judicial District Court, alleging that LPH violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), that DDG committed credit defamation, and that both violated the Montana Consumer Protection Act. Serrania sought to recover approximately $650,000 in damages. LPH and DDG counterclaimed for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">\u00b66 In December 2012 and January 2013, LPH and DDG jointly moved for partial summary judgment on their contract counterclaim, and LPH individually moved for partial summary judgment on Serrania\u2019s FDCPA claim. Serrania responded to the joint motion for summary judgment on the contract counterclaim, but failed to respond to LPH\u2019s motion on the FDCPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">\u00b67 On February 27, 2013, the District Court held a pretrial conference. Wallace, Serrania\u2019s attorney, failed to attend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>conference. On LPH and DBG\u2019s motion, the District Court ordered Wallace to pay $1,000 in sanctions each to counsel for LPH and DDG for the unwarned absence. The Court also entered summary judgment against Serran\u00eda on the contract and FDCPA claims. In the months that followed, Serran\u00eda moved to vacate the sanctions and moved for relief from the FDCPA summary judgment order, referring to that order as an \u201cadvisory opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b68 In May 2013, counsel for LPH and DDG informed Serran\u00eda that they would move to dismiss their unjust enrichment counterclaim, as they had pled unjust enrichment in the alternative to their breach of contract counterclaim. Serran\u00eda nonetheless filed a motion for summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim. In an e-mail to opposing counsel, Wallace explained this motion by writing that, \u201cPlaintiff wants judgments against LPH and DDG.\u201d LPH and DDG responded by moving to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim, which the District Court did. LPH also moved the court to impose sanctions, arguing that Serran\u00eda and Wallace\u2019s conduct constituted vexatious litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b69 In July 2013, DDG moved to compel Serran\u00eda to respond to discovery requests asking her to identify the name of her employer, her employment position, and the nature of her job duties. LPH joined the motion. Serran\u00eda responded by moving to quash the discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"A9G\">\u00b6 10 On December 2,2013, the District Court issued an order resolving a number of outstanding motions and issues, some of which are recounted above, but many of which are not for the sake of brevity. The court\u2019s order set a show cause hearing for December 19, 2013, for Wallace to explain why the court should not sanction Serran\u00eda and Wallace for their conduct in the course of litigation. After that hearing, on January 7,2014, the court sanctioned Serran\u00eda and Wallace in the amount of $42,113.32 to be paid to LPH, and $32,647.94 to be paid to DDG. Additionally, the court sanctioned Wallace $10,000 for \u201chis blatant lack of candor and his disrespectful conduct toward the Court and the legal process and his egregious abuses of the legal rights of the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b611 Serran\u00eda underwent bankruptcy after the District Court issued judgment. Her debts resulting from the dental bill and the District Court\u2019s orders were discharged. Nonetheless, Serran\u00eda now appeals the sanctions orders, as well as the contract and FDCPA summaiy judgment orders, and Wallace, through Serran\u00eda, appeals the sanctions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b612 Whether an appeal is justiciable is a threshold question that this Court determines before proceeding to the merits. <em>Progressive Direct Ins. Co. v. Stuivenga, </em>2012 MT 75, \u00b6 16-17, 364 Mont. 390, 276 P.3d 867. This Court reviews summary judgment orders de novo. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates an absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. This Court reviews sanctions orders for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Booth, </em>2008 MT 155, \u00b6 13, 343 Mont. 268, 184 P.3d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b613 <em>1. Whether Serrania\u2019s appeal is justiciable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b614 The judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts encompasses only live controversies. <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 17. An appeal is moot and non-justiciable when \u201can intervening event or change in circumstances\u201d renders this Court unable \u201cto grant effective relief or to restore the parties to their original position.\u201d <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b615 LPH argues that a change in circumstances has mooted Serrania\u2019s appeal. Specifically, in October 2014, a United States Bankruptcy Court discharged the District Court\u2019s judgments against Serran\u00eda. Thus, the sanctions and contract judgments no longer may be collected against Serran\u00eda. Because this Court cannot grant effective relief to Serran\u00eda with respect to appeals on those issues, those appeals are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u00b616 By contrast, it appears that the bankruptcy trustee abandoned Serrania\u2019s FDCPA claim against LPH. Serran\u00eda possesses that claim and stands to benefit if this Court were to reverse the District Court on it. Serrania\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order on her FDCPA claim is Uve, and we will examine its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b617 Finally, while Serran\u00eda no longer has an interest in the sanctions orders, Wallace does. The general rule is that only a party to a case has standing to appeal an adverse judgment in the case. <em>Marino v. Ortiz, </em>484 U.S. 301, 304, 108 S. Ct. 586, 587 (1988) (\u201cThe rule that only parties to a lawsuit ... may appeal an adverse judgment is well settled.\u201d). Courts recognize an exception to this rule, however, for a party\u2019s attorney who has been sanctioned and seeks to appeal those sanctions. <em>Nisus Corp. v. Perma-Chink Sys., Inc., </em>497 F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (\u201cAs an exception to [the] general rule, a nonparty such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>as an attorney who is held in contempt or otherwise sanctioned by the court in the course of litigation may appeal from the order imposing sanctions... <em>.\u201d); Bartels v. Sports Arena Emps. Local </em>137, 838 F.2d 101, 104 (3rd Cir. 1988) (\u201c[T]here is no doubt at all but that at some point an attorney subject to sanction may appeal.\u201d). Indeed, in <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>2001 MT 49, 304 Mont. 296, 21 P.3d 3, an attorney representing a party appealed sanctions that were entered against him, and we reviewed that appeal. <em>Bayers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Like the attorney in <em>Bayers, </em>Wallace has an interest in overturning the sanctions entered against him. Accordingly, we will review the merits of the sanctions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly awarded LPH summary judgment on the FDCPA claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b619 The FDCPA prohibits a debt collector from collecting a debt through \u201cany false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e, or through \u201cunfair or unconscionable means,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f. Further, the FDCPA imposes an affirmative duty on a debt collector to, within five days of initial communication with a consumer, inform the consumer that she has thirty days to contest the debt or else the collector will presume that the debt is valid. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). If the consumer disputes the debt within thirty days, the collector must cease collection efforts and take steps to verify the debt. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b620 The District Court granted summary judgment to LPH on Serrania\u2019s FDCPA claim because it concluded that: (1) LPH fulfilled its duty to inform Serran\u00eda that she must dispute her debt within thirty days or else LPH would presume that the debt was valid; (2) Serran\u00eda did not dispute the debt; and (3) Serrania\u2019s failure to dispute the debt within the thirty days barred her from asserting FDCPA claims that revolve around the debt\u2019s invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b621 In ruling that Serrania\u2019s failure to dispute the debt barred her claims that LPH violated the FDCPA through misrepresenting that debt, the District Court relied heavily on two United States District Court cases. <em>See Palmer v. I.C. Sys., Inc., </em>No. C-04-03237, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27946 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2005); <em>Bleich v. Revenue Maximization Group, </em>233 F. Supp. 2d 496 (E.D.N.Y. 2002). In both cases, a debt collector communicated an allegedly false debt amount to a debtor, and informed the debtor that she had a right to dispute the debt within thirty days or else it would be presumed valid. The debtor did not take advantage of that right. <em>Palmer, </em>2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27946 at *11; <em>Bleieh, </em>233 F. Supp. 2d at 500. In <em>Bleieh, </em>the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>court determined that Congress imposed a duty on debt collectors to inform a debtor of her right to dispute a debt within thirty days \u201cto avoid FDCPA litigation based solely on the debt\u2019s validity as communicated by the collection agency to the [debtor].\u201d <em>Bleich, </em>233 F. Supp. at 500. Similarly, in <em>Palmer, </em>the district court examined the FDCPA\u2019s language and concluded that \u201cwhere, as here, it is undisputed that the consumer never contacts the collector to contest the debt before the final collection attempt, plaintiff cannot assert a cause of action under the FDCPA solely based upon the debt collector\u2019s attempt to collect an invalid debt.\u201dPaimer, 2005 XJ.S. Dist. LEXIS 27946 at *15.</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">\u00b622 Some months after the District Court entered its summary judgment order, two federal circuit courts examined and rejected the theory espoused in <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Bleich. </em>In <em>McLaughlin v. Phelan Hallinan &amp; Schmieg, LLP, </em>756 F.3d 240 (3rd Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>2014 U.S. Lexis 7516 (Nov. 10, 2014), the Third Circuit held, \u201c[A] consumer is not required to seek validation of a debt he or she believes is inaccurately described in a debt communication as a prerequisite to filing suit under \u00a7 1692e.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>756 F.3d at 248. The court noted that the FDCPA\u2019s \u201ctext provides no indication that Congress intended to require debtors to dispute their debts under \u00a7 1692g before filing suit under \u00a7 1692e, and in fact, the statutory language suggests the opposite.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>756 F.3d at 247. The court further noted that holding that a debtor forfeits her FDCPA claim by failing to quickly dispute a debt undermines the FDCPA\u2019s purpose as a remedial statute, aimed at protecting \u201cunsophisticated debtors, who have no reason to suspect that they would be prevented from filing suit concerning deceptive communications as a consequence of failing to invoke the optional statutory validation procedure.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>756 F.3d at 247-48. Also, such a holding would \u201cimmunize false statements,\u201d undermining the \u201cFDCPA\u2019s goal of ensuring debt collectors act responsibly.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>756 F.3d at 248. Finally, the court noted that the debt validation procedure still serves a purpose without making it a prerequisite to suit because \u201cit can enable debtors to cheaply and quickly resolve disputes with debt collectors\u201d and \u201cfacilitate! ] the exchange of information....\u201d <em>McLaughlin, </em>756 F.3d at 248. The Fourth Circuit conducted nearly the same analysis in <em>Russell v. Absolute Collection Servs., Inc., </em>763 F.3d 385 (4th Cir. 2014), before concluding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">In sum, a pre-suit validation requirement is unfounded in the text of the statute, contrary to the remedial nature of the FDCPA, and inconsistent with the FDCPA\u2019s legislative purpose of eradicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>abusive collection practices. We therefore hold that a debtor is not required to dispute his or her debt pursuant to \u00a7 1692g as a condition to filing suit under \u00a7 1692e.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>Russell, </em>763 F.3d at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b623 Although neither party cited <em>McLaughlin </em>or <em>Russell </em>in their briefs on appeal, we are persuaded by the rulings of the Third and Fourth Circuits. While there is logic behind requiring a party to attempt to resolve a debt dispute outside of court before filing suit, the FDCPA simply does not impose that requirement. And, as the circuit courts observed, such a requirement undermines the FDCPA\u2019s purposes. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court relied on incorrect reasoning in granting summary judgment to LPH on the FDCPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ADn\">\u00b624 Nonetheless, we uphold court orders that reach the correct result. <em>State v. Reim, </em>2014 MT 108, \u00b6 26, 374 Mont. 487, 323 P.3d 880. In this case, one alternative ground that would entitle LPH to summary judgment on the FDCPA claim would be if LPH did not in fact attempt to collect a debt from Serrania through \u201cany false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e, or through any \u201cunfair or unconscionable means,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f. Serrania alleges that LPH misrepresented her debt amount. Misrepresentation of a debt violates the FDCPA\u2019s prohibition on attempting to collect \u201cany amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692R1); <em>see also </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(B) (prohibiting the false representation of \u201cany services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt.\u201d). The question becomes whether the debt that LPH represented to Serrania was \u201cauthorized by agreement... or permitted by law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b625 Serrania disputes the validity of four fypes of charges that LPH sought to collect from her: (1) charges for services rendered to Serrania\u2019s husband and son, (2) interest charges, (3) a non-sufficient funds fee for a bad check, and (4) collections costs and attorney fees for collecting Serrania\u2019s debt. Turning to Serrania\u2019s contract with LPH, we have no difficulty concluding that it authorizes LPH\u2019s attempt to recover collection costs and attorney fees. In the contract, Serrania agreed \u201cto pay collection and legal fees if any delinquent balance is placed with an agency or attorney for collection or suit.\u201d The contract, however, does not appear to authorize any of the other charges that Serrania disputes. We thus turn to whether the law permits these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u00b626 Serran\u00eda disputes the validity of billing her for treatment provided to her child and then-husband. Section 40-2-106, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">A husband or wife, solely on the basis of being a spouse, is not... liable for the debts contracted by the other spouse, except that the expenses for necessities of the family... are chargeable upon the property of both the husband and wife ... [and] the husband and wife may be sued jointly and separately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Section 40-2-210, MCA, further specifies that necessities include services that are \u201creasonably required to provide for the health... of the married person, the person\u2019s spouse, and minor children ... .\u201d These provisions make a person liable for the medical expenses of her spouse and child. <em>See Missoula YMCA v. Bard, </em>1999 MT 177, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 295 Mont. 260, 983 P.2d 933. Accordingly, these provisions permitted LPH to represent Serrania\u2019s debt as encompassing expenses related to dental services provided to her husband and child.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b627 Serran\u00eda also disputes the validity of adding interest to her debt. Section 31-l-106(l)(b), MCA, however, authorizes interest \u201con all money at a rate of 10% a year after it becomes due on ... an account stated[.]\u201d Serran\u00eda had accounts with DDG, and DDG charged interest on those accounts when they were ninety days past due, in compliance with \u00a7 31-1-106, MCA. LPH did not misrepresent Serrania\u2019s debt by including interest in the represented debt amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b628 Finally, Serran\u00eda disputes the validity of a non-sufficient funds fee that was added to her debt after she passed a bad check. But this fee is authorized by \u00a7 27-l-717(l)(a), MCA, which states, \u201cA person who issues a check... for the payment of money is liable for a service charge ... or for damages... if the check... is... dishonored for lack of funds....\u201d LPH did not misrepresent Serrania\u2019s debt by including this fee in the represented debt amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b629 There is no dispute of material fact about the debt that LPH sought to collect. The fees and charges subsumed within the debt were either authorized by Serrania\u2019s contract or permitted under the law. LPH thus is entitled to judgment on Serrania\u2019s FDCPA claim, albeit on a different ground than that on which District Court relied. We affirm the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order on the FDCPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AY8\">\u00b630 <em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in sanctioning Wallace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00b631 Wallace challenges a number of sanctions imposed against him. The first sanction derives from Wallace\u2019s failure to attend the February 2013 scheduling conference. The District Court sanctioned Wallace under M. R. Civ. P. 16(f) for his absence. That rule provides that a court \u201cmay issue any just orders... if a party or its attorney... fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>appear at a scheduling or other pretrial conference.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(1)(A). Further, \u201cinstead of or in addition to any other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or both to pay reasonable expenses \u2014 including attorney fees \u2014 incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b632 Wallace suggests that sanctioning him for missing the conference was unjust because he missed the conference due to illness. But this excuse does not explain why Wallace could not have provided notice to the court or opposing counsel that he would not be able to attend the conference before it occurred. Wallace also argues that sanctions for missing a scheduling conference are justified only if there is a showing of bad faith or prejudice, citing <em>Watson v. West, </em>2009 MT 342, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31, 353 Mont. 120, 218 P.3d 1227. To the extent that <em>Watson </em>requires a finding of prejudice, the District Court had the ability to find it \u2014 LPH and DDG were forced to prepare for a conference that they otherwise would not have had to if Wallace properly had alerted them that he could not attend. The District Court was in a better position to determine whether Wallace\u2019s unwarned absence from the conference justified imposing sanctions, and the court did not abuse its discretion by makingthat determination. <em>See McKenzie v. Sheeler, </em>285 Mont. 500, 506, 949 P.2d 1168, 1172 (1997) (\u201c[T]he trial court is in the best position to know whether the parties are disregarding the rights of opposing parties in the course of litigation and which sanctions for such conduct are most appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b633 The second sanction that Wallace contests derives from Serrania\u2019s refusal to respond to discovery requests asking her to disclose her current employer, her employment position, and the nature of her job duties. These requests are relevant to Serrania\u2019s credit defamation claim and to damages in Serrania\u2019s FDCPA claim. M. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)(a) provides that if a party \u201cfails to provide information requested in accordance with these rules,\u201d a court \u201cmay order the payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, caused by the failure.\u201d The District Court concluded that Serran\u00eda failed to provide information in accordance with M. R. Civ. P. 37 and ordered Serran\u00eda to pay expenses that were attributable to that failure. We cannot conclude that this was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">\u00b634 Wallace contests the two remaining sets of sanctions primarily on procedural grounds. In its December 2,2013 order, the District Court granted LPH\u2019s motion for M. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions, ordering Wallace to show cause why the court \u201cshould not sanction the Plaintiff\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\"award the Defendants the fall amount of the balance owed under the contract, and the Defendant\u2019s debt collection fees, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d At the show cause hearing, Wallace pointed out that M. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2) requires that a motion for sanctions \"be made separately from any other motion,\u201d and that LPH violated that requirement by moving for sanctions under M. R. Civ. P. 11, \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k, all in the same motion. The District Court responded by restyling its show cause hearing on sanctions as initiated <em>sua sponte </em>rather than on LPH\u2019s motion. After the show cause hearing, the District Court ordered Serran\u00eda and Wallace jointly to pay $24,797.24 to DDG and $41,113.32 to LPH as sanctions under M. R. Civ. P. 11(c). The District Court also ordered Wallace individually to pay $10,000 to the Missoula County Clerk of Court\u2019s Office for Ins \"blatant lack of candor and his disrespectful conduct toward the Court and the legal process and his egregious abuses of the legal rights of the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b635 On appeal, Wallace restates his argument about the District Court not complying with the process for imposing M. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions. These arguments have merit. But M. R. Civ. P. 61 directs, \u201cAt every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d On appeal, Wallace simply has not explained how the procedural problems with the M. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions affected his substantial rights. Wallace was on notice that he might receive sanctions for his conduct, and he knew that when he attended the show cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b636 Review of the record also reveals that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by sanctioning Wallace $10,000 for his \"blatant lack of candor and his disrespectful conduct toward the Court and the legal process and his egregious abuses of the legal rights of the Defendants.\u201d The District Court found that Wallace was \u201cprimarily responsible for causing this case to unreasonably grow beyond the legal issues and damages pled in Plaintiffs Complaint and the Defendant\u2019s respective Answers and Counterclaims, and for ignoring and denying the legal effects of this Court\u2019s ruling in its March 14,2013 [summary judgment order].\u201d The District Court was in the best position to make these findings, and the findings justify the sanction. <em>See McKenzie, </em>285 Mont, at 506, 949 P.2d at 1172. Wallace has not demonstrated clear error in the court\u2019s findings in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b637  On the basis of the current record, however, we cannot affirm the District Court\u2019s order for Serran\u00eda and Wallace jointly to pay $24,797.24 to DDG and $41,113.32 to LPH. The District Court based these sanctions in part on the \"filing of this frivolous law suit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>first place.\u201d But, given this Court\u2019s implicit conclusion earlier in this opinion that Serrania\u2019s FDCPA claim had some grounding in the law \u2014 albeit not enough to withstand summary judgment \u2014 this suit does not appear entirely frivolous. We cannot conclude that the District Court appropriately ordered Serran\u00eda and Wallace jointly to pay $24,797.24 to DDG and $41,113.32 to LPH based on the stated findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b638 We affirm all the appealed orders, with the exception of the District Court\u2019s order that Serran\u00eda and Wallace jointly pay $24,797.24 to DDG and $41,113.32 to LPH. That sanctions order is vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
