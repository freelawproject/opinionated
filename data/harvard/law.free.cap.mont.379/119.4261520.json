On appeal, we address whether the District Court erred in reversing the Commission\u2019s determination that Whitehall had not established a legally enforceable obligation to deliver energy to Northwestern. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b62 In 1978, Congress enacted Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PUKPA) to encourage cogeneration and small power production. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7824a-3(a).PXJRPArequires large electric utilities to purchase available energy from \u201cqualifying cogeneration facilities and qualifying small power facilities.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(a). Under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulations, a \u201cqualifying facility\u201d may provide energy, capacity, or both to a utility pursuant to a contract or a \u201clegally enforceable obligation.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304(d). In 1981, the Montana Legislature enacted \u00a7\u00a7 69-3-601 through -604, MCA, to facilitate the Commission\u2019s implementation of PXJRPA. Section 69-3-603, MCA, requires the Commission to set rates and conditions \u201cif a qualifying small power production facility and a utility are unable to mutually agree to a contract for the sale of electricity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b63 Whitehall is a qualifying facility. Northwestern is a public utility operating in Montana and subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. In the summer of2002, Whitehall contacted Northwestern and attempted to negotiate a contract to sell energy from a proposed fifty-megawatt wind-generating facility near Whitehall, Montana. In August 2002, after Whitehall and Northwestern were unable to reach an agreement, Whitehall petitioned the Commission to set a long-term avoided cost rate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for electricity that Whitehall proposed to generate and sell to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Northwestern. On January 2, 2003, after the parties conducted discovery and the Commission held a public hearing, the Commission issued an order setting a short-term rate of $0.010639 per kilowatt hour. On January 31, Whitehall petitioned the District Court for judicial review of that order, seeking an order for the Commission to set a long-term contract rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">\u00b64 On December 22, 2008, the District Court issued an order reversing and remanding the Commission\u2019s decision. The court held that the Commission\u2019s rate unreasonably relied on stale data and directed the Commission to determine whether Whitehall had established a legally enforceable obligation. The Commission and Northwestern appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to this Court, and we affirmed. <em>Whitehall Wind, LLC v. Mont. PSC, </em>2010 MT 2, 355 Mont. 15, 223 P.3d 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b65 On June 4, 2010, the Commission issued an Order on Remand, concluding that Whitehall had not incurred a legally enforceable obligation. The Commission determined that \u201cthe touchstone of a legally enforceable obligation ... is an absolute, unconditional commitment to deliver energy, capacity, or energy and capacity.\u201d Examining the totality of the circumstances, the Commission found that Whitehall failed to demonstrate an unconditional commitment. The Commission further concluded that Whitehall\u2019s attempted negotiations with Northwestern merely constituted an effort to seek information to ascertain the viability of its proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b66 Whitehall petitioned for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order. On May 21, 2014, the District Court issued an order reversing and remanding the Commission\u2019s decision. The court determined that NorthWestem\u2019s refusal to negotiate created a legally enforceable obligation entitling Whitehall to a long-term avoided cost rate. The Commission and Northwestern appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b67 Section 2-4-704, MCA, governs the District Court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s decision. \u201cThe court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency\u201d in weighing factual evidence. Section 2-4-704(2), MCA. The court may reverse or modify an agency\u2019s decision if \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of the appellant have been prejudiced because, among other factors, the agency\u2019s decision exceeds its statutory authority, is affected by legal error, or is clearly erroneous in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the record. Sections 2-4-704(2)(a)(ii), (iv), and (v), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b68 We apply the same standards of review that a district court applies, <em>Molnar v. Fox, </em>2013 MT 132, \u00b6 17, 370 Mont. 238, 301 P.3d 824, \u201cand must accordingly determine whether an agency\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law were correct,\u201d <em>Mont. Solid Waste Contrs. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Serv. Regulation, </em>2007 MT 154, \u00b6 17, 338 Mont. 1, 161 P.3d 837. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record, if the fact-finder misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves the court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>2012 MT 32, \u00b6 25, 364 Mont. 128, 272 P.3d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b69 Congress required FERC to prescribe \u201csuch rules as it determines necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production\u201d within one year of PURPA\u2019s enactment, and to revise those rules periodically. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(a). Section 210 of PURPA requires electric utilities to purchase electric energy from qualifying facilities. 16U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(a). FERC interpreted this requirement to mean that a utility must purchase <em>\u201cany </em>energy and capacity which is made available,\u201d either directly or indirectly, from a qualifying facility. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303(a) (emphasis added). FERC regulations provide that a qualifying facility has the option to sell energy as available or pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304(d). If a qualifying facility sells its energy pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation, it may choose a rate based on the avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery or the avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b610 Though PURPA is a federal law, \u201c[i]t is up to the States, not [FERC], to determine the specific parameters of individual [qualifying facility] power purchase agreements, including the date at which a legally enforceable obligation is incurred under State law.\u201d <em>Metro. Edison Co., </em>72 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61, 015, \u00b6 61, 050 (1995). In its June 2010 order on remand, the Commission noted, \u201cDetermining the date at which [a legally enforceable obligation] is incurred requires determining what establishes [a legally enforceable obligation] under state law. This is a matter of first impression for the Commission.\u201d The Commission thoroughly considered each party\u2019s arguments, the language ofthe statutes, and relevant case law from other jurisdictions to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>[TJhe touchstone of a legally enforceable obligation ... is an absolute, unconditional commitment to deliver energy, capacity, or energy and capacity at a future date. Any commitment that is conditional fails to establish [a legally enforceable obligation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3D\">Reviewing the record under this standard, the Commission determined that Whitehall had not incurred a legally enforceable obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b611 The Commission found support for its conclusion from other jurisdictions, many of which have determined that a qualifying facility establishes a legally enforceable obligation when it cannot abandon a project without incurring a liability- <em>See Rosebud Enters, v. Idaho Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>951 P.2d 521, 526 (Idaho 1997) (upholding a public utilities commission\u2019s determination that a qualifying facility did not establish a legally enforceable obligation by merely seeking information in order to assess the viability of a project); <em>A. W. Brown Co. </em>v. <em>Idaho Power Co., </em>828 P.2d 841, 843 (Idaho 1992) (citing a public utilities commission\u2019s determination that a legally enforceable obligation occurred once \u201cthe project was substantially mature to the extent that the developer was ready, willing, and able to sign a contract\u201d and had \u201cactively negotiated for a contract which, but for the reluctance of the utility, would have been executed\u201d); <em>Appeal of Pub. Serv. Co., </em>539A.2d 275, 280-81 (N.H. 1988) (upholding a public utilities commission\u2019s determination that a legally enforceable obligation was created by a timely and eligible rate petition, demonstrating that most developmental problems had been resolved and that the project was viable, accompanied by an interconnection agreement signed by a qualifying facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b612 Relying on this precedent and statutory language, the Commission rejected Whitehall\u2019s argument that Whitehall incurred a legally enforceable obligation based on \u201cits offer of a detailed long-term contract to [Northwestern] in October 2002, its good faith attempt to negotiate that contract with [Northwestern], and its ultimate petition to the Commission and the Commission\u2019s resultant decision.\u201d In rejecting Whitehall\u2019s argument, the Commission determined that cases on which Whitehall relied did not actually support its position. <em>See A.W. Brown, </em>828 P.2d at 846-47 (upholding a commission\u2019s determination that \u201ca qualifying facility is entitled to receive avoided cost rates if it obligates itself to the delivery of energy or capacity and if that obligation is legally enforceable,\u201d and that \u201cpreliminary, tentative, or general\u201d discussions between a facility and a utility did not establish a legally enforceable obligation); <em>Armco Advanced Materials Corp. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>579 A.2d 1337, 1347 (Pa. Commw. 1990) (determining that a qualifying facility incurs a legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>enforceable obligation when it \u201chas done everything within its power to create such an obligation, either by tendering a contract to the utility or by petitioning the [public utilities commission] to approve a contract or to compel a purchase,\u201d so that \u201conly an act of acceptance by the utility or an act of approval by the [commission] remains to establish the existence of a \u2018contract.\u2019 \u201d). The Commission determined that the courts in these jurisdictions required a qualifying facility to make a binding commitment before finding that the facility had incurred a legally enforceable obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b613 In its order, the Commission also announced a prospective bright-line rule: A facility seeking to establish a legally enforceable obligation must \u201ctender an executed power purchase agreement to the utility with a price term consistent with the utility\u2019s avoided costs, with specified beginning and ending dates, and with sufficient guarantees to ensure performance during the term of the contract, and an executed interconnection agreement.\u201d The Commission explicitly declined to apply this bright-line rule retroactively. Instead, for its review of Whitehall\u2019s petition, the Commission examined the \u201ctotality of the circumstances to determine if the [qualifying facility] has made an unconditional commitment to deliver energy, capacity!,] or energy and capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b614 Several factual findings led the Commission to conclude that Whitehall had not incurred a legally enforceable obligation. The Commission relied on testimony by Whitehall employees indicating that Whitehall intended to use the rate set by the Commission to determine whether Whitehall feasibly could proceed with the project. The Commission found that, of the two contracts that Whitehall submitted to Northwestern, one was unsigned and one was meant to stimulate negotiations rather than to present a firm commitment. Moreover, although Whitehall performed a wind analysis of the proposed site, it had not conducted avian studies or obtained any actual site control. Ultimately, the Commission concluded, \u201cTaken as a whole, the record establishes that [Whitehall] was merely seeking information from which it could make a decision whether or not to proceed. This falls short of establishing [a legally enforceable obligation].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b615 The District Court reversed the Commission\u2019s decision, determining that the Commission \u201cignored the facts and exceeded its statutory authority,\u201d and that its decision was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d The court determined that \u201c[s]imply refusing to negotiate\u201d can create a legally enforceable obligation. In reaching this determination, the court relied on FERC\u2019s declaratory orders in <em>Hydrodynamics, Inc., </em>146 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61, 193 (2014) (concluding that Montana\u2019s requirement that qualifying facilities must participate in competitive solicitation to obtain long-term rates for contracts with utilities violated PURPA); <em>Grouse Creek Wind Park, LLC, </em>142 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61, 187 (2013) (concluding that an Idaho Public Utilities Commission rule and order were inconsistent with PURPA where, as a prerequisite to obtaining a legally enforceable obligation, the rule required a qualifying facility and a utility to sign a purchase and sale agreement or, alternatively, the order required a qualifying facility to complain \u201cmeritoriously\u201d to the commission); <em>Cedar Creek Wind, LLC, </em>137 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61, 006 (2011) (addressing similar issues as <em>Grouse Creek </em>and reaching the same conclusion); and <em>JD Wind 1, LLC, </em>129 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61, 148 (2009) (concluding that a Texas law specifying that legally enforceable obligations were available only to sellers of \u201cfirm power\u201d was inconsistent with PURPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b616 Each of the FERC orders on which the District Court relied addresses issues different from the issue in this case. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In contrast to <em>Hydrodynamics, </em>this case concerns the standard for establishing a legally enforceable obligation when there is no contract, and it does not involve a competitive solicitation requirement. In contrast to <em>Grouse Creek </em>and <em>Cedar Creek, </em>the Commission in this case did not require a signed contract or a formal commission ruling for Whitehall to receive long-term avoided-cost rates. Unlike <em>JD Wind, </em>the Commission did not reject Whitehall\u2019s petition on the ground that it would offer power from intermittent resources rather than firm power. Moreover, in <em>JD Wind, </em>the facility clearly had made a binding commitment because it already was delivering wind energy to the utility when the facility sued to enforce the legally enforceable obligation. <em>JD Wind, </em>\u00b6 61,633. By contrast, Whitehall has not begun to build the infrastructure it would need to deliver energy to Northwestern and has not even acquired property rights to the proposed site.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b617  The Commission did not exceed its statutory authority in concluding that evidence of a utility\u2019s refusal to negotiate, without more, is insufficient to establish that a qualifying facility has committed itself to the proposed project. This conclusion is not affected by an error of law \u2014 it is supported by statutory language and by judicial decisions in other jurisdictions. Further, the Commission\u2019s ruling in this case was fact-specific. There is substantial evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Whitehall had not committed itself to the project or established any obligation that could expose it to liability if Whitehall abandoned the proposed project. Although Whitehall conducted some wind tests in the area of the proposed project, it did not conduct avian studies, obtain required permits, or have actual site control over any of the proposed project areas. In essence, Whitehall sought to have the Commission establish a long-term avoided cost rate in order to determine the financial viability of the project before it incurred an obligation to proceed. But, under applicable FERC regulations, the long-term rate is tied to the date a legally enforceable obligation is incurred. Evidence in the record supports the Commission\u2019s determination that Whitehall, while pursuing information, had not obligated itself to Northwestern and therefore had not established a legally enforceable obligation to deliver energy or capacity. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. Whitehall has failed to demonstrate that its substantial rights were prejudiced for any of the reasons listed in \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b618 Because it is not implicated in this appeal, we decline to opine whether the Commission\u2019s bright-line prospective test, announced in its order, complies with PURPA. Additionally, because we reverse the District Court\u2019s decision, we need not address the appellants\u2019 argument that the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Hydrodynamics, </em>without allowing the appellants to rebut Whitehall\u2019s characterization of that case, violated their procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b619 We reverse the District Court\u2019s decision and order and remand for reinstatement of the Commission\u2019s June 4,2010 order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\"> The Commission defines \u201cavoided costs\u201d as \u201cthe incremental costs as determined by the commission to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity or both which, but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or qualifying facilities, such utility would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>generate itself or purchase from another source.\u201d Admin.
