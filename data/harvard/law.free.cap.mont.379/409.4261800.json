Stoltze Land &amp; Lumber Company and Maxum Specialty Insurance Group (collectively, \u201cStoltze\u201d) filed a complaint against American States Insurance Company (ASI), seeking an order that ASI must defend and indemnify Stoltze against a lawsuit brought by Whitney and Anna Shanks (collectively, \u201cShanks\u201d). The Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, entered summary judgment in ASI\u2019s favor. Stoltze and Shanks appeal. The issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly determined that ASI\u2019s insurance policy with Les Schlegel Enterprises (\u201cSchlegel\u201d) does not require ASI to defend and indemnify Stoltze in an action in which Schlegel could not be held liable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">\u00b62 In 2003, Schlegel and Stoltze contracted for Schlegel to log <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Stoltze\u2019s property. The logging contract contains a provision in which Schlegel agreed to procure liability insurance indemnifying Stoltze from liability for any loss or injury arising from the logging operations. Schlegel also agreed that indemnification \u201cshall not be limited ... by immunity of suit of [Schlegel], [Schlegel] having waived such immunity as a defense against [Stoltze].\u201d Schlegel in turn obtained liability insurance from ASI. The insurance policy (Policy) ran between January 20, 2004, and January 20, 2005. It lists Schlegel as the only named insured. The liability plus endorsement section of the Policy extends coverage to \u201cany person or organization ... for whom [Schlegel is] required by written contract, agreement or permit to provide insurance\u201d to the extent that Schlegel is held liable due to its \u201congoing operations for that Insured, whether the work is performed by [Schlegel] or for [Schlegel].\u201d Another clause modifies this extension of coverage, stating, \u201cNo Coverage will be provided if, in the absence of this endorsement, no liability would be imposed by law on [Schlegel]. Coverage shall be limited to the extent of [Schlegel\u2019s] negligence or fault according to the applicable principles of comparative fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b63 Shanks, a worker for Schlegel, injured himself during logging operations on Stoltze\u2019s property in February 2004. Although Schlegel covered Shanks for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Shanks filed a personal iqjury lawsuit against both Schlegel and Stoltze. Stoltze tendered defense and indemnity of Shanks\u2019s suit to ASI. ASI accepted the tender, stating that it was affording a defense to Stoltze under the Policy with Schlegel, but reserved the right to withdraw the defense if it determined that Stoltze was not covered under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b64 In 2010, Schlegel moved to dismiss the case against it, arguing that the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s exclusive remedy provision, \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, rendered it immune to Shanks\u2019s suit. The district court in that case granted Schlegel\u2019s motion. After Schlegel\u2019s dismissal, ASI withdrew its defense of Stoltze, stating in a letter to Stoltze that the Policy covered Stoltze only to the extent that Schlegel was hable, and that the court determined in its dismissal order that Schlegel was not hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b65 In November 2012, Stoltze filed a complaint against ASI, seeking declaratory judgment that ASI is required to defend and indemnify Stoltze against Shanks\u2019s suit. In 2013, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and, in 2014, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of ASI. The District Court determined that, under the terms of the Pohcy, ASI covers Stoltze to the extent that Schlegel is hable in the underlying action. Because the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the underlying action concluded that Schlegel was immune and not liable, the District Com\u00ed; further concluded that ASI has no duty to defend or indemnify Stoltze. Stoltze and Shanks appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b66 We review an entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. We review the interpretation of an insurance policy for correctness. <em>Plum. Creek Mktg., Inc. v. Am. Econ. Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 264, \u00b6 31, 352 Mont. 56, 214 P.3d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b67 An insurer\u2019s duty to defend or indemnify a party depends on whether an insurance policy establishes such a duty. <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 40, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469. In arguing that ASI has such a duty, the only insurance policy Stoltze and Shanks identify is the policy between Schlegel and ASI. Like any other contract, we construe an insurance policy in an effort to give effect to the mutual intent of the contracting parties as reflected in the contract\u2019s terms. Sections 28-3-301, -401, MCA. \u201cAn insurer must defend unless there is an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against the insured does not fall under the policy\u2019s <em>coverage.\u201d Famers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rumph, </em>2007 MT 249, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 251, 170 P.3d 934; <em>see Scentry Biologicals Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>2014 MT 39, \u00b6 44, 374 Mont. 18, 319 P.3d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b68 Stoltze acknowledges that it is not a named insured in the Policy but argues that, because the logging contract is an insured contract, the liability plus endorsement section of the Policy extends coverage to Stoltze. As mentioned, however, the liability plus endorsement section includes a limiting clause, stating, \u201cNo Coverage will be provided if, in the absence of this endorsement, no liability would be imposed by law on [Schlegel]. Coverage shall be limited to the extent of [Schlegel\u2019s] negligence or fault according to the applicable principles of comparative fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u00b69 In <em>Plum Creek, </em>we examined identical limiting clause language in a liability plus endorsement section of a polity. As in this case, in <em>Plum Creek, </em>two parties (Plum Creek and Garage Doors) entered a contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>with one party (Garage Doors) agreeing to indemnify the other (Plum Creek). <em>Plum Creek, </em>\u00b6 2. Garage Doors obtained liability insurance that included a liability plus endorsement section and a clause stating, as here, \u201cNo coverage will be provided if, in the absence of this endorsement, no liability would be imposed by law on you. Coverage shall be limited to the extent of your negligence or fault according to the applicable principles of comparative fault.\u201d When a Garage Doors employee was injured on the job, he sued Plum Creek. <em>Plum Creek, </em>\u00b6 6. Garage Doors\u2019s insurer, however, refused to defend Plum Creek, pointing to the limiting clause in the liability plus endorsement section. <em>Plum Creek, </em>\u00b6 8. Pinning our analysis to the terms of the limiting clause, we concluded that Garage Doors \u201ccould not be held liable in this case\u201d because the employee\u2019s \u201ccomplaint alleged negligence <em>against Plum Creek, </em>not Garage Doors.\u201d Therefore, it was \u201cunequivocally clear that [the insurer] was not required to defend or indemnify Plum Creek.\u201d <em>Plum Creek, </em>\u00b6 32 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b610 ASI argues that Schlegel is like Garage Doors in <em>Plum Creek, </em>in that Schlegel cannot be held liable in the underlying personal injury case. As noted, a district court determined that Schlegel is immune and dismissed it from the underlying action. The Policy extends coverage to additional insured parties that enter into contracts with Schlegel and incur liability due to Schlegel\u2019s negligence, but only if Schlegel also is subject to liability. The Policy states, \u201cNo coverage will be provided\u201d to a third party if \u201cno liability would be imposed by law\u201d on Schlegel. The limiting language in the Policy shows that determining whether the Policy covers an additional insured turns not on why, but on whether, the named insured would be liable in the absence of the endorsement. If no liability can be imposed by law on Schlegel, then no coverage is provided to Stoltze.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b611 Stoltze argues that the second sentence in the limiting clause \u2014 \u201cCoverage shall be limited to the extent of your negligence or fault according to the applicable principles of comparative fault\u201d \u2014 renders the limiting clause ambiguous about whether coverage depends on liability or on negligence and fault, and that the clause therefore should be interpreted against ASI. <em>See Leibrand v. Nat\u2019l Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., 272 </em>Mont. 1, 6, 898 P.2d 1220, 1223 (1995) (\u201cAmbiguities in an insurance policy are construed against the insurer and exclusions or words of limitation in a policy must be strictly construed against the insurer.\u201d). Stoltze argues that the only way to reconcile the two sentences in the clause is to conclude that the second sentence applies to employees of Schlegel. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>plain language of the Policy does not require that construction. The first sentence of the clause states that ASI will not cover an additional insured in situations in which the named insured cannot be held liable. The second sentence states that, in situations in which the named insured can be held liable, ASl\u2019s coverage of an additional insured is limited to the extent of the named insured\u2019s proportional negligence or fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b612 Stoltze cites two cases in which the United States District Court for the District of Oregon concluded that the same limiting language was ambiguous, <em>see Clarendon Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>688 F. Supp. 2d 1186, <em>1191 (2010); Richardson v. Howard S. Wright Constr. Co., </em>No. CV-05-1419-ST, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37011, at *23-25, but we are not persuaded by the analysis of the policy language in these cases. We follow our reasoning in <em>Plum Creek </em>that the \u201cterms of the Policy and [endorsement taken together are clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Plum Creek, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b613 Stoltze next argues that, even if the Policy states that ASI covers third parties only if Schlegel is liable, ASI must cover Stoltze in this case because Schlegel is liable. Stoltze argues that Schlegel is liable because, in the contract between the two, Schlegel agreed that its indemnification of Stoltze \u201cshall not be limited... by immunity of suit of [Schlegel], [Schlegel] having waived such immunity as a defense against [Stoltze].\u201d An insurer\u2019s duty to defend or indemnify, however, depends on the four comers of the invoked insurance policy \u2014 not on an agreement between an insured and a third party. <em>Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>Plum Creek, </em>\u00b6 31. Further, Schlegel was dismissed from the underlying case on the basis of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. To the extent that Stoltze now argues that Schlegel could be held liable in the underlying suit on the basis of the logging contract, the order dismissing the case against Schlegel is not before the Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ARK\">\u00b614  Shanks argues that Schlegel remains liable because one of the remaining claims against Stoltze concerns whether Stoltze delegated an inherently dangerous and non-delegable operation to Schlegel and thus is vicariously liable for Schlegel\u2019s negligence. But Schlegel cannot be held liable under this claim \u2014 Schlegel has been dismissed from the underlying action due to immunity. Stoltze\u2019s liability for Schlegel\u2019s actions is not the same as Schlegel\u2019s liability, which is what the Policy requires for coverage to extend to Stoltze in this case. Stoltze\u2019s liability for its own acts or omissions also is not within the scope of Schlegel\u2019s policy with ASI.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b615  Shanks further argues the question whether \u00a7 39-71-411, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>MCA, precludes Stoltze from being covered as an additional insured. But, given our determination that Stoltze is not an additional insured under the terms of the Policy, we do not reach this argument. We conclude that, under the plain terms of the Policy, Stoltze is not covered by ASI unless Schlegel is liable. Schlegel is not hable. Therefore, Stoltze is not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b616 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON,SHEAand RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
