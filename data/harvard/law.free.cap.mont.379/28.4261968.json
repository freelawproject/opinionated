In June 2013, the Department moved for summaiy judgment. The District Court granted the Department summaiy judgment and the Petitioners appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on review is whether the District Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">\u00b63 In 2009, the Department began the process of reappraising Montana agricultural properties. All residential, agricultural, and timber properties are reappraised every six years. Section 15-7-111, MCA; <em>Covenant Investments, Inc. v. State, </em>2013 MT 215, \u00b6 4,371 Mont. 186, 308 P.3d 54. Prior to the 2009 reappraisal, the Department relied on self-reporting by property owners. In2005, the Legislature provided funding for a systematic reappraisal of agricultural lands by the Department. In the words of Dallas Reese, Department Management Analyst for the Property Assessment Division, \u201c[t]his reappraisal process for agricultural property was the most comprehensive and detailed in almost 45 years.\u201d Aff. Dallas Reese \u00b6 7 (April 26,2010). The Department utilized a number of methods for assessing the land including a geographical information system (GIS), soil surveys from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the United States Department of Agricultural Natural Resource Conservation Service (USDA NRCS), a global position system (GPS), an in-depth review of soil types, and aerial photographs. The Department also surveyed landowners, however the response was limited, gamering only about a 10% return rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b64 The Department uses a multi-step process for determining the taxable value for the land. First, the Department identifies the land use and categorizes it according to five classifications: grazing land, non-irrigated summer fallow farm land, tillable irrigated farm land, non-irrigated continuously cropped hay land, or non-irrigated continuously cropped farm land. Second, the Department determines the productivity yield using the USDA NRCS soil surveys and calculates production information for each acre of land by classification. Adjustments are made to reflect income that the average Montana farm or ranch could have attained on the land as required by \u00a7 15-7-201(7)(e), MCA. Third, the productivity amount is multiplied by an averaged commodity price determined by Montana agricultural statistical data, to arrive at the gross income per acre. Fourth, the Department calculates a net income per acre according to specific Department administrative rules based on the different classification categories. Finally, the net income per acre is divided by the capitalization rate established in \u00a7 15-7-201(4)(c), MCA, and the assessed values are totaled and multiplied by the current taxable percentage to arrive at the taxable value for the parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b65 During a six-year cycle, any increases in value from the previous cycle must be accounted for. The Montana Legislature, in an effort to alleviate the tax sting due to fluctuations in value, provided for the phase-in of increases in value from previous cycles. Two values are needed to determine phase-in amounts: the current full market value and the value before reappraisal (\u201cVBR\u201d). The full market value of a property is determined at the beginning of the cycle. The VBR, as defined in Admin. R. M. 42.20.501(25) (2006):<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">the 2002 tax year value adjusted for any new construction or destruction that occurred in the prior year. The VBR for the 2003 tax year and subsequent years is the same as the 2002 tax year value if there is no new construction, destruction, land splits, land use changes, land reclassifications, land productivity changes, improvement grade changes, or other changes made to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>property during 2002 or subsequent tax years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-3\">The 2002 tax year value refers to the fully phased-in value from the previous cycle. The phase-in amount is the difference between the full market value at the beginning of the six-year cycle and the frill market value from the prior six-year cycle. This amount is phased-in at a rate of 16.66% each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b66 The Department initially calculated the VBR based on the 2009 updated classification for all agricultural properties. Subsequently, the Department realized that Admin. R. M. 42.20.502 required it to use the unadjusted 2002 base year value, rather than the newly calculated VBR, for properties that increased in value based on a change in productivity. In 2010, the Department adopted a new rule, Admin. R. M. 42.20.607 (2010), to clarify and distinguish between properties experiencing change due to market fluctuations and those changing due to the actions of the owner. If the increase was due to market changes (i.e., changes in the price of a commodity), the Department used the unadjusted 2002 base year value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the increase was due to non-market changes, such as land reclassification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Department calculated a new VBR. The new VBR accounted for the increase in value attributable to the non-market change.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b67 In 2009, the Department reappraised the Lucas Ranch.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Department concluded that the Lucas Ranch had non-market changes due to reclassification of land and thus required a newly calculated VBR. In February 2010, the Petitioners filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Writ of Mandate, seeking a declaration that the Department improperly assessed their agricultural property for tax purposes and failed to properly phase-in the increases in value from the previous cycle resulting in erroneous taxable values for the Lucas Ranch and all similarly situated landowners. The Department answered, arguing that it properly applied the statute and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Petitioners were not entitled to the 16.66% phase-in due to the reclassification of their land. In April 2010, Petitioners moved for class certification and the District Court denied their motion. The Petitioners appealed to this Court, which reversed and remanded the matter for class certification pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 23, as permitted by \u00a7 15-l-407(2Xa), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b68 After the case returned to the District Court, the Department moved to dismiss Charles B. Lucas, who was deceased, as well as the Montana Farm Bureau Federation and the Montana Taxpayers Association for failure to represent the class. The Petitioners stipulated to the dismissal of Charles B. Lucas, but objected to the dismissal of the Farm Bureau Federation and the Montana Taxpayers Association. In June 2013, the Department filed for partial summary judgment on the Petitioners\u2019 writ of mandate, and later filed a motion for summary judgment. Petitioners then filed a cross motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u00b69 On June 2, 2014, the District Court granted the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court declared the remaining motions moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b610 We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same analysis as the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (citations omitted). \u201cWhere there is a cross-motion for summary judgment, we review a district court\u2019s decision to determine whether its conclusions were correct.\u201d <em>Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, \u00b6 8, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b611 Summary judgment is proper when the record shows no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 37; M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the initial burden of \u201cestablishing a complete absence of genuine issues of material fact.\u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 37 (citations omitted). When determining whether genuine issues of material fact remain, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 38 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b612 If the moving party satisfies its burden, the non-moving party must \u201cset forth specific facts, not merely denials, speculations, or conclusory statements, in order to establish that a genuine issue of material facts does indeed exist.\u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 39 (citations omitted); M. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Ultimately, if no issue of material fact exists, the Court must decide whether the facts entitle the moving party to judgment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>a matter of law. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 39; M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b613 <em>Issue: Whether the District Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\"><em>A. </em>Plain Language of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b614 Petitioners contend on appeal that the District Court adopted an interpretation of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, that ignores the plain language of the statute. Petitioners argue that the statute requires the Department to phase-in the change in value by equal amounts over the six-year cycle as detailed in subsection (3) of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. Petitioners assert that \u201creclassification\u201d in the context of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, refers to changes among classes (i.e. Class 3 to Class 4), not changes within agricultural use (i.e., fallow to irrigated). They argue that even if the Legislature intended to include changes to agricultural use within subsection (2), the Department did not adopt rules to assess the valuation and phase-in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b615 This Court interprets a statute first by looking to its plain language. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 41; <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003; <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, 152 P.3d 1288. If the statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 41 (citations omitted). We presume that the Legislature does not pass meaningless or useless legislation. <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 15. Moreover, \u201c[statutory construction should not lead to absurd results if a reasonable interpretation can avoid <em>it.\u201d Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b616 As discussed above, Montana law provides that the Department \u201cshall administer and supervise a program for the revaluation of all taxable property within class three under 15-6-133, class four under 15-6-134, and class ten under 15-6-143.\u201d Section 15-7-111, MCA. Th\u00e9 Department reappraises agricultural property on a six-year cyclical basis. Section 15-7-111, MCA; <em>Covenant Investments, </em>\u00b6 4. Subsections (2) and (3) of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, contemplate two different tax scenarios depending on the changes to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b617 Under subsection (2), when a properly is \u201cnewly constructed, remodeled, or reclassified,\u201d the Department is tasked with valuing and phasing-in the property \u201cin a manner consistent with the valuation within the same class and the values established pursuant to subsection (1).\u201d Section 15-7-111(2), MCA. A landowner\u2019s decision to change from grazing to tillable land isa reclassification and falls under subsection (2) of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. Admin. R. M. 42.20.501(13) (2006). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>When a property\u2019s value increases due to non-market changes such as a reclassification, the Department must assess the new value and calculate a new VBR. Section 15-7-111(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b618 The plain language clearly states that this rule also applies when land is \u201creclassified within the same class.\u201d Section 15-7-111(2), MCA. Petitioners argue that subsection (2) covers only property changing from one class to another class (i.e., Class 3 to Class 4), not changes within a class. Reference to the regulation\u2019s definitions shows that \u201cland reclassification\u201d refers to changes from one agricultural use to another (e.g., grazing land converted to irrigated land), retaining its agricultural purposes. Admin. R. M. 42.20.501(13) (2006). Reclassification differs from \u201cland use change,\u201d wherein the land no longer retains its agricultural purpose and involves conversion from agricultural land to forestlandfor example. Admin. R. M. 42.20.501(15) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b619 Under subsection (3), when the increase in value is due to a market change beyond the taxpayer\u2019s control, the Department uses the valuation from the 2002 base year, phased in at the rate of 16.66% of the change in valuation. Section 15-7-111(3), MCA; Admin. R. M. 42.20.501(25) (2006). The clear language of this section provides that the amount attributable to market changes (i.e., not the result of actions taken by the taxpayer) is gradually phased in over the six-year cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b620 The District Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. Here, the Petitioners experienced a reclassification of land as determined by the 2009 appraisal. The Department concluded that 3.47 acres of Lucas Ranch land changed from grazing to tillable land. This reclassification implicated subsection (2) and the Department calculated a new VBR using the 2002 value adjusted by the reclassification value. If the District Court followed the approach suggested by the Petitioners and used the 2002 value in 2009, it would ignore the value added to the property associated with the reclassification. When a taxpayer makes changes to the land that increase the value, the VBR must account for the increased property value. If the VBR did not account for the increase, the taxpayer would escape tax liability on the increased value. Such an interpretation would render subsection (2) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b621  The Petitioners maintain that the District Court ignored the maxim that tax statutes must be strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Western Energy Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 10, 297 Mont. 55, 990 P.2d 767 (citations omitted). Petitioners\u2019 argue that when \u201cambiguity exists in the statute, doubt should be resolved in the taxpayer\u2019s favor.\u201d Here, however, the statute is not susceptible to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>constructions, as there is no ambiguity. Rather, the plain language clearly establishes that properties that have been reclassified are subject to subsection (2) and do not get the incremental phase-in discussed in subsection (3). The District Court correctly interpreted the plain language of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, and complied with our rules of statutoiy construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">B. Tire Department\u2019s Rulemaking, Application, and Future Implementation of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b622 Petitioners make three additional arguments. First, they maintain that the Department failed to follow the rule making mandate of \u00a7 15-7-111(2), MCA. Second, Petitioners argue that the Department\u2019s application of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, results in continuing violations of Montana law. Lastly, Petitioners assert that the Department is incapable of implementing the District Court\u2019s interpretations of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b623  Petitioners argue that the Department failed to promulgate rules and that the existing rules are outdated. Under \u00a7 15-7-111(2), MCA, the Department must adopt rules for \u201cdetermining the assessed valuation and phased-in value of new, remodeled, or reclassified property within the same class.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 argument misses the primary issue at stake in this appeal; that is, whether the District Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. The failure to update the dates on the rules may be an error, but it does not have a substantive effect on the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b624  Petitioners also point to a number of alleged violations of Montana law by the Department. First, they argue that the Department applied the newly calculated VBR to parcels with no land change and to entire parcels when the change only affected a small number of acres. The Department argues, and we agree, that if individual landowners dispute the Department\u2019s findings, they can raise the issue with the local or state tax appeal boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b625 Second, the Petitioners maintain that the Department violatedits own rule, Admin. R. M. 42.20.502, when it applied the new VBR to property with changes occurring before 2002. The rule states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">(1) For property that <em>contains no new construction, destruction, land splits, land use changes, land reclassifications, land productivity changes, improvement grade changes, or other changes </em>made to the property during 2002 or subsequent tax years, the current year VBR will be the same as the prior year VBR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">(2) For class three property that contains <em>a land </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>reclassification or a land use change, </em>the current year VBR will be the prior year VBR of the new classification or land use change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">(3) For class three property that contains a productivity or grade change, the current year VBR will be the prior year VBR of the prior grade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Admin. R. M. 42.20.502 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b626 Under Admin. R. M. 42.20.502(1), Petitioners argue, the land changes must have occurred during or after2002. Petitioners maintain that many of the changes occurred ten to twenty years ago. Petitioners are correct that under Admin. R. M. 42.20.502(1), the rule references changes made \u201cduring 2002 or subsequent tax years.\u201d However, the next subsection specifically provides for \u201cclass three [agricultural] property that contains a land reclassification or a land use change\u201d and does not specify a year when the change must have occurred. Admin R. M. 42.20.502(2). Here, the Lucas Ranch experienced a land reclassification, therefore Admin. R. M. 42.20.502(2) applies, not Admin. R. M. 42.20.502(1). There is no requirement under Admin R. M. 42.20.502(2) that the changes occur during or after 2002. Moreover, \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA, permits the Department, with some limitations, to assess property that escaped assessment or was erroneously assessed by the Department. <em>OEA Research v. McGee, </em>217 Mont. 321, 324, 704 P.2d 1042, 1045 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b627 Third, the Petitioners argue that the District Court\u2019s interpretation violates equal protection. The District Court acknowledged that two parcels, growing the same crop on the same acreage, may be taxed differently for five years. However, we have previously recognized that \u201cany cyclical revaluation plan inevitably would create temporary disparities between individual property valuations.\u201d <em>Covenant Investments, </em>\u00b6 17 (citations omitted). We have upheld the cyclical variations so long as \u201cno intentional, systemic, arbitrary, or fraudulent discrimination was present.\u201d <em>Covenant Investments, Inc., </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Larson v. State and Department of Revenue, </em>166 Mont. 449, 455, 534 P.2d 854, 857 (1975). Part of the explanation for the variations is that many parcels underwent land changes or reclassifications in prior decades and those changes were not reflected in previous cycles. These parcels, which appear the same today, may have been subject to reclassifications that altered their taxable value. Only in 2009, when the Department had the funding to actually assess and appraise the land, were the changes revealed and new VBRs had to be calculated. Many of the properties experienced large VBR increases, but had previously benefited from significant underassessment. Under the Petitioner\u2019s proposal, this undervaluing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>would continue for another cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">\u00b628  Lastly, the Petitioners argue that the Department does not have the necessary information to determine when the new VBR should be applied. Petitioners assert that the Department lacks vital information such as which acres changed, the prior use of each parcel, and mapping of the areas. The Petitioners concede that the Department has sufficient information on changes after January2009. However, they argue that to comply with Admin. R. M. 42.20.501 and 502, the Department must know whether those changes occurred during or after 2002. The Petitioners argument misses the real issue on appeal, that is, whether the District Court properly interpreted the plain language of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. Whether the Department has enough information on each parcel does not impact the interpretation of the statute regarding phase-in benefits for non-market changes to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b629 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the Department on the Petitioner\u2019s Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Writ of Mandate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> Admin.

In regard to Petitioners\u2019 argument that reclassification of property in the context of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, refers only to changes between property classes and not to changes in agricultural use, I am persuaded by the Department\u2019s citation to \u00a7 15-7-201, MCA (2009), which includes the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">(2) Agricultural land must be classified according to its use, which classifications include but are not limited t\u00f3 irrigated use, nonirrigated use, and grazing use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">(3) Within each class, land must be subclassified by production categories. Production categories are determined from the productive capacity of the land based on yield.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u00b631 I further agree with the Department\u2019s argument that, when interpreting \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, as a whole, subsection (2) governs changes in property value resulting from nonmarket factors such as changes in use \u2014 for example, from summer fallow to irrigated land \u2014 while subsection (3) is directed to and governs changes in value resulting from the 6-year statewide reappraisal or \u201crevaluation\u201d of classes three, four, and ten. By enacting HB 658 in the 2009 Session, which added subsections (3) and (4) to \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Legislature specifically addressed in these provisions only the increased value arising from the reappraisal process, requiring that this increase be phased in over six years at the rate of 16.66% per year. As the title to HR 658 stated, the bill was for an Act\"... MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF PROPERTY TAX REAPPRAISAL ...,\u201d inter aha. <em>Laws of Montana </em>(2009), ch. 483, \u00a7 7. New subsection (3) was essentially an update of the Legislature\u2019s previous adoption of what is now codified as subsection (5), which also provided for phase-in of the new market value established by the reappraisal process. These conclusions effectively overrule Petitioners\u2019 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b632 One question raised by the plain language of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, but not answered by the Department\u2019s analysis of the statute, is the meaning or effect of the phase-in provisions of subsection (2). Understanding, again, that subsection (2) governs the changes in value resulting from nonmarket factors such as new construction and the owner\u2019s changes in use of the property, that provision requires the Department to \u201cvalue and phase in\u201d such changes and to \u201cadopt rules for determining the assessed valuation and phased-in value\u201d of such changes. The language of this directive is very general compared to the particular phase-in language within subsection (3), but nonetheless explicitly requires the Department to phase in, in some manner, the changes in value arising from nonmarket factors. The Department\u2019s argument that \u201charmonization of subsections (2) and (3) of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, requires the Department to phase in <em>only market changes </em>that have occurred between the cycles\u201d conflicts with the language of subsection (2). (Emphasis added.) This argument also conflicts with the Department\u2019s own statutory structure argument that we adopt herein, whereby subsections (2) and (3) are applied to two different processes. The Department takes the position that it can calculate a new value based upon subsection (2) property changes \u201cat any time\u201d and impose that new value all at once, citing \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA (permitting reassessment of property \u201cwhenever the department discovers that any taxable property\u201d has been erroneously assessed). Further, the Department has apparently not adopted rules to implement any kind of phase-in of subsection (2) changes, despite the statutory directive to do so. Given that this issue is not the thrust of Petitioners\u2019 argument and is ancillary to the issues as raised, resolution of these apparent conflicts will need to wait for another day.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b62-5\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b633 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision and would hold that the Department\u2019s calculated VBR and phase-in method for \u201cnew, remodeled, or reclassified property\u201d pursuant to subsection (2) is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>supported by the plain language of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. Neither subsection (2) nor subsection (3) gives the Department the authority to use any value other than the value from the 2002 base year. While subsection (2) allows for a new assessed value for property changes, it does not allow the Department to replace the value from the 2002 base year with a calculated VBR. The Department, moreover, adopted a calculated VBR for every agricultural property in the state pursuant to subsection (2), but failed to comply with the statute\u2019s directive to adopt rules authorizing it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Subsection (2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">The department shall value and phase in the value of newly constructed, remodeled, or reclassified property in a manner consistent with the valuation within the same class and the values established pursuant to subsection (1). The department shall adopt rules for determining the assessed valuation and phased-in value of new, remodeled, or reclassified property within the same class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b634 Petitioners argue that subsection (3), which requires changes in valuation from the 2002 base year for class three, four, and ten properties be phased in at a rate of 16.66% of the change, should be applied to property valuation changes resulting from subsection (3) <em>and </em>subsection (2). The Department\u2019s position is that the phase-in procedure of subsection (3) applies only to increased valuations resulting from changes in market conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u00b635 Given the context of the 2009 comprehensive reappraisal of agricultural properties and the Department\u2019s subsequent adoption of ARM 42.20.607 regarding a phase in procedure for subsection (3), I can appreciate the Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA. Nevertheless, this interpretation fails to account for the clear language of the statute requiring the value of new, remodeled, or reclassified property to be \u201cphased-in\u201d under subsection (2). This is Petitioners\u2019 primaxy objection. Petitioners\u2019 argument is not compromised because they advocate a phase in method consistent with subsection (3). Petitioners, in an effoit to construe the entire statute harmoniously, as we similarly must, assert that the same phase in procedure set forth in subsection (3) should be applied to subsection (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b636 Thus, I agree with Justice Rice when he states in \u00b6 32 that the \u201cone question raised by the plain language of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, but not answered by the Department\u2019s analysis of the statute, is the meaning or effect of the phase-in provisions of subsection (2).\u201d The Department\u2019s argument that only market changes must be phased in conflicts with the plain language of subsection (2) requiring that valuations of new, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>remodeled, or reclassified property similarly be phased in. Further, I fail to see a statutory basis whereby subsections (2) and (3) are to be accorded different processes for phasing in. Lastly, it appears that the Department has failed to adopt any rules to implement a phase in pursuant to subsection (2), as expressly required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b637 I believe the foregoing must be evaluated in the context of the requirement that\"... tax statutes are to be strictly construed against the taxing authority and in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d W. <em>Energy, Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 10,297 Mont. 55, 990 P.2d 767, 769. To the extent any construction of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, is required, the statute must be construed in the taxpayer\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b638 I dissent from our decision which does not apply these principles of statutory construction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
