We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u00b62 On July 11, 2012, Passwater failed to yield while making a left turn off of Montana Highway 83 and collided with a motorcycle. Bryce was driving the motorcycle and his wife Lynn was a passenger. Passwater was intoxicated at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u00b63 Lynn and Bryce (collectively the Boots) were hospitalized. Bryce suffered a broken left foot and Lynn\u2019s left leg was amputated below the knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\u00b64 On October 18, 2013, Passwater pleaded guilty to Negligent Vehicular Assault. A sentencing hearing was set for January 2,2014, but was later continued until March 19,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">\u00b65 On December 24, 2013, the State filed its Presentence Investigation (PSI) with the court. The PSI was delivered to Passwater on December 27,2013. The PSI included a victim impact letter and an affidavit from the Boots claiming a total pecuniary loss of $1,427,318.01. A Life Care Plan (the Plan) was submitted with the PSI. The Plan was prepared by Jennifer Crowley (Crowley), a Certified Life Care Planner and RN at Eagleview West Life Care Planning. The Plan proposed $1,278,256.00 as the cost of future care for Lynn as a result of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">\u00b66 On March 14,2014, Passwater filed an Objection to the PSI. In his Objection, Passwater disputed many of the expenses listed in the Plan, describing them as \u201cspeculation,\u201d and deriding the Plan itself as \u201cgibberish.\u201d Passwater instead proposed a restitution amount of $257,200.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">\u00b67 A sentencing hearing was held on March 19,2014. At the hearing the Boots testified in support of their proposed restitution amount. Passwater called a longtime amputee who testified about the cost of prosthetics. No other witnesses testified regarding restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b68 On May 12, 2014, the District Court issued a Judgment and Sentence ordering Passwater to pay restitution of $593,828.01 to the Boots and $24,988.40 to the Crime Victim Compensation Program for a total restitution amount of $618,816.41. Passwater timely appealed the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b69 What constitutes an appropriate measure of restitution is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 9, 379 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841. \u201cA district court's finding of fact as to the amount of restitution is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if \u2018it is not supported by substantial evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>State v. Spina, </em>1999 MT 113, \u00b6 12, 294 Mont. 367, 982 P.2d 421). \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting State <em>v. Jent, </em>2013 MT 93, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 468, 299 P.3d 332).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u00b610 Passwater presents a single issue for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err when it ordered restitution based on the Life Care Plan?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\u00b612 Passwater suggests that the District Court erred for two reasons. First, he argues that the cost calculations in the Plan were too speculative to provide adequate foundation for the restitution award. Second, he argues that his right to due process was violated by the court\u2019s reliance on \u201cuncorroborated hearsay\u201d in the Plan when awarding restitution. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u00b613 As a part of a criminal sentence, a court must order an offender to pay restitution to a victim who has suffered pecuniary loss as a result of the offense. Section 46-18-241(1), MCA We have reversed awards of restitution when the amounts awarded were based on speculation or insufficient evidence. For example, in <em>Aragon, </em>we reversed a restitution award because the only evidence regarding the amount awarded consisted of two conflicting insurance estimates. We stated, \u201c[a] reasonable mind could not conclude, solely from the two estimates, that one was more appropriate than the other.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u00b6 19. We remanded the case for further factual investigation and determination of the proper amount. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b614 In <em>State v. Collucio, </em>2009 MT 273, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Kirn, 2012 </em>MT 69, \u00b6 8, n.l, 364 Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 746), we reversed a restitution award because we determined that the testimony given in favor of the restitution award was overly speculative. There, after her husband was killed in a car accident, the victim (Troyer) testified to amounts of future costs associated with counseling, home repairs, and lost wages. <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-44. As to counseling, she stated she was \u201cat a loss\u201d regarding how to calculate the cost, but did so by \u201c[asking] a few friends that had been to counseling, approximately what to figure based on their expenses.\u201d <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6 41. Regarding home repairs, she stated that she \u201cjust assumed that I would spend a minimum of $100 a month paying somebody to do the things that [my husband] would be able to do himself.\u201d <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6 42. Finally, in calculating lost wages, Troyer used a pay stub from her husband\u2019s National Guard job showing half-year gross earnings of $27,608, but then adjusted his compensation based on what she felt he would \u201cpotentially earn\u201d from his other jobs, arriving at an annual <em>salary </em>of $92,472 for a total loss of $2,992,165. <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6 43. She also presented a document prepared by a lawyer friend placing total lost wages at $1,338,504, but testified she did not know how that figure had been calculated. <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6 44. We reversed the district court on the issue of restitution and remanded for a legal and factual reconsideration of the damages for counselling, home repairs, and lost wages. We stated, \"[a]ssumptions, ballpark figures from friends, and purely speculative calculations are insufficient information upon which to make findings of fact.\u201d <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b615  This case does not align factually with <em>Aragon </em>or <em>Collucio. </em>In those cases, the evidence presented in favor of restitution was not \u201csubstantiated in the record\u201d such that \u201ca reasonable mind\u201d could conclude that the award of restitution was warranted. <em>Collucio, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 19. In this case, the District Court had substantial evidence on which to base its decision to award restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b616 Evidence presented by the State included the Plan compiled by Crowley which recommended a total restitution amount of $1,278,256.00. The Plan itemized that total into categories of expenses and explained the purpose of each expense and how the total was reached. The Plan included citations to scholarly works, industry materials, government handbooks, and pricing data from retailers in support of the amounts given for each category. A letter from Crowley detailed her qualifications as an RN and a Certified life Care Planner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and her many years of experience in both fields. The letter also explained that she had consulted with several members of Lynn\u2019s heath care team in preparing the Plan, including an orthotist/prosthetist, orthopedic physician, physical therapist, and vocational expert. Further evidence presented by the State included the Boots\u2019 affidavit of pecuniary loss, claiming a loss of $1,427,318.01, as well as testimony from the Boots at the sentencing hearing detailing the costs they had already incurred due to Lynn\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b617 Passwater\u2019s response to the State\u2019s evidence included his Objection to the PSI, in which he suggested that Crowley was unqualified to complete the Plan and asserted that many of the amounts listed within the Plan were purely speculative. The Objection recommended a total restitution amount of $257,200.23, itemized into categories of expense, but did not explain how those expenses were calculated. At the sentencing hearing, Passwater called an amputee witness who testified that the cost of his prosthetic was less than the cost of Lynn\u2019s prosthetic as outlined in the Plan. In a closing statement at the hearing, based on the amputee witness testimony and testimony from the Boots regarding costs they had incurred, Passwater adjusted his recommendation for restitution to $117,200.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b618 At the conclusion of the hearing, the court awarded restitution of $593,828.01 to the Boots and $24,988.40 to the Crime Victim Compensation Program. In doing so, the court went item by item through the Plan, awarding some expenses and reducing or eliminating others. For example, the court pointed out that the $684,036.00 suggested cost of Prosthetic Devices and Supplies included \u201cadvanced technology future prosthetic devices,\u201d which the court found speculative. The court reduced that amount to $352,836.00. Similarly, the court reduced the $279,514.00 proposed cost of Home Health Care to $44,962.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b619 Passwater argues that the District Court erred when it relied upon \u201cspeculative costs\u201d contained in the Plan. Passwater states that the Plan is \u201claden with finaybes,\u2019 fit depends,\u2019 and exorbitant unreasoned inflation of item costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b620 We have held that restitution may be awarded \u201ceven though the actual losses may be uncertain, if the losses were calculated by use of reasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 2009 MT 222, \u00b6 14, 351 Mont. 329, 212 P.3d 276 (citing <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 29, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495). We have also acknowledged that there may be \u201csome guess work\u201d associated with determining losses sustained, but the restitution award may be sustained if based on the best evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>available. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b621 \u201cA district court\u2019s finding of fact as to the amount of restitution is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if\u2018it is not supported by substantial evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9. Based on our review of the record we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. As described above, the District Court was presented evidence from both sides concerning the appropriate amount of restitution. The Plan was prepared by an experienced individual consulting with health care professionals and with outside authority supporting its conclusions. We conclude that a \u201creasonable mind\u201d could accept this evidence as adequate to support a conclusion, and that the Plan meets the \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence\u201d standard and qualifies as substantial evidence. The court accepted several of the Plan\u2019s suggestions but used its own judgment to amend amounts as it saw necessary to avoid speculation or unsubstantiated assumptions. This constituted a \u201creasonable method\u201d to calculate a final award.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b622 Between December 27,2013 \u2014 the date the Plan was delivered to Passwater \u2014 and the March 19, 2014, hearing, Passwater had ample time to gather evidence rebutting the Plan. For example, Passwater could have called another Certified Life Care Planner or medical expert to rebut the expenses in the Plan, or have had an alternative life care plan prepared. Instead, Passwater simply dismissed the Plan as \u201cspeculative,\u201d dismissed Crowley as unqualified, and offered an alternative measure of restitution without corroboration. Based on the evidence presented by Passwater, we cannot conclude the District Court erred by relying, in part, upon the Plan as the best available evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b623 Passwater also argues that his due process rights were violated because the Plan contained \u201chearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay...\u201d and should not have been allowed as evidence. However, the rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing hearings. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 12. Montana Rule of Evidence 101(c)(3) (\u201cScope\u201d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">(c) Rules inapplicable. The [Montana Rules of Evidence] (other than those with respect to privileges) do not apply in the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>(3) Miscellaneous proceedings. Proceedings for... sentencing ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUk\">Furthermore, we have long held that hearsay can be properly considered in sentencing. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>229 Mont. 101, 113, 745 P.2d 342, 349 (1987) (citing <em>State v. D.B.S., </em>216 Mont. 234, 247, 700 P.2d 630, 639 (1985)); <em>State v. Dunkerson, </em>2003 MT 234, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 228, 76 P.3d 1085. Passwater\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the admittance of hearsay evidence at the sentencing hearing is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b624 It is true that a defendant has a due process right to \u201cexplain, argue, and rebut any information\u201d presented at sentencing. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 12. Passwater, however, makes no claim that he was in any way prevented from doing so. As discussed above, Passwater had ample time to prepare a defense to the Plan and myriad ways in which to do so. If he was concerned with having first party testimony for cross-examination, he could have requested Crowley be subpoenaed. He could have subpoenaed the listed health care specialists to testify about their expertise and their participation in creating the Plan. He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b625  The District Court did not err by admitting possible hearsay evidence in the sentencing hearing, because the rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing proceedings. Nor did the District Court err by relying in part upon the Plan to determine the appropriate amount of restitution. The Plan was not purely speculative, and it was supported by substantial evidence. Passwater was not denied the opportunity to rebut the State\u2019s evidence by presenting his own witnesses or evidence. The District Court did not err in awarding restitution to the Boots. \u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
