We reverse and remand for further proceedings, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err in determining that Posnien retained no security interest in the M\u00edstate agency book of business sold to Baird </em>7 <em>pursuant to the terms of Allstate\u2019s Contract Documents?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b63 Fay MasonPosnien was an Exclusive Agent for Allstate, heroffice located in Kalispell. In 2000, Fay incorporated Posnien, Inc., after Allstate informed her it would no longer permit agencies to operate as sole proprietorships. In 2006, Fay decided to sell the agency and retire. After Allstate placed an advertisement on its website listing the agency for sale, Mary Baird, incorporated as Baird 7, offered to purchase the agency from Posnien for $450,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b64 Prior to selling the agency, Posnien was required to obtain Allstate\u2019s approval of Baird 7 as the purchaser and the terms of the agreement. The process of obtaining Allstate\u2019s approval required the involvement of Allstate\u2019s Montana Field Manager, Mike Brown. During the process, Brown provided Baird with documents showing the agency\u2019s history of revenue and expenses, while Baird provided Brown with a proposed business plan. Additionally, Brown reviewed Baird\u2019s tax returns and other financial documents. Beyond the exchange of documents, Brown conducted personal interviews with Baird to determine whether he believed she would be successful as an Allstate agent. Following the process, Brown wrote a letter to Allstate recommending approval of the transaction, and Allstate ultimately approved transfer of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u00b65 Under the agreement between the parties, Baird 7 agreed to make a $150,000 down payment. To make this payment, Baird 7 obtained a loan from Kenneth and Gretchen Gose, while Posnien agreed to finance the remainder of the purchase price. The book of business, understood as an agency\u2019s \u201ccustomer accounts,\u201d was valued at $435,000 by the Buy-Sell Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\u00b66 On March 1,2007, the sale closed and Baird became an Exclusive Agent for Allstate. To become an Exclusive Agent, Mary Baird executed an Exclusive Agency Agreement (Agreement) with Allstate on behalf of Baird 7, incorporating by reference the Exclusive Agency Independent Contractor Manual (Manual). Under the Agreement, an agent owns an \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in the agency\u2019s book of business, whichmay be used as collateral for business loans, although ownership is retained by Allstate. Part of the agent\u2019s economic interest includes the option to receive termination payments at the time an agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>decides to end her affiliation with Allstate. Pursuant to the Agreement, Baird collateralized her right to receive termination payments to secure a loan from the Goses. Baird similarly granted Posnien a security interest in the book of business. Baird executed a UCC Financing Statement at the time of closing, stating that Posnien had a security interest in the book of business along with all assets owned by the Baird 7 agency. On March 2,2007, Posnien filed the statement with the Secretary of State and the Flathead County Clerk and Recorder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b67 The agency continued to be successful following the transfer until Baird\u2019s termination as an agent on April 11, 2011. Under the Agreement, any agency relationship may be terminated for cause in instances of fraudulent conduct. Allstate learned Baird had falsified the date of loss on a claim for damage to her own boat under a personal Allstate policy. In response to Baird\u2019s fraudulent claim, Allstate immediately closed the Baird 7 agency pursuant to the Agreement\u2019s termination provisions and \u201cparked\u201d the book of business at the Pete Russell Allstate agency. In moving the book of business, comprised of approximately 1,400 policies, Allstate placed all of Baird 7\u2019s paper files with the Russell agency and changed its computer system to allow access to the electronic files by Russell. Allstate made no more commission payments to Baird 7. Baird 7 made its final payment to Posnien in April 2011, still owing more than $280,000 on the debt to Posnien.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b68 Under the Agreement, Allstate gave Baird 7 the option of either transferring its economic interest to an approved buyer or receiving a termination payment from Allstate. Baird 7 was given 90 days to sell the agency but failed to do so and subsequently opted to receive a termination payment in the amount of $148,174.69. Because Posnien and the Goses disputed whose lien had priority to the termination payment, Allstate withheld its disbursement of the funds and filed a Complaint in Interpleader on October 11,2011, to determine the rights of the parties. Posnien then filed a counterclaim against Allstate, alleging conversion (by interfering with its security interest and withholding commission payments) and interference with contractual relations. Posnien similarly counterclaimed against Baird 7, asserting Breach of Contract, Forgery, and Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and Fair Dealing. In turn, Baird 7 filed counterclaims against Allstate, including Conversion, Intentional Interference with Prospective Advantage, Invasion of Privacy, Violation of the Montana Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">\u00b69 The Goses and Posnien subsequently entered into a settlement in which the Goses took 2/3 of the termination payment while Posnien received the remaining 1/3. As part of the settlement, Baird 7 assigned all of its claims against Allstate to Posnien, while Posnien agreed to dismiss all claims against Baird 7. Finally, while the settlement stipulated Allstate would no longer be subject to claims regarding the termination payments, Posnien retained the right to pursue any independent claims it had against Allstate, including those assigned by Baird 7. Posnien exercised this right under the settlement agreement and pursued its remaining claims against Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b610 On March 4, 2013, Posnien filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the claim of conversion. Allstate likewise filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Posnien\u2019s claim. Following a hearing, the District Court entered an order denying Posnien\u2019s motion and granting Allstate\u2019s. Posnien appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b611 This Court Reviews a district court ruling on summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. <em>Pilgeram v. Green Point Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839. This Court must determine whether the district court applied the law correctly. <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 21, 332 Mont. 303, 137 P.3d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err in determining that Posnien retained no security interest in the Allstate agency book of business sold to Baird </em>7 <em>pursuant to the terms of Allstate\u2019s Contract Documents?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u00b613 As the District Court stated, the central issue in this case is the scope of the security interest that Posnien was granted when it sold its economic interest in the agency book of business to Baird 7, specifically, what secured interest, if any, survived the termination of Baird 7\u2019s economic interest in the agency. Citing \u00a7 30-9A-203(2)(b), MCA, which provides that a debtor may grant a security interest in collateral if the \u201cdebtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party,\u201d the District Court concluded that because Baird 7\u2019s interest was limited to a termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>payment, Posnien retained no further \u201crights in the collateral\u201d beyond the termination payment. Beasoning that \u201cBaird 7 never possessed the right that would have entitled it to receive commission payments after it was terminated for cause,\u201d the court concluded that Posnien was likewise not entitled to future commission payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b614 Posnien has argued that its right to secure its interest encompassed the termination payment, ongoing commissions generated by the policies, and an economic interest in the agency book of business it sold to Baird 7. Posnien offers that, under Allstate\u2019s contractual documents, an agent such as Baird 7 had rights in the book of business for use as collateral for a business loan from a lender, or to grant a security interest, as purchaser, to the seller of the book of business. During oral argument, Posnien slightly altered, or at least placed a different emphasis on, its position, conceding that the right to a security interest in renewal commission payments ended when Baird 7 lost the right to those payments upon termination of Baird 7\u2019s agency. However, Posnien continues to argue that its security interest in the economic interest of the book of business was more expansive than those commissions alone or the termination payment Baird 7 received, arguing that \u201cPosnien has a security interest, not just in the collateral, but in any proceeds generated from the collateral,\u201d citing the UCC. Section 30-9A-315(l)(aXb), MCA, provides that a secured parly\u2019s interest \u201ccontinues in collateral notwithstanding sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition thereof unless the secured party authorized the disposition free of the security interest,\u201d and also \u201cattaches to any identifiable proceeds\u201d from the collateral. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 30-9A-315, MCA. Posnien thus argues that its lien attached to the revenue Allstate is receiving from the proceeds that are being generated by the policies that have been parked by Allstate with a different agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b615 Central to the resolution of this case are Allstate\u2019s contractual documents controlling the parties\u2019 legal relationships. While the question presented initially appears to sound in secured transactions, it is more appropriately characterized as one of contract. Allstate created an alternate universe of finance to govern the relationships between itself and its agents, as well as between agents, with its own guarantees, terminology and restrictions. It retained the ownership of the agency book of business, but permitted agents to hold an economic interest in the book of business, and incorporated selected legal principles regarding secured sales to govern agency-related financial transactions. Thus, usual principles governing secured transactions are circumscribed by the limited fashion in which they were incorporated into this contractual world. To \u201csell\u201d an agency or an agency book of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>business is a relative term premised upon Allstate\u2019s actual ownership of the book of business. Posnien, Baird, and Allstate were bound together through various contractual documents, most prominently the previously-mentioned Exclusive Agency Agreement (Agreement), the Exclusive Agency Independent Contractor Manual (Manual), and their Supplements, generally referred to herein collectively as the \u201cContract Documents,\u201d which must be examined holistically to determine the parties\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b616 Of primary importance is the Manual\u2019s section entitled \u201cEconomic Interest in the Book of Business,\u201d which defines an agent\u2019s economic interest in her business as comprised of two elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">You have an economic interest in the Allstate customer accounts developed under [the Contract Documents]. That economic interest is a specifically defined, limited interest. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in [the Contract Documents], your economic interest in the business is comprised of only two elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXD\">First, the economic interest includes the option, where applicable, of Receiving a Termination Payment according to the terms of [the Contract Documents].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">Second, the economic interest includes the ability, subject to approval of the company and other provisions of [the Contract Documents], to transfer your interest as provided in the [Agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">No other rights are included within the terms \u201cyour economic interest\u201d or \u201ceconomic interest in the book of business\u201d.... You do not have any right to renewals or renewal commissions of any kind after termination of [the Agreement].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Of note, this definition of an agent\u2019s economic interest in the book of business was provided by Allstate to <em>both </em>Posnien and Baird 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">\u00b617 Readily apparent from a reading of this provision is that the economic interest in the book of business does not include \u201crenewals or renewal commissions of any kind <em>after termination\u201d </em>A similar provision is included in the termination for cause provisions of the Manual. Posnien\u2019s argument, as refined, acknowledges that commissions are designed, as provided in the Agreement, to compensate the agent \u201cfor services rendered,\u201d and therefore terminate upon termination of the agent\u2019s Agreement with Allstate. Although commissions are included within the economic interest of the book of business while the Agreement is in effect, and an agent may then \u201cassign a portion of his commission to a lender\u201d under separate Manual provisions governing the assignment of commissions, the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>receive commissions ends upon termination of the agency Agreement. Thus, according to the Manual, Posnien\u2019s right to receive commissions as compensation ended with the termination of Posnien\u2019s Agreement upon the sale of the book of business to Baird 7, and Baird 7\u2019s right to receive commissions, as well as Posnien\u2019s right to lien Baird 7\u2019s commissions, ended upon termination of Baird 7\u2019s Agreement. Under these clear terms, Posnien has no security interest in the commission stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b618 We return to the question of what Posnien\u2019s economic interest in the book of business consisted of under the Contract Documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subject to Allstate\u2019s approval of each transaction, the Agreement authorized agents to initiate a \u201csale, merger, or assignment\u201d as well as a \u201cconveyance, or the granting of [a] lien, security interest, pledge, or mortgage\u201d of the economic interest. <em>See also, </em>Manual, p. 39 (\u201cyou may sell your economic interest in the book of business serviced by your agency at any time provided the Company approves the buyer.\u201d). The authorization to assign the economic interest in the book of business also includes, under separate contract provisions, the ability to collaterally assign the agent\u2019s commissions, the termination payment, and the proceeds of a sale of the economic interest in the book of business. These provisions are followed by further statements applicable to loan collateralizations. They provide that \u201c[tjhe Company will <em>not approve </em>an assignment <em>of your entire agreement </em>as security for a loan,\u201d and that, \u201cif you assign your rights to the termination payments in order to secure a loan, you must disclose any such assignment, in writing, <em>to any buyer of your economic interest in the book of business.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Another section similarly provides, \u201cif you assign your rights to your Termination Payment <em>or commissions, </em>you must disclose any such assignment to any buyer of your economic interest in the book of business.\u201d (emphasis added). This language demonstrates that an agent\u2019s entire economic interest in the book of business is more expansive than the right to receive commissions or the right to receive a termination payment. An agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>can collateralize either her commissions or termination payment, and still sell her economic interest in the book of business, although she is required to notify the buyer of those outstanding liens. This demonstrates that, as argued by Posnien, the economic interest in the book of business is an asset that, while owned by Allstate, can provide value for the agent beyond sales commissions or a termination payment. While all of these options are not necessarily cumulative, it is clear that an agent is given the option under the Contract Documents of securing the value of her book of business upon sale to a willing buyer by taking a security interest in the book of business, which Posnien did, and which Allstate approved. Under the Contract Documents, Posnien thereby surrendered her rights to further commissions, as noted above, and a termination payment. <em>See </em>Manual, p. 39 (\u201cIf you elect to sell, you do not receive the termination payment from Allstate.\u201d); p. 44 (\u201cThe termination payment will not apply if you sell your economic interest in the book of business.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b619 Intervening in this transaction was the fraudulent action committed by Baird a few years later, and Allstate\u2019s termination of Baird 7\u2019s agency Agreement, in which Baird 7 exercised its option to receive a termination payment. Like the District Court, Allstate relies on \u00a7 30-9A-203(2), MCA, which provides that a security interest is enforceable only if \u201cthe debtor has rights in the collateral,\u201d and argues that \u201cany security interest that Baird 7 granted to Posnien was limited to the extent of Baird 7\u2019s rights\u201d in the book of business. Because Baird 7\u2019s right was limited by the Contract Documents to the options of selling the book of business to a buyer approved by Allstate or accepting a termination payment, which right was satisfied by the termination payment, Allstate argues that Posnien was left without recourse to secure payment of the balance of its secured debt. Allstate offers that it \u201cbears no responsibility for Baird 7\u2019s failure to make the required loan payments or Posnien\u2019s poor business decision.\u201d Allstate thus takes the position that Baird 7\u2019s acceptance of a payment from Allstate terminated not only Baird 7\u2019s economic interest in the book of business, but also Posnien\u2019s remaining economic interest in the book of business. Allstate\u2019s argument is flawed for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b620 Allstate\u2019s argument may be persuasive if this were an arm\u2019s-length transaction within a free market. However, this transaction occurred within Allstate\u2019s closed contract world wherein it had placed limitations upon, and made promises to, the agents. In the Manual, Posnien was promised that \u201c[y]ou will have an economic interest in the Allstate customer accounts you develop\u201d and \u201c[y]ou are able to realize such interest upon the termination of your [Agreement].\u201d To \u201crealize\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>her interest as promised by Allstate, Posnien surrendered her rights to ongoing commissions and to a termination payment and instead chose another option granted by Allstate, as discussed above, to sell and take a security interest in her economic interest in the book of business. As stated in the defined economic interest provision, Posnien\u2019s interest \u201cinclude[d] the ability, subject to [the Contract Documents], to transfer your interest....\u201d That \u201cability\u201d included the right to secure her interest in the book of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b621 This \u201cability\u201d was made subject to the Contract Documents, which Allstate argues limited Baird 7\u2019s interest under the termination procedure commenced for the fraud and thereby likewise limited Posnien\u2019s secured interest in Baird 7\u2019s interest. However, in stark contrast to the provisions clearly stating that the right to receive commissions and the option to receive a termination payment end upon termination of an agent\u2019s economic interest, nothing in the Contract Documents remotely suggests that a selling agent\u2019s broader secured interest in a book of business was subject to forfeiture upon a subsequent decision by Allstate to terminate the buying agent\u2019s interest in the book of business or, in other words, that the termination of Baird 7\u2019s defined economic interest by way of the termination procedure would also extinguish Posnien\u2019s defined economic interest. Indeed, Posnien had every reason to understand just the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"AOT\">\u00b622 First, as mentioned above, the Contract Documents clearly provided Posnien a defined economic interest and promised that she would be able to \u201crealize\u201d this interest. This was a contractual promise to Posnien that was separate from Allstate\u2019s contractual promise to Baird 7. Both were given the limited options by Allstate of either taking a termination payment or selling their interest to another approved buyer while retaining a secured interest. Baird 7 took the payment, while Posnien took the secured interest. Then, as Posnien notes, \u00a7 30-9A-315(l)(a), MCA, provides that a security interest \u201ccontinues in collateral notwithstanding sale, lease, license exchange, <em>or other disposition </em>thereof unless the secured party authorized the disposition free of the security interest... .\u201d (emphasis added). As a general rule of law, Posnien\u2019s secured interest followed the collateral. There was particularly no concern over the collateral\u2019s disposition here, where the book of business, though retaken by Allstate from Baird 7, was part of a closed contractual system and remained in Allstate\u2019s ownership and possession \u2014 the accounts weren\u2019t going anywhere. It was incumbent upon Allstate, if it intended Baird 7\u2019s termination payment to extinguish Posnien\u2019s security interest, to either contractually provide for the same, or to obtain Posnien\u2019s release of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>interest under \u00a7 30-9A-315(l)(a), MCA. Lastly, the Contract Documents provided that secured interests would be honored. The Manual\u2019s section entitled \u201cTransfer of Economic Interest\u201d requires that \u201cany business loan secured by your rights and economic interest in the business\u201d must be repaid before an economic interest can be transferred. This is consistent with the provisions, discussed above, that any secured interests in the economic interest of the agent must be disclosed to a buyer. Clearly, Posnien\u2019s interest was not exclusively hitched to Baird 7\u2019s wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b623 These provisions did not make Allstate the guarantor of the debt owed to Posnien by Baird 7. Posnien took the risk that the book of business she had sold would have sufficient value to generate proceeds to pay the debt, a risk taken upon the promise of Allstate, as owner of the book of business, that Posnien could maintain a security interest in the book of business, and upon Allstate\u2019s approval of the transaction. Posnien also took the risk that Baird 7 would not be a successful agent, but that risk, including the possibility of Baird 7\u2019s contractual termination, was likewise balanced by the legal right to maintain a secured interest in the collateral in the event Baird 7 failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b624 Posnien\u2019s rights upon disposition of the collateral under \u00a7 30-9A-315(l)(a), MCA, were not honored by Allstate and, as explained in the Official Comments to that section, the remedies for this violation include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">[This section] contains the general rule that a security interest survives disposition of the collateral. In these cases, the secured party may repossess the collateral from the transferee or, in an appropriate case, maintain an action for conversion. The secured party may claim both any proceeds and the original collateral but, of course, may have only one satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Official Comment 2, \u00a7 30-9A-315(l)(a), MCA. Here, Posnien has pursued a conversion action.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\u00b625  \u201cProof of a claim for conversion requires that plaintiff own the property; that plaintiff have the right to possess the property; that defendant exercise unauthorized control over the property; and that plaintiff suffer damages.\u201d <em>Salminen v. Morrison &amp; Frampton, PLLP, </em>2014 MT 323, \u00b6 21, 377 Mont. 244, 339 P.3d 602. Posnien\u2019s position in holding an economic interest in the book of business, having the right, as secured creditor, to possess, upon default of its agreement with Baird 7, the book of business, and Allstate\u2019s unauthorized control over the book of business by excluding it from Posnien after Baird 7\u2019s default, satisfies the liability elements of conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u00b626 Allstate\u2019s termination payment made to Baird 7 was potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>applicable to Posnien\u2019s lien, but Allstate chose not to honor the hen and, in any event, the payment was of insufficient amount to satisfy the hen. However, this payment may be credited to Allstate in a calculation of damages for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b627 The District Court concluded that, even if Allstate had not prevailed on its motion for summary judgment on conversion, Posnien\u2019s motion would be denied because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding \u201cwhether Goses or Posnien had the superior security interest, and thus the priority position to receive any assets from Baird 7.\u201d It appears from the record that Groses claimed only entitlement to the termination payment, and that their claim was resolved by the settlement providing for distribution of that payment.
