Meek, arising from Cascade County Cause No. BDV-12-0657, <em>Meek v. Bennett Motors, et al. </em>This Court adopted a briefing schedule and conducted oral argument on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>March 11,2015. Jeffrey G. Winter argued for Petitioner, Cathy Lewis argued for Respondent, and Anders Blewett argued for Amicus Curiae Montana Trial Lawyers Association. The matter having been submitted for decision, we grant the petition and exercise supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court properly granted a defense motion in limine to restrict the medical damages evidence admissible at trial, and granted summary judgment against Meek on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b63 Judy Meek passed away on January 23, 2012, after a fall at a business premises on November 2, 2011. Sharon Meek, as personal representative of Judy\u2019s Estate (Meek), brought this action against the business where the fall happened, seeking damages for survival and wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b64 In the period between the fall and Judy\u2019s death, Judy\u2019s medical providers billed $197,154.93 for her care. Judy was covered by Medicare and had supplemental coverage through Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Medicare and BCBS together paid a total of $70,711.26 to Judy\u2019s medical providers. The District Court concluded that despite the billing from the medical providers, Judy had \u201cno exposure or obligation to pay any charges beyond those actually paid pursuant to the Medicare rules and the insurance polity with Blue Cross/Blue Shield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">\u00b65 The issue in the present case arises from the District Court\u2019s decision on a pre-trial motion filed by one of the defendants, Pierce\u2019s Dodge City. The motion sought to limit Meek\u2019s medical expense recovery to the amounts paid to the providers by Medicare and BCBS, and to prevent Meek from presenting evidence to the jury as to the amounts actually billed by the medical providers. After briefing, the District Court concluded that while there was a split of authority nationally, the legal issue has been decided in Montana, citing this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Conway v. Benefis Health System, </em>2013 MT 73, 369 Mont. 309, 297 P.3d 1200 and <em>Newbury v. State Farm, </em>2008 MT 156, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b66 The District Court determined that since Meek had no liability exposure to the medical care providers in excess of the amount paid by Medicare and BCBS, the only medical expense evidence that she could present to the jury were the amounts that had been paid to the providers. The District Court concluded that the amount actually billed by the providers was not representative of the reasonable value of the medical services provided to Judy and that the amount billed by the health care providers was inadmissible because it \u201cis irrelevant\u201d to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>issue or to damages in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b67 The District Court granted the motion in limine to limit medical damage evidence, and granted summary judgment against Meek on that issue. Meek seeks supervisoxy control over that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b68 This Court exercises supexvisory control in appropriate cases pursuant to Article VH, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution and Rule 17(a), M. R. App. P. Supervisory control is appropriate where the district court is proceeding upon a mistake of law which, if not corrected, would cause significant ixyustice for which appeal is an inadequate remedy. <em>Inter-Fluve v. Eighteenth Judicial District Court, </em>2005 MT 103, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 14, 112 P.3d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b69 A motion in limine can seek to prevent or limit the introduction of evidence at trial, and the authority to grant or deny the motion rests in the inherent power of the district court to admit or exclude evidence so as to ensure a fair trial. <em>Hulse v. Department of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75. Where a decision on a motion in limine involves the exercise of discretion, this Court will not overturn the district court absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 41, 315 Mont. 452, 69 P.3d 1162. Where a decision on a motion in limine involves a conclusion of law or interpretation of statute, we review to determine whether the result is correct. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2011 MT 22, \u00b6 8, 359 Mont. 200, 247 P.3d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment to determine whether it is correct, using the same criteria under Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortgage, </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b611 We do not address Meek\u2019s claim regarding the damages she may recover for medical expenses because that is an issue that can be adequately addressed on appeal if necessaxy. The only issue we address in this pretrial proceeding is whether the District Court properly limited the evidence that is admissible at trial regarding medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b612 The paxties agree that Meek is entitled to damages \u201crepresenting the reasonable value of the medical expenses for medical services obtained by Judy Meek.\u201d This is consistent with Montana law, which requires that in all cases damages must be reasonable, and that no party has a right to unconscionable and grossly oppressive damages that are contrary to substantial justice. Section 27-1-302, MCA; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Tidyman\u2019s Management Services v. Davis, </em>2014 MT 205, \u00b6 40, 376 Mont. 80, 330 P.3d 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b613 The District Court concluded and the respondents argue that amounts billed by health care providers are \u201cnot a reliable or accurate indicator of the reasonable value of the services\u201d because they are unreasonably inflated and few patients ever actually pay the billed amount. Respondents argue that the amount the providers actually receive from insurers or other benefit programs is a \u201cfar better indicator of the reasonable value of a provider\u2019s services.\u201d Further, they argue that allowing Meek to present evidence of medical bills in excess of what has been actually paid could lead to a windfall recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b614 The ultimate issue is whether Meek\u2019s medical bills are admissible at trial or whether, as the District Court held, they are irrelevant and inadmissible. All relevant evidence is admissible, except when otherwise provided. Rule 402, M. R. Evid. Relevant evidence is evidence that has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M. R. Evid.; <em>Alexander v. Bozeman Motors, Inc., </em>2012 MT 301, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 367 Mont. 401, 291 P.3d 1120. Therefore, evidence should not be excluded simply because there may be contrary evidence or because it may be subject to impeachment. Although the District Court ruled that the amount of expenses billed is irrelevant when there is no claim for future medical expenses, medical bills received by a tort victim can be relevant evidence of issues such as the nature and severity of the injuries, and of the medical procedures and treatments that were required. <em>Chapman v. Mazda Motor of Am., </em>7 F. Supp. 2d 1123, 1125 (D. Mont. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b615 The respondents\u2019 factual arguments regarding the nature and reliability of medical billings therefore do not provide adequate grounds for a pre-trial order excluding the evidence of the amounts billed by Meek\u2019s medical providers. If supported by competent evidence at trial, these arguments could provide matters of impeachment, and could affect the weight the juiy might give to the evidence. Without more, however, these factual contentions do not justify exclusion of the evidence. The District Court\u2019s pretrial ruling to exclude all medical bills and grant summary judgment was not justified here, where Meek presented the affidavit of her primary physician that affirmed that the medical services represented in the billings were reasonably necessary to her care. The affidavit also affirmed that the amounts billed were reasonable, were the usual and customary rates for such treatment, and that they represented the reasonable value of the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u00b616 Ultimately, there is a factual dispute in the case over the nature of the hills presented by the medical providers and whether they represent a reasonable measure of the value of the services provided. The reasonableness of the medical bills as a measure of damages is a matter to be determined by the jury. <em>Burley v. Burlington Northern, </em>2012 MT 28, \u00b6 91, 364 Mont. 77, 273 P.3d 825. The existence of genuine issues of material fact precludes summary judgment. <em>Redies v. Attorney Liability Prot. Soc., </em>2007 MT 9, \u00b6 26, 335 Mont. 233, 150 P.3d 930. This does not end the inquiry in this case, however, since the District Court also issued an order in limine, limiting the medical expense evidence that would be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b617  The District Court\u2019s order admitting only evidence of amounts the insurers paid to Meek\u2019s health care providers violates \u00a7 27-1-308, MCA. That statute, referred to as the collateral source rule, requires that a jury determine its award \u201cwithout consideration <em>ofany </em>collateral source.\u201d Section 27-1-308(3), MCA (emphasis added). A collateral source, generally, is \u201ca payment for something that is later included in a tort award and that is made to or for the benefit of a plaintiff or is otherwise available to the plaintiff.\u201d Section 27-1-307(1), MCA. The statute provides, however, that in a separate post-trial proceeding the district court must reduce a jury\u2019s verdict in a personal injury case \u201cby any amount paid or payable from a collateral source that does not have a subrogation right.\u201d Section 27-1-308(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b618 The District Court ruled that the \u201camount of the write-down\u201d (the medical billings not covered by Medicare or BCBS) was not a benefit or was not otherwise \u201cavailable\u201d to Meek and therefore did not meet the definition of a collateral source under the statute. However, the payments made by Medicare to satisfy the providers\u2019 billings are clearly a collateral source. The District Court\u2019s order in this case, and now the Dissent, would not only require that these collateral source payments be considered by the jury, but would also make the collateral source payment conclusively determinative of Meek\u2019s medical damages. This is a clear violation of \u00a7 27-1-308(3), MCA. The statute prohibits the jury from considering any collateral sources and evidence of collateral source payments is not admissible on the issue of a personal injury claimant\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b619 Respondents contend that allowing Meek to present evidence of the medical bills from her providers could result in a \u201cwindfall\u201d recovery. This contention is addressed by \u00a7 27-1-308(1) and (3), MCA, which provides that after a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the district court must hold a hearing and determine whether there were any collateral source payments to account for. If so, the recovery must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>be reduced by the amount paid or payable from a collateral source. \u00b620 Contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusions, the issues in this case were not decided <em>iaNewbury andConway. </em>Both of those cases involved contract disputes between insureds and insurers over application of insurance policy language, and neither case involved the admissibility of evidence in a personal injury action against a tortfeasor. Most significantly, neither case involved application of the collateral source statute, \u00a7 27-1-308, MCA. Neither case resolves the issues raised in the present case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b621 The parties have devoted considerable argument to identifying the majority and minority national rules on whether a tort claimant is limited to introducing evidence of medical expenses paid by third parties. <em>See, e.g., Bynum v. Magno, </em>101 P.3d 1149 (Haw. 2004). We do not decide the present case through application of national trends, but through application of the Montana Rules of Evidence and the Montana collateral source statute, \u00a7 27-1-308, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b622 We reiterate that Montana law requires that damages be reasonable, \u00a7 27-1-302, MCA, and <em>Tidyman\u2019s, </em>\u00b6 40, and that it is up to the jury to determine what is reasonable under the circumstances, <em>Burley, </em>\u00b6 91. This statutory requirement of reasonable damages must be construed along with the collateral source statute, \u00a7 27-1-308, MCA, so as to give effect to both. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Hanson v. Edwards, </em>2000 MT 221, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 185, 7 P.3d 419. Therefore, if at trial Meek introduces evidence of Judy Meek\u2019s medical bills the defendants may contest the reasonableness of those bills as a measure of damages. If so, evidence of the amount that Medicare pays to other health care providers for the same or similar service could be relevant to that issue, as long as there is no evidence or argument that Judy Meek was covered by Medicare or other insurance, or that Medicare or an insurer paid any part of her medical expenses. Those matters may be considered only by the District Court and only after a verdict, as provided in \u00a7 27-1-308(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b623 Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b624 IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b625 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court order on Pierce\u2019s Dodge City\u2019s motions in limine and summary judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Meek, as discussed above, are VACATED and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b626 The Clerk of this Court is directed to provide copies of the Opinion and Order to counsel of record in Cascade County Cause No. BDV120657, counsel for Amicus Curiae Montana Trial Lawyers Association and Montana Defense Trial Lawyers, and to the Honorable Jon A.

The Court\u2019s decision is inconsistent with Montana\u2019s statutes defining damages, \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-201, -202, MCA, and with our precedent, specifically <em>Newbury v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance, </em>2008 MT 156, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021, <em>Conway v. Benefis Health System, </em>2013 MT 73, 369 Mont. 309, 297 P.3d 1200, and <em>Harris v. St. Vincent Healthcare, </em>2013 MT 207, 371 Mont. 133, 305 P.3d 852. The Court allows a person injured by another person\u2019s tortious conduct to recover more than the actual amount she paid or for which she incurred liability for past medical care and expenses. In my opinion, sums beyond that actually expended are not damages. Fundamental principles of compensatory damages in tort actions compel the conclusion that a plaintiff may recover no more than her actual loss. Additionally, the collateral source rule is a rule of evidence that prevents a jury from knowing that the plaintiff has received payment from a source not associated with the tortfeasor; it therefore has no relevance in establishing the appropriate measure for determining the reasonableness of damages. The Court fails to observe this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b628 In these proceedings, which do not include a claim for future medical expenses, there is no question about the appropriate measure of recovery: the Estate is entitled to recover the reasonable value of medical care and services reasonably required and attributable to the tort. \u201cDamages must in all cases be reasonable, and where an obligation of any kind appears to create a right to unconscionable and grossly oppressive damages contrary to substantial justice, no more than reasonable damages can be recovered.\u201d Section 27-1-302, MCA. Accordingly, a plaintiff may recover as economic damages <em>no more </em>than the reasonable value of the medical services received. The focus on \u201creasonable value\u201d in \u00a7 27-1-302, MCA, is therefore a <em>limitation </em>on recovery, not an expansion of recovery beyond a plaintiffs actual loss or liability. The question here involves the application of that measure; that is, whether the \u201creasonable value\u201d measure of damages means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that a plaintiff may recover sums beyond that actually expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b629 In tort actions, damages are normally awarded for the purpose of compensating the plaintiff for the injury suffered, restoring her as nearly as possible to her former position or giving her some pecuniary equivalent. In Montana, compensatory damages are awarded to \u201credress the concrete loss that a plaintiff has suffered by reason of a defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct.\u201d <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 148, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. The law of torts \u201cworks to ensure that an award of damages restores an injured party as near as possible to the party\u2019s pre-tort position \u2014 no better, no worse.\u201d <em>Lampi v. Speed, </em>2011 MT 231, \u00b6 21, 362 Mont. 122, 261 P.3d 1000 (citing <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 32, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079). We stated in <em>Sunburst </em>that an \u201c \u2018injured party is to be made as nearly whole as possible \u2014 but not to realize a profit. Compensatory damages are designed to compensate the injured party for actual loss or injury \u2014 no more, no less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>Burk Ranches v. State, </em>242 Mont. 300, 307, 790 P.2d 443, 447 (1990)). Therefore, damages in a tort action \u201cattempt!] primarily to put an injured person in a position as nearly as possible equivalent to his position prior to the tort.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 901 cmt. a (1979). Moreover, in \u201cdetermining the measure of compensation, indemnify or restitution, the law of torts ordinarily does not measure its recovery as do the rules based upon unjust enrichment, on the benefit received by the defendant. This first purpose of tort law leads to compensatoiy damages.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 901 cmt. a.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b630 Section 911 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides guidance for the measure of \u201creasonable value.\u201d While the measure of recovery for the costs of services rendered by a third party is ordinarily the reasonable value of those services, \u201c[i]f... the injured person paid less than the exchange rate, he can recover no more than the amount paid, except when the low rate was intended as a gift to him.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 911 cmt. h. Section 911 articulates a rule, applicable to recovery of tort damages generally, which establishes that the \u201creasonable value\u201d of services rendered is the exchange rate, and if a person has paid less, she can recover no more than the amount paid. Thus, a personal injury plaintiff may recover <em>the lesser </em>of (1) the amount paid or incurred for medical services, or (2) the reasonable value of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b631 This rule is likewise consistent with our statutes which allow compensation for the \u201cdetriment\u201d proximately caused by the tortious conduct. Section 27-1-317, MCA, provides for recovery of damages measured by \u201cthe amount which will compensate for all the detriment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>proximately caused\u201d by the tort. \u201cDetriment\u201d is defined as \u201ca <em>loss or harm </em>suffered in person or property.\u201d Section 27-1-201, MCA (emphasis added). The right to recover compensatory damages is defined by the \u201cdetriment\u201d that a person suffers. Section 27-1-202, MCA. While the measure of damages for pain and suffering, emotional disturbances, and even future medical expenses necessarily must be left to the discretion of the jury, the measure of damages for past medical expenses must be the amount that was expended for the service, limited only by what was reasonably attributable to the tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b632 <em>Newbury, Conway, </em>and <em>Harris </em>also establish that the reasonable value of medical expenses is limited to what was actually incurred. In <em>Newbury, </em>we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">while it was reasonable for Newbury to expect that his State Farm policies would pay his medical expenses (up to the policy limits of $10,000.00) once the State Fund had paid all it was required to pay, it was not reasonable for Newbury to expect to receive funds in excess of his medical expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 38. This Court, in <em>Newbury, </em>recognized that medical payments benefits are payable only for medical expenses, and when a plaintiff received fiill payment of his medical expenses and owed nothing more to his healthcare providers, a windfall would result if the plaintiff were to receive additional money in excess of his total medical expenses. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39,47. In <em>Conway, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">Here, the record shows that Benefis accepted Kemper\u2019s payment of $1,866.29 as payment in fiill for the actual cost of Conway\u2019s medical treatment that resulted from the accident. Conway does not owe Benefis any remaining amount. Even though all of Conway\u2019s medical expenses have been paid, he still seeks to pocket $1,203.55 in medical payments coverage benefits, representing the difference between Kemper\u2019s payment to Benefis and the TRICARE reimbursement rate. We disagree. Conway is no more entitled to pocket excess medical payments here than he would be under the circumstances in <em>Newbury, </em>or any other situation in which all of his medical expenses are paid by his insurer under its medical payments coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\"><em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b633 We again explained in <em>Harris </em>that an injured party was not entitled to receive the difference in payment between the actual cost of medical treatment and the amount that the physician billed. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. I concurred in <em>Harris, </em>noting that the plaintiffs had not suffered any \u201cdetriment or legally cognizable damages necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>support their claim.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 36 (McKinnon, J., concurring). Accordingly, it is my opinion that the decision reached today by the Court is inconsistent, indeed irreconcilable, with the foregoing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\u00b634 In these proceedings, Judy Meek did not incur liability for her providers\u2019 full bills because at the time the charges were incurred, her providers had already agreed to accept a certain amount from both Medicare and Blue Cross/Blue Shield in exchange for their services. Having never incurred the full bill, the Estate cannot recover it in damages for economic loss. As a result of paying her premiums, Judy Meek obtained the benefit of medical services at a reduced rate. She would have paid these premiums and received the benefit of reduced rates regardless of any tortious conduct. Therefore, there is no need to determine the reasonable value of the services where, as here, the exact amount of expenses has been established by contract and has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b635 Finally, the Court fails to appreciate the distinction between an evidentiary rule and an appropriate measure of reasonable value. The collateral source rule is a rule of evidence which prevents admission of evidence showing that the plaintiffhas received payments from sources independent of the tortfeasor. The rule is premised upon the idea that there is minimal probative value in considering the actions of an unrelated third party when assessing the conduct of the tortfeasor and determining compensatoiy damages. In contrast, it would be <em>very </em>prejudicial to the plaintiff if a jury were to learn that the plaintiffhas already been compensated. The collateral source rule also has a substantive aspect apart from its evidentiary basis. Based upon numerous policy considerations, the collateral source rule serves to protect payments conferred on the injured party from other sources unconnected to the tortfeasor from being credited against the tortfeasor\u2019s liability. Despite the Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, Opinion, \u00b6 18, a district court can apply a correct measure for reasonable value \u2014 the exchange rate \u2014 while still adhering to the collateral source rule that prevents the jury from knowing that the plaintiffhas been otherwise compensated. A jury does not need to hear the source of the payment, or that a bill has been satisfied; all a jury need hear is the amount of the plaintiffs past expense. The rule enunciated by the Court today would prove much more problematic for a district court to navigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b636 Accordingly, I do not agree that medical bills, other than the amount actually paid and received, are \u201crelevant evidence of issues such as the nature and severity of the injuries, and of medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>procedures and treatments that were required.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14. These issues may be established through the testimony of treating physicians and health care providers and not by the admission of bills for amounts over and above what was received and accepted by Judy Meek\u2019s medical providers. The desire to present higher bills in order to gain a larger recovery for other types of damages should not override fundamental principles of compensatory damages, our precedent, and Montana\u2019s statutes. The evidence is simply not admissible for such a purpose and is not relevant, absent a claim for future medical expenses. Here, the amounts disallowed will not assist in developing a foundation for a life care plan or possible future medical procedures and needs. <em>See Willirik v.
