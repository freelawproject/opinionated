We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">2. <em>Did the District Court err by refusing to hold a hearing prior to issuing its order?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by deciding that it lacked jurisdiction, over the parenting and custody issues?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b63 Matthew and Michelle Sampley were married on Januaiy 23, 2010, in Alberta, Canada. In October 2010, they moved to Alaska, where their son, Cael, was bom in 2011. Michelle and Matthew moved to Washington in October 2011 and then to Billings, Montana during the end of September 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b64 In October 2013, Michelle and Cael travelled to British Columbia, Canada to stay with Michelle\u2019s parents. They were scheduled to return to Montana on November 1, 2013. After Michelle\u2019s father was diagnosed with cancer, Michelle and Cael extended their stay until the end of December 2013. Matthew visited Michelle and Cael in Canada for five days in November and for ten days in December. During Matthew\u2019s December visit, Michelle told Matthew that she and Cael would stay in Canada through March 2014. In February 2014, Michelle travelled to Billings to retrieve her and Gael\u2019s personal belongings. She removed these items without Matthew\u2019s knowledge and returned to Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b65 Matthew filed a petition for dissolution with the Yellowstone County District Court on May 29,2014. Matthew\u2019s petition, in addition to requesting dissolution of his marriage with Michelle, asked the District Court to resolve matters of Cael\u2019s parenting and custody. Michelle responded to Matthew\u2019s petition on July 16, 2014, filing a response and moving to dismiss all matters related to parenting and custody. In a brief in support of her motion, Michelle argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over parenting and custody matters. On August 14,2014, after Matthew filed a response brief and Michelle filed a reply, the District Court granted Michelle\u2019s motion. It decided that Montana was not Cael\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 40-7-201, MCA, and that it lacked jurisdiction over parenting and custody matters for this reason. Matthew appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b66 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes. <em>In re </em>Myrland, 2010 MT 286, \u00b6 11, 359 Mont. 1, 248 P.3d 290. We review decisions left to the discretion of a district court for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Guardianship of H.O., </em>2014 MT 285, \u00b6 7, 376 Mont. 519, 337 P.3d 91. A district court\u2019s determination of whether it lacks subject matter jurisdiction is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of Buck, </em>2014 MT 344, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u00b6 12, 377 Mont. 393, 340 P.3d 546. Our review of whether a party was afforded due process is plenary. <em>In re Marriage of Cini, </em>2011 MT 295, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 1, 266 P.3d 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b67 2. <em>Did the District Court err by refusing to hold a hearing prior to issuing its order?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b68 Matthew argues that he was deprived of the opportunity for a hearing in violation of Montana statute and due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">\u00b69  The District Court was not required to hold a hearing before dismissing the matter for lack of jurisdiction. Whether to hold a hearing is a matter left to the discretion of the district court, according to Mont. Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 2(c). Where there is no dispute of material fact, we have allowed district courts to resolve M. R. Civ. P. 12(b) motions without a hearing. <em>General Constructors, Inc. v. Chewculator, Inc., </em>2001 MT 54, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40, 304 Mont. 319, 21 P.3d 604, <em>overruled on other grounds by In re Estate of Big Spring, </em>2011 MT 109, \u00b6 45, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121; <em>cf. Richards v. Cnty. of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 453, \u00b6 26, 354 Mont. 334, 223 P.3d 878 (holding that a hearing was not necessary on a motion for summary judgment because it \u201cwould not have added anything to the proceedings.\u201d). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in this case because there was ample evidence, based on the affidavits and other filings of the parties, upon which it could base its subject matter jurisdiction decision, and because there was no dispute between the parties concerning any material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"AAH\">\u00b610 Despite Matthew\u2019s contention otherwise, M. R. Civ. P. 12(i) does not require a different conclusion. M. R. Civ. P. 12(i) states that \u201c[i]f a party so moves, any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(l)-(7)... must be heard and decided before trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial.\u201d Matthew takes this to mean that an oral hearing is required before resolution of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, if either party requests a hearing. This is incorrect. M. R. Civ. P. 12(i) does not require a court to hold an oral hearing before resolving an M. R. Civ. P. 12(b) motion, regardless of whether a party requests it.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b611 M. R. Civ. P. 12(i) controls the schedule of a proceeding. It controls the order in which a district court must resolve the issues presented to it. It requires, upon the motion of a party, resolution of certain matters before a trial on the merits. <em>See </em>2 James WM. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 12.50, at 12-145 (3d ed. 2015) (discussing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(i), which is identical to M. R. Civ. P. 12(i)); 5C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1373, at 278-90 (3d ed. 2010) (discussing the former Fed. R. Civ. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>12(d), which is substantially similar to M. R. Civ. P. 12(i)). However, it does not require a district court to conduct an oral hearing before resolving such preliminary matters. Although it requires a court to \u201chear\u201d the preliminary matter before trial, it does not require an oral \u201chearing.\u201d Based on Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 2(c), a district court may, in its discretion, \u201chear\u201d the matter based upon affidavits and other filings of the parties alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b612 This conclusion comports with our treatment of the virtually identical predecessor to M. R. Civ. P. 12(i), which was codified prior to 2011 at M. R. Civ. P. 12(d). It also comports with other courts\u2019 treatment of the identical federal rules, upon which M. R. Civ. P. 12(i) and the former M. R. Civ. P. 12(d) were based. Committee Notes to M. R. Civ. P. 12, at 1232-33 (2014 Annotations); Compiler\u2019s Comments to M. R. Civ. P. 12(e), at 686 (2010Annotations). In <em>General Constructors, Inc., </em>we held that a district court did not err by dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction without a preliminary hearing. <em>General Constructors, Inc., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-40. Interpreting the former M. R. Civ. P. 12(d), we reasoned that there were no \u201cmaterial jurisdictional facts\u201d in dispute and that \u201ceven if a court presumed all allegations made by [the plaintiff] were true, a Montana court could not assume subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>General Constructors, Inc., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Similarly, interpreting F. R. Civ. P. 12(i), federal courts have decided that Rule 12(b) motions can be resolved on the basis of affidavits and other documentary matter and that, regardless of whether it is requested by a party, oral testimony is only required in particular circumstances, such as where there are disputed questions of fact or where the decision may turn on issues of credibility. <em>E.g., Dorchester Fin. Sec., Inc. v. Banco BRJ, S.A., </em>722 F.3d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that courts may decide a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction on the basis of affidavits alone or may conduct an evidentiary hearing); <em>Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista, </em>254 F.3d 358,362-65 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that courts have broad authority to hold evidentiary hearings but are not required to in order to determine their own jurisdiction); <em>see </em>Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.50, at 12-146; Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1373, at 288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b613  Whether to hold a hearing on Michelle\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion was a matter of discretion for the District Court. The material jurisdictional facts in this case were presented in affidavits and the pleadings, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b6 14  Furthermore, the District Court did not fail to afford Matthew due process by refusing to hold a hearing. As Matthew correctly notes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of his or her child is a constitutionally protected liberty interest. <em>A.W.S. v. A.W., </em>2014 MT 322, \u00b6 16, 377 Mont. 234, 339 P.3d 414; <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2060 (2000). He also correctly notes that due process requires notice and the opportunity to be heard before governmental deprivation of such a liberty interest. <em>Steab v. Luna, </em>2010 MT 125, \u00b6 22, 356 Mont. 372, 233 P.3d 351. However, even if we assume that the District Court failed to provide Matthew with the opportunity to be heard by not holding a hearing, Matthew was not deprived of due process. The District Court made no decision affecting Matthew\u2019s right to the care and custody of his child. Matthew has not been deprived of any liberty interest. Indeed, the District Court specifically decided that it did not have the power to decide any matters related to Matthew\u2019s custody of Cael. The District Court\u2019s decision will not foreclose Matthew from pursuing matters related to the custody of Cael in a court that can properly exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267 (a judgment has preclusive effect only as to the claims a parly has had the opportunity to litigate). Matthew has not been deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b615 <em>2. Did the District Court err by deciding that it lacked jurisdiction over the parenting and custody issues?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b616 Both parties agree that, pursuant to the Montana Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Montana courts can only exercise jurisdiction over parenting and custody issues if Montana is the \u201chome state\u201d of the child whose parenting and custody is at issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-7-101 and -201, MCA; <em>Stephens v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2006 MT 21, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 40, 128 P.3d 1026. They also agree that Montana is a child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d only if that child has at some point \u201clived in\u201d Montana for at least six months. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-7-103(7), MCA; <em>Stephens, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13,16. While Matthew acknowledges that Cael has not ever been present in Montana for a six-month period, he argues that Cael has \u201clived in\u201d Montana such that Montana courts can exercise jurisdiction. Citing \u00a7 40-7-103(7), MCA, he contends that for the purposes of the UCCJEA, time \u201clived in\u201d Montana includes periods of \u201ctemporary absence\u201d from the State. He argues that Cael was present in Montana during September 2013 and then was \u201ctemporarily absent\u201d from October 2013 through at least March 2014. For this reason, he argues that Cael \u201clived in\u201d Montana for over six months and that the District Court erred when it decided that Montana is not Gael\u2019s home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b617 Michelle responds that this Court cannot consider whether Cael\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>absence was temporary since this argument was raised for the first time on appeal. In the alternative, she argues that Cael\u2019s absence was not temporary and that the District Court was correct to decide that Montana is not Cael\u2019s home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b618 We are able to consider Matthew\u2019s argument that Cael\u2019s absence from Montana was \u201ctemporary.\u201d Although it is well settled that we will not consider new arguments or legal theories raised for the first time on appeal, <em>In re the Parenting of N.S., </em>2011 MT 98, \u00b6 36, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863, Matthew\u2019s argument that Cael\u2019s absence was a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d is not a new argument or theory. While neither party used the term \u201ctemporary absence,\u201d this issue was disputed before the District Court. The parties discussed the length and character of Cael\u2019s trip to Canada, Michelle\u2019s intention in taking him to Canada, and the trip\u2019s effect on Gael\u2019s connection to Montana. Michelle argued that the absence meant that Cael did not live in Montana for an amount of time sufficient for Montana to exercise jurisdiction over parenting and custody matters, while Matthew argued otherwise. While not labeled as such, these arguments were about whether or not Cael\u2019s absence was \u201ctemporary.\u201d Thus, Matthew\u2019s argument is not new on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b619 Nevertheless, we agreewith Michelle\u2019s argument that the District Court was correct when it determined that Montana lacks jurisdiction over matters relating to Cael\u2019s parenting and custody. We agree with Matthew that a period of \u201ctemporary absence\u201d is included in the time \u201clived in\u201d Montana for the purposes of determining whether Montana is a child\u2019s home state. Section 40-7-103(7), MCA. However, we do not agree that Cael \u201clived in\u201d Montana for six months, even if we include the amount of time Cael was temporarily absent from the State. More specifically, we hold that Cael\u2019s absence was temporary through February 2014 at the latest. Since Cael moved to Montana for the first time in late September 2013, this means that there was no six-month period of time that Cael \u201clived in\u201d Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b620 This decision turns on whether Cael\u2019s absence from Montana was \u201ctemporary\u201d and, if so, how long the absence remained temporary. However, we have not yet considered what exactly constitutes a temporary absence and what distinguishes a temporary absence from an absence that will not be included as time a child lived in Montana for the purposes of \u00a7 40-7-103(7), MCA. The UCCJEA does not define the term, and the plain language of the UCCJEA provides limited help in determining what constitutes a \u201ctemporary absence.\u201d The metes and bounds of the term are not clear on the face of \u00a7 40-7-103(7), MCA, nor does the statute specify what factors courts should consider when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>determining whether an absence from Montana is temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b621 When applying a statute and when presented with such statutory ambiguiiy, this Court looks beyond the bare statutory language and attempts to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>In re K.M.G., </em>2010 MT 81, \u00b6 26, 356 Mont. 91, 229 P.3d 1227. We consider legislative history in such cases, and when considering uniform laws, such as the UCCJEA, we also consider the derisions of other jurisdictions that have interpreted the same statutory language. <em>E.g., Stoican v. Wagner (In re Estate of Lawlor), </em>2015 MT 54, \u00b6 23, 378 Mont. 281, 343 P.3d 577; <em>see Buck, </em>\u00b6 21. Both sources are helpful here.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b622 Forty-nine states have adopted the UCCJEA, and several courts have considered what constitutes a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d for the purposes of determining a child\u2019s home state. Despite the UCCJEA\u2019s purpose of uniform state treatment of child custody jurisdiction issues, these jurisdictions\u2019 treatment of the term has been far from uniform. <em>See, e.g., Norris v. Norris, </em>No. S-15439, 345 P.3d 924, 2015Alas. LEXIS 29, 12 n.22 (Alaska Mar. 27, 2015); <em>S.M. v. A.S., </em>938 S.W.2d 910, 917-18 (Ct. App. Mo. 1997). Instead, three primary approaches have developed. Some courts have considered only the duration of an absence in determining whether the absence is temporary. <em>E.g., In re Marriage of Schoeffel, </em>644 N.E.2d 827, 829 (Ill. App. Ct. 4th Dist. 1994). Others have considered the intention of a child\u2019s parent, parents, or other caregivers. <em>E.g., Ogawa v. Ogawa, </em>221 P.3d 699, 704 (Nev. 2009) (absence was temporary because parents intended it to be a three-month vacation). Still others have adopted a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, considering factors like the parties\u2019 living arrangement, the location of the child\u2019s doctor, receipt of public benefits, and frequency of relocation, in addition to duration and intention. <em>E.g. Norris, </em>2015 Alas. LEXIS 29, 12-15; <em>In re A.W., </em>94 A.3d 1161, 1167-68 (Vt. 2014); <em>Carter v. Carter, </em>758 N.W.2d 1, 8-9 (Neb. 2008); <em>Chick v. Chick, </em>596 S.E.2d 303, 308 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004). We are not particularly persuaded by the reasoning of these courts to adopt any of these approaches. The decisions we have reviewed provide little rationale for why any particular approach best gives effect to legislatures\u2019 intents in adopting the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b623 However, the legislative history of Montana\u2019s UCCJEA provides support for a totality of the circumstances approach in at least some instances. In 1977, Montana adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA). Ch. 537, L. 1977; <em>In re Marriage of Stoneman, </em>2003 MT 25, \u00b6 12, 314 Mont. 139, 64 P.3d 997. Prior to the Act\u2019s enactment by all 50 states, states\u2019 disparate and conflicting exercise of jurisdiction over child custody matters encouraged forum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>shopping, self-help, and re-litigation of custody matters in never ending disputes. UCCJA Prefatory Note, 9 U.L.A. 261, 263-65 (1999). The purpose of the UCCJA was to eliminate such problems by establishing uniform criteria for states\u2019 exercise of jurisdiction over child custody matters. Section 40-8-102, MCA (1995); UCCJA \u00a7 1, 9 U.L.A. at 271; <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 12. The drafters of the UCCJA adopted what was meant to be a bright-line rule: a state could exercise jurisdiction over a custody matter if it was the child\u2019s \u201chome state.\u201d Section 40-7-201, MCA; UCCJA \u00a7 3 Comment, 9 U.L.A. at 308-09. The drafters stated that the six-month requirement for establishing a home state was based on a \u201creasonable assumption of fact.\u201d Specifically, that \u201c[m]ost American children are integrated into an American community after living there six months\u201d and, consequently, that this period \u201cseem[s] to provide a reasonable criterion for identifying the established home.\u201d UCCJA \u00a7 3 Comment, 9 U.L.A. at 308 (quoting Leonard G. Ratner, <em>Child Custody in a Federal System, </em>62 Mich. L. Rev. 795,818 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"ALL\">\u00b624 Following revision of the UCCJA and the resulting creation of the UCCJEA, Montana adopted the UCCJEA. Ch. 91, L. <em>1999; Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 14. The drafters of the UCCJEA recognized that inconsistencies among state interpretation and enforcement of the UCCJA had hindered the purposes of the UCCJA. They made revisions to the uniform law to help further the UCCJA\u2019s goals. UCCJEA Prefatory Note, 9 U.L.A. 649,650-54 (1999). The definition of \u201chome state\u201d was left substantially unchanged between the UCCJA and UCCJEA. UCCJEA \u00a7 201 Comment, 9 U.L.A. at 671-72; <em>compare </em>\u00a7 40-7-103(7), MCA, <em>with </em>\u00a7 40-7-103(5), MCA (1997). Thus, it is reasonable to impute the comments and purposes behind the definition in the UCCJA to the UCCJEA\u2019s definition. This is especially true since Montana did not repeal the UCCJA definition and then enact the language of the UCCJEA, but instead amended the language of the UCCJA. <em>See </em>Sec. 1-14, Ch. 91, L. 1999. The language and legislative history of that amendment do not seem to express an intent to alter the purpose or meaning of the \u201chome state\u201d requirement. <em>See </em>Sec. 4. Ch. 91, L. 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"ADO\">\u00b625  Thus, the Montana Legislature\u2019s intent in adopting the UCCJA and UCCJEA definition of \u201chome state\u201d was to create a bright-line rule based on the assumptions that a state is the established home of a child after the child is integrated into a community of the state and that such integration usually occurs after six months of living in a community. In light of this intent, adopting a definition of \u201ctemporary absence\u201d that would render these assumptions unreasonable would defeat the Legislature\u2019s purpose for adopting its definition of \u201chome state.\u201d We, therefore, conclude that an absence is not temporary if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>character of the absence would make it unreasonable to assume that a child would integrate into a community of Montana dining the portions of the six-month period when the child is not absent from the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b626 A totality of the circumstance approach makes the most sense for determining whether an absence renders the integration assumption unreasonable. We cannot say that a single factor will be dispositive to this determination in all cases; neither the intentions and expectations of the parents nor the duration of the absence will control every situation. Instead, the continued reasonableness of the integration assumption in light of an absence is best considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b627 While such a standard is somewhat more subjective than the bright-line, six-month rule imposed by the legislature; and while such subjectivity interferes with the UCCJEA\u2019s goal of uniform application of child custody jurisdiction laws between states; requiring temporary absences to be measured against the purposes and underlying assumptions of the intended bright-line rule in an objective test seems to provide a rule that is as precise as possible. At tibe very least, we think that providing such a standard will better promote uniform treatment of child custody jurisdiction than the similar standardless tests of other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b628  In this case, the District Court did not err when it decided that Montana is not Gael\u2019s home state. Cael did not \u201clive in\u201d Montana for six months because he was present in Montana for one month at most and his \u201ctemporary\u201d absence lasted at most another four months. Michelle and Cael moved to Billings at the end of September 2013. They remained there for somewhere between four days and a month, depending on whether Michelle or Matthew is to be believed. Cael has not returned to Billings or Montana since. If this absence from Montana was ever \u201ctemporary\u201d it ceased being \u201ctemporary\u201d in February 2014, at the latest. Cael has been absent from Montana since leaving in September 2013, and there is no evidence that the parties have attempted to make a home for Cael in Montana. Indeed, all of Cael\u2019s possessions were removed from Montana during February 2014. Moreover, by Matthew\u2019s admission, Michelle informed Matthew during February 2014 that she no longer intended to return with Cael to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Billings. Thus, as of February 2014, Michelle and Cael had lived in Billings for a month or less, were living in Canada, had moved all of their possessions to Canada, and had no intention to return to Billings. It is unreasonable to assume that most children would integrate into the Billings community despite the circumstances accruing in the present case as of February 2014. Based on its characteristics, therefore, CaeFs absence was not temporary as of February 2014 at the latest. Combining his periods of physical presence in and temporary absence from Montana, Cael \u201clived in\u201d Montana for the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 40-7-103(7) and -201, MCA, from the end of September 2013 through February 2014 at the latest. Gael, therefore, \u201clived in\u201d Montana for no more than five months. This is short of the six months required for Montana to exercise jurisdiction. Section 40-7-201, MCA. For this reason, the District Court did not err when it decided that CaeFs home state \u201cmay very well be Washington, may very well be Canada, but ... is not Montana under the factual circumstances.\u201d Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b629 The District Court did not err by resolving Michelle\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion before holding a hearing, despite Matthew\u2019s request for a hearing. The District Court also did not err when it determined thatit lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the child custody matters in this case. We affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the matters related to CaeFs custody.</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> We do not decide whether the contrapositive is true. As the stated conclusion is sufficient to resolve the present appeal, we need not consider whether all absences that do not render the integration assumption unreasonable are necessarily \u201ctemporary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
