We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issue: <em>Did the District Court err when it dismissed MAAS\u2019s petition as moot ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">\u00b63 On December 31,2009, we issued our opinion in <em>Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211. We held \u201cthat under \u00a7 45-2-211, MCA, a terminally ill patient\u2019s consent to physician aid in dying constitutes a statutory defense to a charge of homicide against the aiding physician when no other consent exceptions <em>applyBaxter, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00b64 The Board of Medical Examiners (Board) is the occupation and licensing board for healthcare professionals within the Montana Department of Labor and Industry. At the request of two medical doctors, the Board drafted a \u201cposition statement\u201d explaining the effect of our decision in <em>Baxter </em>on its discipline policy for physicians participating in \u201caid-in-dying.\u201d On January 12, 2012, a committee of the Board gave notice to interested persons of a final position statement draft. The Board adopted an amended version of that draft on January 20, 2012, and it posted the final version, which it titled \u201cPosition Statement No. 20\u201d (Position Statement), on its website.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">\u00b65 MAAS is a Montana nonprofit public benefit corporation. Its core purpose is to oppose assisted suicide and euthanasia. On March 12, 2012, MAAS asked the Board to vacate the Position Statement and to remove it from the Board\u2019s website. The Board revised the Position Statement on March 16, 2012, but if did not comply with MAAS\u2019s request. MAAS repeated its request on July 6,2012. The request was again unsuccessful, and on September 27,2012, MAAS filed a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>with the Board. In the petition, MAAS sought a declaratory ruling that the Position Statement was invalid. On November 16,2012, the Board held a hearing on the petition. It denied the petition shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b66 On December 17,2012, MAAS filed a petition in the District Court for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. MAAS claimed that the Board exceeded its authority by adopting the Position Statement. It asked the District Court for declaratory judgment to that effect and for an order requiring the Board to vacate the Position Statement. On September 20,2013, while this matter was pending before the District Court, the Board adopted a motion to rescind all of its position statements, including Position Statement No. 20, and it removed the statements from its website. The Board then filed a motion in the District Court asking the court to dismiss the case. The Board argued that once it rescinded the Position Statement the case was rendered moot. The District Court agreed, and dismissed MAAS\u2019s petition on December 13,2013. MAAS appeals this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b67 Mootness, as an issue of justiciability, presents a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 20, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err when it dismissed MAAS\u2019s petition as moot?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b69 MAAS argues that its case was not rendered moot when the Board withdrew the Position Statement, and, regardless, that the case should be allowed to go forward based on exceptions to our mootness rules. In response, the Board argues that the case has been rendered moot and that any decision on the merits of the case would result in an unacceptable advisory opinion. It argues that the District Court was correct to dismiss the case for this reason. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b610 The judicial power of Montana courts \u201cis limited to justiciable controversies.\u201d <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. For this reasons, justiciability is a threshold issue. <em>Clark v. Roosevelt </em>Cnty., 2007 MT 44, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 118, 154 P.3d 48. A justiciable controversy is \u201cone upon which a court\u2019s judgment will effectively operate, as distinguished from a dispute invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion.\u201d <em>Plan Helena, Inc., </em>\u00b6 8 (quoting <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11) (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirement serves to prevent Montana courts from rendering advisory opinions, which we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>consistently held exceed the authority of Montana courts. <em>See Plan Helena, Inc., </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b611 Mootness is a category of justiciability. <em>Plan Helena, Inc., </em>\u00b6 8. We have often described mootness as the \u201cdoctrine of standing set in a time frame,\u201d stating that \u201c[t]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\u201d <em>E.g., Greater Missoula Area Fed\u2019n of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881; <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 31, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864. A matter is moot when \u201ca court\u2019s judgment will not effectively operate to grant relief.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201cThe fundamental question to be answered in any review of possible mootness is \u2018whether it is possible to grant some form of effective relief to the appellant.\u2019\u201d <em>Briese v. Mont. Pub. Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>2012 MT 192, \u00b6 14, 366 Mont. 148, 285 P.3d 550 (quotingProgressioe <em>Direct Ins. Co. v. Stuivenga, </em>2012 MT 75, \u00b6 37, 364 Mont. 390, 276 P.3d 867).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b612 The matter MAAS presented to the District Court was the validity of the Position Statement. MAAS claimed that the Position Statement was a rule promulgated in violation of the Board\u2019s authority, and MAAS asked the District Court to declare the rule invalid, to order the Board to vacate the Position Statement, and to order the Board to remove the statement from its website. By rescinding the Position Statement and removing it from the Board\u2019s website, the Board effectively granted MAAS the relief it sought, and it left the District Court with no effective relief to grant, rendering the matter moot. In <em>Clark, </em>we held that the case was moot after a government entity returned the property that the plaintiff claimed was illegally seized. We reasoned that \u201ca judgment by this Court regarding the issue raised on appeal \u2014 i.e., whether the District Court erred in determining that probable cause existed for the seizure ... \u2014 would have no practical impact on the matter of [the petitioner\u2019s] entitlement to have her property returned.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 12. Similarly, any judgment the District Court could have rendered in the present case would not have had any practical impact on the continued validity of the Position Statement after the Board rescinded the Position Statement. The Board would not have been required to take any additional remedial measures in the face of any judgment, since it had already rescinded the Position Statement and removed the Position Statement from its website. For these reasons, no judgment of the District Court would have effectively operated to grant relief and the matter was moot. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b613  We do not agree with MAAS\u2019s argument that reconsidering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and overruling our decision in <em>Baxter </em>would provide effective relief in this case. MAAS argues that the Position Statement was an interpretation of our decision in <em>Baxter, </em>and that overruling <em>Baxter </em>would be an effective remedy. But, our continued adherence to <em>Baxter </em>is not the issue in this case, nor would overturning that case grant relief \u2014 effective or otherwise \u2014 to the parties. To begin with, overruling our precedent is not an action other Montana courts can make. <em>See State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, \u00b6 14,309 Mont. 63, 50 P.3d 121. The District Court, therefore, could not have granted relief by overruling <em>Baxter. </em>More importantly, overruling precedent is a collateral result of a decision on the merits of a subsequent case. It is merely a potential consequence of our analysis when considering whether to grant relief. Overruling precedent is not relief in and of itself. To hold otherwise would allow parties to seek, as MAAS does now, opinions concerning the meaning of our decisions by presenting little more than hypothetical grievances or conceptual disagreement with a holding of this Court. Opinions rendered in such cases would be advisory opinions, which are beyond the power of this Court to render. <em>Plan </em>Helena&gt; <em>Inc., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11. As we do not reconsider our prior decisions outside of the context of a controversy and \u201clive\u201d request for relief, MAAS\u2019s argument that overrulingBaafer would provide effective relief is incorrect for the same reasons as discussed above. <em>Plan Helena, Inc., </em>\u00b6 10. Namely, the Position Statement has already been rescinded, no judgment of the District Court could grant effective relief, and there is no longer a \u201clive\u201d request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\">\u00b614 MAAS argues that, in spite of the foregoing, we should allow its case to proceed for either of two reasons. First, MAAS argues that we have considered otherwise moot matters where the issues are of special importance to the public interest. MAAS contends that \u201cthe issues regarding <em>Baxter ... </em>have important implications for the public interest,\u201d and that we should let this case proceed and render an opinion on the meaning of that case. As discussed above, such an opinion would be advisory. It would be an opinion on the merits of a decision without the benefit of concrete facts or adversarial development of arguments. We will not render such an advisory opinion. <em>Plan Helena, Inc., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11. We have never held that any exception to mootness will allow us to reconsider in the abstract a decision of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b6 15 Second, MAAS argues that the Board, despite voluntarily ceasing the action alleged to be wrongful in this case, may freely repeat the action in the absence of a judgment. It argues that we should allow the case to proceed for this reason. We have, as MAAS notes, recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that cases may proceed where they would otherwise have been rendered moot by a defendant\u2019s voluntary cessation of the challenged action. <em>E.g., Havre Daily News, LLC, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-40. We have stated that courts may \u201crule on non-extant controversies in order to provide guidance concerning the legality of expected future conduct.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, LLC, </em>\u00b6 38. We have, however, allowed courts to do so only in the limited circumstances where the defendant has voluntarily ceased the alleged wrong; where it is \u201creasonable to expect the \u2018same wrong\u2019 to recur, such that a ruling on the merits would be of ... discernible future benefit to the litigants or the interests of judicial economy\u201d; and where the reasonableness of such recurrence is supported by evidence, rather than speculation or allegation alone. <em>Havre Daily News, LLC, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b616 In this case, there is no evidence indicating that it is reasonable to expect the same wrong to occur. The alleged wrong in this case was the Board\u2019s interpretation of an opinion of this Court in a document the Board promulgated in excess of its authority. <em>See Havre Daily News, LLC, </em>\u00b6 38 n.9 (stating that a wrong is the same only if it presents a \u201csubstantially identical constellation of facts\u201d). There is no indication that the Board will repeat such behavior in the future. MAAS has not provided any evidence that the Board has repeatedly issued rules interpreting decisions of this Court or that it otherwise regularly exceeds its authority. MAAS does not allege any other past instances of improper rulemaking and it does not point to any reasons that the Board would continue to promulgate rules in excess of its authority. Meanwhile, the Board has rescinded all of its position statements, and there is no indication that the Board will continue to issue position statements of any kind or undertake to interpret <em>Baxter. </em>Faced with such a lack of \u201cconcrete evidence suggesting that [the defendant] will perpetrate a substantially similar wrong,\u201d we have refused to apply the voluntary cessation exception to mootness, <em>Havre Daily News, LLC, </em>\u00b6 40, and we refuse to apply the exception today.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b6 17  For the foregoing reasons, the matter before the District Court was rendered moot when the Board rescinded the Position Statement. The District Court was correct to dismiss the case. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
