Schowengerdt challenges the denial of his request for the appointment of new counsel and alleges his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated. We remand for further proceedings on a limited issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b62 The parties raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court adequately inquire into Schowengerdt\u2019s complaint that defense counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>2. Did Schowengerdt receive ineffective assistance of counsel?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b63 On December 10, 2012, the State filed an information charging Schowengerdt with one count of deliberate homicide. The State alleged by affidavit that on December 8, 2012, just before midnight, Schowengerdt repeatedly stabbed his wife, Tina Schowengerdt, resulting in her death. The affidavit further stated that, the following morning, Schowengerdt entered the Powell County Law Enforcement Center and provided a frill confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b64 On January 2,2013, Steven Scott (Scott) of the Office of the State Public Defender (OPD) was assigned as counsel for Schowengerdt. On January 17, Scott filed a \u201cNotice of Intention\u201d in which he advised that Schowengerdt intended to plead not guilty and assert the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. However, on April 2, Schowengerdt agreed to plead guilty to deliberate homicide, without the benefit of a plea agreement. In a handwritten statement, Schowengerdt admitted killing his wife: \u201cI knowingly stabbed Tina Schowengerdt with a knife causing her death. This occurred on 12/8/12.\u201d During the ensuing change of plea hearing, Schowengerdt indicated that he was satisfied with the services of his attorney and was voluntarily entering his plea. During the plea colloquy, Schowengerdt stated he did not want to proceed to trial because \u201cI can\u2019t handle it.\u201d Schowengerdt admitted that he stabbed Tina with a knife knowing that it would cause her death. The District Court accepted Schowengerdt\u2019s guiltyplea, and the matter was set for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u00b65 On June 12, Schowengerdt sent a handwritten letter to the District Court, seeking the appointment of new counsel. The letter stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">I am Requesting a Withdraw as My Attorney at this time Mr Steve Scott</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>I AM Requesting For proper Reputation in My case</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8f\">Two days later, Scott filed a motion for withdrawal of Schowengerdt\u2019s guilty plea- In his supporting brief, Scott explained: \u201cMr. Schowengerdt, during a visit with his attorney, Mr. Scott, stated he wants to withdraw his plea of guilty and proceed onto trial in this case. Mr. Schowengerdt indicated he made a mistake when he entered into the plea and now wishes to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial.\u201d Scott further added, \u201cIt is my duty as a licensed attorney in Montana to point out to the Court there is not any case law in Montana to support Mr. Schowengerdt\u2019s position as to the withdraw of plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b66 On June 17, the District Court ordered Scott to submit a memorandum explaining Scott\u2019s position regarding his continued representation of Schowengerdt and the \u201cPublic Defender\u2019s position with respect to providing Schowengerdt with new counsel.\u201d Scott did so, stating that he had \u201cno problem with continuing to represent\u201d Schowengerdt and that he did not believe there had been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, and describing the process by which Schowengerdt could file a complaint with OPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b67 On July 2, the District Court convened a hearing to address Schowengerdt\u2019s letterfor change in representation. The court stated to Schowengerdt that it was unclear from his letter why he did not want Scott to be his attorney, after which the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtN\">[Schowengerdt]: Can I explain it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">[Court]: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">[Schowengerdt]: All right. Early on, back in December, might have been January, but it was early on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">[Court]: Well, Mr. Schowengerdt, let me stop you there. You\u2019re starting to tell a story. I\u2019m going to remind you that you have a right to remain silent. The things you say in court can wind up to be to your prejudice in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">[Schowengerdt]: It seems like I\u2019ve already spoke about everything that\u2019s got me here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Thus, at the point Schowengerdt was going to explain his dissatisfaction with his assigned counsel, the court interrupted him and Schowengerdt was never provided another chance to speak to the issue. Instead of inquiring into Schowengerdt\u2019s objections, the court directed him to follow the OPD\u2019s process for obtaining substitute counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">[Scott]: Dennis, do you want a different attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">[Schowengerdt]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">[Court]: All right. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re driving at, you need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>communicate with the Public Defender\u2019s Office rather than me and tell them why you think you should have a different lawyer, and then they will tell me whether or not they\u2019ll give you one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">[Court]: If they do not give you a different lawyer, then you have \u2014 we\u2019re going to be looking at: Okay, am I going to let Mr. Scott off the hook in this case or not?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b68 On August 27, the District Court conducted a hearing on Schowengerdt\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. At the outset of the hearing, the court inquired whether the issue of Schowengerdt\u2019s representation had been resolved. Scott explained that the OPD had denied Schowengerdt\u2019s request for a new counsel, and that Schowengerdt had not administratively appealed the decision. The court then responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">All right. So the matter is concluded then. The matter has run its course. We had a hearing. We made it apparent to Mr. Schowengerdt what procedure he was to follow. He followed the procedure. A decision was made. It has not been appealed, and Mr. Steven Scott remains Schowengerdt\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">So we\u2019ll proceed, then, to the Defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty on the singular charge of deliberate homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b69 In contrast to its prior statements, the District Court did not inquire further into the basis for Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints concerning his counsel. Moving to argument on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, Scott stated he did not \u201chave anything to add beyond what is in the motion in this matter.\u201d Scott explained: \u201cIt was during a visit with Mr. Schowengerdt that he asked me ... to file a motion to withdraw his plea. He did not have a basis to give to me as to why he felt his plea should be withdrawn... . It was simply that Mr. Schowengerdt changed his mind and would like to be able to withdraw his plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b610 Following Scott\u2019s statement, the court gave Schowengerdt an opportunity to address the withdrawal of his plea. Schowengerdt indicated that he was \u201cnot prepared for this,\u201d and then stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m guilty. I know what the outcome was, but I think I was fighting for my life.\u201d Scott concluded by stating: \u201call I have is that Mr. Schowengerdt has asked me to file the motion to withdraw his guilty plea. I don\u2019t have any case law on my side to support that motion, but we\u2019re just simply asking \u2014 Mr. Schowengerdt is simply asking he be allowed to withdraw his plea and continue to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u00b611 The District Court denied Schowengerdt\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, concluding that the \u201cDefendant has not in any way asserted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>plea of guilty was involuntary and there is no basis in the record to conclude Defendant\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary.\u201d The District Court sentenced Schowengerdt to life in the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b612 Schowengerdt appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a request for substitution of counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>Halley v. State, </em>2008 MT 193, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 37, 186 P.3d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b614 \u201cIneffective assistance of counsel claims raise mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>2011 MT 23, \u00b6 20, 359 Mont. 207, 248 P.3d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b615 <em>1. Did the District Court adequately inquire into Schowengerdt\u2019s complaint that defense counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u00b616 Schowengerdt challenges the adequacy of the District Court\u2019s inquiry into his request for new counsel. He argues that the court failed to inquire into his complaints concerning his representation to determine if they were \u201cseemingly substantial.\u201d The State counters that the District Court conducted an adequate inquiry because Schowengerdt did not appeal the decision of the OPD and Schowengerdt failed to \u201cprovide specific complaints about\u201d his counsel, instead only making \u201cvague statements about wanting proper representation or not thinking that he had been represented properly.\u201d Alternatively, the State argues, citing our decision in <em>State v. Edwards, </em>2011 MT 210, 361 Mont. 478, 260 P.3d 396, that \u201c[e]ven if the district court did not conduct an adequate initial inquiry, that does not require reversal because Schowengerdt did not raise a complaint that communications had broken down or that he feared his counsel would fail to effectively represent him going forward to sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">\u00b617 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. If a defendant asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and requests the appointment of new counsel, the \u201cdistrict court must conduct an \u2018adequate initial inquiry\u2019 to determine whether the defendant\u2019s claim is \u2018seemingly substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Happel, </em>2010 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 357 Mont. 390, 240 P.3d 1016 (citing <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371). We have explained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u201cthreshold issue to determine whether a complaint is substantial is not whether counsel was ineffective, but rather whether the district court made an adequate inquiry into the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Happel, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 30, 318 Mont. 516, 82 P.3d 20). We have found it to be \u201creversible error where a district court fails to make an initial inquiry into a defendant\u2019s complaints about counsel.\u201d <em>City of Billings v. Smith, </em>281 Mont. 133, 137, 932 P.2d 1058, 1061 (1997). The district court\u2019s inquiry is adequate so long as the \u201ccourt considers the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints.\u201d <em>State v. Rose, </em>2009 MT 4, \u00b6 96, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749 <em>{superseded in part on other grounds, State v. Stops, </em>2013 MT 131, 370 Mont. 226, 301 P.3d 811) (citing <em>City of Billings, </em>281 Mont. at 136-37, 932 P.2d at 1060). However, if the district court \u201cfails to conduct \u2018even a cursory inquiry,\u2019 such an effort is inadequate and justifies remand of the case for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Happel, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing State <em>v. Weaver, </em>276 Mont. 505, 511-12, 917 P.2d 437, 441-42 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b618  Here, the District Court erred by failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints. After entering his guilty plea, Schowengerdt sent the June 12 letter to the District Court asking to have his counsel removed from his case. Although the letter was short and Schowengerdt\u2019s writing skills were minimal, the letter made clear that Schowengerdt was asking for new counsel to be substituted for Scott. Schowengerdt confirmed that intention during the subsequent hearing. However, after asking Schowengerdt about his concerns, the District Court interrupted Schowengerdt as he attempted to give an explanation. The court ordered Schowengerdt to follow the OPD\u2019s process for appointment of new counsel. The court stated that additional proceedings would be conducted if OPD denied Schowengerdt\u2019s request. However, when the OPD administratively denied the request, the court ruled that the matter was concluded and conducted no additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b619  The District Court plainly did not consider Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints as it did not permit Schowengerdt an opportunity to offer them during the hearing. The record does not indicate what Schowengerdt\u2019s objections were to Scott\u2019s representation. Instead, the District Court merely deferred to the OPD\u2019s administrative process on the issue of whether Schowengerdt was entitled to new counsel. While the OPD administrative process may be helpful in resolving some conflicts that arise in the assignment of counsel, it does not supplant judicial procedures that ensure that a criminal defendant is provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the constitutional right to counsel. The District Court failed to follow these procedures when it neglected to inquire into Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints concerning his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b620 The State argues that the court\u2019s error does not require reversal based on <em>State v. Edwards. </em>There, the defendant requested new counsel after being convicted at trial, and the district corut, upon receipt of Edwards\u2019 post-trial motion, failed to inquire into his complaints prior to sentencing. <em>Edwards, </em>\u00b6 29. Despite the court\u2019s error, we concluded that remand was unnecessary because Edwards\u2019 complaints related solely to the alleged ineffectiveness of his counsel at trial, and he had failed to argue that \u201che feared counsel would fail to effectively represent him going forward to sentencing.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>\u00b6 29. The State argues that Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints here were similarly inadequate to require inquiry by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b621  However, we are not able to determine whether Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints here were sufficient because he was not provided an opportunity to explain them. And, unlike Edwards, Schowengerdt argues that his counsel would not be able to effectively represent him going forward with his motion to withdraw his plea in the event the matter is remanded. Schowengerdt requests \u201cthe opportunity to present his motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the district court through constitutionally effective counsel.\u201d Consequently, the District Court\u2019s failure to adequately inquire into his complaints necessitates a remand for further proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did Schowengerdt receive ineffective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b623 Given our resolution of Issue 1, it is not necessary to address Issue 2 at this time. The proceedings on remand may well render moot any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\u00b624 Upon remand, the District Court must adequately inquire into Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints about his assigned counsel to determine whether his complaints are seemingly substantial and necessitate a hearingto determine thevalidity of Schowengerdt\u2019s allegations and the need for substitution of counsel. If the court determines that new counsel is warranted, then, in accordance with the relief sought by Schowengerdt, he will have \u201cthe opportunity to present his motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the district court\u201d with new counsel. We express no opinion on the merits of Schowengerdt\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. If, on the other hand, the court determines that Schowengerdt has not presented seemingly substantial complaints about his counsel, or is otherwise not entitled to new counsel, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>judgment and sentence are affirmed, subject to Schowengerdt\u2019s right to appeal the District Court\u2019s determinations made on remand, and his preserved issue concerning ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Weaver, </em>917 P.2d at 441-42, 276 Mont. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b625 Remanded for farther proceedings as stated herein.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
