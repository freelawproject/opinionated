Contestants appeal an order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, granting summary judgment in favor of Harris and concluding that Contestants had not offered sufficient evidence to challenge Dorothea\u2019s testamentary capacity or to support their allegations of undue influence. We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court\u2019s order allowing probate of Dorothea\u2019s estate complies with \u00a7 72-3-122, MCA.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Harris on Contestants\u2019 objections.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b63 Dorothea married Harris in 1965 after the death of her first husband, Frank Kinniburgh, in 1963. Frank Kinniburgh is the natural father of the three Contestants. Dorothea and Frank Kinniburgh also had a fourth child, Theodore, who died in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b64 Dorothea\u2019s maiden name was Whiteman. Dorothea inherited certain mineral interests in Richland County from her Whiteman ancestors. On March4,1983, Dorothea executed a will (1983 Will) that devised in equal shares to her children, Contestants and Theodore, and her husband, Harris, all of her mineral interests in Richland County. During 1997, Theodore became ill from a heart condition and died. Dorothea acted as Theodore\u2019s primary caregiver while he was ill. Dorothea also was sick during the time she cared for Theodore and, following his illness and death, Dorothea\u2019s health declined. Dorothea died two years later, in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b65 On April 9, 1997, during the time that Dorothea was caring for Theodore, she executed a new will (1997 Will). The 1997 Will left Dorothea\u2019s entire estate to Harris, including all of the mineral interests in Richland County, and named Harris as Personal Representative. Harris believed that he and Dorothea held all assets jointly with rights of survivorship and therefore that he did not need to probate Dorothea\u2019s 1997 Will. Earnings from the oil and gas royalties apparently were made payable to both Dorothea and Harris during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\u00b66 Fourteen years later, in 2013, while preparing to drill a well involving the Richland County interests, Diamond Resources, an oil and gas company, determined that Harris was not, in fact, the legal owner of the mineral interests. Diamond Resources informed Harris that a Montana probate proceeding would be required before proceeds from those interests could be distributed. Specifically, Diamond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Resources required a deed of distribution conveying Dorothea\u2019s mineral interests. Accordingly, in July 2013, Harris filed an application for informal probate of the 1997 Will and for appointment as Personal Representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b67 The Clerk of Court granted Harris\u2019s application, admitted the 1997 Will to informal probate, and \u2014 as specified in the will \u2014 appointed Harris as Personal Representative. After receiving notice of the informal probate, Contestants filed pro se requests for a hearing to contest the transfer of all the mineral interests to Harris. Contestants maintained that it was their mother\u2019s intent that they inherit the mineral rights in Richland County. Responding to Contestants\u2019 filings, the District Court ordered that no hearing would be held until Contestants filed verified objections under \u00a7 72-1-310, MCA. Contestants filed objections and the District Court held a status conference, at which time the court determined that no distribution of the mineral interests would occur until the objections were resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac-\">\u00b68 A few months later, Harris, in his capacity as Personal Representative, moved for summary judgment and requested that the court allow informal probate of the estate in accordance with the 1997 Will. Contestants, through counsel, opposed the motion on the grounds of untimeliness of the probate of the will, undue influence, and lack of testamentary capacity. Both parties submitted affidavits. Following a hearing, the District Court determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding Dorothea\u2019s testamentary capacity when she executed the 1997 Will, or any genuine issues regarding whether Harris exerted undue influence on Dorothea. The District Court entered a written order allowing Harris to continue with probate of the estate. Contestants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b69 The interpretation of a statute is a matter of law that we review de novo. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 19, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. We also review a district court\u2019s summary judgment rulings de novo. <em>Victory Ins. Co. v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2015 MT 82, \u00b6 10, 378 Mont. 388, 344 P.3d 977. Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Victory, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether the District Court\u2019s order allowing probate of Dorothea\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>estate complies with \u00a7 72-3-122, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b611 Contestants argue that, under the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) \u00a7 72-3-122, MCA, the District Court erred by permitting Harris to initiate probate proceedings on Dorothea\u2019s estate fourteen years after her death. Under the UPC (and with one exception not applicable here), \u201cto be effective to prove the transfer of any property ..., a will must be declared to be valid by an order of informal probate by the clerk or an adjudication of probate by the court.\u201d Section 72-3-102, MCA. Section 72-3-122(1), MCA, states that, generally, no formal or informal probate or appointment proceeding \u201cmay be commenced more than 3 years after the decedent\u2019s death,\u201d but proceeds to list exceptions to this rule. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 72-3-203(l)(d), MCA (\u201cAn application for informal probate of a will must state... that the time limit for informal probate ... has not expired either because 3 years or less have passed since the decedent\u2019s death or, if more than 3 years from death have passed, the circumstances as described in 72-3-122 authorizing tardy probate have occurred\u201d). Harris invokes the exception found in \u00a7 72-3-122(lXd), MCA. That subsection states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">an informal appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced after the time period if no proceedings concerning the succession or estate administration have occurred within the 3-year period after the decedent\u2019s death, but the personal representative has no right to possess estate assets as provided in 72-3-606 beyond that necessary to confirm title to the property in the successors to the estate, and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented against the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b612 Subsection (d) therefore permits an informal appointment or formal testacy proceeding to be initiated more than three years after the decedent\u2019s death with three limitations. First, the subsection is inapplicable if there has been any other proceeding regarding succession or estate administration dining the three-year period. Second, no claims other than for expenses of administration may be considered in a late-filed proceeding. Third, the personal representative\u2019s right to possess estate assets is limited to the possession necessary to confirm title to the estate\u2019s assets in the estate\u2019s successors. We examine whether Harris\u2019s initiation of the probate proceedings in this case runs afoul of any of subsection (d)\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b613 As to the first requirement, the record establishes that there was no proceeding regarding succession or estate administration during the three-year period following Dorothea\u2019s death. Harris\u2019s action therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>does not overstep the first limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b614 Regarding the second limitation, a \u201cclaim\u201d is a liability of the decedent or of the estate arising at or after the decedent\u2019s death, including funeral expenses and expenses of administration, but does \u201cnot include ... demands or disputes regarding title of a decedent or protected person to specific assets alleged to be included in the estate.\u201d Section 72-1-103(6), MCA. A claim against the estate is made for matters such as a debt owed by the decedent or by the estate, or for fees of the personal representative. <em>See In re Estate of Barber, </em>239 Mont. 129, 140, 779 P.2d 477,484 (1989). The definition of a \u201cclaim\u201d is distinct from the definition of a \u201cdevise,\u201d which \u201cmeans a testamentary disposition of real or personal <em>property.\u201d </em>Section 72-1-103(11), MCA. <em>See also Estate of Yogiji, </em>311 P.3d 1224, 1228 (N.M. Ct. App. 2013) (holding that a wife\u2019s action seeking to identify assets representing her share of community property is not a \u201cclaim\u201d against husband\u2019s estate). Harris is not pursuing a debt owed by Dorothea or her estate. Accordingly, he has not overstepped the limitation that no claims other than for expenses of administration may be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b615 Our focus therefore turns to the third limitation, which permits a personal representative to possess estate assets only to the extent \u201cnecessary to confirm title to the property in the successors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the estate.\u201d Section 72-3-122(l)(d), MCA. Under the UPC, both real and personal property devolve to a devisee immediately upon the testator\u2019s death, \u201csubject to\u201d the estate\u2019s administration. Section 72-3-101(2), MCA. Section 72-3-606(1), MCA, provides a personal representative the general authority to take possession or control of devised property when \u201cnecessary for purposes of administration.\u201d This section ensures that a personal representative retains the power to sell property of the estate, even property that has been specifically devised in the will, if necessary to pay the decedent\u2019s debts, the expenses of administration, or a family allowance. <em>Northland Royalty Corp. v. Engel, </em>2014 MT 295, \u00b6 11, 377 Mont. 11, 339 P.3d 599; <em>Shephard v. Widhalm, </em>2012 MT 276, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25,</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u00b616 The history of subsection (d)\u2019s enactment confirms our interpretation. The original version of the UPC adopted by the Legislature in 1974 placed strict time limits on when a will could be submitted for probate. It disallowed proceedings to establish a will after three years following the decedent\u2019s death, consistent with the UPC\u2019s policy to \u201cpromote a speedy and efficient system for liquidating the estate of the decedent and making distribution to its successors.\u201d Section 72-l-102(2)(c), MCA (1983) (repealed by 1993 Mont. Laws ch. 494, sec. 134). <em>In Estate of Taylor, </em>207 Mont. 400, 675 P.2d 944 (1984), we held that, in light of this policy, if a will is not probated within three years of death, the assumption of intestacy is final. <em>Taylor, </em>207 Mont. at 404, 675 P.2d at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b617 The Montana Legislature adopted subsection (l)(d) of \u00a7 72-3-122, MCA, following a 1993 UPC revision by the Uniform Laws Commission. The 1993 version of \u00a7 72-3-102 allowed a duly executed will that had not been probated to be admitted <em>as evidence of a devise </em>if there was no previous court proceeding concerning the succession or administration of the estate, and if either oftwo narrow exceptions was satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">(a) The devisee or his successors and assigns possessed the property devised in accordance with the provisions of the will; or (b) The property devised was not possessed or claimed by anyone by virtue of the decedent\u2019s title during the time period for testacy proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Section 72-3-102(2), MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\u00b618 The 1995 Legislature enacted general revisions to Montana\u2019s probate code, including revisions to \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-102 and 72-2-122, MCA. University of Montana School of Law Professor E. Edwin Eck, also a member of the Uniform Laws Commission, provided to the House Judiciary Committee a written explanation of the amendments regarding revisions to the three-year bar on probate and appointment provisions. E. Edwin Eck, <em>Written Comments to Mont. House Jud. Comm, on S.B. No. 132 </em>(Feb. 28,1995) (Eck Comments). It explained that \u201cthe original \u00a7 72-3-102 exception permitted proof, otherwise than via a probate proceeding, of wills that were not probated within three years following death because of specified circumstances tending to justify the failure to act in the permitted time.\u201d Eck Comments at 6. The Joint Editorial Board for the UPC (JEB-UPC), a committee of the Uniform Laws Commission, recommended revising the UPC to remove the time bar on proceedings to establish wills, though the three-year period would remain operative to limit contests seekingto upset a prior informal probate or an administered intestate succession. As Professor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Eck\u2019s comments explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">Experience has taught that specification of limited circumstances excusing timely probate of a will was a mistake. As originally framed, the \u00a7 72-3-122 exceptions as derived from original \u00a7 72-3-102 bristled with potential proof problems that invited litigation. Also, it is far from clear that reasons behind the original UPC policy of definite settlement of certain unopened estates within an arbitrary time period served any policy important enough to block discovery and effectuation of duly executed wills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Eck Comments at 6. Montana already had adopted its own amendment to \u00a7 72-3-122 in 1989 in an attempt to permit late limited proceedings in cases where no probate of a will or administration had occurred during the three-year period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-3-122(l)(d), MCA (1989). Professor Eck explained that this deviation, and similar measures in other states, demonstrated that late-offered wills occur frequently \u201cand that XJPC\u2019s effort to classify such estates as intestate unless original UPC \u00a7 3-102\u2019s exception applies is not acceptable to important numbers of practicing attorneys.\u201d Eck Comments at 6. Under the provision recommended by the JEB-UPC, \u201cinformal appointment proceedings can be used to generate title-perfecting paperwork in successors, whether testate or intestate, when no probate or appointment proceeding occurred within three years.\u201d Eck Comments at 7. Professor Eck noted that the former version of \u00a7 72-3-122 permitted this result, \u201cbut only in the narrowly described and troublesome to prove situations deemed sufficient to excuse timely proceedings.\u201d Eck Comments at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b619  Applying the foregoing to Harris\u2019s initiation of probate proceedings, we determine that Harris has not overstepped the limitation that he possess Dorothea\u2019s estate only as necessary to generate title perfecting work in the estate\u2019s successors. Harris opened the probate to confirm title to the mineral interests in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Will. No other proceedings had been opened since Dorothea\u2019s death. The general three-year time bar does not bar probate of the estate. To the extent that <em>Estate of Taylor </em>conflicts with this holding, it relies on abrogated law, and it is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"ALb\">\u00b620 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Harris on Contestants\u2019 objections.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b621 Contestants objected to the probate of the 1997 Will on the grounds that, when the will was drafted, Harris exerted undue influence on Dorothea and Dorothea lacked testamentary capacity. Harris responded by arguing that Contestants failed to submit evidence necessary to support these objections, and, in any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Contestants\u2019 objections were barred by laches. The District Court granted summary judgment to Harris on Contestants\u2019 objections to the 1997 Will because it determined that Contestants failed to submit evidence raising a dispute of material fact about undue influence and testamentary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b622 On appeal, Harris argues that the District Court correctly concluded that Contestants failed to support their claims adequately at the summary judgment stage. He also argues that, regardless, laches should apply to bar Contestant\u2019s objections. Laches exists where a \u201cparty is actually or presumptively aware of his rights but fails to act,\u201d resulting in a delay of \u201csuch duration or character as to render the enforcement of an asserted right inequitable.\u201d <em>Larson v. Undem, </em>246 Mont. 336, 340, 805 P.2d 1318, 1321 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b623 We agree that laches would bar Contestants from probating the 1983 Will. At least one of the contestants filed an affidavit explaining that he was aware that Dorothea had a will that disposed of the mineral interests in a way that benefited Contestants. Despite that knowledge, for fourteen years following Dorothea\u2019s death, Contestants never sought to probate the 1983 Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b624 Laches could not, however, resolve Contestants\u2019 objections to probate of the 1997 Will. Before Harris initiated informal probate proceedings in 2013, Contestants were unaware of 1997 Will. After Harris sought the 1997 Will\u2019s probate, Contestants registered timely objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b625 The application of laches to probate of the 1983 Will does not resolve this case. Even if Contestants are barred from enforcing the 1983 Will, a successful challenge to the 1997 Will on the grounds of undue influence or lack of capacity would result in a declaration of intestacy. Under such a declaration, Contestants likely would be entitled to a share in the mineral interests because they are not Harris\u2019s descendants. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-2-112, -113, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\u00b626 We thus proceed to examine whether the District Court correctly determined that Contestants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to their undue influence and testamentary capacity claims. The party contesting a will on the ground of undue influence \u201cmust present specific acts showing that undue influence actually was exercised upon the mind of the testator directly to procure the execution of the will.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Mead, </em>2014 MT 264, \u00b6 27, 376 Mont. 386, 336 P.3d 362 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cMere suspicion\u201d or \u201c[g]eneral allegations of poor health are not sufficient to show undue influence.\u201d <em>Mead, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 31 (citation omitted). Contestants submitted affidavits that demonstrated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>opportunity for undue influence. These affidavits, however, do not show specific acts of undue influence sufficient to establish a triable dispute on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b627 Contestants\u2019 proof of lack of testamentary capacity presents a closer question, but still is not sufficient to withstand summary judgment. A testator is competent to execute a will if he or she is \u201caware of: (1) the nature of the act to be performed; (2) the nature and extent of the property to be disposed of; and (3) the objects of his or her bounty.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 66, 149 P.3d 557. After a will proponent gives prima facie proof of due execution, the burden is on a will contestant to show lack of testamentary capacity. <em>Harms, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b628 Here, Harris met his initial burden by submitting affidavits from two legal assistants who observed Dorothea sign the 1997 Will at the office of Dorothea\u2019s attorney, and who signed the will as witnesses. Both witnesses attested that they would not have signed the 1997 Will if they had any question about Dorothea\u2019s testamentaiy capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b629  Contestants countered with affidavits from two of Dorothea\u2019s children stating that Dorothea was under \u201cmental stress\u201d and \u201cnot in a good frame of mind\u201d in 1997. These allegations do not show that Dorothea did not understand the natures of her act, property, or relations when the 1997 Will was executed. Elaine Thompson\u2019s affidavit does state that the 1997 Will referred to Thompson by her name from a previous marriage, but that was the name used in Dorothea\u2019s 1983 Will. The Thompson affidavit also points out that the 1997 Will mistakenly refers to Tamra Sue Patzer as Harris\u2019s \u201cchild by a previous marriage,\u201d when Patzer is actually Harris\u2019s child by a previous relationship, not a marriage. Thompson alleges that this was \u201cnot a mistake my mother would have made if she was of sound mind.\u201d \u201cA suspicion, regardless of how particularized it might be, is not sufficient to sustain an action or defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Abraham v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 94, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 366, 46 P.3d 628. Once a party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden, the parly opposing summary judgment must present \u201cmaterial and substantial evidence\u201d that raises a genuine issue of material fact. <em>MacKay v. State, </em>2003 MT 274, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 467, 79 P.3d 236. Material facts are identified by looking at the substantive law governing a claim. <em>McGinnis v. Hand, </em>1999 MT 9, \u00b6 6, 293 Mont. 72, 972 P.2d 1126. Contestants\u2019 affidavits do not present substantial evidence material to their contention that Dorothea was not cognizant of her property, relations, and testamentary act when she signed the 1997 Will. We agree with the District Court that the affidavits do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>present a triable issue on testamentaiy capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b630 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order permitting probate of Dorothea\u2019s estate and granting summary judgment to Harris on Contestants\u2019 objections. In light of Contestants\u2019 previous petition to prevent informal probate, we remand for formal testacy proceedings on the 1997 Will. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-3-215(2), -302(l)-(2), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\"> \u201cSuccessors\u201d include \u201cpersons, other than creditors, who are entitled to property of a decedent under the decedent\u2019s will.\u201d Section 72-1-103(48), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
