We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-24\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b151-25\">\u00b62 We review the following issue: <em>Did the District Court err when it </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>decided that Mitchell violated \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, by crossing the center line of a road with his vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABS\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b63 Police Officer Matthew Grieshop was patrolling a road near Red Lodge on May 31, 2014. At around 1:00 a.m., he began following two vehicles. The vehicle furthest from Grieshop was operated by Mitchell. After some time, the vehicle between Grieshop and Mitchell passed Mitchell\u2019s vehicle. As it did so, Mitchell\u2019s vehicle crossed over the yellow center line of the road. While Grieshop was following Mitchell, Mitchell\u2019s vehicle also crossed the fog line on the right side of the road. After observing these incidents, Grieshop stopped Mitchell\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">\u00b64 Grieshop issued Mitchell a citation for crossing the center line and then sought to administer a breath alcohol test. Mitchell refused to perform the test, and Grieshop arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, Mitchell\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b65 On June 24, 2014, Mitchell petitioned the District Court to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. Following a hearing on July 9,2014, the District Court denied Mitchell\u2019s petition. Reviewing video from Grieshop\u2019s vehicle, it decided that \u201cMitchell\u2019s vehicle slightly crossed over the yellow center line.\u201d Consequently, it concluded that Mitchell violated \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, and that Grieshop had particularized suspicion sufficient to justify stopping Mitchell. The sole issue presented to the District Court was whether Grieshop had particularized suspicion to stop Mitchell\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>E.g., Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 8, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err when it decided that Mitchell violated \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, by crossing the center line of a road with his vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALa\">\u00b68 Although Mitchell generally argues that his driver\u2019s license should be reinstated, the issue he presents is much narrower. The issue we consider in this Opinion is correspondingly narrow. Mitchell argues that Grieshop did not have particularized suspicion to justify his stop of Mitchell\u2019s vehicle. Mitchell acknowledges that any statutory violation would have been sufficient to establish particularized suspicion for a traffic stop. <em>See State v. Haldane, </em>2013 MT 32, \u00b6 26, 368 Mont. 396, 300 P.3d 657. He argues, however, that it is not a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>violation, as a matter of law, to momentarily cross a road\u2019s yellow center line with a vehicle. To support this argument, Mitchell quotes \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">Whenever a roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic... [a] vehicle must be operated as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and may not be moved from the lane until the operator has first ascertained that the movement can be made with safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Mitchell contends that the phrase \u201cas nearly as practicable\u201d indicates that the Legislature contemplated that vehicles would occasionally move from their lane, and he argues that the Legislature did not intend to make a momentary deviation from a lane of traffic a statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b69 When interpreting a statute, we first consider the plain meaning of the statutory language. We will not look any further if the meaning of the statute is clear on its face. <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003; <em>see </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. As part of the plain meaning analysis, we consider the context in which the language is used. <em>See Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 11 (\u201cWe construe a statute by reading and interpreting the statute as a whole, \u2018without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>City of Great Falls v. Morris, </em>2006 MT 93, \u00b6 19, 332 Mont. 85, 134 P.3d 692)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u00b6 10 Mitchell\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, is not consistent with the language of the statute. A thing is \u201cpracticable,\u201d according to its ordinary definition, if it is reasonably possible to accomplish or feasible in a particular situation. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1361 (Biyan A. Gamer ed., 10th ed. 2014); <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>1383 (5th ed. 2011). Considering this ordinary definition \u2014 especially in light of the statute\u2019s <em>statement that \u201c[a] </em>vehicle ... <em>may not he moved from the lane </em>until the operator has first ascertained that the movement can be made with safely\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, is clear from its plain language. The plain meaning of the statute is not that momentarily crossing the center line is permissible, but that moving from a lane of traffic is usually prohibited to the extent that it is feasible for a vehicle to be operated within the lane of traffic. Mitchell does not argue that it was not practicable for him to operate his vehicle inside the lane of traffic. Bather, he only argues that the statute provides an exception for any <em>momentary </em>deviation from a lane of traffic. The plain language of the statute, however, does not provide such an exception for <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>momentary deviation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b611 Despite Mitchell\u2019s contention otherwise, our decision in <em>State v. </em>Lafferty, 1998 MT 247, 291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363, is not inconsistent with this conclusion. In that case, we stated that \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, \u201crelates to moving from a marked traffic lane to another marked traffic lane. Here, [the Defendant] did not move from one of the marked eastbound traffic lanes.... She merely crossed onto and barely over the fog line on the far right side of the right traffic lane in which she was travelling.\u201d Lafferty, \u00b6 14. Mitchell contends that we decided that the defendant in <em>Lafferty </em>did not violate \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, because momentarily crossing a fog line or a center line is not a violation. This is incorrect. We did not find a violation because the defendant did not enter another lane of traffic. In this case, by crossing the center line, Mitchell did enter a different lane of traffic. For this reason, the situation in the present case is distinguishable from the facts on which our decision in <em>Lafferty </em>was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b612  For the foregoing reasons, the District Court did not err by deciding that Mitchell violated \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, when he directed his vehicle across the yellow center line.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b613 Mitchell\u2019s argument thathe did not violate \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, when he briefly crossed a road\u2019s yellow center line with his vehicle is incorrect. As this was the only basis on which he challenged his traffic stop and the resulting suspension of his driver\u2019s license, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Mitchell\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\"> This is not to say that a violation will exist every time a vehicle crosses a yellow center line or otherwise leaves its lane of traffic. This decision does not foreclose the possibility that it will not be practicable to remain in a lane of traffic in all situations. We merely decide, based on the narrow issue presented by Mitchell, that momentary deviations are not excepted per se.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
