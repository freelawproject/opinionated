At the trial, Pingree\u2019s ex-wife, Caroline, did not testify and the District Court admitted a number of hearsay statements she made prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether Fingree\u2019s confrontation rights were violated when prior testimony from a civil order of protection hearing was read at his criminal trial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u00b63 On September 11, 2012, the Ravalli County Attorney filed an information charging Pingree with felony Assault with a Weapon, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, and misdemeanor Partner or Family Member Assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. The State alleged that Pingree pointed a gun at his wife and fired it to the left of her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\u00b64 On October 5,2012, Caroline Pingree, the alleged victim, sought an order of protection in Butte-Silver Bow County, where the parties\u2019 dissolution had been filed. Pingree was present at the hearing, although without counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified, but did not contest the order. Pingree did not cross-examine Caroline.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00b65 Subsequently, Pingree pled not guilty to the criminal charges and the case went to a jury trial. Pingree maintained that he did not intend to shoot at Caroline; rather, his finger slipped when loading the weapon. Although the State subpoenaed Caroline, she was not served and did not appear at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, the prosecutor introduced portions of a transcript from the civil order of protection hearing, at which Caroline testified to violence by Pingree. The actual transcript was not entered as an exhibit; rather, it was read into evidence in question and answer form.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b66 The District Court admitted the prior testimony over the objection of defense counsel. The court held that Caroline\u2019s hearsay statements from the order of protection hearingwere admissible under M. R. Evid. 804(bXD(B). The District Court noted that Caroline\u2019s statements were made under oath and Pingree was advised of his right to cross-examine Caroline by the court, but declined the opportunity to do so. The District Court reasoned that the confrontation clause requires only that the defendant have the opportunity to cross-examine, not that he actually do so, and that representation by counsel is not a requirement for admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b67 While deliberating, the jury sent a request to the District Court asking to review the transcript of the order of protection hearing. Judge Langton denied the request and provided a supplementary instruction that read, in part: \u201cIt would be improper for me to provide you a complete transcript of the Butte hearing as it would tend to give undue emphasis to that testimony. If there is a specific point of topic from that hearing transcript that you request you may inform me of that and I will consider it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b68 On March 6, 2013, the juiy found Pingree guilty of the charged offenses. Judge Langton sentenced him to the Department of Corrections for a period of fifteen years, with ten years suspended, on the Assault with a Weapon charge, and six months, with five months suspended, on the Partner or Family Member Assault charge (to run concurrently). Pingree now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b69 This court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions for abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of discretion. <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretations of the Constitution or the rules of evidence de novo. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b610 <em>Issue: Whether Pingree\u2019s confrontation rights were violated when prior testimony from a civil order of protection hearing was read at his criminal trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b611 The State maintains that Pingree waived his M. R. Evid. 804(b)(1)(B) argument in the District Court. Additionally, the State asserts that Pingree waived any argument based on the Montana Constitution by failing to raise it below. Pingree asserts that he raised the M. R. Evid. 804 and confrontation issues, and the District Court considered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b612 On the morning of the trial, the State indicated it intended to introduce Caroline\u2019s testimony from the order of protection hearing. Pingree objected on the basis of the \u201cSixth Amendment right to confront the witness, confrontation clause, <em>Crawford </em>[referring to <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004)], as well as ... the right to personally face your accuser.\u201d The District Court clearly considered the hearsay issue and ruled that the prior testimony was admissible under both <em>Crawford </em>and M. R. Evid. 804(b)(1)(B). Pingree\u2019s objection was clear and sufficient to preserve the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u00b6 13 The United States Constitution provides that criminal defendants \u201cenjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. Similarly, the Montana Constitution provides that \u201cin all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right... to meet the witnesses against him face to face\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. We have previously held that Montana\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides greater protection than the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766. These protections prohibit the State\u2019s use of hearsay statements except in certain circumstances. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u00b614 \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d M. R. Evid. 801(c); <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless specifically excluded by statute, the rules of evidence, or other court rules. M. R. Evid. 802; <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 17. M. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Evid. 804 provides hearsay exceptions applicable when the declarant is unavailable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b615  In a criminal case, former testimony given as a witness at another hearing, although hearsay, is admissible \u201cif the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, and redirect examination.\u201d M. R. Evid. 804(b)(1)(B). In other words, before a prosecutor may introduce the former testimony of a now-unavailable witness, the defendant must have had, at the time testimony was given: (1) an opportunity to examine the declarant, and (2) a similar motive to develop the declarant\u2019s testimony. M. R. Evid. 804(b)(1)(B). The standard for admitting this evidence is whether the objecting party had the same motive to conduct the examination <em>as </em>he would at trial if the witness were available at that time. <em>State v. Homer, </em>2014 MT 57, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 157, 321 P.3d 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b616 Cross-examination is essential to the adversary system. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 13. Cross-examination \u201ctests the witness\u2019s testimony in the most rigorous, demanding, and exacting\u201d manner and has the potential to expose \u201cflaws, inconsistencies, and insidious motives.\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 13. We agree with the State that Pingree\u2019s right to cross-examine Caroline was satisfied. The court presiding over the order of protection hearing advised Pingree of his right to cross-examine Caroline, but Pingree declined the opportunity. Although he was acting as his own attorney, he nonetheless had the opportunity to cross-examine Caroline and we conclude that M. R. Evid. 804(b)(l)(B)\u2019s requirement that the individual have an opportunity to cross examine the declarant is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b617 However, the second prong of M. R. Evid. 804(b)(lXB), requiring a similar motive, was not satisfied in this case. It is clear that the motives underlying the two cases were vastly different. An order of protection hearing is a civil proceeding. A protective order serves to prevent further conflict between the parties. Certainly, a respondent may face criminal consequences for violating an order of protection <em>(see </em>\u00a7 45-5-626, MCA), but simply being named as respondent does not expose a respondent to criminal liability. Here, Pingree conceded the issue and agreed to the imposition of the protective order against him.</p>\n<p id=\"Aia\">\u00b618 Conversely, a criminal case implicates a much higher risk for a defendant. The charges carry serious criminal penalties if a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>is found guilty. A criminal conviction affects one\u2019s liberty in the most fundamental way and thus, a defendant is entitled to legal representation. Pingree risked maximum sentences of twenty years and $50,000 in fines for the Assault with a Weapon charge and one year and $1,000 in fines for the misdemeanor Partner or Family Member Assault charge. Sections 45-5-213(2)(a), -206(3)(a)(i), MCA. The consequences of a criminal prosecution provide a very different motivation for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b619  Pingreedidnothaveasimilarmotivefordevelopingtestimony via cross-examination of Caroline at both hearings. As discussed above, the punitive nature of criminal proceedings critically differs from a civil order of protection hearing. Notably, Pingree agreed to the imposition of the protective order against him, whereas he strongly maintained his innocence at the criminal trial. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred when it found that Caroline\u2019s statements satisfied the requirements of M. R. Evid. 804(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b620 The State further asserts that the admission of Caroline\u2019s prior testimony was harmless. Trial errors are subject to harmless error review, using a \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test to assess whether the district court\u2019s error was indeed harmless. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. The State must demonstrate that the jury was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence and, qualitatively, the tainted evidence would not have contributed to the conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. The cumulative evidence test \u201cfocuses on the qualitative impact the inadmissible evidence may have on the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 22. This inquiry is not simply whether other untainted evidence established the necessary elements of the crime. Instead, the harmless error analysis also requires us to ask whether the tainted evidence had a substantive impact on the jury\u2019s decision to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"AP9\">\u00b621 The primary issue in the criminal trial was Pingree\u2019s intent, i.e., whether he intended to point and fire the gun or whether the gun discharged accidentally. The State claims that Caroline\u2019s testimony at the order of protection hearing was simply cumulative of other evidence admitted at the trial without objection, including the 911 call and the officers\u2019 testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b622  Here, the introduction of Caroline\u2019s prior testimony cedis into question the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. The State has failed to demonstrate that the facts admitted through Caroline\u2019s prior testimony did not have a substantive impact on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AZO\">\u00b623 We acknowledge the many challenges presented in prosecuting intimate partner crime. Research suggests that the vast majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>between 80 to 85 percent, of abused women recant at some point. Tom Lininger, <em>Prosecuting Batterers After Crawford, </em>91 Va. L. Rev. 747,768 (2005). However, evidence-based approaches to domestic violence prosecution are available to pursue these crimes. For example, in <em>State v. Finley, </em>we concluded that the victim\u2019s testimony is not necessary when there is additional evidence supporting the required elements beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2011 MT 89, \u00b6 31, 360 Mont. 173, 252 P.3d 199. In <em>Finley, </em>we reaffirmed our prior holding that the elements of a criminal offense do not require direct evidence and can be established through circumstantial evidence alone. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 29 (citations omitted). In that case, the victim placed a frantic call to 911, which was later admitted into evidence at the trial. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 30. The 911 recording demonstrated the victim\u2019s fear and terror as the dispatcher tried to coax her out of the gas station where she was hiding. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 5. Moreover, we found additional supporting evidence from the testimony of the responding police officers, who noted the victim\u2019s distraught demeanor and appearance and confirmed the damage to the house caused during the assault. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b624 Here, while not sufficient to establish harmless error, the State may have had sufficient evidence to pursue the prosecution without using Caroline\u2019s statements from the prior hearing. The State introduced the 20-minute 911 call, wherein Caroline stated: \u201cMy husband just fired a gun at me.\u201d The juiy could hear Caroline raying on the call, clearly upset. The 911 dispatcher testified that Caroline was frightened and locked herself in the bathroom until officers arrived at the home. Caroline told the dispatcher that Pingree had instructed her to \u201ctell us that he had shot into the floor, because he was going to be in big trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b625 Further, testimony from law enforcement provided other corroborative evidence. Deputy Colgan discussed Caroline's scared demeanor when officers arrived at the home. Detective Jessop testified to finding the gun at the bottom of the ravine with the gun\u2019s chamber empty. According to Detective Jessop, the empty chamber suggests that someone removed the casings before throwing the gun to prevent matching the gun to the bullet. Trajectory analysis conducted by Deputy Cashell provided evidence of the bullet\u2019s entay into the couch at a close proximity and steep angle, consistent with Pingree standing over Caroline. Finally, Montana Crime Laboratory forensic scientist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Lynette Lancon testified to the unlikelihood that either firearm<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> could have discharged accidentally and that the safety function on both guns was functioning correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b626 Moreover, Pingree\u2019s own testimony tended to cast him as not credible. Pingree testified that he told law enforcement officer Marshall Rose where he threw the gun. The State called Marshall Rose as a rebuttal witness and he denied that Pingree ever told him where to find the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b627 We are unable to conclude that the admission of Caroline\u2019s hearsay statements was harmless. The primary issue at Pingree\u2019s criminal trial was his intent; that is, whether he intended to shoot the gun at Caroline or whether the gun discharged accidentally. Caroline\u2019s hearsay statements, such as \u201che walked out and pointed a gun at me and fired ... and then he laughed,\u201d directly contradicted Pingree\u2019s defense. Additionally, the hearsay statements included references to Pingree grabbing the phone out of Caroline\u2019s hand and throwing it out the front door, not allowing Caroline to visit her family in Butte, and past violent incidents between the couple (\u201cIt was not like a volatile fight or anything, like we\u2019d been known to have in the past.\u201d). Moreover, the jury\u2019s request to examine the order of protection transcript while deliberating suggests that they placed considerable emphasis on the hearsay statements. While the dissent contends that the prior statement was not \u201cmore compelling or deserving of greater evidentiary weight\u201d than the recording of the 911 call (citing <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 35, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690), it was a statement given under oath in a court of law and we cannot say that the testimony did not have a substantive impact on the jury. The record suggests that the statements had a qualitative effect on the jury\u2019s decision to convict Pingree and are thus not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b628 In conclusion, Caroline\u2019s testimony at the order of protection hearing is hearsay. Montana Rule of Evidence 804requires that before former testimony of a now unavailable witness may be admitted in a criminal case, the party against whom the testimony is offered must have had an opportunity and similar motive to probe the witness\u2019 testimony through cross examination. We conclude that under the facts of this case, Pingree did not have a similar motive to develop Caroline\u2019s testimony at the order of protection hearing. We further conclude that the State has failed to carry its burden to establish that the tainted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b629 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-13\"> The Office of the Public Defender represented Pingree in his criminal case.

R. Evid. 804(b)(1)(B), but I would find the error harmless and affirm Pingree\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b631 While the Court properly describes the appropriate harmless error analysis, Opinion, \u00b6 20, it does not engage in a meaningful discussion of the qualitative impact of the inadmissible evidence. As the Court acknowledges, there was strong evidence, admitted properly at trial, to counter Pingree\u2019s defense that the gun fired accidentally. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26. Pingree\u2019s argument on appeal is that the inadmissible evidence nevertheless was critical because Caroline\u2019s testimony during the civil hearing was the only direct proof that Pingree intended to fire the gun, and that there was no independent evidence at trial to prove Pingree\u2019s mental state. He contends that in the recorded 9-1-1 call, Caroline said that Pingree shot a gun right next to her, which was not inconsistent with his defense, whereas, in the civil hearing, she testified that he pointed a gun at her and fired, and then he laughed.</p>\n<p id=\"Asy\">\u00b632 Review of the record reveals that Caroline\u2019s testimony during the civil hearing was, in those respects material to the elements of the offenses with which Pingree was charged, substantively indistinguishable from what she reported during the recorded 9-1-1 call. When the State played the 9-1-1 recording at trial, the jury heard, from Caroline directly, the following conversation she had with the dispatcher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">[Caroline]: My husband just fired a gun at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">[Dispatcher]: Your husband just what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">[Caroline]: Fired a gun at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">[Dispatcher]: He fired a gun at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">[Caroline]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-14\">[Audible crying.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-15\">[Dispatcher]: Do you know why he fired at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-16\">[Caroline]:... No. We\u2019ve been having a little bit of problems going on. He just kind of woke up and he came and he told me he was just playing with me but he actually fired the gun right by me.... I was sittin\u2019 on the couch and he fired it like right next to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-20\">[Dispatcher]: Do you need an ambulance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-21\">[Caroline]: No, he missed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>[Dispatcher]: Has he ever done this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">[Caroline]: Oh we had some problems several years ago. Never to this extent, however. I filed a restraining order on him and I moved away, and then we both got sober and stuff, and I moved back about a year and a half ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">[Caroline]: I was sittin\u2019 on the couch and he just kinda came up and fired it right beside me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">[Caroline]: He just kind of put it up against me, shot it, and laughed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">[Caroline, after telling the dispatcher that Pingree is outside the bathroom door and may have heard her talking]: He asked me if I had really called the cops. [The line goes dead, but dispatch calls her back.]... When he unplugged the phone he said, \u201cI need you to tell everybody that you just thought I shot into the floor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">[Dispatcher]: So when he unplugged the phone he told you he just shot into the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">[Caroline]: He did, he knocked on the door, he said ..., \u201cyou just have to tell everybody I shot a shot into the floor, okay? I\u2019m in a lot of trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">\u00b633 This evidence is not qualitatively different from Caroline\u2019s testimony during the civil hearing. During that hearing, she said that Pingree \u201cpointed\u201d the gun, whereas she told the dispatcher that he fired it \u201cat me,\u201d that he \u201cfired it right beside me,\u201d and that he \u201ckind of put it up against me.\u201d This is a distinction without a substantive difference. In both instances, she described Pingree laughing after he fired the gun. And, as the Court points out, there was independent corroborating evidence of the unlikelihood that the gun(s) could have been fired accidentally. Opinion, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\u00b634 In determining whether trial error is harmless, \u201cif the tainted evidence was admitted to prove an element of the offense, then the State must direct us to admissible evidence that proves the same facts as the tainted evidence and demonstrate that the quality of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility it might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Derbyshire, 2009 MT 27, \u00b6 47, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. This Court\u2019s prior cases analyzing the qualitative impact of inadmissible evidence have found an evidentiary error to be harmless where there is untainted evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the same facts and, in comparison to the inadmissible evidence, the untainted evidence outweighs the impact of the evidence that should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b635 For example, in <em>Sanchez, </em>the trial court improperly admitted hearsay testimony from a neighbor that the deceased victim (Aleasha) had told her that, during an argument, Sanchez stated, \u201c[M]e love you, [Aleasha]. Me not love you that much. You cross me, I kill you.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 20. Although the evidence was powerful \u2014 and was evidence of words spoken by the victim that went directly to the disputed element of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting \u2014 we concluded that its admission was harmless error, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">The jury heard from Aleasha\u2019s killer himself, that, after learning of Aleasha\u2019s infidelity, he made arrangements for the care of his children, he went to the store and purchased ammunition, he took the loaded gun to Aleasha\u2019s house, he waited for her to come outside, and he shot her after a brief argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\"><em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u00b636 In <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187, we agreed with the defendant that the trial court improperly admitted recordings of four telephone conversations between the victim and the defendant (her father) where the victim confronted him directly about his sexual abuse of her over a period of many years. During one such call, for example, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">At the outset, A.S. reiterated that she was \u201ctired of the sexual favors\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s my body, it\u2019s not your body.\u201d Stewart stated, \u201cOkay. Are you tired of it?\u201d and A.S. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Stewart then stated, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s done. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\"><em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 9. The recorded calls were the only evidence tending to indicate the defendant\u2019s admission to the sexual abuse of his daughter; he testified at trial that he had no sexual contact with her. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 18. Comparing the inadmissible recorded phone calls with the untainted evidence proving Stewart\u2019s sexual abuse (which included the victim\u2019s trial testimony), we first pointed out that \u201cthis is not a case where the recordings filled in large holes and chronological gaps in the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 50. We concluded that although the recordings were \u201cobjectively reliable\u201d evidence, \u201c[qualitatively, nothing on the recordings is any more inflammatory or prejudicial than the other, admissible evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\u00b637 In <em>Mizenko, </em>we held that the trial court improperly allowed hearsay testimony from a sheriffs deputy and police dispatcher relating statements the domestic violence victim had made to them at the time of the defendant\u2019s assault of her. As here, the victim did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>appear at trial. Because the recording of the victim\u2019s call to 9-1-1 was admitted without objection and related the same facts, we concluded that the error was harmless. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b638 In contrast, we have found evidentiary error not to be harmless when the evidence improperly admitted is qualitatively different from the untainted evidence. A clear example of this is <em>State v. Gieser, </em>2011 MT 2, 359 Mont. 95, 248 P.3d 300, a DUI case in which the state had not laid a proper foundation for the admission of evidence of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test or the defendant\u2019s breath test showing a blood alcohol concentration that exceeded the legal limit. Although untainted evidence established other indicia of intoxication, such as \u201cthe odor of alcohol, bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred speech, impaired coordination, and [the defendant\u2019s] difficulty finding his licenset,]\u201d we emphasized that the HGN and breath tests \u201chave an appearance of precision and scientific reliability that is qualitatively different from the more subjective observations of the officer as to speech, eyes, coordination and odors.\u201d <em>Gieser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b639 Comparing these cases to the evidence at Pmgree\u2019s trial, it is evident that Caroline\u2019s inadmissible hearsay testimony is not qualitatively different from her statements on the 9-1-1 recording. The facts recited by the Court in \u00b6\u00b6 24-26 demonstrate that other evidence properly admitted at trial proved the same facts. The question here isn\u2019t whether the statements are cumulative, but whether the content of the prior testimony is \u201cmore compelling or deserving of greater evidentiary weight,\u201d <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 35, than Caroline\u2019s recorded conversation with the dispatcher. Both the tainted and the untainted evidence in this case are the victim\u2019s spoken words about Pingree\u2019s conduct, and the evidence therefore is of similar quality. The evidence was used to both parties\u2019 advantage. Pingree used Caroline\u2019s prior testimony to call her credibility into question, pointing out in closing argument that she testified that Pingree grabbed the phone out of her hand in front of the responding law enforcement officers, but that none of the officers reported witnessing that. It is therefore speculative to say that the prior testimony had \u201csubstantive impact\u201d on the jury\u2019s decision to convict. Opinion, \u00b6 27. The State\u2019s case may have been even more compelling without it. In the final analysis, it cannot reasonably be argued that testimony read to the jury by a third person from a hearing that occurred weeks after the offense is more compelling or deserving of greater evidentiary weight than the recording of the victim\u2019s twenty-minute wait in her locked bathroom while officers responded to her call for emergency assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b640 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
