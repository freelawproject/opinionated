We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AjX\">\u00b62 On February 14, 2013, Pinder crashed a truck into a light post outside the Super 8 Motel on Harrison Avenue in Butte, Montana. Butte-Silver Bow County police officers responded to the scene and, with the help of witnesses, located Pinder exiting a bathroom in the dining room of the motel. Pinder appeared intoxicated and was having difficulty standing, walking, speaking, or following verbal commands. The officers called for an ambulance to take Pinder to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\u00b63 Shortly thereafter, a motel employee gave the officers a can of aerosol dust-remover that had been discovered in the same bathroom Pinder had exited earlier. The officers knew that dust-remover can be used as an inhalant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">\u00b64 At the hospital, Pinder was arrested for DUI. Pinder then consented to a blood draw for toxicological testing. The toxicology report revealed that Finder's blood contained 6.2 mcg/ml of 1,1-Difluoroethane (DFE), a chemical found in dust-remover.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">\u00b65 Because Pinder had three prior DUI convictions, he was charged with felony DUI in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(c), MCA, and misdemeanor reckless driving in violation of \u00a7 61-8-301(l)(a), MCA. He pled not guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">\u00b66 On September 30,2013, Pinder filed a motion to dismiss the DUI charge. An evidentiary hearing was held on October 31,2013. At the hearing, the court heard evidence that DFE is a recognized substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of abuse and its use can result in symptoms including lightheadedness, disorientation, loss of inhibition, dizziness, hallucinations, delusions, impaired judgment, cardiac arrest, and death. However, Pinder argued that Montana\u2019s DUI statutes do not define \u201cdrug,\u201d and therefore the District Court should have used use the definition of drug from \u00a737-7-101(16), MCA, (the \u201cPharmacy\u201d chapter of Title 37, \u201cProfessions and Occupations\u201d) because it is the only section in the MCA that defines the term \u201cdrug.\u201d According to Pinder, DFE does not fit within that definition of \u201cdrug\u201d and thus the DUI charge against him should be dismissed. The court denied Finder\u2019s motion in a written order on November 6, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b67 Pinder entered into a plea agreement with the State and the court accepted his guilty plea on November 15, 2013. As part of the agreement, Pinder reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. Though Pinder later violated the terms of the plea agreement by failing to comply with conditions of his bail, the State does not contest Finder\u2019s right to appeal the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b68 Pinder now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss a criminal case, and its decision on the interpretation of a statute, de novo for correctness. <em>State v. </em>Madsen, 2013 MT 281, \u00b6 6, 372 Mont. 102, 317 P.3d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b610 Section 61-8-40K l)(c), MCA, states that it is unlawful for a person who is under the influence of \u201cany other drug to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle within this state.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c \u201cUnder the influence\u2019 means that as a result of taking into the body alcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol and drugs, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle has been diminished.\u201d Section 61-8-401(3)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">\u00b611 Pinder argues that, because the term \u201cdrug\u201d is not specifically defined in Montana\u2019s DUI statutes or elsewhere in the criminal code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the District Court should have applied the definition of \u201cdrug\u201d from \u00a7 37-7-101( 16), MCA, which provides definitions related to the licensing and regulation of pharmacies. That statute states:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">As used in this chapter, the following definitions apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">(16) \u201cDrug\u201d means a substance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">(a) recognized as a drug in any official compendium or supplement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">(b) intended for use in diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or animals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(c) other than food, intended to affect the structure or function of the body of humans or animals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">(d) intended for use as a component of a substance specified in subsection [(a), (b), or (c)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Sections 37-3-101(16)(a)-(d), MCA. According to Pinder, DFE does not meet this definition and should not be considered a \u201cdrug\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Therefore, Pinder was not driving under the influence of a \u201cdrug\u201d and the DUI charge against him should have been dismissed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">\u00b612 In denying Finder\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court reasoned that it would be illogical and counter to legislative intent to use the pharmaceutical definition of \u201cdrug\u201d in applying the DUI statute. Instead, the court used a plain meaning definition of \u201cdrug\u201d taken from <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>\u201c[a] natural or synthetic substance that alters one\u2019s perception or consciousness.\u201d 571, (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 9th ed. 2009). The court concluded that DFE qualified as a \u201cdrug\u201d under that definition and therefore did not dismiss the DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">\u00b613 Pinder argues that we are compelled to use the pharmacy definition of \u201cdrug\u201d defined by \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">[w]henever the meaning of a word or phrase is defined in any part of this code, such definition is applicable to the same word or phrase wherever it occurs, except where a contrary intention plainly appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The State counters that the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201c[a]s used in this chapter\u201d prefacing the pharmacy definition section plainly shows the legislature\u2019s contrary intention to use of the pharmacy definition of \u201cdrug\u201d in the DUI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">\u00b614 In the past we have taken disparate approaches to whether prefatory phrases in statutory definitions such as \u201cfor the purposes of this section\u201d or \u201cas used in this Title,\u201d satisfy the \u201ccontrary intention\u201d language of \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA. In one line of cases we stated that such application phrases constitute contrary intentions and preclude the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of those definitions in sections not mentioned. In other cases we have held that the phrases indicate only that the legislature intended the particular application of the definitions in those parts of the code without preventing use of those definitions in other parts of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">\u00b615 As an example of the exclusionary approach, in <em>Richter v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 165, 289 Mont. 379, 962 P.2d 583, we refused to apply the definition of \u201cfarm\u201d given in the Montana Probate Code to the MCA sections covering eminent domain, because that \u201cfarm\u201d definition was specifically applied to the Probate Code. <em>Richter, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Similarly, in <em>Billings Firefighters Local 521, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters v. City of Billings, </em>1999 MT 6, 293 Mont. 41, 973 P.2d 222, we refused to apply to Title 7, chapter 3, MCA, a definition of \u201cstructure\u201d that was applied to certain sections of Title 7, chapter 1, MCA. <em>Billings Firefighters, </em>\u00b6 19. In <em>State v. Merry, </em>2008 MT 288, 345 Mont. 390, 191 P.3d 428, while attempting to define \u201csupervision and direction\u201d (as used in the statutes regulating the administration of blood tests in DUI cases) we refused to apply definitions for \u201cdirect supervision,\u201d \u201cgeneral supervision,\u201d or \u201cqualified medical direction\u201d given in the sections regulating dental hygienists, hearing aid dispenser trainees, and respiratory care. We reasoned that the inclusion of the phrases \u201c[for] the purposes of this section,\u201d and \u201c[a]s used in this chapter,\u201d demonstrated that the legislature \u201cplainly has limited the reach of these definitions, and thus, they cannot properly define the terms of [the DUI blood test section].\u201d <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 15. Thus, under this line of cases, application phrases on definitions are seen as exclusionary, precluding application of the definition to other code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b616 On the other hand, the inclusionary approach is found in <em>Mountain View Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Mountain View Sch., </em>227 Mont. 288, 738 P.2d 1288 (1987), where we held that educators at Mountain View School were eligible to receive state benefits under Title 2, chapter 18, because they did not qualify as \u201cschoolteachers\u201d as used in that chapter. We reached that conclusion by determining that the Mountain View School employees did not fit the definition of \u201cteacher\u201d given in Title 20. We applied that definition in spite of the language \u201cas used in this title\u201d prefacing the Title 20 definition section. <em>Mountain View Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>227 Mont. at 290-291, 738 P.2d at 1289-1290. Likewise, in <em>Dept. of Rev. v. Gallatin Outpatient Clinic, (\u201cGallatin\u201d) </em>234 Mont. 425, 763 P.2d 1128 (1988), we allowed the definition of \u201chospital\u201d given in Title 50 to be applied to a tax statute under Title 15, despite limiting prefatory language in the definition. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201c[t]he use by the legislature in Section 50-5-101, MCA, of the phrase \u2018as used in parts 1 through 4 of this chapter\u2019 does not show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the legislature\u2019s plain intent that the definitions were only to he applied in those parts of the code. Those words only indicate that the legislature intended the particular application of the definitions in those parts of the code, without limitation to the general use of the definitions in other parts of the code, pursuant to Section 1-2-107, MCA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><em>Gallatin, </em>234 Mont. at 430, 763 P.2d at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b617 More recently, in <em>Judicial Stds. Comm\u2019n v. Not Afraid, </em>2010 MT 285, 358 Mont. 532, 245 P.3d 1116, we applied the definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d given in Title 13 to issues involving the Montana Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct. We applied the definition despite the phrase \u201c[a]s used in this title\u201d prefacing the definition section. In doing so, we cited \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA, and <em>Gallatin, </em>and stated \u201c[w]e see no clear indication that the statutory definition of \u2018public office\u2019 cannot be referenced for issues arising outside of Title 13.\u201d <em>Judicial Stds., </em>\u00b6 20. Under this line of cases, limitation clauses are seen as inclusionary, specifically applying the given definition to the listed sections, but not precluding application of the definition to other sections where appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b618 In this case, however, we need not delve into the use of the phrase \u201cas used in this chapter\u201d in order to see that the legislature did not intend the pharmacy definition of \u201cdrug\u201d to apply to the DUI statute. Words and phrases used in the statutes of Montana are construed according to context. Section 1-2-106, MCA. Thus, whether or not a \u201ccontrary intention\u201d to using a given definition plainly appears must be considered according to context.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b619  The context of the locations of the two uses of the term \u201cdrug\u201d in the MCA at issue here makes it clear that the legislature did not intend to apply the pharmacy definition of \u201cdrug\u201d to the DUI statute. The purpose of the pharmacy statutes is to regulate the administration of legal substances of clinically recognized medical value by licensed professionals. The purpose of the DUI statutes is to protect public safety by punishing individuals who choose to drive after ingesting \u201calcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol and drugs\u201d that causes their \u201cability to safely operate a vehicle [to be] diminished.\u201d Section 61-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>8-401(3), MCA. Though some substances that would qualify as a \u201cdrug\u201d under the pharmacy statute are intoxicating, many intoxicating substances that would impair a person\u2019s ability to drive fall outside that definition. We do not think the legislature intended to limit the scope of the DUI statute by applying it only to drivers who may have diminished their driving ability by ingesting a substance regulated by pharmacists. The language of the statute plainly shows that the legislature intended to punish individuals who drive after ingesting \u201cany\u201d substance that diminishes their driving ability. Sections 61-8-401(lXc) and -401(3), MCA. Here, because \u201ca contrary intention plainly appears,\u201d \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA, does not compel us to apply the pharmacy definition of \u201cdrug\u201d to the DUI statute. The District Court did not err when it refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b620 Having determined that the pharmacy definition does not apply to the DUI statute, we turn to whether the District Court used an appropriate definition for the term \u201cdrug.\u201d We conclude that the court was correct. We recently stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">[a] judge\u2019s role in statutory interpretation is to \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. A court\u2019s function is to determine legislative intent, and where that can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, the plain meaning controls and a court need not go further or apply other means of interpretation. Statutory terms must be interpreted reasonably and logically, and given the natural and popular meaning in which they are usually understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">The Legislature need not define every term it employs in a statute. If a term is one of common usage and is readily understood, a court should presume that a reasonable person of average intelligence can understand it. The failure to include definitions of all terms does not automatically make a statute vague as long as the meaning is clear and provides a defendant with adequate notice of the proscribed conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\"><em>Madsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b621  The common and readily understood meaning of the word \u201cdrug\u201d in the context of traffic regulations is a substance that alters one\u2019s perception, consciousness, or impairs physical or mental abilities. This meaning is clear and provides adequate notice that driving a vehicle while under the influence of such a substance is prohibited. Furthermore, the definition comports with the legislature\u2019s definition of \u201cunder the influence,\u201d that is, \u201cas a result of taking into the body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>alcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol and drugs, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle has been diminished.\u201d Section 61-8-401(3)(a), MCA. As stated above, the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the DU1 statutes was plainly to protect public safely by punishingindividuals who drive after ingesting substances that impair their ability to operate motor vehicles. The District Court\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug\u201d is consistent with the legislature\u2019s objectives in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b622  The District Court was correct when it did not apply the pharmacy definition of \u201cdrug\u201d and instead used a commonly understood plain meaning definition. Under that definition, DFE could be considered a drug and driving while under the influence of DFE a violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\"> The \u201cany other\u201d in the statute is a reference to \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(b), MCA, which specifically prohibits driving wider the influence of a drug that is designated a \u201cdangerous drug\u201d by the board of pharmacy under \u00a7 50-32-202, MCA.
