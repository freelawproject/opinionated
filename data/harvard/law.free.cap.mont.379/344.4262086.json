(CPI) and Nancy Smith after CPI sought to collect Amour\u2019s bill for Smith\u2019s services as guardian ad litem (GAL) during Amour\u2019s marriage dissolution proceedings. The Fourth Judicial District Court, Mineral County, entered summary judgment in favor of CPI and Smith. Amour appeals. The dispositive issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court correctly awarded summary judgment to CPI on Amour\u2019s Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim because CPI was not attempting to collect a debt regulated by that statute.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court correctly awarded summary judgment to Smith.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court correctly awarded CPI $7,408.70 in damages plus interest.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">\u00b63 In 2007, Amour filed for dissolution of her marriage. On January 24,2008, the court handling the action entered an order naming Smith as GAL for Amour\u2019s children during the pendency of the dissolution proceedings. The order specified Smith\u2019s duties, granted Smith judicial immunity, and specified that the gross marital estate was responsible for paying Smith for her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">\u00b64 On February 4, 2008, Amour entered a contract with Smith specifying that Smith would be paid $90 per hour for her work, plus expenses. Smith billed Amour half the account and billed Amour\u2019s ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>husband the other half. Amour paid some of the bills but stopped paying in May 2010. In November 2011, Smith assigned $6,975.60 in unpaid bills to CPI, which then notified Amour that she owed $7,511.74, including interest. On January 20, 2012, the dissolution corut entered an order stating that the \u201cindividual debts to the GAL are solely the responsibility of the individuals and are not a debt of the marital estate,\u201d and that the \u201cParties\u2019 individual debts including ... their individual debt to the GAL are the responsibility of each party individually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b65 In March 2012, CPI filed a complaint injustice court to collect the debt. Amour filed a counterclaim exceeding the justice court\u2019s jurisdictional limit and the case was dismissed. Amour then filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that CPI violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) through attempting to collect a false debt; that Smith committed defamation by falsely publishing to third parties that Amour owed a debt; and that Smith violated the Montana Consumer Protection Act through her actions. CPI counterclaimed for the amount owed for Smith\u2019s services under theories of breach of contract and breach of a court order. Later that year, CPI and Smith filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b66 In November 2013, the District Court awarded Smith summary judgment in lull and CPI summary judgment in part, reserving the issue of the amount of damages due to CPI for Amour\u2019s failure to pay her account. In July 2014, the District Court entered judgment in favor of CPI in the amount of $7,408.70 in principal plus interest from the date of Smith\u2019s assignment of the account to CPI. Amour appeals the District Court\u2019s entries of summary judgment in favor of CPI and Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b67 We review summary judgment orders de novo. <em>Albert v. City of </em>Billings, 2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates an absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. After the moving party meets its initial burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of fact and entitlement to judgment, the burden shifts to the party opposing summary judgment either to show a triable issue or to show why the undisputed facts do not entitle the moving party to judgment. <em>Phelps v. Frampton, </em>2007 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 300, 170 P.3d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly awarded summary judgment to CPI on Amour\u2019s FDCPA claim because CPI was not attempting to collect a debt regulated by that statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b69 The FDCPA regulates the collection of debts, but only the collection of those debts that fall under the terms of the statute. <em>Hawthorne v. Mac Adjustment, </em>140 F.3d 1367, 1371 (11th Cir. 1998) (\u201cBy the plain terms of the statute, not all obligations to pay are considered \u2018debts\u2019 subject to the FDCPA.\u201d). The FDCPA defines \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201c[AJny obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services, which are the subject of the transaction, are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5). A \u201ctransaction\u201d under the FDCPAmust be a consensual arrangement. <em>Hawthorne, </em>140 F.3d at 1371. Thus, \u201c[w]hen determining whether an obligation is a \u2018debt\u2019 under the statute, courts focus on whether it arose from a consensual consumer transaction for goods or services.\u201d <em>Omran v. Beach Forest Subdivision Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>No. 12-10116, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66277, at *7 (E.D. Mich.) (concluding that fines for breaking subdivision deed restrictions are not debts under the FDCPA); <em>see Gulley v. Markoff &amp; Krasny, </em>664 F.3d 1073, 1075 (7th Cir. 2011) (per curium) (concluding that the FDCPA does not apply to efforts to collect city real estate fines); <em>Hickenv. Arnold, Anderson &amp; Dove, P.L.L.P., </em>137 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1143 (D. Minn. 2001) (concluding that a debt arising out of a marital settlement agreement does not fall within the FDCPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b610  CPI asserts, and the District Court concluded, that Amour\u2019s debt to Smith did not arise out of a consensual transaction. Amour contests this conclusion, arguing that her debt to Smith arose out of the contract that Amour and Smith entered into in February 2008 specifying the amount that Amour would pay Smith for her services. Amour fails to recognize, however, that the February 2008 contract followed the dissolution court\u2019s January 2008 order appointing Smith as GAL and directing that the marital estate would be responsible for paying Smith for her services. In its January 2012 order, the court then assigned half that debt to Amour personally. With or without the contract between Amour and Smith, Amour still would have been under court order for Smith\u2019s services. Indeed, in response to a request for admission, Amour stated that her contract with Smith was \u201ca document I was ordered to sign\u201d by the dissolution court. Amour also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>stated in her complaint that the dissolution court ordered Smith appointed as GAL, and that Amour \u201cdid not want the services of Smith and did not request them.\u201d Under these circumstances, it is clear that Amour's debt to Smith did not arise out of a consensual transaction and therefore that the FDCPA does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b611 Amour also argues that CPI effectively admitted that the FDCPA regulates its debt collection efforts by sending Amour a letter referring to Amour\u2019s account as a \u201cdebt.\u201d But the question is not whether Amour was indebted to Smith; the question is whether the debt is the type of debt that the FDCPA regulates. It is not, because the debt did not arise out of a consensual transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b612  The District Court correctly awarded CPI summary judgment on Amour\u2019s FDCPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b613 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly awarded summary judgment to Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b614 The District Court granted summary judgment to Smith on Amour\u2019s state law claims on two grounds, first, the court determined that Amour failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about those claims, and that, in the absence of such a dispute, Smith was entitled to judgment. Second, the court determined that Smith was due quasi-judicial immunity for her actions as GAL. Amour contests both of these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b615 Amour alleged two claims against Smith: defamation and violation of the Montana Consumer Protection Act. The District Court held that, as a court-appointed GAL, Smith was entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity under \u00a7 2-9-112(2), MCA. That section provides in pertinent part that an \u201cagent of the judiciary is immune from suit for damages arisingfrom the lawful discharge of an official duly associated with judicial actions of the court.\u201d We have extended immunity to participants in the judicial process when they are acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. <em>Steele v. </em>McGregor, 1998 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30, 288 Mont. 238, 956 P.2d 1364.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">Like judicial immunity, quasi-judicial immunity benefits the public \u2014 not the person being sued \u2014 by ensuring that quasi-judicial officers exercise their functions unfettered by fear of legal consequences; also like judicial immunity, quasi-judicial immunity extends only to acts within the scope of the actor\u2019s jurisdiction and with the authorization of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\"><em>Steele, </em>\u00b6 26. Though we have not addressed the application of quasi-judicial immunity to a GAL, other courts have determined that GALs are entitled to absolute quasi-judidal immunity. <em>See Surprenant v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Mulcrone, </em>44 A.3d 465, 468 (N.H. 2012) (\u201cAbsolute judicial immunity attaches when a GAL performs certain delegated duties because of the intimate relationship between the GAL and the court in the judicial process.\u201d) (quoting Marr <em>v. Me. Dept. of Human </em>Servs., 215 F. Supp. 2d 261, 268 (D. Me. 2002)). Courts recognize that judicial immunity protects against harassment by disgruntled parents and ensures the GAL\u2019s independence. <em>See Carrubba v. Moskowitz, </em>877 A.2d 773, 784 (Conn. 2005). \u201cA guardian must be free, in furtherance of the goal for which the appointment was made, to engage in a vigorous and autonomous representation of the child.\u201d <em>Tindell v. Rogosheske, </em>428 N.W.2d 386, 387 (Minn. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b6 16  The District Court\u2019s January24,2008 order appointing Smith as GAL explicitly stated that she was an \u201cagent\u201d of the court \u201cand as such is granted judicial immunity.\u201d The statute authorizing appointment of a GAL in a parenting proceeding makes clear that the GAL is an officer of the court, tasked with conducting investigations, making reports and recommendations to the court, and performing other duties as the court directs. Section40-4-205, MCA. Amour argues that Smith did not act as an agent of the court when she sent Amour a bill and sought to enforce collection. But the law requires the court to \u201center an order for costs and fees in favor of the child\u2019s guardian ad litem,\u201d and directs the order to be made \u201cagainst either or both parents.\u201d Section 40-4-205(4), MCA. Judicial immunity extends to the GAL\u2019s \u201cperformance of duties which are within the scope of such guardian\u2019s authority.\u201d <em>Billups v. Scott, </em>571 N.W.2d 603, 607 (Neb. 1997). Smith\u2019s attempt to enforce collection of payment from Amour was within the scope of her authority as GAL. We agree with the District Court that she is protected by quasi-judicial immunity under \u00a7 2-9-112(2), MCA, from Amour\u2019s Montana Consumer Protection Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b617 Under the circumstances of this case, we find it unnecessary to analyze whether judicial immunity would protect Smith from suit for Amour\u2019s defamation claim, which alleges an intentional tort. Truth is a complete defense against a defamation claim. <em>Citizens First Nat\u2019l Bank of Wolf Point v. Moe Motor Co., </em>248 Mont. 495, 501, 813 P.2d 400, 404 (1991). Smith attached detailed billing statements withher motion for summary judgment. She also attached an affidavit attesting to the accuracy of those statements, to the duties she performed as GAL, and to the fact that Amour never disputed Smith\u2019s services or disputed that she was required to pay for those services until the current litigation. Through this evidence, Smith met her \u201cinitial burden\u201d of establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Phelps, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b618  The burden accordingly shifted to Amour to respond with evidence showing a triable issue on her defamation claim. <em>Phelps, </em>\u00b6 16. Amour responded with interrogatory responses that explained the basis for her claim that Smith misstated Amour\u2019s debt and acted unfairly and deceptively. But these interrogatory responses were not signed. M. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(5) requires that interrogatory responses be signed. \u201c[A] party opposing a motion for summary judgment may not rest upon his pleadings but has an affirmative duty to bring forth <em>sworn </em>testimony or affidavits [that] show a genuine issue.\u201d <em>Wright v. State, </em>231 Mont. 324, 327, 752 P.2d 748, 750 (1988) (emphasis added). We require \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with M. R. Civ. P. 56\u2019s evidentiary requirements. <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe. Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 41, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. Courts do not consider unsworn or unsigned evidence at the summary judgment stage. <em>See Alfson v. Allstate Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 326, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 372 Mont. 363, 313 P.3d 107; <em>Silver v. Foster Wheeler LLC, </em>No. 2:11-CV-64218-ER, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29076, at *9-10 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 25,2012); <em>Overton v. City of Harvey, </em>29 F. Supp. 2d 894, 901 (N.D. Ill. 1998). There was no evidence in the record that the District Court appropriately could consider that raised a triable issue on Amour\u2019s defamation claim. The District Court therefore acted correctly in concluding that Smith was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b619 On appeal, Amour admits that her interrogatory responses were not signed, but argues that she corrected that mistake by later submitting signed versions of those responses. By that time, however, the District Court already had granted Smith summary judgment. A court \u201cneed not consider untimely filed documents in proceedings for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>231 Mont. at 327, 752 P.2d at 750. Further, Amour challenged the performance of Smith\u2019s duties as GAL for the first time after being sued for collection of the debt. The proper time to raise those challenges was in the underlying dissolution proceedings. Amour failed to present substantial evidence essential to her claims. <em>See Smith, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b620 The District Court correctly awarded summary judgment to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b621 <em>3. Whether the District Court correctly awarded CPI $7,408.70 in damages plus interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b622 In its November 2013 summary judgment order, the District Court, mindful that CPI and Smith had provided several different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>figures for the amount of debt that Amour owed, reserved the issue of the amount of damages due to CPI. A few months later, CPI moved for summary judgment on the amount of damages, attaching an affidavit from Smith stating that the amount owed was $7,408.70, and including billing statements accounting for that figure. The District Court then entered judgment in CPI\u2019s favor in that number, plus interest, and appropriate costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">\u00b623 On appeal, Amour argues that the District Court improperly resolved a factual dispute by determining that Amour owed $7,408.70 in principal. We disagree. CPI met its initial burden by submitting Smith\u2019s affidavit and billing statements showing that $7,408.70 was due. The burden then shifted to Amour to identify evidence calling into question the accuracy of the amount billed. Amour instead submitted interrogatory responses that baldly alleged that Smith ran up charges without providing evidence to support that allegation. Additionally, the interrogatory responses attacked the competency with which Smith performed her actions as GAL, but Amour did not provide evidence that Smith did not in fact perform the actions that accounted for the debt of $7,408.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b624 Amour also appeals the District Court\u2019s award of interest on the principal amount. However, \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Each person who is entitled to recover damages certain or capable of being made certain by calculation and the right to recover that is vested in the person upon a particular day is entitled also to recover interest on the damages from that day except during the time that the debtor is prevented by law or by the act of the creditor from the debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Section 27-1-211, MCA, has three requirements: (1) an underlying monetary obligation, (2) an amount of recovery that is certain or capable of being made certain by calculation, and (3) a right to recover that vests on a particular day. <em>LHC, Inc. v. Alvarez, </em>2007 MT123, \u00b6 29, 337 Mont. 294, 160 P.3d 502. All three requirements are met in this case. The District Court determined that there is an underlying monetary obligation, and that the right to recover vested in CPI after Smith assigned her account to CPI in November 2011. All of the billed-for actions occurred before November 2011. Amour disputes the amount that CPI should recover, but \u201c \u2018the fact that a claim is disputed does not make it uncertain,\u2019 as long as the damage amount is reduced to certainty on a particular day.\u201d <em>LHC, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Safeco Ins. Co v. Lovely Agency, </em>215 Mont. 420, 425, 697 P.3d 1354, 1357 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s November 2013 summary judgment order and July 2014 judgment in favor of CPI are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, McKINNON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
