Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 12, 2017, a man entered a Petco store on Taylor Road in Reynoldsburg Ohio and stole more than $4,000 in flea and tick medication. Three store employees witnessed the theft and one took photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Fairfield County Grand Jury subsequently returned an indictment charging appellant with one count of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2), a felony of the fifth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 27, 2017, the matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the conclusion of the state's evidence, counsel for appellant made a Crim.R 29 motion for acquittal. Counsel did not argue that the state had failed to prove venue. The trial court, however, raised the issue sua sponte. The court concluded that although the state had failed to present evidence of venue, sufficient facts were presented from which reasonable minds could differ as to whether the state had proved venue beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant then rested without presenting evidence and without renewing his Crim.R 29 motion for acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 28, 2017, the jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty as charged. He was subsequently sentenced to a 6-month prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant filed an appeal and the matter is now before this court for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN PERMITTING THE INTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE CASE BELOW.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL HEREIN.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court should have granted his motion for a directed verdict. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant concedes he did not raise the issue of venue when he made his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal and further concedes he failed to renew his motion after resting his case. In such a circumstance, it would normally be proper to consider proof of venue waived. We find, however, it is appropriate to consider the argument under a plain-error analysis, since the failure to prove venue does affect a substantial right.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In overruling appellant's motion for acquittal, the trial court did so without permitting the state to reopen its case to establish venue, and without taking judicial notice that venue had been established. The court found that although there had been no express testimony concerning venue, there were enough facts and circumstances in evidence for reasonable minds to differ as to whether venue was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
