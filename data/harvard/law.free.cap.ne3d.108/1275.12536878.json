He was sentenced to five years in prison. We affirmed his conviction on appeal, but noted that the trial court had incorrectly classified Rucker as a Tier III sex offender under Ohio's version of the Adam Walsh Act (\"AWA\"). We remanded the cause for the trial court to correct its judgment entry to reflect that Rucker was a Tier II sex offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Rucker\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

The trial court did not carry out our order on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 8, 2015, after Rucker was released from prison, he filed a pro se \"Motion for Re-Sentencing Based on Void Judgment/and or Motion to Dismiss the Defendant's Classification as Tier Sex Offender or Child-Victim Offender * * *.\" Rucker's counsel filed an \"Amended Motion for Relief from Sanctions Imposed Pursuant to Sentence,\" arguing that the trial court had failed to properly notify Rucker of postrelease control, that Rucker's release from prison had deprived the court of authority to correct the postrelease-control notification, and that therefore, Rucker could not be subject to postrelease control. Rucker also argued that because he had been released from prison, the trial court was without authority to classify him as a Tier II sex offender \"pursuant to the principles applicable to\" postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court overruled Rucker's amended motion. The court found that postrelease control had been properly imposed. The court also determined that it was bound by our order of remand to modify Rucker's sex-offender classification to Tier II. The court stated in its entry overruling the motion that \"Rucker's classification will be modified under a separate entry to Tier II.\" The trial court did not journalize a separate entry. Rucker appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Rucker\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.
