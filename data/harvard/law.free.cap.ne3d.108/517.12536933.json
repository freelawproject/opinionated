Clapp, Assistant Public Defender, 125 East Erie Street, Painesville, OH 44077 (For Defendant-Appellant).\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   CYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Dawud Wilson, appeals his conviction and sentence, following his no contest plea to robbery and a repeat violent offender specification, in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas. The principal issue is whether the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion to suppress. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 1, 2015, appellant was indicted for aggravated robbery, a felony-one, with a repeat violent offender (\"RVO\") specification (Count 1); robbery, a felony-two, with an RVO specification (Count 2); and receiving stolen property, a\n   felony-five (Count 3). Appellant pled not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 16, 2015, appellant filed a motion to suppress, arguing the sheriff's deputy lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him. Evidence at the suppression hearing revealed that on April 17, 2015, at about 1:00 p.m., appellant walked into the Buckeye Credit Union in Painesville Township and handed the teller a note, saying he had a loaded gun on him and to place all the bills from her drawer on the counter. Appellant's note indicated that if she did not follow the instructions in the note, he would use the gun to hurt her. The teller produced $1,972. Appellant took the money and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Lake County Sheriff's deputies immediately responded. Based on information provided by deputies, dispatch issued a \"Be On The Lookout\" broadcast to area law enforcement agencies with a description of the suspect and his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Deputy William Leonello, a 34-year veteran police officer, said he was on duty at the intersection of Route 84 and Route 91, when he heard a broadcast from dispatch that a robbery had just occurred at the Buckeye Credit Union at the intersection of Fairgrounds Road and Route 20. Dispatch described the suspect as a black male dressed in black clothing with a beard driving a small tan or gold pickup truck, possibly a Chevrolet S-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Initially, Deputy Leonello planned to go to Route 2 to try to locate the suspect, but dispatch then said the suspect was last seen driving south on a side street off Woodland Road. As a result, the deputy took Route 91 to I-90. He drove east on I-90 and then stopped in a turnaround near Route 306. Turnarounds on I-90 connect the eastbound and westbound lanes of traffic. While positioned perpendicular to I-90 westbound, Deputy Leonello observed oncoming traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Deputy Leonello said he was not just looking for Chevrolet S-10s; he was looking for any vehicle that fit the description, such as a Ford Ranger. The deputy said he was there for less than two minutes when he saw a small tan pickup truck, a Ford Ranger, travelling westbound. The deputy saw the driver was a black male wearing dark clothing; however, he could not see whether the driver had a beard because he was looking away from him. The truck was in the left (high-speed) lane, but travelling at a normal rate of speed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Deputy Leonello said that as the truck passed him, he still could not see the driver's face because he turned his head to the right and did not look toward him. The deputy then pulled out into the westbound lanes of travel and followed the truck. He was planning to stop and identify the driver. The deputy did not, however, activate his overhead lights; he just followed him, trying to get the number on his license plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Then, as Deputy Leonello went under the Route 306 bridge, dispatch said the suspect vehicle was a tan Ford Ranger, not a Chevrolet S-10. The deputy said the truck he was following matched that description. He also said the description he had of the suspect fit the description of the male he was following, but he still could not tell if the driver had a beard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Deputy Leonello tried to call for back up, but could not get through. As he approached the Kirtland Road bridge, he saw a Willoughby Police cruiser positioned in a turnaround just west of the bridge. The deputy continued to follow the suspect, but still did not activate his overhead lights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The driver of the Willoughby Police cruiser positioned in the turnaround was Willoughby Police officer Charles Krejsa, a 20-year veteran police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   He testified he heard dispatch broadcast that a robbery had just occurred at the credit union. He heard the dispatch describe the suspect as a black male wearing a black shirt with a beard who had stolen cash and left the scene. After hearing the suspect was last seen driving south on Fairgrounds Road toward Route 84, Officer Krejsa believed the suspect was headed for I-90. As a result, the officer drove to Route 84, then to Route 306, and then onto I-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Officer Krejsa said that about five minutes after he heard the initial dispatch, he pulled into the turnaround at the Kirtland Road overpass. Officer Krejsa said this location was about ten minutes away from where the suspect was last seen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Officer Krejsa said he was observing westbound traffic for one to two minutes when he saw a small, tan Ford Ranger pickup truck in the left-hand lane. He said that because it was similar to an S-10, it was \"immediately apparent\" this truck matched the description of the suspect vehicle. He said the radio band he was using does not provide all information being broadcast, and he did not hear the subsequent broadcast that the suspect vehicle was a Ford Ranger. Officer Krejsa said that as the driver of the truck drove by, he saw the driver was a black male wearing a black shirt; however, he said he could not see whether the driver had a beard because the male was looking away from him as he drove by.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Officer Krejsa said he pulled out to follow the truck and, as he did, he noticed a Lake County Sheriff's vehicle was following the truck. Officer Krejsa said his intent was to see if there was any additional information he could get to \"cement [his] suspicions\" that this was the suspect vehicle. Officer Krejsa said that the overhead lights of the Sheriff's Office's cruiser were not activated at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Deputy Leonello testified that he radioed dispatch for a registration check on the truck. He provided the license plate number and a description of the truck. He did not hear back from dispatch, but, based on the information he had, he decided to stop the driver of the truck. Deputy Leonello activated his overhead lights. Officer Krejsa said that, in order to provide back up, he also activated his overheads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The officers testified the driver pulled his truck across the three lanes of traffic to the right berm without incident. Deputy Leonello exited his cruiser and Officer Krejsa parked behind his vehicle and exited his. Deputy Leonello called out to the driver, later identified as appellant, to exit his vehicle; keep his hands where he could see them; turn around; and walk backwards toward him. Appellant complied. Officer Krejsa told appellant he was being detained but not arrested and mirandized him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The officers saw appellant was wearing a black shirt and dark pants. Both said that appellant did not have a beard, but he had what appeared to be glue on his jaw and under his lower lip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The officers secured appellant in Officer Krejsa's cruiser because it was equipped with video and they then approached appellant's truck. They did not enter the truck at that time, but from the outside, they saw a black jacket in the back seat with $50 bills protruding from the pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant did not present any opposing testimony or evidence and, thus, the officers' testimony was undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} When appellant's vehicle was later inventoried, officers found his robbery note on the floor near the center console; the exact amount of cash stolen from the\n   bank in appellant's jacket, which was \"bait\" money (cash that is recorded for tracking purposes); and a three-page list of other banks with their locations, escape routes, and appellant's notes as to whether or not they would be good targets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On October 19, 2015, pursuant to the parties' plea bargain, appellant pled no contest to robbery and the RVO specification as charged in Count 2 in exchange for the state's agreement to dismiss the remaining counts. The court found appellant's plea was voluntary, accepted the plea, and found him guilty of robbery and the RVO specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 23} At his sentencing, the trial court reiterated its findings under the RVO statute and sentenced appellant as an RVO. The court sentenced him to eight years in prison for robbery and to two years for the RVO specification, the two terms to be served consecutively to each other, for a total of ten years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellant appeals, asserting three assignments of error. For his first, he alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"The trial court erred by denying the defendant-appellant's motion to suppress in violation of his due process rights and rights against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 10 and 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant argues Deputy Leonello lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him and, thus, any evidence obtained as a result of the stop must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellate review of a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence presents a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Burrows\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2000-T-0089,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20605106\">\n    2002 WL 605106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *5 (Apr. 19, 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Based on our review of the evidence, Deputy Leonello had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity that warranted his investigatory stop of appellant. The deputy, who has 34 years experience as a police officer, learned from dispatch that a bank robbery had just been committed. Dispatch provided the deputy with the suspect's last known location and direction of travel, which led the deputy to conclude that the suspect would likely be headed to I-90 as a means of escape. Further, the deputy obtained a description of the suspect and his vehicle. In less than two minutes from establishing his position in the turnaround, Deputy Leonello saw appellant's vehicle, which matched the description of the suspect's truck in terms of the color, size, make, and model. Significantly, the deputy did not stop appellant until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   dispatch advised the suspect vehicle was a Ford Ranger. Further, dispatch described the suspect as a black male wearing black clothing and a beard. When appellant passed Deputy Leonello while travelling westbound on I-90, the deputy saw a black male wearing dark clothes. The only reason the deputy was unable to confirm whether appellant had a beard was because he turned away when he saw the deputy. Appellant thus matched the suspect's description in terms of his gender, race, and clothing. As a result, when the deputy stopped appellant, he had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was the robber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    State v. Woods\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Lake No. 99-L-111,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201370850\">\n    2000 WL 1370850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sep. 22, 2000), in which this court invalidated a stop, is misplaced as its facts are easily distinguishable from those presented here. In\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , the officer testified he stopped the defendant because he matched the suspect's description and made furtive movements. However, the suspect was described as wearing a black hooded nylon coat, while the defendant was wearing a green coat with a fur collar. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   the officer's decision to look for the suspect near the entrance of the freeway was based only on a hunch that the freeway was the most likely means of escape, whereas, here, dispatch advised officers of appellant's escape route. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , the officer was not informed the suspect had a vehicle and thus was not informed of the description of a vehicle, while here, before Deputy Leonello stopped appellant, he had been informed\n   that the suspect was driving a tan Ford Ranger and that was exactly the type of vehicle appellant was driving. Further, while this court in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   held that the act of the defendant in turning his face from police was not a furtive movement, here, the state did not argue appellant's similar action was a furtive movement.

Thus, for RVO purposes, it makes no sense to draw a distinction between stipulations regarding the facts of a prior conviction and the facts of a current conviction. Once the defendant admits the facts recited by the prosecutor supporting a conviction, either prior or current, those facts are no longer in dispute. As the Court in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   said, where the defendant stipulates \"to all the facts necessary for the trial court to designate him as a repeat violent offender,\" \"the trial court ha[s] no need to conduct fact-finding * * * and no Sixth Amendment violation occurred * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32-33. That is exactly what happened here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 93} The dissent's reliance on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Payne, supra,\n   </em>\n   in which this court held that the trial court violated\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , is misplaced as the facts in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable. Payne's case was tried by a jury, which found him guilty of the underlying offenses. At sentencing, the court enhanced the defendant's sentence based on the court's findings-from the testimony presented-that Payne caused physical harm in his prior conviction and serious physical harm in his current conviction, per the former RVO statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107-108. Payne did not waive the jury as to the specification and\n   <em>\n    did not stipulate to the necessary findings,\n   </em>\n   and this court properly held the trial court's fact-finding regarding his prior and current convictions violated\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 94} In contrast, here, appellant pled no contest to robbery\n   <em>\n    and the specification, thus waiving the jury as to both,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    admitted all facts necessary for the RVO specification\n   </em>\n   as recited in the prosecutor's statement of facts. Before pleading, appellant told the court he would be admitting (1) the facts alleged in the indictment and (2)\n   <em>\n    the facts to be presented by the prosecutor\n   </em>\n   . Before hearing from the prosecutor, the court advised appellant, and he said he understood, that \"there needs to be a finding, which would be today, that you threatened serious physical harm to the victim * * *.\" After the court notified him of this element, appellant said he was (1) voluntarily pleading no contest to robbery and the specification and (2)\n   <em>\n    asking the court to accept his plea.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Then, during the prosecutor's statement of facts, he said appellant handed the robbery note to the teller. In that note, appellant informed her that he had a loaded gun on him and indicated he would hurt her with it unless she followed his demands.\n   <em>\n    After hearing the facts as outlined by the prosecutor, appellant admitted they were true\n   </em>\n   . He thus essentially admitted he threatened to cause the teller serious physical harm. Appellant again asked the court to accept his plea. The court then found that appellant threatened to inflict serious physical harm on the teller, thus triggering the RVO statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 96} After making this finding, the court instructed appellant to again review the plea form to\n   <em>\n    make sure he still wanted to plead\n   </em>\n   based on the court's findings and\n   <em>\n    to only sign the form if that was still his wish\n   </em>\n   . After again reviewing the form with his attorney, appellant signed it, and the court found him guilty of robbery and the RVO specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Since appellant waived his right to have the jury try the specification and\n   admitted all facts necessary to enhance his sentence as an RVO, the trial court did not commit plain error in sentencing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 98} For his third and final assigned error, appellant alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 99} \"The trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to a maximum, eight-year prison sentence for robbery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 100} Appellant concedes the trial court was required by R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) to impose the longest possible prison term for his robbery offense (eight years) because the court also imposed a prison term for the RVO specification. He also concedes the trial court was not required to make any particular findings before imposing a maximum sentence and that, in imposing such sentence, the court was only required to consider the sentencing factors in R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. However, he argues that because, in his view, the court's finding that he threatened to cause serious physical harm (as to the RVO specification) was contrary to law, the eight-year term for robbery should also be vacated due to the court's alleged errors in imposing that sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 101} First, appellant argues the court erred in finding that the teller suffered serious psychological harm per R.C. 2929.12(B)(2) because, in his view, that finding was not supported by the record. However, in considering this seriousness factor, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 102} There was also serious psychological harm caused to the teller. Certainly, even though I don't have a written victim impact statement, I can imagine receiving the note * * * and the fear, the terror, [and] the concern for one's life and * * * well-being * * *. So I do find that there was serious psychological harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 103} The trial court thus found that serious psychological harm was a natural consequence of appellant giving the teller the note during the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 104} Further, appellant's own words at sentencing helped prove the psychological harm his actions caused the teller when he stated: \"I do realize that my actions have caused a negative impact on [the tellers'] lives * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 105} Second, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that no less seriousness factors were present because appellant said at sentencing that he did not intend to harm the teller. Appellant argues this comment supported the less serious factor in R.C. 2929.12(C)(3) (that the offender did not expect to cause physical harm). However, \"[a] trial court is not required to give any particular weight * * * to a given set of circumstances; it is merely required to consider the statutory factors * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. DelManzo\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.

Thus, despite appellant's comment at sentencing, the court was not required to give it any weight. The trial court was able to observe appellant while testifying and, in finding that no less serious factors were present, the court, as the trier of fact, obviously found appellant's comment lacked credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 106} Based on our review of the record, the court considered the purposes and principles of felony sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness factors in R.C. 2929.11 in imposing appellant's sentence.

Crim.R. 11(B)(2). Appellant pled no contest to robbery, a second-degree felony of which \"serious physical harm\" is not an element. The indictment did not allege \"serious physical harm\" in the robbery count or in the attached RVO specification. Therefore, not even a jury would have been permitted to find that appellant threatened \"serious physical harm\" to the victim under that count. As such, the trial court violated appellant's right to procedural due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Russell v.

This amounted to a violation of appellant's Sixth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 121} The trial court was only permitted to enhance appellant's sentence relative to the RVO specification if a\n   <em>\n    trier of fact\n   </em>\n   found appellant's actions threatened, attempted, or resulted in \"serious physical harm\" to the victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under the RVO statute at that time, the trial court was required, inter alia, to make an independent, judicial finding that \"serious physical harm\" occurred, or had been attempted, in the current conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106, citing former R.C. 2929.01(DD). This court held that the trial court's finding of \"serious physical harm,\" as it related to the current conviction, went \"beyond what is constitutionally permissible under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   ; i.e., any fact,\n   <em>\n    other than a prior conviction\n   </em>\n   , must be determined by a jury or admitted by the appellant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114 (emphasis sic). We held the defendant's constitutional rights, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , were violated even though, at the time, the finding of \"serious physical harm\" was required when initially designating a defendant an RVO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113. A constitutional violation is even more apparent when, as here, the trial court acts as the trier of fact under the current statutory scheme, because this finding must now be applied at the sentencing phase to enhance the penalty of a defendant who has already been designated an RVO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

To suggest there was an admission or stipulation of \"serious physical harm\" is a complete distortion of the record. Even the trial court understood that appellant had neither admitted nor stipulated to \"serious physical harm,\" which is why the court stated it was required to make this finding \"as the trier of fact.\" Again, a trial court does not\n   <em>\n    try\n   </em>\n   facts at a plea or sentencing hearing. Nevertheless, the court stated: \"And again there needs to be a finding, which would be today, that you threatened serious physical harm to the victim in this particular case as well, or inflicted physical harm. Having sat through some earlier hearings, I think it was the threat of physical harm that's the real issue.\" It is also noteworthy that the trial court, in its initial statement of findings, concluded: \"The Court specifically finds * * * [appellant] did threaten to inflict\n   <em>\n    physical harm\n   </em>\n   on the employee of Buckeye State Credit Union by virtue of the written letter[.]\" However, the court subsequently stated: \"The Court also makes the finding that the Defendant did, in the commission of the crime here today, threaten to cause\n   <em>\n    serious physical harm\n   </em>\n   to a person, thereby triggering the RVO.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 124} Appellant did admit to certain facts as presented by the prosecutor, e.g., that he handed a note to the teller indicating he was carrying a firearm. The majority is suggesting that because those facts may be sufficient to support a finding of \"serious physical harm,\" the trial court was permitted to act as the trier of fact and enhance appellant's sentence accordingly. On that basis, the trial court could find appellant guilty of anything, regardless of the indictment or plea, based on a prosecutor's statement. Further, a statement of facts by a prosecutor in the face of a no contest plea does not constitute evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Magnone\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7100\">\n    2016-Ohio-7100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%20212\">\n    72 N.E.3d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46, citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, although appellant admitted to the facts as presented by the prosecutor at his plea hearing, that does not equate to an admission or stipulation to the characterization of those facts as threatening \"serious physical harm.\" The trial court was not permitted to find that those facts equated to \"serious physical harm\" in order to enhance appellant's sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 125} The majority opinion completely mischaracterizes and distorts what is stated in this dissent. The distinction between (a) factual findings that were properly made in a case already concluded, of which a future court may take judicial notice, and (b) factual findings that must be made by a trier of fact in a case still pending before the court, has been explained herein and cannot be made more clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 126} To summarize, there are two serious flaws in this case. First, appellant never, at any time, admitted or stipulated to threatening \"serious physical harm.\" The prosecutor never stated that appellant threatened \"serious physical harm.\" Nevertheless, the trial court proceeded to make a factual finding based on the facts presented by the prosecutor. Second, that finding was made even though it was not alleged in the indicted count to which appellant pled no contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 127} Appellant's two-year sentence for the RVO specification should be vacated, and this matter should be remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
