Appellant also made a claim for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} By Opinion and Entry filed March 7, 2017, Appellant's causes of action for Disability Discrimination and punitive damages were dismissed pursuant to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 28, 2017, a bench trial commenced in this matter on the remaining causes of action. At trial, the court heard testimony from Appellant, Appellee Matt Thompson and Rob Nixon, an independent contractor who worked with Appellant for Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Based on the testimony and evidence presented at trial, the court found that while Appellant was an employee of Fence Solutions prior to September, 2015, his status changed to that of an independent contractor on or around September 14, 2015. The court further found that Appellant was an independent contractor when his employment was terminated from Fence Solutions. The court made additional findings that while employed by Fence Solutions, Appellant was paid at least minimum wage and that he received all overtime pay owed to him. The court found that Appellee Matt Thompson did not breach any duty owed to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"I.

In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , this matter was tried to the bench so the trial court was the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Here, Appellant signed an independent contractor agreement which stated that he was responsible for furnishing his own labor, equipment and/or tools; that Fence Solutions was not responsible for any accidents, stolen tools, or materials or other liabilities of Appellant; Appellant was responsible for his own damages and repairs; Appellant was responsible for his own taxes; Appellant was responsible for any personal injury; Appellant was responsible for his employees, subcontractors, materials, equipment, and all applicable taxes, benefits, and insurance, including Workers' Compensation. Additionally, the agreement stated that while Fence Solutions can control the quality of the work, the subcontractor is an independent contractor in all respects. The contract also provided that payment was to be given after completion of the job and satisfaction of the contractor and owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} At trial, Appellant admitted that he was responsible for his own equipment and that he provided his own labor and equipment (T. at 145-146). Testimony was presented that Appellant was responsible for lost or damaged tools, the quality of his work, any accidents and all materials on the job site. (T. at 180-185). Testimony was also presented that Appellant could control the hours he worked at a job site and could hire other subcontractors. (T. at 186-190). Rob Nixon, a fellow independent contractor employed by Fence Solutions, stated that Appellant would often borrow/use Nixon's equipment. (T. at 243). The court also heard testimony that all of the independent contractors who worked for Fence Solutions, including Appellant were responsible for obtaining their own Workers' Compensation insurance and that all except Appellant had in fact done so. (T. at 186-187).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} While Appellant argues that Fence Solutions use of a W-2 rather than a 1099 supports the position that he was an employee, we do not find same to be determinative of his employment status. Matt Thompson testified that he did not know why the accountant continued to issue a W-2 to Appellant rather than a 1099 after Appellant signed the independent contractor agreement. (T. at 182, 213-214). Evidence was also presented that Fence Solutions did not withhold Federal, State or Local income taxes from Appellant's check, but rather paid said taxes for him, in addition to his paid wages. (T. 182, 214-216).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the Industrial Commission's ruling wherein it found Appellant to be an employee of Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The Industrial Commission is the exclusive evaluator of the weight and credibility of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Thus, the issue before us is whether the bureau's order was supported by evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In the instant case, the trial court, in its March 7, 2017, Judgment Entry, characterized the Industrial Commission's ruling as a default judgment because Appellee did not participate in the proceeding. The trial court further found that the sole evidence before the Industrial Commission was a medical record from Fairfield Medical Center dated 11/4/15, and that such evidence did not allow for a conclusive determination that Appellant was an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Upon review, we find that the trial court was in a better position as the trier of fact to make the determination as to Appellant's status. At trial, both parties had an opportunity to present evidence in support of their positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the findings of the Industrial Commission and making a determination finding that Appellant was an independent contractor. We find the trial court had sufficient evidence before it to support its determination Appellee was an independent contractor, rather than an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant's First Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In his Second Assignment of Error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that Appellant was terminated for breach of his independent contractor agreement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellant herein argues that his termination was the result of retaliation for filing a Workers' Compensation claim in violation of R.C. \u00a7 4123.90, which prohibits employers from taking an adverse employment action against an employee because he filed, or pursued, a workers' compensation claim for an injury which arose and occurred in the course of his employment with the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 28} R.C. \u00a7 4123.90 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   No employer shall discharge, demote, reassign, or take any punitive action against any employee because the employee filed a claim or instituted, pursued or testified in any proceedings under the workers' compensation act for an injury or occupational disease which occurred in the course of and arising out of his employment with that employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} \"The scope of the statute is nevertheless narrow, and R.C. \u00a7 4123.90 does not prevent an employer from [taking an adverse employment action against] an employee who is unable to perform his or her duties * * * [or] for just and lawful reasons.
