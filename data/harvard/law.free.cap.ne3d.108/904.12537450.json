Prior to the Indianapolis Historical Preservation Commission (\"IHPC\") proceedings at issue, the Site was zoned SU-7, which only allows charitable, philanthropic, and not-for-profit use. The Site sits between north East Street and Park Avenue just south of 9th Street and is in the Chatham-Arch and Massachusetts Avenue Historic Preservation District. David Pflugh is an attorney who lives at 847 North Park Avenue, directly across Park Avenue from the northeast corner of the Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [2] The Site currently is occupied by a vacant nursery school building constructed in the 1970s and a single house at 812 North Park Avenue that was built in 1894. Across Park Avenue to the east are historic homes, across 9th Street to the north is the Chatham Center (which includes apartments and retail space, including a pet groomer, a hair salon, and a doctor's office), and across East Street to the west are the fifteen-story Lugar Towers apartments. The Chatham-Arch and Massachusetts Avenue Historic Area Preservation Plan (\"the CAMA Plan\"), adopted in 2006, designates the nursery school building as \"Non-Contributing Non-Historic[.]\" Appellees' App. Vol. 2, p. 142. The CAMA Plan has a site-specific recommendation for the Site that calls for D-8 zoning\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with \"higher density residential, such as town houses, along East St.\" and \"lower density, single-family and two-family houses, along Park [Ave.].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [3] On September 1, 2016, Vezolles petitioned the IHPC to rezone the Site from SU-7 to what was ultimately changed to D-8 to allow for a new development called Chatham Park (the \"Project\") to replace the vacant nursery school building. Vezolles proposed building seven single-family homes and two duplexes on the east side of the Site and two condominium buildings with a total of fifty-five units on the west side. Following is a site plan which provides an overview of the area and depicts how the Site would look once the Project is completed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellees' Br. p. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [4] The IHPC held four public hearings on December 7, 2016; February 1, 2017; April 5, 2017; and May 3, 2017, at which concerned citizens, including Pflugh, testified. On May 3, 2017, the IHPC entered written findings approving the Project. Specifically, the IHPC rezoned the entire Site to D-8, granted a use variance permitting a small commercial use in one corner of the Site, granted four development-standard variances, and issued a certificate of appropriateness (\"COA\"). The retail space is directly across 9th Street from similar retail space in Chatham Center and is 2400 square feet, and the use variance specifically excludes twenty-nine categories of commercial use that could be detrimental\n   to the neighborhood. The zoning commitments include other restrictions, including hours restrictions and noise restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [5] In addition to the use variance for retail, the IHPC granted Vezolles four development-standard variances, allowing for less open space at the Site and reducing the livability-space ratio and floor-area ratio for the buildings to be built along East Street. Both variances are typically needed for residential development in downtown urban areas. Without the livability-ratio variance, the Site could not be developed with higher-density residential structures along East Street as called for in the CAMA Plan, and high-density residential development would likely be required along Park Avenue (directly across from Pflugh's house) where the CAMA Plan calls for single- and two-family dwellings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [6] On June 2, 2017, Pflugh petitioned for judicial review of the grant of variances and the COA. Pflugh challenged the use variance, the development standard variance for less open space than required, the development standard variance for livability ratio, and the COA. On January 22, 2018, the trial court denied Pflugh's petition. The trial court concluded that Pflugh lacked standing to seek judicial review because Pflugh is not aggrieved by the IHPC's decision. The trial court also concluded that even if Pflugh had standing, the IHPC's decision was not \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; without observance of procedure required by law; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\" Appellees' App. Vol. 2, p. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

Ct. App. 2008). Pflugh apparently interprets the Indiana Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Bagnall\n   </em>\n   as setting forth the proposition that adjacent property owners are automatically aggrieved. A close reading of\n   <em>\n    Bagnall\n   </em>\n   indicates otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [11] Far from holding that adjacent property owners are automatically aggrieved, the\n   <em>\n    Bagnall\n   </em>\n   Court merely noted that the appellee conceded \"that a sufficient legal interest is present in zoning cases if the petitioner owns property that is 'adjacent' to or 'surrounding' the subject property[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Bagnall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533002\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/726/782/\">\n    726 N.E.2d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is not the same thing as explicitly adopting the proposition. Moreover, the Court did not reach the question of the aggrieved status of adjacent landowners such as Pflugh, as the property at issue in that case was not, in fact, adjacent to the rezoned property. Finally, after mentioning the concession, the Court reiterated that an aggrieved person must present evidence that the \"zoning variance would result in infringement of a legal right resulting in\n   <em>\n    pecuniary injury\n   </em>\n   as required by [\n   <em>\n    Williams-Woodland Park Neighborhood Ass'n v.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bagnall\n   </em>\n   , Pflugh must show pecuniary or special injury, and the trial court specifically found that he had failed to do so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Even given the proximity of Pflugh's property to the Site on which the variances have been granted, Pflugh has not demonstrated the type of substantial grievance or pecuniary harm required to show he has been \"aggrieved.\" With regard to the use variance, Pflugh complains there will be additional noise and traffic near his home, but does not direct this Court to any other harms. Our Indiana Court of Appeals has held that increased noise and traffic do not qualify as a \"special injury\" and thus additional noise and traffic is insufficient to confer standing as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Reed v. Plan Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9205218\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/810/1126/\">\n    810 N.E.2d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1128 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004). With regard to the development standard variances, Pflugh argues that \"[i]t is foreseeable that [the variance] will put children in the street batting baseballs into Pflugh's yard because there is so little open space[.]\" (Pflugh Reply Br. at 16.) Finally, with regard to the COA, Pflugh makes no\n   argument that he is harmed by its issuance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellees' App. Vol. 2, p. 21. The trial court further found that \"[e]ach of the arguments Pflugh makes regarding harm are harms that would be common to the community as a whole. As Pflugh has failed to show the variances cause a special injury to him, he has failed to meet his burden of showing he has been aggrieved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [13] The trial court found that Pflugh failed to establish that he was particularly harmed, and it is well-settled that we will not set aside a trial court's findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Bagnall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533002\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/726/782/\">\n    726 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   786 (citing Ind.

Pflugh does not claim, much less establish, that the trial court's findings are clearly erroneous. In the end, none of Pflugh's specific complaints allege any fiduciary harm or a harm that would not be common to the community as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [14] This is consistent with our decision in\n   <em>\n    MacFadyen v.

App. 2016), in which we concluded that an adjoining landowner did not have standing to challenge a zoning board decision.

Damages shall be in the Court's discretion and may include attorney's fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Our discretion to award attorney fees under Indiana Appellate Rule 66(E) is limited, however, to instances when an appeal is permeated with meritlessness, bad faith, frivolity, harassment, vexatiousness, or purpose of delay.\n   <em>\n    Orr v.
