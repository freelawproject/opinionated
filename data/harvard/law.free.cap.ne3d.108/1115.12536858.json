Appellant assigns as error ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a suppression motion alleging the first search warrant was based on stale information. He contends the court erred in admitting ballistics testimony where the expert could not identify or exclude two firearms as having fired a bullet recovered from the victim's skull. He complains an anthropologist testified to a matter which was outside her area of expertise and which was not specified in her report. He also contests the admission of other acts evidence from three witnesses, adding confrontation clause and hearsay arguments as well. For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant and Tracey Heskett (the victim) were married for a brief time in 1998. After some time apart, they resumed a relationship which ebbed and flowed over the course of 15 years. Appellant voiced he could not \"get rid of her\" and said he called her \"herpes\" as a result. He said he \"cussed her every day\" calling her a \"drunken whore, thieving bitch.\" (St.Ex. 36). The victim lived in a trailer on her mother's property, and Appellant lived in a house in the same township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On February 13, 2015, Appellant picked up the victim at her trailer. She left her phone with her aunt, who moved in with her two weeks prior. The victim later called her aunt, voicing she had to sneak Appellant's phone to make the call after he threw her out by the hair. (4 Tr. 149).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim's aunt then drove to Appellant's house to retrieve the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The next day, Saturday, February 14, 2015, Appellant called the victim at 4:30 a.m. He accused her of stealing his two wallets and threatened to report her to the police if she did not come over to find or return his wallets. (4 Tr. 150); (St.Ex. 36). They spoke again at 5:33 a.m. (2 Tr. 13-14). The victim left in her vehicle at approximately 6:30 a.m. Leaving her phone with her aunt, she instructed her aunt to call Appellant's phone if she did not return by 9:00 a.m. (4 Tr. 152). The victim never returned. Her aunt called Appellant's phone throughout the weekend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On Monday morning, February 16, 2015, the victim's aunt contacted the Monroe County Sheriff's Office to report the victim was missing. An officer visited Appellant's residence around 9:00 a.m. Appellant invited the officer into his house. Appellant confirmed the victim arrived at his house before daylight on the morning of February 14, 2015. (1 Tr. 304). According to Appellant: two \"pipeliners\" arrived in front of his house in a white company truck just after daylight and sounded the horn; when he went outside, one of the men asked if Tracey was there; and the victim walked toward the truck, passing him without making any comment. (1 Tr. 304).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The victim's vehicle was in Appellant's driveway covered with two to four inches of snow. The officer found the victim's\n   driver's license in the center console of her vehicle. Appellant's vehicle was in the driveway, and it was free from snow. Appellant opened his vehicle for the officer and consented to the officer looking around his home. The house appeared \"uninhabitable\" to the officer, and thus, he could not discern if anything appeared out of place. (1 Tr. 308).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant said the victim did not remove her coat while at his house and was wearing a turquoise-green coat, a brown knit hat, and multiple layers of clothing. (1 Tr. 305-306). The victim's aunt confirmed the victim was wearing a turquoise jacket and a brown knit hat. She noted the victim always wore multiple layers of clothing and described some of the layers the victim wore that day: a red plaid shirt, a pink shirt, other top layers, and jeans with pants underneath. (4 Tr. 153). After speaking to the victim's aunt, the officer returned to Appellant's house. This time, the officer looked upstairs where he noticed two firearms in Appellant's bedroom. (1 Tr. 315).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Sheriff's Office distributed missing person fliers, visited businesses, and went to various well sites and well pads due to Appellant's \"pipeliner\" story. They investigated at least three tips which did not add to the investigation: the victim's sister-in-law asked the police to check an illegal dump site; a driver saw a woman urinating next to a truck along a road; and a store employee heard a \"pipeliner\" make a sarcastic remark about the missing person flier. Appellant reiterated his story (about pipeliners picking up the victim) to an officer who visited him on February 20, 2015 to ascertain if he had heard from the victim. (3 Tr. 23, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A lieutenant became involved in the case on or about February 25, 2015. He visited Appellant to hear the story about the pipeliners. Appellant invited him into the house and subsequently pried open the frozen lid from a deep stone well near the porch so the lieutenant could check inside. (2 Tr. 45-46). Besides the disarray in the house, there was \"junk,\" including a refrigerator, on the front porch and in the yard; in discussing the yard items, Appellant told the lieutenant the dummy hanging from his tree was supposed to be a pipeliner who broke a branch off a tree. (2 Tr. 51-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant confirmed he called the victim early on February 14, 2015, accused her of stealing his wallets, and demanded she bring back the wallets or find them. (2 Tr. 46). Yet, he said they did not look for the wallets or fight when she arrived that morning, estimating the time of arrival as 7:00 a.m. (2 Tr. 46-47). He noted they did not get along and she would often leave for a time after they fought; he claimed she would be back and she does this all the time. (2 Tr. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The lieutenant obtained the victim's phone records and ran Appellant's criminal history. He discovered Appellant had a West Virginia felony conviction for unlawful assault. As Appellant was not permitted to possess a firearm due to this prior conviction and the first officer to visit Appellant's house noticed firearms, a search warrant for guns was prepared. The search warrant was executed on March 11, 2015. Twelve firearms were confiscated, along with 2,000 rounds of ammunition and black powder for reloading ammunition. The officers noticed Appellant's two wallets on his nightstand. They saw a homemade whip with blood on it and noticed what appeared to be blood on a pair of jeans. A partially burned bright turquoise-green coat was spotted in a burn pile forty or fifty yards from the house. (2 Tr. 57, 81-82). A gray sweatshirt and pieces of burnt carpet were in the burn pile as well. Appellant was immediately\n   arrested for having weapons while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} During his interview that day, Appellant said the guns belonged to the victim but acknowledged helping her reload the ammunition with powder. Appellant then described where he obtained the .22 caliber Ruger revolver which the police discovered behind his chair. He opined the victim left the state, noting many of the pipeliners who passed by his house were from another state. He claimed the victim invited pipeliners into his house once when he was in jail. He said the victim took his two wallets and he never got them back. He then described in detail the two stolen wallets which officers spotted on his nightstand (one had a Pittsburgh Steelers emblem embossed into brown leather and one was black leather with his identification inside). (2 Tr. 116, 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Based on these developments, a second search warrant, seeking evidence of an assault, was executed the next day. A gun box and a box of ammunition were spotted on the ground behind a shed. The gun box contained a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, four unspent .38 cartridges, and one spent .38 cartridge. (1 Tr. 327). Bones and a belt buckle were observed among ashes in a 55 gallon drum used as a burn barrel. When the barrel was tipped over, a strong odor of fuel emanated from the contents and a charred body part was revealed; it was half of a human head and neck with one shoulder and the top of an arm still attached. (1 Tr. 319; 2 Tr. 108, 119). A red shirt was visible on the shoulder. Other bone fragments were recovered as well. An agent with the State of Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) documented what appeared to be a trail of burnt fabric pieces between the open burn pile and the burn barrel. (3 Tr. 182, 191, 197-198).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The forensic pathologist performed an autopsy of the remains and discovered a bullet in the victim's left upper neck near the second cervical vertebrae. (4 Tr. 35, 48). He opined the victim was alive when shot as there was blood around the bullet. (4 Tr. 61). DNA testing showed the fluid recovered during the autopsy was consistent with the victim's DNA (one in one trillion, 519 billion). (3 Tr. 58-59, 66). A mass of three layers of clothing from the main body part recovered was examined; the forensic pathologist found blood between the layers of fabric and noticed a strong petroleum smell. (4 Tr. 45-46). The State Fire Marshal found this fabric contained gasoline. (3 Tr. 42, 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The forensic pathologist observed the main body part was cut from the remainder of the body along a single plane in what appeared to be a single pass of a blade. (4 Tr. 30, 33). He opined the cut was made with an electrical, mechanical saw, not with a chainsaw or the brute force of a person using a handsaw or hacksaw. (4 Tr. 36-37). Other recovered remains were bone fragments which represented the upper arm, lower leg, pelvis, and spine. A piece of long bone appeared to have a chop in it as if made by a hatchet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The forensic pathologist consulted with an anthropologist as he was unsure if the fire could have caused the mark and because he was not an expert on the changing of bone color due to heat exposure. (4 Tr. 40-41, 44). The anthropologist testified to the range of colors in the bones: tan was the standard color of a bone which would have been exposed to the least heat; black meant exposure to higher heat; and white was the final (calcine) stage before ash. (4 Tr. 70-72). She noted the humerus was still tan. She confirmed the bone fragments represented all segments of the body and the main body part had been cut along one plane. As for the long bone fragment with a \"penetrating\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   black line, she concluded this was not due to the fire but was due to trauma caused by an implement. (4 Tr. 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Upon receiving the coroner's report, the police obtained a third search warrant in June 2015 to look for cutting implements. Appellant had been in jail since his arrest. It appeared someone had entered his house by breaking in through the side door. Items such as a level, a machete, and a steel trap were set out. There were also missing items such as two chainsaws, some hanging photographs, and a television.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Besides demonstrating the human remains were those of the victim, DNA evidence showed the blood on the whip was consistent with Appellant's (rather than the victim's) DNA. As to other items seized for potential blood evidence, some did not test positive on a presumptive blood test at the lab (jeans) and others tested presumptively positive but DNA could not be obtained (hacksaw blade, hatchet, sweatshirt). (3 Tr. 62, 71, 74, 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} A BCI firearms expert compared the .22 caliber bullet recovered from the victim with the ammunition and five of the firearms recovered during the execution of the search warrants. He testified in accordance with his report that two of the firearms could neither be identified nor eliminated as having fired the bullet recovered from the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant was indicted for aggravated murder (with prior calculation and design) with a firearm specification, abuse of corpse, and having weapons while under disability. The jury convicted him of the lesser included offense of murder, abuse of a corpse, and having weapons while under disability. The court sentenced Appellant to fifteen years to life for murder plus three years on the firearm specification, twelve months for abuse of a corpse, and thirty-six months for the weapons offense, all to run consecutively. The within timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE: SEARCH WARRANT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant sets forth five assignments of error, the first of which contends:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel, depriving him of a fair trial pursuant to both the United States and Ohio constitutions, in that counsel failed to suppress the search warrant executed on or about March 11, 2015 which was based on stale evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} As Appellant acknowledges, defense counsel's failure to file a motion to suppress does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel per se.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3133747\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/115/55/\">\n    115 Ohio St.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-4837\">\n    2007-Ohio-4837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=873%20N.E.2d%20858\">\n    873 N.E.2d 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 65.

More specifically, where a defendant complains trial counsel failed to file a suppression motion, the defendant must prove there was a valid ground to suppress the evidence in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Spaulding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    151 Ohio St.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20N.E.3d%20554\">\n    89 N.E.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 94. The defendant must also show there is a reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been suppressed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20N.E.3d%20554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} As to prejudice, Appellant points to the mass of evidence against him which was derived solely from the execution of the three search warrants. He contends only the first search warrant was based\n   upon stale information. As he points out, the second warrant was based upon evidence gained during the execution of the first search warrant, and the third search warrant was based upon evidence gained during the execution of the second search warrant. He therefore concludes if the first search warrant is invalid, then the evidence stemming from the other two search warrants would be suppressed as the fruit of the first unlawful warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In arguing there were valid grounds for suppression, Appellant contends the information relied upon to obtain the warrant for firearms was stale because the police did not seek a warrant soon after the first officer saw two guns at Appellant's house on February 16, 2015. Appellant emphasizes the search warrant was executed on March 11, 2015. This is 23 days from the day the officer spotted the firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"For a search warrant to issue, the evidence must be sufficient for the magistrate to conclude that there is a fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. The reviewing court then must ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The bullet was damaged and only had a rifling imprint of one partial land for comparison. (3 Tr. 136-137, 164). The expert compared this bullet to the rifling characteristics of five of the firearms seized from Appellant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The .22 caliber Ruger revolver found behind Appellant's chair could not be identified as the weapon which fired the bullet, but it could not be excluded either. The rifling impression made by the Ruger was consistent with the impression remaining on the fired bullet. (3 Tr. 144, 163-164). The bullets found with the Ruger were different than the fired bullet (as they were .22 \"long rifle copper washed lead hollow point bullets\"). (3 Tr. 160). However, ten cartridges from a seized assortment of Appellant's ammunition exhibited a .22 caliber \"brass washed lead round nosed bullet configuration.\" (3 Tr. 153).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} A .22 caliber Geco rifle produced similar class characteristics to the fired bullet but could not be identified as the fired weapon or excluded.

(Pretrial Tr. 5). The trial court's January 8, 2017 judgment entry found: \"If the proposed testimony reflects that one or more firearms could neither be included [n]or excluded as the possible murder weapon, it is nonetheless an expert opinion for the Jury's consideration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Defense counsel renewed his objection at trial during the expert's testimony, claiming the opinion that two firearms could not be excluded or identified cannot be rendered \"to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" (3 Tr. 142). The state responded it is an expert's opinion to conclude, based upon scientific testing and expert knowledge, that a fact cannot conclusively be determined one way or another. The court overruled the objection.

Defense counsel cited Crim.R. 16(K) and said he was unprepared to confront the expert's claim about the time it takes to cremate a body. (4 Tr. 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 47} The prosecutor responded by noting the expert report and her curriculum vitae indicates she has experience with bones exposed to heat based upon coloration, pointing out her report cited a source as well. (4 Tr. 77-78). The report contained a description of the remains as showing \"evidence of exposure to high heat, with color ranging from tannish brown to white (Haglund, 1995).\" The report also noted \"extensive fragmentation, shrinking and warping from heat exposure\" and said \"[s]ome elements show a different fracture pattern than can be attributed to exposure to high heat.\" (St.Ex. 18). In addition to detailing her experience with skeletal remains and forensic case work, the anthropologist's curriculum vitae noted her prior forensic evaluation of three sets of burnt remains. (Def.Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The prosecutor also suggested if the anthropologist was incorrect on the specific topic of funeral home cremations, she could be confronted on cross-examination. The court overruled the objection. The anthropologist then answered the prosecution's last question (on whether one could create the heat necessary to cremate a body in an open burn pile) by stating she could not say for certain but believed it would be extremely difficult. (4 Tr. 79). She also stated, on cross-examination, she did not know how long it would take to burn a body in a burn barrel. (4 Tr. 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Appellant states the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the anthropologist to testify to matters outside her area of expertise and which were not disclosed in her expert's report provided to the defense prior to trial. He states her testimony that cremation in a funeral home setting takes eight hours at 2000 degrees was unreliable because she was not an expert on this topic and this fact was not in her report, alleging a combined violation of an evidentiary rule and a criminal discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Pursuant to Evid.R. 702(A)-(C), a witness can testify as an expert if the testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; the witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; and the testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. \"The individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or\n   she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

These documents indicated the anthropologist's experience with burnt remains.

The state notes defense counsel seemed prepared for the topic now contested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The state also believes the arguments surrounding the objection, including the citation to Crim.R. 16(K), did not indicate the objection was being made under Evid.R. 702 as well. An error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected and a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context. Evid.R. 103(A)(1). The state additionally posits the witness's statement on cremation in a funeral home setting was subject to impeachment, went to the weight of the evidence on that topic, and did not prejudice the defense in any event, i.e., any error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 53} As to the open burn pile question asked by the prosecutor, which was when the defense's objection was entered, the anthropologist did not estimate a time and thereafter clarified she did not know. As to the funeral home cremation question, which was asked prior to the open burn pile question, prejudice is not apparent considering the totality of the circumstances. We note defense counsel's opening statement predicted: \"the science will tell you it takes a while to burn a human body.\" (1 Tr. 296). While defense counsel was arguing he was unprepared to cross-examine the witness on cremation time in a funeral home setting, he also disclosed his pretrial research indicated a crematory can cremate a body in two hours. (4 Tr. 76). Additionally, the trial court agreed to an early lunch break after direct examination of the anthropologist to permit defense counsel to research the topic before conducting his cross-examination. (4 Tr. 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Defense counsel then thoroughly cross-examined the anthropologist. He was permitted to impeach her on the topic of cremation with the articles he found online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   He elicited: she gained her information on funeral home cremation from a funeral attendant when she attended a cremation; she was merely voicing a personal anecdote; and the focus of her research is not on cremation times. Upon learning this, no request was made to strike her prior answer as being outside her arena of expertise. Defense counsel questioned the witness on the information contained in the articles he printed regarding cremation in a crematory, which respectively stated: cremation time is typically 2-2.5 hours at 1,400 to 1,800 degrees; cremation can take from 60 minutes to more than 5 hours, and it takes time to preheat the crematory; and cremation is almost complete at 2-3 hours. (Def.Ex. B). These estimates were elicited during the anthropologist's testimony, and the court subsequently admitted the articles as evidence over the prosecution's objection. (5 Tr. 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 55} In conclusion, the trial court soundly exercised its discretion to implement a remedy it reasonably considered fitting under the circumstances and in the face of the objection. Moreover, any error in eliciting the testimony on cremation in a funeral home setting was harmless considering its context and the overwhelming evidence presented in this case. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR: OTHER ACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Appellant's fourth assignment of error provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"Appellant was denied due process and a fair trial pursuant to both the United States and Ohio constitutions when the trial court allowed other acts testimony from any one of or each of three of the State's witnesses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Appellant contends the evidence of other acts presented via the testimony of three witnesses should have been excluded as: the evidence was irrelevant under Evid.R. 401 ; it was not admitted for a proper purpose under Evid.R. 404(B) ; and the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice which requires exclusion under Evid.R. 403(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state initially asks us to disregard Appellant's arguments under this assignment of error because the argument section of Appellant's brief failed to cite to the transcript or specify the testimony to which his arguments apply; that is, Appellant broadly states the argument applies to the other acts evidence presented by the victim's three relatives. Nevertheless, after discussing the objection to prior bad acts testimony, the factual history portion of Appellant's brief specifies the contested portions of each of these three witnesses' testimony with citations to the transcript. (Apt.Br. 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 62} First, Appellant contests the testimony by the victim's mother that Appellant was demeaning toward the victim throughout their relationship: the victim's mother testified she \"always\" heard Appellant call her daughter demeaning names and \"cuss her out.\" (4 Tr. 123). Appellant\n   also complains about her testimony that she attempted to assist her daughter in obtaining her keys and phone from Appellant and went to the police when her attempt was unsuccessful. (4 Tr. 126-127). She said Appellant returned the items while she was at the Sheriff's Office reporting the event. This was believed to have occurred within weeks of the victim's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 63} This testimony explains why the victim would have left her phone with her aunt on the day before her murder and again on the day of her murder. It illuminated the relationship between the defendant and the victim, which is relevant to various exceptions for the admission of other acts evidence. The testimony supports motive and background as the victim's mother finally involved police in the tumultuous relationship; and according to other testimony, Appellant threatened to call the police on the victim in order to get her to come to his house the morning she went missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In\n   <em>\n    Nields\n   </em>\n   , the trial court allowed a police officer to testify about his response to a domestic violence dispatch several weeks before the murder during which the victim told the officer she was afraid of the defendant and wanted him to leave her home.\n   <em>\n    Nields\n   </em>\n   , 93 Ohio St.3d at 10, 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20859\">\n    752 N.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The trial court permitted evidence of the prior act because it showed a strained relationship between the killer and victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20859\">\n    752 N.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This witness moved in with the victim two weeks before her disappearance. She heard Appellant yell at the victim and call her names such as a \"thieving bitch\" and a \"slut.\" (4 Tr. 145). On the day before the victim went missing, the victim left her phone with her aunt before she left with Appellant. Thereafter, she called her aunt with Appellant's phone asking her aunt to come get her because Appellant threw her out by the hair. (4 Tr. 149). The victim's aunt testified Appellant called early the next morning accusing the victim of stealing his two wallets and ordering her to return to his house to locate them or he would report her to the police. (4 Tr. 150). The victim drove to Appellant's house but left her phone at home and instructed her aunt to start calling Appellant if she was not home by 9:00 a.m. (4 Tr. 152).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 66} As to Appellant's other acts argument, this testimony confirms the \"tumultuous\" and \"strained relationship\" was still occurring immediately before the victim went missing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nields\n   </em>\n   , 93 Ohio St.3d at 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20859\">\n    752 N.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also constitutes the immediate background of the offense. This testimony was further relevant to motive. The victim's aunt had recently encouraged her niece to stand up to Appellant; she also confronted Appellant about his treatment of the victim. Appellant's threats to call the police appear to be in response to the victim's mother contacting the police about the victim's keys and phone. The testimony was also relevant to identify Appellant as the person who called the victim very early on her last morning and demanded she\n   come to his home. The victim responded by complying with his demands, and she was never seen again. Notably, Appellant admitted he called the victim to accuse her of theft, and he admitted she in fact came to his home that morning. Furthermore, the accusations by Appellant go toward his intent and his plan. That is, the state charged Appellant with aggravated murder; it was argued his false accusations of theft and his demanding the victim come to his home to locate two wallets help demonstrate his prior calculation and design. (He told police he never found the wallets, but the police found them stacked on his nightstand.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The third relative of the victim to testify was her sister-in-law. Appellant protests the admission of testimony that she saw the victim fall for no reason, at which point the victim observed she must still be dizzy from Appellant hitting her in the head earlier in the day. This occurred the summer before the victim went missing (or possibly the prior summer). (4 Tr. 136). The sister-in-law encouraged the victim to go to the hospital or to the police, but she refused. This testimony supports the theory that the victim was being encouraged by various relatives to speak out and report Appellant to the police and thus \"tended to show his motive to murder.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nields\n   </em>\n   , 93 Ohio St.3d at 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20859\">\n    752 N.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Clearly, the contested statements made by the victim to her mother, her aunt, and her sister-in-law (set forth supra) were not testimonial (and thus any hearsay issues are addressed under the rules of evidence). Accordingly, Appellant's confrontation clause argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 76} As aforementioned, Appellant concludes with a brief hearsay argument regarding the other acts testimony reviewed above. Before turning to his specific argument (wherein he claims the forfeiture by wrongdoing hearsay exception does not apply), we review the nature of the contested testimony. (Apr.Br. 4). Initially, we point out that not all of the challenged other acts evidence was hearsay. For instance, the victim's mother witnessed Appellant act demeaning toward her daughter and heard him call her names. This was not hearsay as the witness testified to the defendant's own statements that she personally heard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a). Additionally, the victim's mother saw her daughter arrive home on foot without her car or phone. This witness personally went to Appellant's house and made demands upon him. Appellant declared to this witness that he did not have the car keys or the phone; this was not hearsay as it was the defendant's own statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 802(D)(2)(a). This witness suggested she would take the matter to the police. She then went to the police, and the items reappeared at the victim's house in the meantime. The statement attributed to the victim (Appellant returned the items) was a minimal part of the evidence and could be presumed from the witness's observations in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 77} Next, we review the contested testimony of the victim's aunt. The aunt testified she heard the victim on the phone with Appellant in the early morning hours (just before she went missing). The victim said Appellant accused her of stealing his wallets and demanded she come to his home to find them or he would call the police. Essentially, the victim expressed she was going to Appellant's house to look for his wallets in order to avoid his calling the police on her. This was akin to an expression of the victim's intent, plan, and design and an expression of her motive for formulating this plan to go to Appellant's house early on the last morning of her life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(2). This rule provides a hearsay exception for: \"A statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\"\n   <em>\n    Regardless, Appellant admitted to police he called the victim early in the morning and made these statements, and his video interview was evidence at trial\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 78} The victim's aunt also testified about the day before the victim went missing. The aunt saw Appellant pick up the victim that day and watched the victim purposely leave her phone behind. Later, the victim called her aunt. The aunt then retrieved the victim from Appellant's house, where the victim was waiting outside (in the middle of winter). These statements are personal observations and are not hearsay. The issue is with the content of the phone call to the aunt: the victim said she was covertly using Appellant's phone and \"needed\" her aunt to come retrieve her because Appellant threw her out by the hair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 79} The statement that she was secretly using Appellant's phone could be considered a present sense impression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(1) (\"A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter unless circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\"). As to having her hair pulled while being thrown out of a house, the state did not specifically elicit that the victim was voicing a lingering sensation experienced, which would have been a statement of the declarant's then existing sensation, pain, physical condition, or bodily health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(3) (exception for then existing physical condition). Yet, it appeared to be the description of an event made immediately after perception of the event and the circumstances did not indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(1) (present sense impression exception). The statement the victim needed to leave Appellant's house was equivalent to an expression of the victim's intent, plan, and design, and she related her motive for doing so as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(3) (state of mind exception, which can include intent, plan, motive, design, etc). Finally, although the foundation was minimal, the entire statement appears to have the characteristics of an excited utterance, considering the event and the circumstances under which it was made (including the covert use of the Appellant's phone).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(2) (\"A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Before alternatively analyzing the application of the forfeiture by wrongdoing hearsay exception (outlined by the state at the pretrial hearing and contested by Appellant on appeal), we review the testimony from the victim's sister-in-law contested by Appellant. After the victim fell down for no reason, the victim disclosed she was dizzy because Appellant hit her in the head with a stick earlier in the day. The witness personally observed the victim's fall. The victim's statement of dizziness was admissible under the hearsay exception in Evid.R. 803(3) as it was a statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, sensation, physical condition, or bodily health. Appellant's issue appears to be with the victim relating the prior cause of her dizziness. In addressing whether this less temporally-related incident was permissible other acts evidence above, we alternatively found the potential prejudice from any error in admission would not have been outcome determinative due to the other overwhelming evidence presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 81} We turn to analyze whether the forfeiture by wrongdoing provision contained in Evid.R. 804(B)(6) could be applied to any remaining hearsay as an alternate hearsay exception. Pursuant to this rule, the following is not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: \"Forfeiture by Wrongdoing. A statement offered against a party if the unavailability of the witness is due to the wrongdoing of the party for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending\n   or testifying.\" Evid.R. 804(B)(6) (the statement is not admissible unless the proponent gave advance written notice of an intention to introduce the statement sufficient to provide the adverse party a fair opportunity to contest admissibility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 82} The state gave timely notice under Evid.R. 804(B)(6) and under Evid.R. 404(B) (the other acts rule, which also required notice). A pretrial hearing was held where three of the victim's relatives presented their proposed testimony. The trial court made a preliminary ruling admitting the evidence. On the morning trial was to commence, the defense filed a motion to reconsider the in limine ruling, noting the court's entry discussed Evid.R. 404(B) other acts admissibility but not Evid.R. 804(B)(6). The motion pointed out how Evid.R. 804(B)(6) not only required the defendant to have wrongfully caused the witness's unavailability but also required the defendant to have done so\n   <em>\n    for the purpose\n   </em>\n   of preventing her from attending or testifying. The court denied the motion to reconsider the in limine ruling on the record before jury selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Before the victim's mother testified, the defense renewed the objection to the testimony presented at the pretrial and noted the prosecution agreed to accept an ongoing objection. (4 Tr. 116). In objecting, defense counsel provided an example of testimony presented at the pretrial by the victim's mother about the victim telling her mother Appellant kicked her leg and a physician told the victim a blood clot resulted from the injury (and gave her a shot to dissolve the clot). The state responded by noting, \"we have tried to narrow\" the testimony from the witnesses. (4 Tr. 117). Thereafter, the state did not elicit this story from the victim's mother at trial.

As this qualified as a testimonial statement subject to the confrontation clause, the Ohio Supreme Court applied the common law forfeiture exception to confrontation rights. The Ohio Supreme Court concluded the defendant's killing of\n   the victim-declarant was designed to prevent her from testifying against him \"in any future criminal proceedings\" and constituted an exception to the confrontation clause in the trial against the defendant for murdering the declarant.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In other words, the forfeiture exception can be applied to the victim's hearsay statements being introduced at the trial for the victim's murder trial if part of the defendant's purpose (in making the victim unavailable through wrongdoing) was to prevent her or even merely dissuade her from testifying in a future trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Here, a partial motive theory under Evid.R. 804(B)(6) entails: Appellant engaged in long-term abuse of the victim; he abused her the day before her death; on the morning of her death, he called in the middle of the night and demanded she come to his house; a physical altercation took place; there were indications she may finally decide to contact law enforcement; her relatives had been encouraging her to have Appellant arrested for his abuse; her aunt had recently moved in with her and confronted Appellant about his treatment of the victim; and one of his motivations for engaging in the act which precipitated or caused the victim's death was to keep her from reporting his ongoing abuse of her to police (and eventually testify on the subject of this abuse).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 88} As this motivation need not be the sole or even the main motivation, it is irrelevant that additional motives were suggested by the evidence. Furthermore, in determining Appellant's motivation in order to evaluate admissibility under Evid.R. 804(B)(6),\n   <em>\n    the trial court was permitted to consider all of the evidence presented at the pretrial, even if it was not thereafter presented at trial, and was permitted to consider hearsay and other acts evidence, without regard to its ultimate admissibility\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 104(A) (the trial court shall determine all preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence without being bound by the rules of evidence, except those on privilege).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 89} As a ruling in limine can be reconsidered at trial, the trial court could also consider the evidence presented at trial relevant to the forfeiture by wrongdoing hearsay exception. The totality of the circumstances presented for the trial court's review can be considered.

Under Appellant's first assignment, there was no error as to the issuance of the search warrant, and counsel thus did not render ineffective assistance of counsel. Under his second assignment, there was no error admitting the ballistics testimony. As to the third assignment, the trial court committed no error in handling the anthropologist's testimony. As to the fourth assignment of error, the confrontation clause was inapplicable to the contested statements as they were non-testimonial. This left evidentiary issues.
