CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Dennis G. Cook, appeals from the judgment of conviction entered by the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas on October 7, 2016. The issues on appeal are solely related to the trial court's imposition of sentence. For the\n   reasons that follow, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On the night of November 28, 2015, appellant and two others (Mr. Heller and Mr. Johnson) parked down the street from a residence located on Tavern Road in Burton, Ohio. They kicked open the door of the residence and held the occupant at gun point. The trio was described by the victim as wearing ski masks and carrying guns. The victim was assaulted and forced into the basement at gun point; he was tied to a chair and beaten with a gun. One of the perpetrators poured lighter fluid on the victim and threatened to light it unless he told them where to find his money and marijuana. The house was ransacked, and the offenders stole money, marijuana, and a cell phone from the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant was indicted by the Geauga County Grand Jury on February 1, 2016, in a seven-count indictment. Appellant entered a plea of guilty on July 25, 2016, to Aggravated Robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), a first-degree felony (Count 1); Kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2), a first-degree felony (Count 5); and Carrying a Concealed Weapon, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2), a fourth-degree felony (a stipulated lesser-included offense to Count 6). The remaining counts of the indictment were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A sentencing hearing was held on September 26, 2016. It was emphasized that Mr. Heller had masterminded the criminal plan; he had been at the home previously to repair the furnace, and the victim had indicated he could sell Mr. Heller marijuana. Mr. Heller received a thirteen-year prison sentence for his role in the crimes. It was also stressed that Mr. Johnson escalated the physical violence once the trio was inside the residence and that appellant did not actually inflict any physical harm on the victim. Mr. Johnson received seventeen years in prison for his role in the crimes. In addition, defense counsel argued that the Aggravated Robbery and Kidnapping counts should merge for purposes of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court imposed a seven-year prison sentence for Aggravated Robbery, a six-year prison sentence for Kidnapping, and an eighteen-month prison sentence for Carrying a Concealed Weapon. The trial court rejected the merger argument and ordered the Aggravated Robbery and Kidnapping sentences to run consecutively with each other and concurrent to the sentence for Carrying a Concealed Weapon, for a total prison sentence of thirteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court issued its judgment of conviction on October 7, 2016. Appellant timely appealed and raises two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by not finding that the offenses of aggravated robbery and kidnapping merge, and sentencing him separately and consecutively for a total of thirteen years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by sentencing him to thirteen years in prison and the sentence was therefore excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Merger of Multiple Counts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Under his first assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred by not finding that his convictions of Aggravated Robbery and Kidnapping merge for the purpose of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} R.C. 2941.25 specifies when merger is appropriate and \"incorporates the constitutional protections against double jeopardy.

In response, the State acknowledges \"there is virtually always a kidnapping\" during the course of a robbery \"due to the fact that a person will necessarily be deprived of his freedom of movement when a criminal holds the person at gun point or threatens physical harm.\" Under the circumstances of this case, however, the State argues appellant's conduct went \"far beyond the 'usual' robbery/kidnapping relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant was convicted of Aggravated Robbery and Kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and R.C. 2905.01(A)(2), respectfully. The relevant portions of these statutes provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Aggravated Robbery\n   </em>\n   : (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following: (1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Kidnapping\n   </em>\n   : (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception * * * shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: * * * (2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court recognized, \"[c]ertainly aggravated robbery has a component to it of limiting someone's freedom to move but this was beyond that. * * * [T]ying somebody to a chair, pouring lighter fluid on them, that's more than just hold still while I rob you. So the Court does not find that the sentences for the kidnapping and aggravated robbery should merge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We agree that it is possible for these two offenses, under certain circumstances, to merge as allied offenses of similar import.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re A.G.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

The trial court stated, \"Come on, * * * [e]ven drug dealers don't get to be tied up and have lighter fluid poured on them. * * * That's not that we approve of the drug dealer's activity and there will be comeuppance on those activities, but these people brought violence to this county [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant next contends the trial court did not give adequate weight to the fact that he did not personally cause any actual physical harm to the victim and that he expressed genuine remorse. These facts do weigh in favor of mitigation, but it is\n   also evident from the record that the trial court considered them in that manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant further asserts the court should have accorded more weight to the fact that his most serious prior criminal conviction occurred when he was a juvenile. Appellant was 17 years old when he was convicted of his first felony, Participating in Criminal Gang Activity; the initial charges included Grand Theft Auto, Robbery, and Attempted Murder. Appellant was bound over from juvenile court and tried as an adult. His prison sentence was suspended, but he subsequently violated his community control provisions three times as an adult, which resulted in a two-year prison sentence. Then, in 2012, appellant served a nine-month prison term for another felony conviction, Carrying a Concealed Weapon. Finally, while he was being held in jail on the instant offenses, appellant was convicted of misdemeanor assault for assailing another inmate with a broomstick. Appellant's argument regarding his criminal history is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellant has failed to show that his sentence is clearly and convincingly not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant's second assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The judgment of the Geauga County Court of Common Please is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   DIANE V. GRENDELL, J.,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   CYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE, J.,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
