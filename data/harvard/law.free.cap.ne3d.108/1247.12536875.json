This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mr. Ross was charged with a litany of offenses, including two counts of capital murder, following the deaths of a man (\"the first victim\") and the man's wife (\"the second victim\"). He chose to retain counsel and, over the next few months, either his retained counsel or his retained counsel's law partner appeared on his behalf at several pre-trials. At one of those pre-trials, the State notified the court that it had become aware of a potential conflict of interest. It was the State's position that retained counsel had a conflict of interest because: (1) he had represented the first victim on a drug-trafficking case in 2009; (2) his law partner was representing the first victim on a drug-trafficking case at the time of his death; and (3) his law partner previously had represented both the second victim and the first victim's mother, a potential witness in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the State's pronouncement, the court set the matter for a disqualification hearing, and the State filed a written motion to disqualify. Based on the arguments presented at the disqualification hearing, the State's written motion, and the relevant case law, the court granted the motion to disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mr. Ross now appeals from the trial court's order, disqualifying his retained counsel of choice. He raises one assignment of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DISQUALIFIED DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL OF CHOICE, IN VIOLATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In his assignment of error, Mr. Ross argues that the trial court erred when it granted the State's motion to disqualify. He contends that his retained counsel had no conflict of interest and the State failed to prove that retained counsel would not act competently and diligently on his behalf. On review, this Court does not agree that the trial court erred in its disqualification order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Criminal defendants enjoy a constitutional right to counsel.

The State informed the trial court that the first victim was a former client of retained counsel and, at the time of his death, a current client of the law partner. In both instances, the first victim had been facing drug-trafficking charges; a serious point of concern for the State because drugs were a possible motive for his murder. The State noted that, at the time of the first victim's death, the law partner had already been representing him for two years. The law partner also had represented the second victim in a prior criminal matter and, following the first victim's death, had represented the first victim's mother on a civil matter. Because the mother was a potential witness in this case, the State argued that her status as a former client was another point of conflict. Indeed, prosecutors divulged that the law partner had shared with them his discomfort at appearing on behalf of Mr. Ross when the first victim's mother was present. The State noted that the mother also had come forward to express her discomfort with the arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Based on the foregoing relationships and the concerns cited by the State, the trial court found that there was \"a serious potential conflict of interest that\n   exist[ed] which could affect [retained] counsel's representation of [Mr. Ross].\" Accordingly, it granted the State's motion to disqualify. Mr. Ross argues that the court erred by doing so because there was no conflict. He notes that, pursuant to Prof.Cond.R. 1.7(a)(2), a conflict only exists if there is a \"substantial risk\" that an attorney's relationship with a former client will materially limit him or her in fulfilling his or her duties as counsel. He argues that, at best, the State set forth evidence of \"a minor risk\" in this matter. According to Mr. Ross, the State failed to allege \"any reason that [his retained] counsel [would] not [have] provide[d] competent and diligent representation to [him] in his case * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Having reviewed the record, this Court cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted the State's motion to disqualify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re E.M.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-1090\">\n    2017-Ohio-1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 5, quoting\n   <em>\n    Pfizenmayer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-344\">\n    2008-Ohio-344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 13. Because retained counsel and his law partner practiced law together, they were considered a \"firm\" for purposes of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prof.Cond.R. 1.0(c). Thus, any conflict of interest that arose for one was, by law, imputed to the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carnegie Cos.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860582\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/183/770/\">\n    183 Ohio App.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-4655\">\n    2009-Ohio-4655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=918%20N.E.2d%201052\">\n    918 N.E.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 32, quoting Prof.Cond.R. 1.10(a). Even if retained counsel's representation of the first victim back in 2009 was not a cause for concern, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that there was a substantial risk his duties to Mr. Ross would be materially limited by the duties he owed to his partner's former clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prof.Cond.R. 1.7(a)(2), 1.9(c)(1)-(2). As noted, both the victims and the first victim's mother, a potential witness in this matter, were his partner's former clients. The first victim's case, in particular, was a drug-trafficking case, and drugs were a possible motive for his murder. If any pertinent, privileged information came to light during the two-year period that the law partner acted as the first victim's counsel, both he and retained counsel would be prohibited from revealing or using that information to the disadvantage of the first victim, even if it would benefit Mr. Ross.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prof.Cond.R. 1.9(c)(1)-(2). Moreover, if the first victim's mother testified in this matter, retained counsel would be placed in the position of cross-examining her despite her status as a former client. There was evidence that both the law partner and the victim's mother had already expressed their discomfort as a result of the partner acting as substitute counsel at various pre-trials. While Mr. Ross claims that there is only \"a minor risk\" that all the foregoing concerns will impede his retained counsel in the performance of his duties, the record supports the trial court's conclusion to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Notably, both an actual conflict and \"a showing of a serious potential for conflict\" justify a trial court's removal of a defendant's counsel of choice.\n   <em>\n    Wheat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p159\">\n    486 U.S. at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p159\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
