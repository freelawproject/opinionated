The appellee is Dawn Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The appellant and appellee began this case with a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage filed on May 20, 2014 with an attached separation agreement. On August 1, 2014, appellant filed a motion to convert the action for dissolution into a divorce action and that motion was granted. The appellant filed a complaint for divorce on August 6, 2014 and appellee filed an answer and counterclaim on September 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 9, 2015, appellant filed a Motion to Set Aside the Separation Agreement and the trial court denied that motion on February 9, 2015. The parties executed and filed an Agreed Judgment Entry-Decree of Divorce on March 13, 2015 that incorporated the original separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 30, 2015 appellee filed a motion to cite appellant in contempt for failure to comply with Section 24, Paragraph 3 of the Separation Agreement which obligated appellant to make monthly\n   payments of $1,866.91 to the parties' adult children's bank accounts. Appellant moved to dismiss the motion on August 5, 2015 and appellee opposed that motion on August 26, 2015. The motion to dismiss was denied on January 26, 2016 and a hearing was scheduled for April 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Magistrate conducted the hearing and found that the Separation Agreement did require the appellant to make monthly payments of $1,866.91 to the parties' adult children's bank accounts. Appellant conceded at this hearing that he did not make the payments. In a decision dated May 16, 2017, the Magistrate held appellant in contempt and sentenced him to 30 days in jail. To avoid the jail term, appellant could purge the contempt by paying $3000.00 in attorney fees, court costs, and a monthly payment of $950.00 toward past due payments owed to the parties' sons. The magistrate also awarded appellee judgment against appellant in the amount of $25,203.28, plus 4% interest from the date of the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant filed objections to the magistrate's decision on May 30, 2017 arguing that: (1) the magistrate erred in finding Plaintiff in contempt for failure to make payment of $1,866.91 each month to his two adult sons; (2) the magistrate did not have jurisdiction over this matter because the children were emancipated; (3) the magistrate did not have the authority to provide support of or aid the adult children; (4) the Defendant was not a real party in interest; and (5) Ohio Revised Code Section 3105.10(B) is not applicable to this action. The objections were no more than single sentences as set out above with no argument or citation to the record in support. Appellee filed her response on June 2, 2017 and the transcript of the hearing was filed on June 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court considered and overruled the objections on July 31, 2017 and appellant filed a timely appeal. Appellant submits three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT EXERCISED JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE \"SECTION TWENTY-FOUR\" OF THE PARTIES'\n   <em>\n    SEPARATION AGREEMENT\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN CONCLUDING THAT APPELLEE HAD STANDING TO PROSECUTE HER CONTEMPT MOTION AS A REAL PARTY IN INTEREST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN CONCLUDING THAT CASTLE IS APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's third assignment of error must be overruled for failure to comply with Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iv) which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Waiver of right to assign adoption by court as error on appeal. Except for a claim of plain error, a party shall not assign as error on appeal the court's adoption of any factual finding or legal conclusion, whether or not specifically designated as a finding of fact or conclusion of law under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii), unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion as required by Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The magistrate incorporated\n   <em>\n    Castle v. Castle\n   </em>\n   into the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of law at paragraph 20. Appellant's Objections are broad and non-specific and come perilously close to failing to fulfill the Civ.R. 53 requirement that the objections be specific and state grounds with particularity. We find sufficient grounds to consider appellant's first and second assignments of error. However, appellant failed to object to the magistrate's application of the decision in\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   , so we\n   find that appellant's third assignment of error has been waived. For that reason, we overrule the third assignment of error without further consideration and consider the remaining two assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The appellant contends that the first and second assignments of error, asserting the trial court acted without jurisdiction and that the appellee did not have standing, should be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. We have previously held that both assignments of error should be reviewed de novo and we find no reason to modify those decisions.

We now turn to the separation agreement to consider whether it provides for the adult children's support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The separation agreement contains the following relevant paragraphs in Section 24:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties acknowledge that they have two adult children, to wit: Zachary and Joshua. The parties agree to the\n   following terms regarding their adult children:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1) each will be responsible for one half of the tuition, room and board, books and travel (including vehicle) expenses for a four year undergraduate degree or technical/trade education program for both Zachary and Joshua in an amount equivalent to tuition, room and board, books and travel expenses at the Ohio State University. The parties agree that this obligation shall continue until such time as Zachary and/or Joshua have completed their degree/educational program or six years expires following their commencement of college in the fall of 2013. Further, the parties agree that if either Joshua or Zachary are dis-enrolled from college, the obligation to pay shall cease until such time as they re-enroll in college.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2) The parties agree that the wife's \u00bd of the tuition payment is satisfied through her continued employment with Ohio State University.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3) The parties agree that each month, husband shall deposit $1866.91 into the checking account for Joshua and Zachary held at Delaware County Bank.

Appellant has abandoned this argument and now contends \"the agreement entered into by the parties was not for child support and was not for college expenses for the adult children. It was simply to put money into a bank account in the name of the two children.\" (Appellant's brief, page 5) Appellant acknowledges appellee's testimony that the payment required by paragraph 3 of section 24 was for food, clothing, car and healthcare (Appellant's brief, page 5) yet inexplicably contends this payment was not for support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The term \"child support\" must be broadly interpreted to include economic maintenance, education and necessities of life.\n   <em>\n    Loyd v.

We are particularly concerned that the affected parties, the adult children of appellant and appellee, had no opportunity to object to the award and have no remedy. While the record does support a judgment against appellant in the amount of $25,203.28, plus 4% in interest, it does not support awarding that sum to appellee. Presumably those payments should be directed to the accounts of the adult children as required by the relevant portions of the separation agreement, but we will leave that determination to the trial court on remand. For that reason, we reverse the decision of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas with regard to the awarding of $25,203.28, plus 4% in interest to appellee and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceeding to insure this amount is awarded according to the requirements of the separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The decision of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
