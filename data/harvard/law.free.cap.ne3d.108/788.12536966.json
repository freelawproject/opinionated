If no evidence is presented that the alleged offenses occurred within the bracketed time frames specified in the indictment, the counts in the indictment relating to those offenses should be dismissed. Any variance of proof outside the parameters of time established by the indictment may constitute a separate offense.\n   <em>\n    This analysis suggests a bright- line\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    test, i.e., that an accused be tried for the crimes alleged in the indictment, and that any evidence outside the time period established in the indictment may constitute a separate offense requiring separate process. This bright-line approach is particularly appropriate in criminal child abuse cases.\n   </em>\n   In such cases, the state is granted greater leeway in charging that the crime(s) took place within a fairly broad time frame. The\n   <em>\n    quidpro quo\n   </em>\n   is that the state prove what it charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20N.E.2d%20353\">\n    542 N.E.2d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Though it would be more accurate to state that \"the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   is that the state prove what the grand jury charged,\" the underlying principle is the same. And that principle is applicable in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Whether couched as a matter of due process (as in\n   <em>\n    Barnecut\n   </em>\n   ) or the constitutional requirement of Article I, Section 10, of the Ohio Constitution that felony criminal charges may only be brought on present or indictment of a grand jury, the conclusion is the same. When a grand jury presents an indictment declaring it found probable cause that criminal conduct occurred and when such criminal conduct occurred, it is contrary to the grand-jury protections afforded to the individual to allow an amendment that is at variance with the pronouncement of the grand jury as contained in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   An indictment does not constitute a roving commission to the STATE OF OHIO or to the Court to expand or broaden charges of criminal conduct beyond those actually found and identified by the grand jury. As \"a sovereign body and a very important agency of the government,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282749\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/153/661/#p665\">\n    153 F.Supp. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 665 (W.D. Ky. 1957), the grand jury and its unique role in the criminal process must be afforded full respect from the other branches and agencies of government involved in that process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The sole entity responsible for making accusation of felony criminal conduct is the grand jury. And it is only upon the accusations actually made by the grand jury, premised upon probable cause, that criminal proceedings may ensue. The request of the STATE OF OHIO to amend the\n   <em>\n    Indictment\n   </em>\n   seeks to enlarge or broaden the date range as to when alleged criminal conduct occurred beyond that found by the grand jury; it goes beyond the essential facts as found by the grand jury. To allow such an amendment would necessitate this court invading the province and prerogative of the grand jury, as well as would subject the defendant to trial beyond the essential facts constituting the offenses for which was charged by the grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   To allow the prosecutor, or the court, to make a subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the indictment would deprive the defendant of a basic protection which the guaranty of the intervention of a grand jury was designed to secure. For a defendant could then be convicted on the basis of facts not found by, and perhaps not even presented to, the grand jury which indicted him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Russell v.

The former is still within the ambit of the facts as found by the grand jury; the latter clearly goes outside of the facts as found by the grand jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Ohio R.
