Prior to July 1, 2014, the statute provided a defendant who had served more than 365 days of his sentence could move to have his sentence modified by the trial court, \"\n   <em>\n    subject to the approval of the prosecuting attorney.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -l-17(b) (2013) (emphasis added). Thus, if the prosecutor did not approve, the trial court had no authority to modify a sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [8] Effective July 1, 2014, our legislature eliminated the need for the prosecuting attorney's approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 35-38-l-17(c) (2014) (providing, after defendant has served 365 days, court has authority to reduce or suspend sentence to a sentence available at the time of sentencing and \"court must incorporate its reasons in the record\"). However, another statute that also took effect in 2014 made the new version of Indiana Code section 35-38-1-17 inapplicable to \"(1) penalties incurred; (2) crimes committed; or (3) proceedings begun; before [July 1, 2014]. Those penalties, crimes, and proceedings continue and shall be imposed and enforced under prior law as if [the new sentencing laws] had not been enacted.\" I.C. \u00a7 1-1-5.5-21(a) (2014). Accordingly, if Schmitt, who was sentenced in 2005, had petitioned for sentence modification after July 1, 2014, the court could not have modified his sentence without the prosecutor's approval.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swallows v.

Because the statute provides no indication the legislature intended to overturn or modify the court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Robinett\n   </em>\n   , we presume the legislature intended to keep that law intact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Layman v.

The trial court did order the prosecutor's office to respond to Schmitt's petition but did not indicate in any way that it was considering granting the petition. Schmitt included in his petition and in his motion for reconsideration all the educational and employment opportunities he had pursued while incarcerated. The trial court's order praised Schmitt's \"positive strides,\" (App. Vol. II at 41), which demonstrates the court acknowledged Schmitt's recitation of those pursuits. Three years earlier, the trial court had ordered a progress report from the DOC, and that report verified most, if not all, the programs Schmitt had pursued while incarcerated. However, without a preliminary determination to grant Schmitt's petition, the trial court was not required to hold a hearing or request another progress report from the DOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9054597\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/798/537/\">\n    798 N.E.2d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (trial court is not required to hold a hearing if it has not made a preliminary decision to reduce or suspend a sentence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Prosecutorial Consent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [16] Schmitt argues the State's objection to his petition \"did not preclude the trial court from granting a sentence modification.\" (Br. of Appellant at 8.) While he originally based his argument on the sections of the statute regarding violent criminals,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in his reply brief he argues we are bound by\n   <em>\n    Woodford v.

Therefore, according to Schmitt, although he has filed three petitions to modify since being sentenced in 2005, only one of those was filed after the 2015 amendment, such that prosecutorial consent was not required for the court to grant his current petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [17] The State acknowledges the\n   <em>\n    Woodford\n   </em>\n   holding, but argues Schmitt has exceeded the limit on petitions that can be filed without prosecutorial consent.

Schmitt filed two petitions to modify prior to the 2015 amendment in the statute. Schmitt filed his third petition in 2017. Pursuant to the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Woodford\n   </em>\n   , as it pertains to the two-petition limit in Indiana Code section 35-38-1-17(j)(2), this is Schmitt's first petition to modify his sentence and prosecutorial consent was not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188365\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/58/282/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188365\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/58/282/\">\n    at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prosecutorial consent not required if number of petitions filed since 2015 amendment has not exceeded two).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Abuse of Discretion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [21] The trial court has broad discretion to modify a sentence.\n   <em>\n    Ames v.

Schmitt argues that because the trial court did not explain its reasons for denial, that denial could have been \"premised upon the State's objection or a belief in that the original sentence was appropriate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Reply Br. at 5.) The State argues that because Schmitt's sentence was affirmed by our Court and because Schmitt has served only fifteen years of a fifty-year sentence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Schmitt's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [23] On May 31, 2017, the trial court ordered the prosecutor to \"advise the Court on or before June 30, 2017, as to their position regarding any sentence modification.\" (App. Vol. II at 33.) The trial court's order denying the modification notes the prosecutor objected. These two facts suggest the trial court may have been under the impression it was required to have prosecutorial consent to modify Schmitt's sentence. In light of that possible confusion, we reverse and remand for the trial court to decide the petition on its merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188365\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/58/282/\">\n    58 N.E.3d at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (when it is unclear whether the trial court was operating under a misapprehension of its authority, we decline to review the order for an abuse of discretion but rather remand for the trial court to consider on the merits). If the court makes a preliminary determination that it would grant Schmitt's petition, then the court should request documentation from the DOC and hold a hearing on Schmitt's petition in accordance with the statutory requirements.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Issue I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [24] Because the two-petition limit includes only such petitions as have been filed since the statute was amended in 2015, Schmitt's petition is effectively the first petition he has filed, and prosecutorial consent was not required. Although a trial court is not required to explain its reasons for denial, because the trial court mentioned the State's response in its order, we reverse that denial and remand for the trial court to review Schmitt's petition on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [25] Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Riley, J., and Mathias, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Ind.

However, those issues are not pertinent to our review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Schmitt focuses a significant amount of argument on speculation that the trial court did not consider his rehabilitative efforts. When denying a petition, the trial court is not required to make written findings and conclusions. I.C. \u00a7 35-38-1-17(h). As we remand due to possible confusion regarding prosecutorial consent, we need not address this speculative argument. Nonetheless, the trial court implied it had read Schmitt's petition listing his rehabilitative efforts when it mentioned his \"positive strides\" in its denial order.
