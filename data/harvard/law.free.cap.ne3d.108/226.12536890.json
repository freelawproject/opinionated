Rosenthal, Columbus.\n </attorneys>\n <p id=\"p-7\">\n  DECISION\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   BROWN, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Heather Crosier, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas affirming an order of the State Personnel Board of Review (\"SPBR\"), which affirmed an order from appellee, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\"ODRC\"), terminating appellant's employment with ODRC. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was employed by ODRC as a program administrator 2 in ODRC's Corrections Training Academy (the \"Academy\"). Pursuant to her employment, appellant was a member of the classified civil service. Dr. Tracy Reveal was the superintendent of the Academy, and the highest level official in appellant's chain of command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Academy, located in Orient, Ohio, is the \"centralized point within which all of the new [ODRC] employees\" come for their \"basic training.\" (Tr. at 39.) The Academy also provides in-service training programs for current ODRC employees. As a program administrator 2, appellant was responsible for scheduling, administering, and coordinating courses offered at the Academy. Appellant also arranged for volunteer training officers to come to the Academy from the various ODRC institutions to teach classes as needed. When an Academy employee requested a volunteer training officer from an ODRC institution, the employee would typically \"send a request to the training officer of the institution where the person works, the actual instructor [being requested] and the warden of the institution where the volunteer instructor is employed.\" (Tr. at 229.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} During her employment with ODRC, appellant was disciplined for various violations of the performance track of ODRC standards of employee conduct. On August 8, 2012, appellant received a written reprimand for violating Rule 17 of the standards of employee conduct. On July 10, 2013, appellant received a 2-day working suspension for violating Rules 8 and 12(B). On March 11, 2014, appellant received an order of removal from her employment. The order stated that, on December 4, 2013, appellant \"failed to remove a box of ammunition from [her] personally owned vehicle before leaving it at the Marion Correctional Institution to be cleaned by ODRC inmates.\" (Appellee's Ex. 1.) The order stated appellant had violated Rule 30(B) of the standards of employee conduct, which prohibits the unauthorized conveyance or possession, while on state owned property, of weapons or ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} However, also on March 11, 2014, appellant, Dr. Reveal, and the Director of ODRC, Gary Mohr, entered into a Last Chance Agreement (\"LCA\"). The LCA provided ODRC would hold the order of removal in abeyance, and that in exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Employee agrees to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1). To refrain from any further performance-related misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All parties hereto agree that if the employee violates this Last Chance Agreement, or commits any violations of the Performance Track of the ODRC Standards of Employee Conduct, the appropriate discipline shall be termination from her position. The Employer/Agency need only prove that the employee violated this agreement and/or the Standards of Employee Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   This Last Chance Agreement is in force and effect for a period of two (2) years from the date * * * of the employee's signature on this agreement. This two-year period may be extended by a period equal to the employee's absence of fourteen days or longer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Appellee's Ex. 1, \"LCA\".)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In spring 2014, Warden Norman Robinson of the Chillicothe Correctional Institution (\"CCI\") contacted Dr. Reveal to express concerns he had \"about the amount of hours that some of the instructors at CCI were being requested\" to volunteer at the Academy. (Tr. at 50.) Warden Robinson informed Dr. Reveal there \"were about three or four individuals\" from CCI who were requesting off frequently to instruct at the Academy, and stated that \"Charity Adkins was one of those individuals.\" (Tr. at 162.) Warden Robinson explained the amount of employees requesting off was \"cut[ting] into [his] overtime budget.\" (Tr. at 149.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Thus, in an attempt to \"ensure that the overtime was going to * * * be curtailed,\" Warden Robinson and Dr. Reveal decided that all requests from the Academy for instructors from CCI \"would go through [the warden's] administrative assistant,\" Amy Hamilton. (Tr. at 160.) Dr. Reveal informed Hamilton about the new \"system.\" (Tr. at 176.) In June 2014, Charlotte Jenkins became the warden of CCI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 12, 2014, Dr. Reveal sent an e-mail to Academy staff members, including appellant. The e-mail stated as follows: \"Hello. Please send any instructor requests for a CCI volunteer instructor to Amy Hamilton, the Warden's Admin. Asst. Thank you. Tracy L. Reveal, Ph.D.\" (Appellee's Ex. 8.) Dr. Reveal considered the e-mail to be a written directive, and expected that her staff \"would follow it.\" (Tr. at 53.) Appellant admitted she received the May 12, 2014 e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Additionally, prior to May 12, 2014, appellant admitted she \"did receive verbal instructions not to request Charity specifically,\" but asserted the communication \"was 'broken' with no 'finality.' \" (Appellee's Ex. 11, Attachment B.) Dr. Reveal also stated that, prior to the May 12, 2014 e-mail, she had discussed with appellant \"the concerns around requesting [Adkins] from CCI.\" (Tr. at 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On June 30, 2014, appellant sent out a combined request to Warden Jenkins of CCI and Warden Bennie Kelly of Grafton Correctional Institution (\"GCI\"). The request asked that Charity Adkins from CCI and David Robinson from GCI be permitted to instruct courses at the Academy scheduled for July 21-23 and August 25-29, 2014. Appellant admitted that her June 30, 2014 request, sent to Warden Jenkins rather than Hamilton, did not comport with Dr. Reveal's May 12, 2014 e-mail. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27.) Appellant stated the June 30, 2014 request was \"merely an oversight.\" (Tr. at 248.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On July 5, 2014, Adkins submitted her request for leave to be permitted to teach at the Academy on the July 21-23 and August 25-29 dates. Warden Jenkins reviewed the request, and noted the request was for \"64 hours,\" which was \"a lot of time for an employee to be gone from the institution.\" (Tr. at 137.) Warden Jenkins took the request for leave to Hamilton. Hamilton explained to Warden Jenkins\n   that she had not received the initial request for Adkins to instruct at the Academy, and \"there was a directive that came out and it wasn't followed correctly.\" (Tr. at 138.) Warden Jenkins denied Adkins' request for leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On July 7, 2014, Hamilton filed an incident report regarding the situation. The ODRC chief inspector's office conducted an investigation into the incident report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On August 27, 2014, the chief inspector's office issued a report, concluding appellant \"did violate the directive issued by Dr. Reveal regarding requesting instructors from CCI.\" (Appellee's Ex. 11.) On September 15, 2014, appellant received a pre-disciplinary conference notice, which informed appellant she had allegedly violated Rules 7 and 50 of the performance track of ODRC's standards of employee conduct. Rule 7 prohibits the \"[f]ailure to follow post orders, administrative regulations, policies, or written or verbal directives.\" (Appellee's Ex. 3.) Rule 50 prohibits any violation of R.C. 124.34. Following the pre-disciplinary conference, ODRC concluded appellant had violated Rules 7 and 50 of the performance track of ODRC's standards of employee conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On October 2, 2014, ODRC issued an order of removal to appellant. The order noted the March 11, 2014 LCA, wherein appellant agreed that if she \"committed any violation of the performance track of the ODRC [standards of employee conduct] while the LCA was in effect, the appropriate discipline would be termination from employment.\" (Appellee's Ex. 1.) The order stated appellant had \"violated a directive issued by Dr. Tracy Reveal,\" and that appellant's \"failure to follow the directive\" amounted to a violation of Rules 7 and 50 of the performance track of the standards of employee conduct. (Appellee's Ex. 1.) Appellant appealed the order of removal to the SPBR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Following a May 6, 2015 hearing, an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") issued a report and recommendation on February 19, 2016. The ALJ noted appellant \"acknowledged that she had received Dr. Reveal's May 12, 2014, email directing staff to send requests for CCI employees to serve as volunteer instructors to Amy Hamilton,\" and that appellant \"further acknowledged that she failed to comply with Dr. Reveal's instructions when she requested CCI employee Charity Adkins as a volunteer instructor in June 2014.\" (Report &amp; Recommendation at 3-4.) The ALJ noted appellant's contention that \"her failure to comply with Dr. Reveal's instructions was a mistake, rather than an intentional or willful act,\" but concluded that appellant's \"conduct constituted a violation of\" Rules 7 and 50 of \"the performance track of Appellee's [standards of employee conduct], and a violation of the LCA executed by the parties on March 11, 2014.\" (Report &amp; Recommendation at 4.) The ALJ recommended that SPBR affirm the October 2, 2014 order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant filed objections to the ALJ's report and recommendation on March 22, 2016, arguing that ODRC failed to offer \"proof that the email of May 12, 2014 was a 'directive.' \" (Objs. to Report &amp; Recommendation at 9.) The SPBR set the matter for a hearing before the full board on June 22, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On July 19, 2016, SPBR issued an order affirming the October 2, 2014 order of removal. Appellant appealed SPBR's order to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On October 27, 2016, appellant filed her brief in the trial court. Appellant argued that a directive was \"not a one line, one time, email to selected staff asking\n   them to please send certain requests to some other staff person not normally notified.\" (Appellant's Trial Brief at 8.) ODRC filed its brief in the trial court on November 28, 2016, arguing that the May 12, 2014 e-mail was a directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On December 12, 2016, the trial court issued a decision and entry affirming the July 19, 2016 order of SPBR. The court noted that appellant and ODRC had agreed in the LCA that, if appellant committed any violation of the performance track of ODRC's standards of employee conduct, the appropriate discipline would be termination. The court observed that appellant had been given \"an order/directive\" on May 12, 2014 regarding \"how to handle a request for instructors,\" and that \"[a]ppellant failed to follow the new method when she requested instructors in June of 2014.\" (Decision at 7.) As such, the court concluded SPBR's July 19, 2016 order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. The trial court affirmed SPBR's July 19, 2016 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant appeals, assigning the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I. The Trial Court erred in finding there was reliable probative and substantial evidence to support the administrative agency decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   II. The Trial Court failed to apply the proper standard of review required for statutory construction and interpretation of R.C. 124.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   III. The decision of the Trial Court that Appellant was no longer covered by the civil service rules due to the existence of the LCA is unreasonable and repugnant to the purpose of R.C. 124.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   IV. The decision of the Trial Court that Appellant was no longer covered by the civil service rules due to the existence of the LCA is unreasonable and repugnant to the purpose of R.C. 124.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   V. The Trial Court's decision failed as a matter of law when finding the conduct of the Appellant was misconduct, not a mere mistake, failing to apply the Civil Service Law and the LCA referenced documents in their entirety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   VI. The Trial Court's decision failed as a matter of law to construe the terms of the LCA against the maker, the Ohio Department Of Rehabilitation and Correction, when it found Appellant's clerical mistake to be misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   VII. The Trial Court erred finding the LCA was violated and enforceable against the Appellant because its interpretation and decision by the Trial Court that any work error of any kind would result in a violation is inconsistent with the common use of the word misconduct; that enforcement of that interpretation is against public policy as incorporated in R.C. 124 because the LCA evidences no meeting of the minds that \"mistake\" or \"error\" means misconduct; and that provision is unconscionable as interpreted by the Trial Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} SPBR shall \"[h]ear appeals, as provided by law, of employees in the classified state service from final decisions of appointing authorities * * * relative to * * * discharge.\" R.C. 124.03(A)(1). SPBR has the power to \"affirm, disaffirm, or modify\" an appointing authority's removal order. R.C. 124.03(A)(1). In cases of removal, the employee may appeal the decision of SPBR to the court of common pleas as provided in R.C. 119.12.

(2) \"Probative\" evidence is evidence that tends to prove the issue in question; it must be relevant in determining the issue.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} While appellant agreed to refrain from performance related misconduct, she also agreed that if she \"violate[d] this [LCA], or commit[ted] any violations of the Performance Track of the ODRC Standards of Employee Conduct, the appropriate discipline [would] be termination from her position.\" (Appellee's Ex. 1.) Pursuant to the disjunctive \"or,\" the LCA presented two events which would result in appellant's termination: (1) if appellant engaged in performance related misconduct, or (2) if appellant committed any violation of the performance track of ODRC's standards of employee conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant argues that neither SPBR nor the trial court \"opined what it was about the Appellant's admitted 'mistake' that took it to the level of misconduct.\" (Appellant's Brief at 10.) However, because appellant's \"mistake\" violated the performance track of ODRC's standards of employee conduct, the LCA provided for appellant's termination. ODRC did not need to additionally establish that appellant's conduct was misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Rule 7 of the performance track of ODRC's standards of employee conduct prohibits the \"[f]ailure to follow * * * written or verbal directives.\" (Appellee's Ex. 3.) Rule 50 prohibits \"[a]ny violation of ORC 124.34.\" (Appellee's Ex. 3.) R.C. 124.34(A) provides that \"[n]o officer or employee shall be * * * removed * * * except * * * for,\" among other things, \"violation of any policy or work rule of the\n   officer's or employee's appointing authority.\" Because a violation of Rule 7 of the standards of employee conduct violated an ODRC work rule, the Rule 7 violation was also a violation of R.C. 124.34(A). Thus, the Rule 7 violation amounted to a Rule 50 violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} ODRC's standards of employee conduct do not define the word \"directive.\" A directive is generally defined as \"something that serves to direct, guide, and usu. impel toward an action or goal;\n   <em>\n    esp\n   </em>\n   : an authoritative instrument issued by a high-level body or official.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   354 (11th Ed.2014). The May 12, 2014 e-mail came from the highest level official at the Academy, Superintendent Dr. Reveal. Appellant admitted she received the e-mail, and admitted that \"the intention\" of the e-mail \"was for [her] to follow it.\" (Tr. at 22.) Appellant's job involved requesting volunteer instructors from ODRC institutions, and the May 12, 2014 e-mail instructed appellant regarding how she was to perform that aspect of her job with respect to requests sent to CCI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Accordingly, the May 12, 2014 e-mail was a written directive. The e-mail was an authoritative instrument issued from the highest level official at the Academy, which directed Academy employees to send requests for volunteer instructors from CCI to Hamilton. The evidence of appellant's June 30, 2014 request, sent to Warden Jenkins rather than Hamilton, was reliable, probative, and substantial evidence demonstrating appellant failed to follow Dr. Reveal's May 12, 2014 directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellant argues that, because she \"contact[s] institutions to request instructors\" as part of her job, she \"did not violate any rule by contacting GCI or CCI for an instructor.\" (Appellant's Brief at 12.) To the contrary, it is precisely because appellant failed to perform her job in accordance with the May 12, 2014 directive that she violated Rule 7 of the standards of employee conduct.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayer v.

However, the lack of a wrongful intent might go to the theory of mitigation but not to the breach of the LCA. * * * As the SPBR noted in its meeting minutes, the violation cannot be justified by using a subjective review of the employee's intent. Most if not all of the Appellant's substantive arguments went to the issue of the size of the error and the fairness of a state employer terminating someone for such a small error. However, the Appellant was no longer covered by the civil service rules due to the existence of the LCA. Under normal situations, the Appellant would never have faced a sanction such as termination-but that all changed with the LCA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Decision at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellant asserts the \"LCA did not override the application of R.C. 124.34,\" and that the trial court erred in stating that \"an LCA supersedes R.C. 124.34 in all respects regarding the application of civil service law to the Appellant.\" (Appellant's Brief at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The trial court, however, also stated that \"[a]ppellant was covered by a valid LCA. Hence, the review conducted by the SPBR was limited as noted in R.C. 124.34(B).\" (Decision at 6.) R.C. 124.34(B) provides that \"in an appeal of a removal order based upon a violation of a [LCA], [SPBR] may only determine if the employee violated the agreement and thus affirm or disaffirm the judgment of the appointing authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Generally, SPBR has the authority to \"review an appointing authority's decision and to disaffirm an employee's discharge not only where the appointing authority acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unlawfully, but also where [SPBR] finds in an independent review that the decision regarding discharge is improper or unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Maurer v.
