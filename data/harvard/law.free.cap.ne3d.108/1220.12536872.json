For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The December 3, 2013 Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Wohlheter worked in the CMHA police department as a detective. On December 3, 2013, he and two other detectives, Robert Weis (\"Weis\") and Clinton Ovalle (\"Ovalle\"), were conducting \"quality of life\" patrols on Lakeview Estates, a CMHA property. As found by the arbitrator,\n   the events leading to the instant grievance matter unfolded as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} While patrolling the CMHA property, the three officers observed what appeared to be a drug transaction between a man and a woman, later identified as Thomas Moore (\"Moore\") and Tamblyn Stanley (\"Stanley\"), respectively. The officers exited their vehicle to investigate the suspected drug transaction. Spotting the officers, Stanley began to walk away. Ovalle approached her while the other two officers approached Moore. While Ovalle searched Stanley, Weis and Wohlheter ordered Moore to the ground, handcuffed him, and conducted a pat-down search. They found a CMHA key in his possession but no drugs. Moore told the detectives the key belonged to his child's mother, who was a tenant in a CMHA apartment. The officers released Stanley, but decided to search the CMHA apartment for drugs. They placed Moore in the police vehicle and had him direct them to the apartment. As soon as they entered the apartment building, the officers detected the odor of marijuana and encountered another man who appeared to have been smoking marijuana. Ovalle stayed behind to investigate that man while Weis and Wohlheter continued to the apartment with Moore, who was still handcuffed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Det. Weis used the seized key to open the door of the apartment. While Weis stood by the doorway with Moore, Wohlheter entered the apartment. As Weis testified later, Wohlheter searched the apartment; specifically, he searched the kitchen, refrigerator, freezer, cupboard cabinets above the refrigerator, and two cereal boxes. No drugs were found, however. Ovalle then arrived and also entered the apartment. He talked to Wohlheter and decided that they could not legally search the apartment. The two then exited the apartment. According to Weis's testimony, Wohlheter was in the apartment for about ten minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Internal Investigation of the Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Stanley subsequently filed a complaint alleging that Ovalle used excessive force when searching her. Sergeants Gregory Drew (\"Drew\") and Paul Styles (\"Styles\") were assigned to investigate her complaint. As part of that investigation, they interviewed the three officers, Stanley, and Moore. The investigation revealed that the three detectives engaged in conduct that violated CMHA police department's policies and procedures. Drew found Wohlheter not only participated in the unlawful arrest and transportation of Moore from one location to another, but also unlawfully searched the apartment and then provided an untruthful account of the events during the subsequent investigation of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to Drew, Wohlheter was deceptive and tried to cover up his actions during the investigation. Wohlheter initially misled the investigation by claiming Moore was not handcuffed and opened the apartment door himself, although Wohlheter later admitted in the predisciplinary hearing that it was Weis who opened the door. Wohlheter maintained he was in the apartment for only 10 to 12 seconds. He also denied searching the kitchen. These statements were directly inconsistent with both Weis's and Moore's accounts of the events, which indicated Moore was handcuffed the entire time and Wohlheter stayed in the apartment for about ten minutes and searched some items in the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After a predisciplinary review, CMHA terminated Wohlheter on April 24, 2014. CMHA cited Wohlheter's violation of CMHA's rules and regulations, violation of Moore's civil rights, illegal search of the apartment, and dishonest conduct during\n   the investigation. Ovalle was also terminated and Weis was given a 30-day suspension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Grievance and Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On April 30, 2014, on behalf of Wohlheter, the Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. (\"the union\") filed a grievance procedure pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"). The union contended the termination was without just cause. The grievance was denied. The union then pursued arbitration on behalf of Wohlheter pursuant to the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The arbitrator conducted a two-day hearing. Before the arbitrator, the union argued that Wohlheter did not engage in any misconduct and he was not dishonest during the internal investigation. The union also argued CMHA engaged in disparate treatment-punishing Wohlheter more severely than Weis, who was a more senior officer and only received a 30-day suspension as opposed to Wohlheter's termination, and that it did not have just cause to terminate Wohlheter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} CMHA argued that Wohlheter was terminated for just cause-for the illegal arrest of Moore and illegal search of the apartment, and for his dishonesty during the investigation of the incident. CMHA argued that it was not required to impose progressive discipline because of Wohlheter's dishonesty during the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Arbitrator's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On August 4, 2015, the arbitrator issued a decision reinstating Wohlheter, with a substantial suspension (nearly 16 months) and denial of back-pay. The arbitrator found Wohlheter violated CMHA's rules and regulations in the prolonged detainment of Moore and the illegal search of the apartment. The arbitrator also found Wohlheter engaged in acts of dishonesty. But because of the difference in treatment of penalties between Wohlheter and Weis, and because of the mitigating evidence in Wohlheter's favor, the arbitrator ultimately concluded that termination was \"too severe\" and \"not reasonable under the just cause provision of the CBA.\" The arbitrator reached this decision as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Here, the arbitrator acknowledged CMHA Police Chief Andres Gonzalez's emphasis on Weis's honesty and recognized that, despite an initial lack of candor during Drew's interview of him, Weis eventually provided a truthful and complete account of the unlawful detention of Moore and search of the apartment. Weis's ultimate truthfulness enabled the CMHA police department in its investigation to ascertain the facts surrounding the incident. The arbitrator also noted Chief Gonzalez's emphasis on Weis's expression of remorse as an indication that he has learned a valuable lesson from the incident and could continue to be an asset to CMHA police department. And the arbitrator acknowledged Weis's contrite attitude both later during the investigation and at the arbitration hearing. But the arbitrator also remarked that, although eventually truthful, Weis initially attempted to hide the illegal detention and search as well, and he only became truthful when pressed further. Ultimately, although finding that Wohlheter's conduct during the incident was more egregious than Weis's conduct, the arbitrator believed the difference in the conduct did not justify the \"level of difference\n   in the penalty.\" The arbitrator acknowledged, however, that because Wohlheter's conduct was more severe, \"a more severe penalty is justified.\" After considering mitigating factors, such as Wohlheter's work record, service time, and the gravity of the offenses, the arbitrator decided Wohlheter's penalty for his conduct should be a substantial suspension without pay instead of termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In reinstating Wohlhether, the arbitrator further acknowledged concern over public policy but stated that \"there is no evidence in the record which indicates that there is 'an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy' against the reinstatement of an officer who has engaged in the misconduct as outlined in the decision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitrator's Decision, page 29. Accordingly, the arbitrator ordered CMHA to modify the disciplinary action to a suspension from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement, without back pay or benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Trial Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} CMHA filed a motion to vacate the arbitrator's award with the trial court. The trial court denied CMHA's motion, stating that the arbitrator's decision to reinstate Wohlheter drew its essence from the CBA and did not violate public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} CMHA now appeals, raising as its sole assignment of error that the trial court erred by not vacating the report and award of the arbitrator pursuant to R.C. 2711.10(D) because the arbitration award is unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious and is against public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Nor does CMHA or the dissent cite to any. Instead, CMHA cites to dicta and otherwise distinguishable case law to advocate for a bright-line rule that would prevent retention or reinstatement of any police officer found to be \"dishonest.\" As discussed more fully below, the cases CMHA relies upon are distinguishable and do not justify vacating the arbitrator's award in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Initially, we note that dishonest acts by a police officer that render an arbitration award unenforceable are not well-defined under Ohio law.

In\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   , the court's holding is rooted in its finding that, aside from the officer committing a criminal act of falsification, the officer also violated R.C. 737.11, which expressly provides that \"the police force shall * * * obey and enforce * * * all criminal laws of the state and the United States.\" Wohlheter, however, was not terminated for falsifying a police report and therefore the public policy recognized in\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   does not preclude his reinstatement in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Contrary to the dissent's suggestion,\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that Ohio has a well defined and dominant public policy against a contractual agreement to severely punish yet reinstate a police officer who engages in any acts of dishonesty in his or her official capacity. Such a broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   directly contravenes the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court's admonitions. Indeed, we are constrained to uphold the arbitrator's decision unless the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement violates some explicit, well defined, and dominant public policy. Extending\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   beyond its holding for a blanket proposition ignores our limited review and dangerously transforms a narrow exception into a broad authority for courts to severely undermine the purpose of a collective bargaining agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} As stated previously, in resolving CMHA's arguments, our inquiry is not whether Wohlheter's conduct itself violates public policy, but whether the arbitrator's decision to reinstate him did so.\n   <em>\n    Dayton v.

Despite recognizing Ohio and federal laws that require drug testing and prohibit the use of controlled\n   substances by transportation employees, the Supreme Court held that \"Ohio has no dominant and well-defined public policy that renders unlawful an arbitration award reinstating a safety-sensitive employee who was terminated for testing positive for a controlled substance, assuming that the award is otherwise reasonable in its terms for reinstatement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=742%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n    742 N.E.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And, absent an award that clearly violates a well-defined and dominant public policy, our review requires deference to upholding the arbitrator's decision. We find that the cases relied on by CMHA do not evidence a well-defined and dominant public policy that renders unlawful an otherwise reasonable arbitration award reinstating Wohlheater for his dishonest conduct.

We find this authority applicable and persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In this case, the arbitrator considered Wohlheter's five years of service with acceptable performance, his lack of prior disciplinary action, and an absence of any indication that Wohlheter cannot be rehabilitated to perform his duties as an officer.

The arbitrator's award punished Wohlheter by imposing a substantial suspension (from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement) without back pay and benefits.

That authority, though, is not limitless. I agree with CMHA that this arbitration award is unenforceable. This particular award violates public policy. It contravenes Ohio law. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 48} I agree with the majority that the public policy exception to our review of arbitration awards is narrow. I fully disagree with the majority's application of the exception in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Here, the arbitrator acknowledged that a claim of dishonesty against a police officer was very stigmatizing and, therefore, CMHA must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Wohlheter was dishonest. Applying that standard, the arbitrator found that Wohlheter committed dishonest conduct. The arbitrator's decision stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The evidence demonstrates that CMHA had sufficient evidence before it to determine that the Grievant gave misleading statements during the investigation of the incident. Even if the Grievant could have been mistaken about who opened the door to the apartment, the evidence obtained through the investigation revealed that the Grievant searched the apartment. The Grievant maintained that he did not search the apartment. Moreover, the Grievant said they were in the apartment 10-12 seconds. This is much different than the 10 minutes revealed during the investigation, and is clearly not the result of a mistake. Moreover the Grievant stated that all three officers dealt with Antonio Shanklin and the marijuana and then went to the apartment together. It was revealed that this was not true. The evidence reveals that Detective Ovalle stayed and dealt with Mr. Shanklin while the Grievant, Detective Weis and Moore went upstairs to the apartment. It is not likely that this was a mistake on the Grievant's part. The Grievant should recall if he dealt with Mr. Shanklin; this is not a minor detail, it's hard to believe that the Grievant would be mistaken about that. Therefore, CMHA provided clear and convincing evidence that the Grievant was not truthful during the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The evidence establishes that the Authority provided clear and convincing evidence that the grievant engaged in misconduct and violated several of CMHA's\n   rules and regulations. The Authority provided evidence that the Grievant participated in the unnecessary prolonged detainment of Moore, the illegal search of Terracia Goin's apartment and the Authority provided sufficient evidence that Grievant was dishonest during the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 50} To determine whether there is a well-defined and dominant public policy prohibiting the reinstatement of a police officer who commits acts of dishonesty, we are to examine and seek guidance from \"laws and legal precedents.\"\n   <em>\n    S.W.

The majority asserts an inappropriately narrow interpretation of the public policy prohibition in\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   , finding that prohibiting the reinstatement of a police officer who falsifies a traffic ticket does not prohibit reinstatement related to any or all acts of dishonesty. The majority then concludes that because Wohlheter was not terminated for falsifying a police report, the public policy in\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   does not preclude his reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 56} We note first that, although the facts in\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   involved the falsification of a traffic ticket, the court found that Ohio has a well-defined and dominant public policy expressly prohibiting the reinstatement of an officer who falsifies a report. While the prohibition is certainly more than a \"general consideration of supposed public interest,\" it is clearly not limited to falsifying traffic tickets.\n   <em>\n    W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, Internatl. Union of the United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299394\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/757/\">\n    461 U.S. 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299394\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/757/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299394\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/757/\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Further, while the court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   was undoubtedly bolstered by the fact that falsification is a criminal act, its public policy holding was ultimately rooted in the notion that \"honesty is vital to the effective performance of [police] duties and to ensuring public trust and confidence in the police force.\"\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. In light of this reasoning, I find the reinstatement of an officer who first violated department policy and Ohio laws of search and seizure and subsequently made repeated false statements and provided a knowingly untruthful account of those events during an official investigation to be equally violative of the public policy against reinstatement of dishonest officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 58} This position is further supported by the unique circumstances of the facts underlying the investigation in this case as articulated by CMHA Police Chief Andres Gonzalez. Gonzalez testified at length before the arbitrator and explained that, as a CMHA officer, Wohlheter was tasked with serving an economically disadvantaged community that has historically had a high level of distrust of the police. He went on to explain that CMHA police officers are unique in that they encounter the same residents and their families frequently and, therefore, earning the community's trust is of utmost importance in the officers' ability to carry out their duties. In light of this context, an officer making false statements during an investigation into his own commission of an unnecessary prolonged detainment and illegal search is just as detrimental, if not more so, to a police force's ability to effectively carry out its duties under R.C. 737.11 as falsifying a traffic ticket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Like Wohlheter, Det. Ovalle also filed a grievance regarding his termination and the matter proceeded to arbitration as well. Contrasting the roles of the two CMHA officers, the arbitrator reinstated Det. Ovalle, finding that Det. Ovalle did not participate in the illegal search of the apartment and that Tamblyn Stanley's account of excessive use of force was not credible. More importantly, the arbitrator found that Det. Ovalle did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   engage in dishonest conduct during the investigation of the incident. Consequently, the arbitrator reinstated Det. Ovalle and imposed a 30-day suspension instead. This court affirmed the trial court's decision that affirmed\n   the arbitration award.\n   <em>\n    Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. v. FOP, Labor Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

In affirming the trial court's judgment denying CMHA's motion to vacate the arbitration award, this court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   CMHA raised issues of dishonesty throughout the arbitration proceedings and the arbitrator addressed these allegations specifically.\n   <em>\n    The arbitrator found that Detective Ovalle did not engage in dishonest conduct\n   </em>\n   . The portion of the arbitration award detailing the arbitrator's findings that Detective Ovalle did not engage in conduct that would constitute dishonesty is lengthy and thorough. CMHA attempted to show that Detective Ovalle lied during interviews he gave regarding the Stanley and Moore incidents.\n   <em>\n    The arbitrator found that Detective Ovalle was not dishonest\n   </em>\n   , and that his version of events was more credible than Stanley's. The arbitrator found that Stanley's allegations against Detective Ovalle changed over time. She initially reported that Detective Ovalle swept her legs out from under her, causing her to fall. She later said Detective Ovalle pushed her down to the ground. The arbitrator noted that Detective Ovalle's description of his interaction with Stanley was consistent. The arbitrator found that Detective Ovalle was more credible. Credibility determinations are primarily for the factfinder to make. This court cannot review the merits of the factual determinations made by the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Assn. v. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785668\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/107/248/#p257\">\n    107 Ohio App.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=668%20N.E.2d%20548\">\n    668 N.E.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist. 1995). Further, Moore's version of events fit more closely with Detective Ovalle's statements and testimony than Stanley's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Although the court was constrained by its inability to review the factual determinations made by the arbitrator, it nevertheless quoted the public policy enunciated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   and noted that in identifying \"a strong, well-recognized public policy * * * that precluded the reinstatement of officers who falsified reports,\"\n   <em>\n    Rist\n   </em>\n   was \"representative of a line of cases demonstrating a strong public policy against the retention of individuals as police officers who engage in acts of dishonesty in their official capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The majority in this case concludes that because the court in\n   <em>\n    Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth.\n   </em>\n   did not address or analyze any alleged dishonesty by Det. Ovalle, it did not adopt or apply the relevant public policy. This conclusion is problematic. The court did not affirm the arbitrator's award because it did not find a well-defined and dominant public policy prohibiting the reinstatement of officers who commit acts of dishonesty in their official capacity. On the contrary, the court affirmed the arbitrator's award, at least in part, because Det. Ovalle had not committed acts of dishonesty that would have made the arbitrator's award violate public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 62} In contrast to the arbitrator's finding regarding Det. Ovalle, the arbitrator in the instant case found Wohlheter to have engaged in repeated acts of dishonesty yet reinstated him. This writer acknowledges that the narrow public policy exception does not provide a broad judicial power to set aside arbitration awards as against public policy. The facts of this case are certainly sufficiently compelling to vacate the arbitrator's award reinstating Wohlheter. The continued employment of any such officer only serves to erode fragile public trust and confidence in the law\n   enforcement officers, who are entrusted to the unique front line position of public trust. Ohio's courts have stressed the importance of maintaining the public's confidence by ensuring the integrity of law enforcement officers. Examining the laws and legal precedents, it is found that Ohio has a well-defined and dominant public policy favoring an honest police force made up of officers who command the public trust, and laws and court precedents against the reinstatement of a police officer who has committed acts of dishonesty in his official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 63} I agree with the majority's determination that the arbitrator here had the authority to act. No arbitrator possesses unlimited authority to exceed clearly established public policy. This award is contrary to public policy. It should not be enforced. For that reason, I would reverse the trial court's judgment denying CMHA's motion to vacate the arbitration award reinstating Wohlheter.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
