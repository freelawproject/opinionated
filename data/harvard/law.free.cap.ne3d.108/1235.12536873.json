( Civ.R. 12(b)(6) ). As required by that Rule, we assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true and construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Within that context, we set forth the relevant facts below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND THE CASE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellants Adam Keim (\"Keim\"), and Laura Williamson (\"Williamson\") were employees of Appellee Sterilite of Ohio, LLC and Appellants Donna L. Lunsford (\"Lunsford\"), Peter D. Griffiths (\"Griffiths\"), are still so employed. Appellee Sterilite of Ohio, LLC, (\"Sterilite\") is a limited liability company located at 4495 Sterilite Avenue, S.E., in Massillon, Ohio. Appellee Sterilite, LLC (\"the Parent Company\"), is a limited liability company that is the parent company of the Appellee Sterilite. Defendant U.S. Healthworks Medical Group of Ohio, Inc. (\"U.S. Healthworks\"), is a corporation located at 2626 Fulton Drive, N.W., Canton, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellee Sterilite adopted a Substance Abuse Policy, a copy of which was attached to the complaint. The Policy warned of testing for \"reasonable suspicion that an employee may be impaired by the use of drugs or alcohol in violation of this policy,\" and that the company would conduct \"random testing at periodic intervals to maintain safety and productivity.\" The Policy explained that Sterilite would use a urinalysis method to test for the use of illegal drugs or the improper use of prescription or over-the-counter drugs. The Policy described the procedure and the consequences of refusal or failure to take the test as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Employees to be tested will be informed by their Supervisor as to when and where they are to report for testing. Employees will be granted up to two and one-half hours to produce a valid specimen for test purposes. Failure to produce a valid urine specimen within the allowed timeframe will be considered as a refusal to undergo a drug test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Failure to properly submit to a BAT or blood alcohol test within the allowed timeframe will be considered a refusal to undergo the BAT or blood alcohol test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES: Any employee who refuses to undergo a drug/alcohol test will be subject to immediate termination. Except as otherwise provided in this policy, an employee who tests positive for alcohol, illegal drugs, or prohibited use of prescription or over-the-counter drugs as described in this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. An employee, (sic) who tests positive for the use of valid prescription or over-the-counter drugs will not be subject to disciplinary action if the test is the result of a random drug screen. If, however, the positive test is the result of a test based upon reasonable suspicion of impairment or a workplace accident/incident, disciplinary action will be imposed up to and including termination. A positive test for marijuana, even if based upon a prescription for medical purposes under Ohio law, will subject the employee to discipline under this Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Exhibit B, Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellants were notified by Sterilite to appear at a specified location within the Sterilite plant to submit to a urinalysis. Lunsford, Williamson and Griffiths were subject to a random screening. Keim was tested under the reasonable suspicion clause of the policy and while he objected to the assertion that there was reasonable suspicion, he complied with the directive of Sterilite as did all Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Sterilite used what Appellants describe as a direct observation method of collecting the urine specimen for the test. Each employee was accompanied by an individual of the same sex to a restroom facility designated by Sterilite for the exclusive purpose of collecting urine samples pursuant to the Policy. While in the restroom, the person accompanying the Appellant was obligated to visually observe the Appellants genitals and the production of the urine sample. U.S. Healthworks completed the collection in this manner at the direction of Sterilite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The direct observation procedure was disclosed to the Appellants only immediately prior to conducting the test. Direct observation was not described in the Substance Abuse Policy maintained by Sterilite. Appellants signed a consent and release form shortly prior to the administration of the test, but the form did not reference direct observation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Appellants had not behaved in any manner that would give Sterilite cause to believe that they would do anything to compromise the integrity of the urine sample, nor did they make any statements or take any action that might be reasonably interpreted as advocacy or threats to undermine the policy. The Appellants did not act in a way that created a concern that they might adulterate past samples, the samples taken on that date or advocate that any other employee take such an action. Appellant Lunsford was subject to urine tests at Sterilite prior to the tests at issue, but none used direct observation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Sterilite began using the direct observation method in October 2016 and it was used for all analyses without any requirement that the employee had engaged in any behavior that might alter the outcome of the urinalysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} All Appellants were subject to the direct observation method of collection. Sterilite terminated Keim's and Williamson's employment because they failed to produce a urine specimen within two and one half hours, despite their good faith effort to comply with the request. Lunsford and Griffiths were able to supply a sample, but Lunsford was particularly uncomfortable\n   because it forced her to reveal genital scarring she suffered from a surgical procedure. Lunsford and Griffiths are still employed by Sterilite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellants filed a complaint on December 22, 2016 alleging Invasion of Privacy, Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy, Failure to Remit Minimum Wages, Failure to Remit Wages, Breach of Contract and seeking Declaratory Judgment, Injunctive Relief, and Certification as a Class. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(b)(6) and Appellants opposed the motion. The trial court granted the motion on May 9, 2017 with regard to Count One, Invasion of Privacy; Two, Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy; Three, Declaratory Judgment regarding the Direct Observation Method; Four, Injunctive Relief regarding the Direct Observation Method, and Five, Class Action for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. On June 13, 2017 Appellant Williamson dismissed her claims in counts Six through Eight without prejudice. On November 27, 2017, after several pleadings involving an attempt to file an amended complaint and other unrelated matters, Appellants dismissed counts Six through Eight and thereafter, on November 30, 2017, the trial court entered an order noting that no claims remain pending and the order of May 9, 2017 was now a final appealable order. Appellants filed a notice of appeal on December 26, 2017 and submitted the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} I.

Appellants' case will survive or fail based upon the resolution of that issue alone. The first assignment of error addresses that question, and the remaining assignments assume that the first assignment is decided in Appellants' favor. If the first assignment of error is rejected, the remaining assignments are rendered moot.

Consequently, this type of claim does not require that the Appellees took steps to expose the Appellants' private matters to the public, but only that the Appellants had a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the subject matter and Appellees wrongfully intruded into the protected area. \"In other words, there is no wrongful intrusion where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. \"\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Appellees contend the Appellants' expectation of privacy was reduced in this context such that the direct observation method did not violate the Appellants' privacy and offer citations to several cases in support of their argument. While those cases do show that an employee has a reduced expectation of privacy regarding the composition of their bodily fluids, the precedent Appellees rely upon does not address the direct observation method implemented by Appellees and whether Appellants have a reasonable expectation of privacy in this context.

The Supreme Court of Ohio addressed an analogous situation in\n   <em>\n    Housh\n   </em>\n   when it examined the means used by a collection company to collect a debt and held that while the company had a right to collect the debt, the Court would impose limits to its ability to invade the debtor's right of privacy.

We read the holding in\n   <em>\n    Housh\n   </em>\n   as applied in this context to mean that an employer may use reasonable means to accomplish its goal of providing a safe and drug free workplace, including the collection and testing of bodily fluids. However, just as in\n   <em>\n    Housh,\n   </em>\n   we cannot state there can never be a method of collection of bodily fluids that would fall \"outside the bounds of reasonable methods which may be pursued\" and that, therefore \"is actionable as an invasion of plaintiff's right of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20N.E.2d%20340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The trial court does not include in its analysis of precedent the\n   <em>\n    Housh\n   </em>\n   directive to consider the reasonableness of the intrusion, but the cases cited by the trial court recognize similar limitations on the method of collecting urine specimens.

We find the distinction between the two cases to be more striking than what is noted by the trial court. In\n   <em>\n    Vernonia School Dist. 47J\n   </em>\n   the Court noted that \"These conditions are nearly identical to those typically encountered in public restrooms, which men, women, and especially schoolchildren use daily.

We cannot agree that the United States Supreme Court would arrive at the same conclusion should it be presented with the facts that are described in Appellants' complaint in the case at bar, namely the direct observation of the Appellant's genitals. The Appellants' allegations present a picture that is very different from conditions typically encountered in public restrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 36} A similar distinction can be made with regard to another case cited by Appellee and the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Wilcher v.

In that case, the plaintiffs claimed that direct observation of their genitals occurred during the collection of the urine specimen. The Third Circuit noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The firefighters claim that monitors looked at their genitalia as they urinated. SODAT and its employees, on the other hand, steadfastly maintain that they did not focus on the firefighters'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   genitalia during the urine collection process.

Consequently, we will adopt the\n   <strong>\n    district court's description of the SODAT procedure as one which entails only incidental observation of a firefighters' genitals\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Wilcher\n   </em>\n   at 375 (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The Third Circuit decided it was important to investigate the details regarding the method of collection and the level of intrusion into the firefighters privacy caused by that method. The court found only incidental observation of genitals and, therefore, found no invasion of privacy. With regard to female firefighters, the court agreed that \", the facts of this case suggest that SODAT took substantial measures to minimize the intrusion of privacy to female firefighters caused by the direct observation procedure\" and that \"the monitors did not look at the firefighters genitalia as the urinated, but rather in their general direction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11835410\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11835410\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/366/\">\n    at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Both the United States Supreme Court and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the method utilized during direct observation was an important issue and both determined there was only incidental observation of genitals. The fact that both courts felt it important to reach that conclusion suggests that a different conclusion may be reached under different facts and, therefore, we cannot agree that the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Vernonia School Dist. 47J\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilcher\n   </em>\n   provide an answer which should lead to the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In the case before us, we are not called to determine whether direct observation of urine collection is justified or reasonable considering the circumstances. We consider justification and reasonableness to be factual issues that must not be decided in the context of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. If this case was solely focused upon whether the employer invades an employee's privacy by requiring the employee to produce a sample of bodily fluids, such as urine, for appropriate testing, we would agree that issue has been resolved. Requiring the production of a specimen and consent to a test would not likely be an invasion of privacy. However, the focus of the Appellant in this case is not the fact of the production of the sample and the subsequent test, but the means of collection. To the extent the Appellant is challenging the direct observation method, the precedent Appellees rely upon is unhelpful as it does not address the method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The Southern District of New York considered a case regarding direct observation in the context of a claims of a violation of the Fourth Amendment and, while that case focused on a different basis for the challenge to the testing procedure, the courts characterization of the collection process is helpful:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   I find urinalysis analogous to a blood test.

We cannot agree that there is no set of facts upon which the Appellants may recover. Both Appellees and the trial court rely upon case law that does not foreclose the possibility that the method of collection of a urine sample could comprise a violation of the Appellants' right to privacy. We conclude that Appellants have stated a valid claim and that dismissal for failure to state a claim was not supported by a review of the pleadings and the attachments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Because the remaining assignments of error have at their foundation the claims of invasion of privacy, because the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim of invasion of privacy and because we find that decision in error, consideration of the remaining assignments of error at this junction would be premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 45} For the forgoing reasons, the decision of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, the judgment vacated and the matter remanded to the trial\n   court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Gwin, P.J. and Hoffman, J. concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
