This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} J.C.H. was a young woman who struggled with addiction and lived at home with her family and three-year-old son. On the afternoon of March 22, 2015, her family found her body on the floor of her bedroom. There were drugs and related paraphernalia near her body, and it was later determined that she died as a result of a fentanyl overdose. Following a brief investigation, the police identified Mr. Ecker as the individual whom they believed had provided her with the lethal dose of fentanyl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The police secured a warrant to search Mr. Ecker's residence and executed the warrant two days after J.C.H. died. During the search, they uncovered fentanyl, alprazolam, suboxone, marijuana, needles, digital scales, and drug packaging materials. The police then arrested Mr. Ecker and searched him, whereupon they also found two small bindles of fentanyl in his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The foregoing events led to a grand jury indicting Mr. Ecker in Criminal Case No. 2015-03-0964. In that case, he was charged with aggravated trafficking in fentanyl, trafficking in marijuana, possessing marijuana, possessing alprazolam, possessing suboxone, illegally using or possessing drug paraphernalia, possessing drug abuse instruments, and multiple forfeiture specifications. Additional charges were then added by way of supplemental indictment. The supplemental indictment charged him with involuntary manslaughter as a result of providing J.C.H. with fentanyl, corrupting her with drugs, aggravated trafficking in fentanyl, and trafficking in marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Ecker remained in jail for some time, but ultimately posted bond. In\n   February 2016, the police went to his new apartment because they received a call that gunshots had been fired at or near that location. While walking through the apartment, officers observed several items that led them to conduct a search. The search uncovered fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, drug packaging materials, a digital scale, and other items. As a result of the search, a grand jury indicted Mr. Ecker in Criminal Case No. 2016-02-0635(A) and charged him with aggravated trafficking in methamphetamine and fentanyl, aggravated possession of methamphetamine and fentanyl, possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and multiple forfeiture specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following Mr. Ecker's 2016 indictment, the State moved to consolidate his two cases for trial. Mr. Ecker opposed the motion, and the trial court held a hearing. Over Mr. Ecker's objections, the court granted the State's motion and ordered the cases consolidated for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Before trial, the State dismissed several counts, and the court permitted Mr. Ecker to plead no contest to the charges of possessing alprazolam and suboxone. His remaining counts were submitted to the jury, save for his minor misdemeanor count for possessing marijuana. The jury found him guilty on all counts, and the court found him guilty of the minor misdemeanor. The court sentenced him to a total of 21 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Mr. Ecker now appeals from the court's judgment and raises four assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT DENIED KEVIN ECKER A FAIR TRIAL AND DUE PROCESS OF LAW WHEN IT ALLOWED A JOINT TRIAL OF TWO DISTINCT EVENTS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Ecker argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it joined his 2015 and 2016 indictments for trial. He argues that the evidence in each case was not simple and direct and, had each case been tried separately, the evidence from each case would have been inadmissible in the other case.

This Court has held on multiple occasions that, to preserve a claim of error under Crim.R. 14, a defendant \"must renew his * * * motion to sever either at the close of the State's case or at the conclusion of all the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Lorain Nos. 10CA009922, 10CA009915,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-1263\">\n    2012-Ohio-1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201020239\">\n    2012 WL 1020239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17. According to the State, Mr. Ecker failed to renew his motion to sever at either time, so he is limited to a claim of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The record reflects that Mr. Ecker repeatedly objected to the joinder of his indictments for trial. Specifically, he opposed the State's initial motion to consolidate, argued against joinder at the hearing on the motion, renewed his objection at the start of trial, renewed his objection during the testimony of the State's seventeenth witness, and renewed his objection during the testimony of the State's penultimate witness. Additionally, at the end of the trial, he renewed \"all [his] prior objections and all [his] prior motions.\" While the better practice may have been for him to articulate a specific joinder objection at the conclusion of trial rather than make a general renewal of all of his prior motions, this Court cannot conclude that his failure to do so resulted in forfeiture. Mr. Ecker made a point of renewing all of his objections and motions and, importantly, at that time he had already articulated his prejudice argument on multiple occasions during the course of the trial. Under these particular facts and circumstances, this Court must conclude that he preserved his objection to joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Mr. Ecker argues that he was prejudiced by the joinder of his indictments for trial because it allowed the State to use the evidence against him in separate cases \"as an aggregate indication as to the validity of each claim.\" He avers that, had his cases been tried separately, the State would not have been permitted to introduce other acts evidence from one case in the other. Further, he avers that the joinder prejudiced him because the evidence in each case was not simple and direct. He notes that the 2015 case involved complicated DNA testimony and the 2016 case posed certain obstacles for the parties, such as how to keep from the jury the fact that he was on parole at the time of his arrest. According to Mr. Ecker, he was held accountable for the drugs the police\n   found in the 2016 case because the jury was aware that, at the time of his arrest, he had already been charged with a homicide and multiple drug offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} With respect to Mr. Ecker's 2015 case, the State presented evidence that he had been associating with the victim, J.C.H., for several months before her death. The two exchanged text messages wherein they repeatedly arranged to meet so that J.C.H. could purchase either marijuana or heroin from him. There was evidence that they were together directly before J.C.H. overdosed and that Mr. Ecker's DNA profile could not be excluded as the source of the major profile analysts found on one of the baggies in her possession when she died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} J.C.H. died as a result of a fentanyl overdose. The State presented evidence that the police searched Mr. Ecker's residence two days after her death and found fentanyl, alprazolam, suboxone, marijuana, needles, digital scales, and drug packaging materials in his basement and two bindles of fentanyl on his person. Additionally, two former addicts testified against Mr. Ecker. The first addict testified that he spoke with Mr. Ecker after J.C.H.'s death and Mr. Ecker (1) admitted that he had sold J.C.H. narcotics just before she overdosed, and (2) stated that he was trying to secure more of that \"real good dope.\" The second addict was present when the police raided Mr. Ecker's residence and testified that he was there because he had just purchased heroin from Mr. Ecker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} With respect to the 2016 case, the State presented evidence that the police came to Mr. Ecker's apartment to follow up on a call they had received. There was no mention of his being on parole, but there was testimony that a search ensued because officers spotted contraband while walking through the apartment. Mr. Ecker was present at the time along with his girlfriend and another male. The search resulted in officers finding fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, drug packaging materials, a digital scale, a snort straw, and three cell phones. The narcotics that they found had been wrapped in women's underwear and tucked into a pair of women's boots. Even so, the State produced evidence that, while being held in jail on the 2015 case, Mr. Ecker made several phone calls and spoke with at least one individual about securing a new drug supplier in anticipation of his release. The State also produced evidence that, after his release, Mr. Ecker exchanged numerous text messages with people, making arrangements to sell them various narcotics. In several of the messages, he referenced having his girlfriend make his deliveries for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As noted, prejudice as a result of joinder will not lie if (1) evidence of the joined offenses otherwise would have been admissible in separate trials as other acts evidence, or (2) the evidence of each crime was simple and direct.\n   <em>\n    Kolvek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-9137\">\n    2017-Ohio-9137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206542894\">\n    2017 WL 6542894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 18.

He testified that Mr. Ecker initially denied having sold heroin or fentanyl to J.C.H. As the interview progressed, however, Mr. Ecker admitted that he had sold her heroin, but claimed that he had not done so for a while.

The fact that an individual refuses to wear a wire is not an act that bears upon a particular trait of his character. An individual might refuse to wear a wire for any number of innocuous reasons, and it is not against the law to refuse to do so. Accordingly, Evid.R. 404(B) does not apply in this instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28 ;\n   <em>\n    Hash\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} To the extent Mr. Ecker argues that the detective's testimony was irrelevant and substantially more prejudicial than probative, this Court concludes that any error in the admission of that testimony was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 52(A) (errors that do \"not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded\"). The issues at trial were whether Mr. Ecker possessed and trafficked in certain narcotics and whether he caused J.C.H.'s death by providing her with fentanyl. The State produced a wealth of evidence tending to show that he had substantial quantities of narcotics in his possession, that he admitted having sold heroin to J.C.H. before, that he, in fact, had sold her fentanyl directly before her death, and that he routinely sold narcotics to other individuals. At worst, Detective Schmidt's testimony made it appear that Mr. Ecker was unwilling to assist the police in investigating his drug supplier or other individuals involved in the drug trade. That testimony, however, had no bearing on Mr. Ecker's own culpability in the commission of the offenses with which he was charged. Because Mr. Ecker has not shown that the detective's testimony affected the outcome in this matter, this Court rejects his argument concerning the admission of that testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201419104\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Testimony Regarding the Number of Overdose Deaths in Summit County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Mr. Ecker also argues that the trial court erred when it allowed the State to interject testimony about the increasing number of overdose deaths in Summit County. His brief, however, contains no analysis on that point other than to note that such testimony had no bearing on his guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7). Moreover, while he cites three portions of the record in support of his argument, the record reflects that he only objected on two of those occasions. Mr. Ecker did not object on the first occasion, which was the first time the State broached the subject. On that occasion, Detective Tim Harvey testified as to the increasing and specific number of overdose calls he and his partner had investigated over the last year. Later testimony simply mirrored that sentiment; noting that there had been a sizeable increase in the number of local overdose deaths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Mr. Ecker has not argued plain error on appeal or explained how he was prejudiced by the admission of later, cumulative testimony, given that he did not object to Detective Harvey's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201419104\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As this Court has repeatedly held, \"[i]f an argument exists that can support [an] assignment of error, it is not this [C]ourt's duty to root it out.\"\n   <em>\n    Cardone v.
