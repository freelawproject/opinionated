He raises two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. The trial court erred in granting Atlantis's motion for summary judgment on Scheel's negligence claim where there is a question of fact about whether Atlantis had both a contractual and common law duty to provide police services and breached that duty, proximately causing Scheel's injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. The trial court erred in granting Atlantis's motion for summary judgment on Scheel's spoliation of evidence claim where there is a question of fact about whether Atlantis was on notice of potential litigation and intentionally destroyed video footage which was necessary for Scheel to prove his case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to his assignments of error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Rock Ohio Caesars Cleveland, L.L.C. (\"the Casino\") is a company that\n   owned a casino located in downtown Cleveland. The Casino opened in May 2012. Prior to its opening, the Casino realized that it could not have armed security personnel on its payroll. As a result, on May 14, 2012, the Casino entered into a contract (\"the Security Agreement\") with Atlantis, \"a contract security management service [ ] in Northeastern Ohio [that employs] primarily security officers and Cleveland police officers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Security Agreement stated that Atlantis will \"provide the armed security services ('Services') as listed in Exhibit B.\" Exhibit B states that Atlantis is to \"[p]rovide police services upon request of the [Casino.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} As part of accepting the bid, Atlantis also had to engage with One Six Security. One Six Security provided logistical support and training to the Casino, including \"[o]fficer training that's outside the typical general practices of a police officer[, including] getting the [officers] to stay in the salutation of the day, making eye contact. More of a hospitality type of training.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Under its agreement with the Casino, Atlantis officers were to man seven stations around the Casino, including two parking lots. Commander Deon McCaulley, who worked for Atlantis and was responsible for creating a schedule for Atlantis officers, stated that the Casino did not want Atlantis officers patrolling the gaming floors and that the Casino's own security staff patrolled the gaming floors. McCaulley stated that, instead, Atlantis officers were to \"respond when * * * asked to do so\" through the Casino's dispatch system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} According to Scheel, on the evening of June 29, 2012, he and his then-fianc\u00e9e, Christine, went to the Casino.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around 1:45 a.m., Scheel sat down at a blackjack table next to Scott Greggor. While sitting at the table, Greggor began commenting on Scheel's polo shirt. Scheel stated that Greggor appeared intoxicated and slurred his words. Scheel stated that he tried to mind his own business and ignore Greggor who continued making comments about Scheel to another man who was also sitting at the table.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Eventually Christine came over, and after hearing Greggor's continued comments, began exchanging words with Greggor, causing the conversation to escalate. At one point, Scheel told Greggor not to talk to Christine, to which Greggor responded, \"How about I take you outside and kick your ass?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During this time, Alex Rotuno, an unarmed security guard employed by the Casino and wearing the Casino's tan security uniform, approached the men as the conversation continued to escalate and tried speaking with both men and Christine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Video footage from the Casino's surveillance cameras shows that seconds after Rotuno approached the table, Scheel stood up and got into Greggor's face. Scheel stated that he told Greggor that he \"might want to stop doing what [he was] doing.\" Greggor then immediately stood up and pushed Scheel over his chair, causing Scheel to fall down and land with \"all of [his] weight on [his] wrist[.]\" According to Scheel, Greggor had pushed him over \"within a minute or two\" of the argument starting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The video shows that Greggor and Scheel wrestled with one another and that Christine also involved herself in the altercation, grabbing Greggor's head and throwing punches. The video shows that the fight lasted approximately 27 seconds and was eventually broken up by the Casino's\n   security personnel. Atlantis officers did not arrive at the location until after the fight was over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Once the men were separated, Scheel and Christine were escorted to an interview room by the Casino's security personnel. During the interview, security personnel from both the Casino and Atlantis spoke with them. At one point, a Casino employee informed Scheel that video surveillance showed that both men were responsible for the altercation. As a result, Scheel and Christine became upset and raised their voices, and Stephanie Maye, employed by Atlantis, entered the room and asked them to settle down. At one point, Maye took Christine's phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} During the interview, Scheel made a number of comments suggesting that he was going to file a lawsuit as a result of the incident and stated that he had legal counsel that would take care of the situation. He also told Christine that she did not know \"how much [they] were going to make off of this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Thomas Lett, an Atlantis employee, also interviewed Scheel and Christine. Lett stated that the Casino had the incident on tape and that Scheel and Christine could get the Casino's reports later. The Casino permanently banned Scheel and Christine and escorted them out of the Casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On August 19, 2015, Scheel refiled a complaint against the Casino and Atlantis for his injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He set forth claims for negligence, false imprisonment, respondeat superior, and spoliation of evidence against the Casino and Atlantis. He also set forth claims for premises liability and dram shop liability against the Casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Casino and Atlantis filed answers denying wrongdoing and asserting affirmative defenses. Additionally, Atlantis set forth counterclaims against Scheel for spoliation of evidence and frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51. Scheel filed a reply denying Atlantis's counterclaims and asserting affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Casino and Atlantis filed motions to dismiss Scheel's false imprisonment claims, and the trial court granted both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Casino and Atlantis also separately filed motions for summary judgment as to Scheel's remaining claims. Scheel opposed both motions. In support of his argument that genuine issues of material fact existed as to his claims, he attached an expert report from Terry Hulse, a private investigator who had previously worked as a corporate director of investigations and security for Harrah's Corporation, which owned gaming properties. In drafting his report, Hulse reviewed a number of depositions, video footage from the Casino, an \"excerpt of the security plan,\" incident reports and daily logs from the Casino, and other documents. After reciting the factual background of the incident, Hulse concluded that \"Atlantis security officers are hired to provide security services at the [Casino] and have a duty to protect [Casino] patrons.\" Noting that Atlantis officers were not permitted to \"patrol the casino\" and \"took their direction from the [Casino's] security department[,]\" Hulse believed that \"Atlantis should have insisted that its officers be empowered to patrol the floor, rather than being confined to seven specific locations.\" He stated, \"I believe that Atlantis officers had a duty to actually and actively ensure the safety of [the Casino's] patrons.\" He also stated that the altercation between Greggor and Scheel and Scheel's injury were foreseeable based on the prior incidents that occurred at the Casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On August 9, 2016, the trial court granted Atlantis' motion for summary judgment, but denied the Casino's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The matter proceeded to trial on Scheel's claims against the Casino. A few days later, before trial concluded, however, the Casino and Scheel settled, and the trial court dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On October 3, 2016, Scheel appealed the trial court's decision granting Atlantis summary judgment. In\n   <em>\n    Scheel v. Rock Ohio Caesars Cleveland, L.L.C., d.b.a. Horseshoe Casino Cleveland\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105037,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-7174\">\n    2017-Ohio-7174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203432672\">\n    2017 WL 3432672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we dismissed Scheel's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Specifically, we found that there was not a final, appealable order because Atlantis' counterclaims against Scheel were unresolved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. As a result, we remanded the case to the trial court where Atlantis voluntarily dismissed its counterclaims against Scheel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} With the jurisdictional issue now aside, Scheel refiled his appeal of the trial court's decision granting Atlantis' motion for summary judgment as to his claims for negligence and spoliation of evidence only. He is not appealing the trial court's order granting summary judgment to Atlantis on his claims for false imprisonment and respondeat superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In Scheel's assignments of error, he argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Atlantis. His first assignment of error concerns his claim for negligence and his second concerns his claim for spoliation of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} An appellate court reviews a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

The Casino Did Not Ask Atlantis to Ensure That Its Security Plan was Adequate.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 32} First, Scheel argues that Atlantis had a duty to \"ensure that the\n   [Casino's security] plan was adequate.\" The Security Agreement states that Atlantis employees are to provide \"police services\n   <em>\n    upon request\n   </em>\n   of the [Casino].\" (Emphasis added.)

The Security Agreement is Not Ambiguous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Scheel further argues that the contract is ambiguous because it is unclear if \"police services\" included ensuring that the Casino's security plan was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Here, the first page of the Security Agreement states, \"[The Casino] hereby engages [Atlantis] to provide the armed security services ('Services') as listed in Exhibit B.\" Exhibit B, titled \"Description of Services,\" states, under \"Scope of Services,\" that Atlantis employees are to \"[p]rovide police services\n   <em>\n    upon request of the client\n   </em>\n   , in accordance with this Service Agreement.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In support of his argument that the Security Agreement is ambiguous, Scheel cites to\n   <em>\n    Adelman\n   </em>\n   , where we analyzed whether a security company negligently provided security services to the plaintiff, who suffered injury and was an intended beneficiary of the security contract between the security company and the owner of the premises.

In fact, neither the Casino nor Atlantis, who were the only parties to the Security Agreement, dispute the fact that Atlantis was not permitted to or in charge of checking or modifying the security plan and that such a responsibility did not fall under \"police services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Evidence submitted by Scheel's own expert supports this conclusion. Hulse's expert report notes that \"despite their uniforms and firearms, Atlantis officers had very little actual authority at the time of Scheel's injuries. They could not patrol the casino floor or make arrests. Although hired to provide security for the casino, Atlantis took their direction from the [Casino's] security department.\" Hulse's report continued to state, \"Thus, it is my opinion that Atlantis officers\n   <em>\n    should have been permitted\n   </em>\n   to patrol the casino, rather than being stationed at seven specific sites at the casino.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 40} During Hulse's deposition, he admitted that in forming his expert opinion, he never received the Casino's security plan and only reviewed an excerpt. When asked if he \"assign[ed] any responsibilit[y] for [the altercation between Scheel and Greggor] to Atlantis[,]\" Hulse said he did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Further, Section 11(q) of the Security Agreement states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [Atlantis'] employees shall comply with [the Casino's] security procedures at all times, and if any of [Atlantis'] employees is found to be in violation of such procedures by [the Casino], [the Casino] may remove them from [the Casino's] account or * * * property immediately, in [the Casino's] sole discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Moreover, Commander Deon McCaulley's testimony shows Atlantis' employees had little authority under the Security Agreement. McCaulley said he was hired by Atlantis immediately after it entered into the agreement with the Casino. He stated that it was his job \"to determine how many officers [the casino] would need in order to staff the schedule that they were giving us\" and that he was responsible for interviewing police officers to work at the Casino, making sure that those officers \"abided by the rules and regulations by the Cleveland division of police or the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office[,]\" and \"mak[ing] sure that they did the functions that the casino was asking us to perform.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Discussing the weeks leading up to the Casino's opening, McCaulley said that he worked on deciding \"how many police officers would be needed on a shift and where those police officers would be placed within the casino.\" He stated that in doing this, he worked with Joslyn Pennywell, the Casino's director of security, who was terminated prior to the Casino's opening. McCaulley explained that Brad Hirsch, Pennywell's supervisor, took over her security responsibilities. When asked what his \"understanding of the role that Atlantis CPD would play versus the role that casino security would play[,]\" McCaulley stated that \"Mr. Hirsch * * * did make clear the role that he wanted CPD to play. He wanted us to certainly be friendly and inviting to the guests[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 44} When asked whether the position he interviewed for \"was to be in charge of security\" at the casino, McCaulley stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Not to be in charge of security. They have a security director at the Horseshoe. My position was to organize or put together a schedule of Cleveland police officers and Cuyahoga County sheriff's deputies, put together a schedule that would allow those officers and deputies to work inside of the casino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   He explained, \"I wasn't part of putting together their overall security plan. But my understanding [was] that a component of that plan involved sworn police officers.\" McCaulley stated that he did not participate in developing the Casino's security plan and did not know if one existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 45} When asked about the locations of where Atlantis' employees were to stand in the Casino, McCaulley stated that he took \"direction from the [Casino] management security staff as to where they thought [Atlantis officers] were best utilized as police officers.\" McCaulley also explained that in June 2012, the Casino \"did not want a roving patrol[,] [s]o [Atlantis] did not patrol the gaming floor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Further, when asked about the interface between Atlantis and the Casino's own security personnel, McCaulley explained that Atlantis employees \"respond when * * * asked to do so. [The Casino's security personnel has] a dispatcher that will call [Atlantis personnel's] attention to wherever it's needed.\" He also stated that \"[a]n [Atlantis] officer will respond to wherever an altercation or argument is taking place.\" He stated that \"if there is information that needs to be shared with [Atlantis] police officers, it was shared [through the dispatch system].\" He explained that Atlantis security would respond to a location in the Casino if someone, through dispatch, communicated that they were needed. He also stated that dispatch did not share every report with Atlantis security personnel because \"it was [not] necessary for [Atlantis] officers to see every incident that [the Casino's] security staff handled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 47} When asked to explain what the Casino's request for a third-party security company called for, Kevin Jaite, Atlantis' senior vice president of operations, explained the Casino could not directly employ Cleveland police officers so it was \"looking for a third party to administer the contract[.]\" Jaite stated the Casino drafted the Security Agreement. When asked what the Casino's expectations of Atlantis officers were, Jaite stated that Atlantis officers \"had these fixed post positions[,]\" including one officer at each door to the Casino, one officer in the poker room on the third floor, and one officer near the escalators on the second floor. In his affidavit attached to Atlantis' motion for summary judgment, Jaite also stated that \"the casino determines where the CPD officers are stationed in the casino and how many.\" He also explained that while the Cleveland police officers \"have stations [that they] are asked to be at[,]\" the Casino's internal security patrol the floor. Jaite explained that the Cleveland police officers hired by Atlantis use general police practices while working at the Casino in addition to some general \"dos and don'ts,\" which covered \"their posture, not texting while they are working, how to report on and off the shift[,] [and] [w]here to stand.\" Jaite stated that the officers are in their full police uniforms, which includes their service weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 48} As to the security plan, Jaite said the following during his deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. [W]as there a security plan that somebody adopted? As you were going through this push training, did somebody have a plan for how the security of the casino would work and where CPD and Atlantis would\n   fit in and where everybody else would fit in?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. Yeah. We were working with Brad Hirsch from the casino at the time. He was the assistant general manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. Okay. My question was, did he have a plan?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. Let's go back to Brad Hirsch and his plan, the one that wasn't in the book, but the plan that he had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Tell me about how you * * * got an understanding of what Atlantis was supposed to be doing. So, for example, you told me there were going to be officers at different locations. How did you know that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. That was disseminated to us by either Brad or the casino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. Okay. And Brad Hirsch is orchestrating BCI and One Six and casino people and Atlantis people and CPD, and somewhere in that training, you got an understanding from Brad that your Atlantis police officers were supposed to be stationed at four or five locations in the casino?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. I think we had - I think we had maybe seven at the time, inside and outside. We had them all set out in the parking lot, in the Asher lot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. All right. So at this initial training session that lasted a couple of days, via Brad Hirsch, you understood that Atlantis was supposed to be placing seven officers at seven locations throughout the casino and the parking lot; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A. That's primarily where we got our post positions from.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. All right. And I understand that the security plan did not call for Atlantis CPD to be patrolling?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Jaite explained that the Casino's security director determined the Casino's security officers' responsibilities versus those of the officers hired by Atlantis. Jaite stated that if the Casino's internal security \"observe[s] something out of the ordinary or need[s] assistance, they will call or radio the police officer.\" He also explained that Atlantis employees are told to address situations the same way they would as if they were on duty and that \"[i]f a situation arises, they are required to respond accordingly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The following exchange also took place during Jaite's deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. Did you have a hand in developing a security plan for the casino?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. Have you ever seen a security plan for the casino?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q. Do you know if one exists?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Contrary to Scheel's argument that \"police services\" is ambiguous, the above evidence shows that there is no factual issue as to what \"police services\" meant in the Security Agreement. Neither the Casino nor Atlantis intended \"police services\" to mean developing, reviewing, or modifying the Casino's security plan. The evidence shows that the Casino developed the security plan, such as deciding that Atlantis would not patrol the gaming floor and would remain at seven designated locations until summoned by the Casino's dispatch system, and that Atlantis took no part in that development. Therefore, \"while factual determination of intent may be necessary\" in some cases, unlike\n   <em>\n    Adelman,\n   </em>\n   that is not the case here. Neither\n   Scheel nor his expert created genuine issues of material fact by arguing that a term of a contract, to which Scheel was not a party, meant something other than what the actual parties involved intended the term to mean. Therefore, we disagree with Scheel that the Security Agreement is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Atlantis Was Not Required to Perform More than Their Duties Under the Security Agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Scheel also argues, pointing to his expert report, that Atlantis was negligent because its failure to involve itself in developing, modifying, or ensuring that the security plan was adequate was unreasonable. Scheel's argument seems to suggest that Atlantis should have contracted to do more under the Security Agreement and demanded that the Casino allow it to review and/or modify the security plan. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 53} To find that Atlantis officers had a duty to protect Scheel by demanding that the Casino let them review or modify the security plan would go beyond the extent of Atlantis' contractual obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deeds v.

Scheel's expert report does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to what the Security Agreement actually required Atlantis to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.E.2d%201308\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]he expert testimony and opinion sought to be elicited by Deeds * * * as to the generally accepted standard of conduct for a security guard and Justice's adherence to that standard would not have been helpful to the jury\" based on the fact that the security guard's responsibilities were \"expressly limited\" by contract.). As a result, we find that Atlantis did not have a duty to modify or ensure that the Casino's security plan was adequate under the Security Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Foreseeability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Scheel also argues that Atlantis owed him a duty because his injury was foreseeable based on six incidents that occurred during the opening four weeks at the Casino prior to his fight with Greggor. While the incident reports are not detailed, the first six incidents can be summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   1. May 31, 2012, 8:17 p.m.: A fight occurred in the poker room between three patrons. All were escorted out of the Casino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   2. June 3, 2012, 3:30 a.m.: An altercation occurred in the Ontario Street parking garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   3. June 14, 2012, 2:42 a.m.: An intoxicated guest in the World Series Poker Room began \"behaving disorderly.\" Security officers from both the Casino and Atlantis engaged the intoxicated guest and escorted him to the cashier and eventually the bathroom, where he became hostile. The guest was eventually escorted out of the Casino and put on a 24-hour eviction. The guest returned later that day, where he was again escorted out of the Casino and placed on a permanent eviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   4. June 16, 2012, 3:57 a.m.: An altercation occurred on the gaming floor between two patrons, who were permanently evicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   5. June 16, 2012, 10:57 p.m.: While a patron waited for his girlfriend to exit the restroom, another patron\n   walked by and \"slightly brush[ed] his arm.\" The patrons, along with another male, began fighting near the Casino's food court. After the fight was broken up, all three men were escorted out of the Casino and permanently banned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   6. June 16, 2012, 11:10 p.m.: An altercation occurred between multiple patrons on the second floor of the Casino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Those incidents, however, do not show that Scheel's injury was foreseeable to Atlantis: first, because Atlantis officers were not present before or during the fight because they did not receive a dispatch until after the fight was over and, second, because Atlantis was not even provided the reports of the above-described incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 56} With respect to the incident in this case, Hulse's expert report states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   The fight between the three participants (Scheel, Speigel and Greggor) lasted approximately 27 seconds and was witnessed by as many as six Horseshoe security officers who were standing idly by in the immediate area. None of the security officers present made any attempt to stop the fight until a break in the action occurred that allowed the officers to step between the fighting guests.\n   <em>\n    Atlantis Security (CPD) appears to arrive on the scene a full ten seconds after the fight ends and the participants are separated.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Hulse's statement shows that Atlantis employees were not aware of the verbal dispute, did not know that the altercation was occurring, and did not arrive at the location until after the altercation ended. In fact, Scheel has not offered any evidence showing that Atlantis employees were made aware of circumstances suggesting that a physical altercation was imminent before Scheel had already suffered his injury. Atlantis employees' lack of awareness was not their fault. Instead, as noted earlier, Atlantis employees were stationed at seven spots throughout the Casino and parking areas, could not patrol the floors, and only left their designated stations when dispatched. This was part of the Casino's security plan, under which, as Commander McCaulley stated, Atlantis security personnel would \"respond when * * * asked to do so * * * [because the Casino] did not want a roving patrol.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Further, as to the prior incidents at the Casino, the record shows that Atlantis employees did not receive every incident report. Commander McCaulley explained that whether Atlantis employees receive an incident report \"depends on the circumstance.\" He said\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [I]f there is information that needs to be shared with police officers, it was shared. But I don't think that it was a situation with every report that [the Casino] made, [it] actually, shared it with CPD. I don't think it was necessary for our officers to see every incident that their security staff handled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Moreover, Hulse's report states, \"Perhaps even more egregious is the fact that Atlantis was unaware of any incidents at the casino at the time of Scheel's injuries. Jaite said that Atlantis does not receive or review reports of fights or arrests, and that it does not have access to the casino's i-Track system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Thus, the evidence establishes that, if anything, Scheel's injury was foreseeable to the Casino, whose security personnel and gaming employees were present during the verbal altercation and had access to the reports detailing the prior incidents. Therefore, we reject Scheel's argument that Atlantis owed him a duty to prevent his injury because it was foreseeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Accordingly, we find that Atlantis did not owe Scheel a duty, overrule his\n   first assignment of error, and affirm the trial court's order granting Atlantis summary judgment as to Scheel's claim for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Spoliation of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Turning to his claim for spoliation of evidence, Scheel argues that the trial court should not have granted Atlantis' motion for summary judgment because Atlantis \"was responsible for investigating incidents and preserving evidence at the casino\" and \"intentionally deleted\" surveillance footage of the moments leading up to his physical altercation with Greggor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 62} To establish a claim for spoliation of evidence, a plaintiff must prove the following: (1) pending or probable litigation involving the plaintiff, (2) that the defendant knew that litigation exists or is probable, (3) willful destruction of evidence by the defendant designed to disrupt the plaintiff's case, (4) actual disruption of the plaintiff's case, and (5) damages proximately caused by the defendant's actions.\n   <em>\n    Elliott-Thomas v.

In that case, a loss prevention specialist from the store physically apprehended a customer after he suspected that she was trying to steal perfume.

Further,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   [d]uring the time of the incident, Marshalls had a highly sophisticated multiplex video surveillance system that recorded Abbott's entire visit in the store.

Consequently, security is needed. Otherwise, why hire a security company? Having established a duty based on the foreseeability of fights resulting in injuries at a casino, I would find that factual issues exist as to whether Atlantis breached this duty given the circumstances in Scheel's case. For example, where were Atlantis employees assigned to be, and was this altercation visible to any employees at the time? These are factual issues to be decided by factfinders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 72} I agree with the majority's finding that Atlantis did not have a duty to ensure that the Casino's security plan was adequate.
