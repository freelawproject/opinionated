Lee, from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas adopting a magistrate's decision denying appellant's motion for relief from judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B), following the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Gamble Hartshorn, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 17, 2015, appellee filed a complaint against appellant for unpaid legal services, alleging claims for breach of contract, account, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit. On April 28, 2015, appellant filed a document with the trial court indicating he had \"picked up [the] summons sent by the certified mail at post office on 3-27-2015,\" that he \"denied all the allegations against\" him, and he was requesting a continuance in order to hire an attorney. (Mag. Decision at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On June 18, 2015, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. By decision and entry filed July 21, 2015, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, which was unopposed, and entered judgment in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of $62,152.94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On July 30, 2015, appellant filed a \"motion for continuance of disclosure of witnesses and extension of time to respond to motion for summary judgment and for time to obtain an attorney.\" On August 5, 2015, attorney Wilburn L. Baker filed a notice of appearance of counsel on behalf of appellant. On August 17, 2015, the trial court denied appellant's motion for continuance, noting it was untimely and the court had already granted summary judgment in favor of appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 26, 2015, appellant filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment. On September 23, 2015, appellee filed a memorandum contra appellant's motion for relief from judgment. A magistrate subsequently conducted a three-day hearing on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion. On February 9, 2016, the magistrate issued a decision denying appellant's motion for relief from judgment, finding that the Civ.R. 60(B) motion was untimely, and appellant had established neither excusable neglect nor a meritorious defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 23, 2016, appellant filed objections to the magistrate's decision. On May 9, 2016, appellant filed supplemental objections. On May 31, 2016, appellee filed a response to appellant's objections and supplemental objections. On December 14, 2016, the trial court filed a decision and entry adopting the magistrate's decision of February 9, 2016, holding in part the magistrate did not err in finding that appellant's \"neglect in failing to file a timely response to [appellee's] motion for summary judgment was not excusable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following four assignments of error for this court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I. The trial court abused its discretion when it denied Mr. Lee's motion for relief of judgment which was timely and was supported with sufficient evidentiary materials and operative facts showing a meritorious defense and excusable neglect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   II. The trial court abused its discretion when it applied an impossible test in finding that Mr. Lee's neglect was not \"excusable neglect\" to preclude Mr. Lee's right to relief of judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   III. The trial court abused its discretion when it did not find, pursuant to binding authority, that Mr. Lee's neglect was \"excusable neglect\" as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IV. The trial court abused its discretion when it did not grant Mr. Lee's motion for relief as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant's four assignments of error, all raising various challenges to the trial court's decision denying his motion for relief from judgment, are interrelated and will be considered together. Under these assignments of error, appellant contends his Civ.R. 60(B) motion was timely and supported by sufficient operative facts showing a meritorious defense and excusable neglect, and the trial court erred in failing to find he demonstrated excusable neglect justifying relief from judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Civ.R. 60(B) states in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(B); (3) fraud * * *, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged * * *; or (5) any other reason justifying relief from the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2) and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In order to obtain relief from judgment under Civ.R. 60(B), a movant must demonstrate that: \"(1) the party has a meritorious defense or claim to present if relief is granted; (2) the party is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5); and (3) the motion is made within a reasonable time, and, where the grounds of relief are Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (2) or (3), not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\"\n   <em>\n    GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v.

Based on the testimony and exhibits submitted, the magistrate rendered a decision which included the following findings of fact. Appellant entered into a written contract for legal services with attorney Douglas Warnock, and the fee agreement stated in part: \"It further is understood and agreed that the Attorney shall serve as co-counsel in the case for the Client with Joel H. Mirman, Attorney at Law, and the law firm of Gamble Hartshorn LLC, who will serve as lead counsel for the Client in the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellee provided legal services to appellant \"from November 14, 2006 through October 5, 2009.\" (Mag. Decision at 3.) On October 5, 2009, appellant discharged\n   attorney Ray Drexel (of the firm Gamble Hartshorn, LLC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On March 17, 2015, appellee filed its complaint against appellant, asserting claims for breach of contract, account, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit. \"[W]ithout leave of Court,\" appellant e-filed a document and entered an appearance in the action on April 28, 2015. (Mag. Decision at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On June 18, 2015, appellee filed its motion for summary judgment, to which appellant \"filed no response.\" (Mag. Decision at 4.) In his affidavit attached to the motion for relief from judgment, appellant stated: \"[S]oon after the middle of June, 2015, I received a copy of Gamble Hartshorn, LLC's motion for summary judgment.\" (Mag. Decision at 4.) Although appellant acknowledged receiving appellee's motion for summary judgment, he did not file a memorandum in opposition to the summary judgment motion \"because he was confused.\" (Mag. Decision at 4.) Appellant further stated in his affidavit that \"he 'thought we could discuss this motion for summary judgment at the scheduled August 4, 2015 hearing.' \" (Mag. Decision at 4.) The record, however, indicated \"there was no hearing scheduled for August 4, 2015,\" and appellant \"acknowledged under oath that he did not attend a court hearing on August 4, 2015.\" (Mag. Decision at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} While acknowledging receipt of the complaint in April 2015 and the motion for summary judgment in June 2015, appellant \"still delayed in seeking legal counsel, according to the testimony of John Scaccia.\" (Mag. Decision at 4.) On July 21, 2015, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment on its claims for breach of contract and account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} During the hearing before the magistrate, when \"asked 'with whom did you speak in an effort to get a lawyer,' [appellant] replied, 'the first one I went to [was] Mr. John Scaccia.' \" (Mag. Decision at 5.) Appellant's statement \"was corroborated by John Scaccia's testimony, which was that [appellant] contacted him in late July 2015 to represent him in the underlying case.\" (Mag. Decision at 5.) Scaccia, however, \"could not represent [appellant] because his license to practice law in Ohio was suspended.\" (Mag. Decision at 5.) Scaccia testified that he referred appellant to attorney Wilburn Baker. The magistrate found that, \"from April 28, 2015 to late July 2015, [appellant] did not take any action to hire an attorney to represent him in the underlying lawsuit.\" (Mag. Decision at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Approximately one week after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and the case was terminated, appellant, pro se, \"e-filed a document with this Court on July 30, 2015.\" (Mag. Decision at 5.) The document, \"titled 'motion for continuance of disclosure of witnesses and extension of time to respond to motion for summary judgment and for time to obtain an attorney,' \" was signed by appellant and had a \"handwritten notation backdating it to '7-22-2015.' \" (Mag. Decision at 5.) On August 5, 2015, appellant's counsel entered an appearance. By decision and entry filed August 17, 2015, the trial court denied appellant's July 30, 2015 motion. On August 26, 2015, counsel for appellant filed the Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In considering the testimony and exhibits submitted, the magistrate found that \"the overwhelming evidence supports [appellant's] familiarity with litigation, legal documents, and the legal system.\" (Mag. Decision at 5.) The magistrate noted that \"in addition to the underlying lawsuit, [appellee] represented [appellant] in at least two other legal matters.\" (Mag. Decision at 6.) The magistrate further found\n   that \"the documents [appellant] e-filed with this Court appear to have been prepared at his direction.\" (Mag. Decision at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We initially address appellant's contention the trial court abused its discretion in failing to find excusable neglect under Civ.R. 60(B)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to appellant, the trial court employed an \"impossible test\" in determining that his neglect was not excusable. Appellant characterizes this test as a \"Control Rule,\" and he challenges prior decisions by this court and other Ohio courts generally holding that neglect is not excusable if the party could have prevented the circumstances from occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In considering whether neglect is excusable under Civ.R. 60(B)(1), \"a court must consider all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Maggiore v.

(noting the facts and circumstances did not constitute excusable neglect where \"[t]he matter was within [the appellant's] control and he failed to act reasonably to make sure that the act was performed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Upon review of the record in this case, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining appellant failed to demonstrate excusable neglect. As set forth under the findings of fact rendered by the magistrate, appellee filed its complaint on March 17, 2015, and appellant acknowledged receiving a copy of the complaint by certified mail. Appellant e-filed a document on April 28, 2015 which, the magistrate noted, was filed without leave of court and did not contain a certificate of service. In that document, appellant expressed his intent to hire an attorney. On June 18, 2015, appellee filed its motion for summary judgment, to which appellant filed no response, and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee on July 21, 2015. Approximately one week after summary judgment was granted in favor of appellee, appellant filed a document titled \"motion for continuance of disclosure of witnesses and extension of time to respond to motion for summary judgment and for time to obtain an attorney.\" Appellant acknowledged he did not seek legal counsel until\n   late July 2015, and appellant's counsel did not file a notice of appearance until August 5, 2015. On August 17, 2015, the trial court denied appellant's motion for continuance, and appellant filed his Civ.R. 60(B) motion on August 26, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In his motion for relief from judgment, appellant argued his April 28, 2015 filing constituted a motion to continue, and he believed such motion was to be heard by the trial court on August 4, 2015. Appellant further argued that his failure to respond to appellee's motion for summary judgment was excusable neglect because he was not proficient in English and lacked technology to communicate with the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Both the magistrate and trial court addressed and rejected appellant's arguments with respect to his April 28, 2015 filing. The magistrate, noting that appellant did not seek leave to file the document out of rule and that such document failed to include a certificate of service, concluded that the filing at issue, \"whether characterized as an 'Answer' (a pleading) or a 'motion for continuance,' does not comply with Ohio's civil rules.\" (Mag. Decision at 7.) In a similar vein, the trial court, noting case law holding that pro se litigants are held to the same standards as are members of the bar with respect to procedural rules, cited appellant's admission \"that his 'filings' failed to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure.\" (Feb. 9, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry Adopting Mag. Decision at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The trial court also addressed appellant's claim that he believed his April 28, 2015 filing was a motion to continue to be heard by the court on August 4, 2015. The court observed that appellant \"nevertheless filed another motion on July 30, 2015, requesting additional time to obtain an attorney and respond to [appellee's] motion for summary judgment,\" and the court concluded that appellant's conduct \"belies his contention that he believed his earlier motion to continue would be heard on August 4, 2015.\" (Feb. 9, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry Adopting Mag. Decision at 8, 9.) The court further noted that appellant \"admitted during his testimony that he did not appear on August 4, 2015 for this 'hearing.' \" (Feb. 9, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry Adopting Mag. Decision at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The record on appeal supports the findings and conclusions of the trial court with respect to appellant's filing of the April 28, 2015 document.

As noted, the magistrate, following an extensive hearing on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion, rendered findings that the document appellant filed with the court on April 28, 2015 demonstrated his \"familiarity and sophistication with the legal process and litigation, and his command of the English language,\" and that the filing indicated appellant \"knew he could hire an attorney to represent him, as he had done in previous lawsuits filed against him.\" (Mag. Decision at 9, 10.) Similarly, the magistrate cited the fact that the document filed by appellant on July 30, 2015, which included a certificate of service, demonstrated his familiarity with the legal process and command of the English language. Noting that appellee had represented appellant \"in at least two other prior legal matters,\" the magistrate found the record \"replete with evidence supporting [appellant's] familiarity with litigation and the legal system.\" (Mag. Decision at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The trial court, in overruling appellant's objections to the magistrate's decision, found that \"from April 28, until July 30, 2015, when he filed his motion for an extension of time, [appellant] did nothing to engage or protect himself in these proceedings,\" and that \"[h]is earlier request for a continuance to obtain a lawyer indicates that he was aware that he needed to retain legal counsel.\" (Feb. 9, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry Adopting Mag.
