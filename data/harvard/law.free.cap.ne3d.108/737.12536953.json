Jones (\"Jones\") appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to vacate his guilty plea and the denial of credit for time served through a nunc pro tunc order. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 23, 2016, Jones pled guilty to aggravated vehicular assault, a fourth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(2)(a). Jones was sentenced to 18 months in prison to be served consecutively to the time he was currently serving for violating his community control sanctions from a previous case, Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-596387. In addition, Jones was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $2,790.12, and given credit for time served on this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 11, 2016, Jones filed a motion for jail-time credit that the judge ordered during his sentencing. Without a hearing, on May 19, 2016, the trial court issued a journal entry that granted the motion. On July 12, 2016, the trial court issued a nunc pro tunc entry indicating that the motion for jail-time credit was denied since Jones was serving consecutive sentences. On October 14, 2016, Jones filed two motions: a motion to correct the nunc\n   pro tunc entry in order to restore the jail-time credit and a motion to vacate the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In his motion to vacate his guilty plea, Jones argued that, under the threat of the state reindicting him to include an alcohol specification, he was forced to plead guilty to the lesser charge of aggravated vehicular assault. Both motions were denied, and Jones filed this timely appeal asserting two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I. The trial court committed error by denying Jones's motion to vacate his guilty plea when he was threatened with re-indictment on a more severe crime if he did not plead guilty; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   II. The trial court committed error by withdrawing credit for time served sua sponte in a nunc pro tunc entry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Thus, the trial court was without continuing jurisdiction at the time it modified its original judgment via a nunc pro tunc entry. The trial court's nunc pro tunc entry was a nullity. It follows that the trial court's subsequent denial of Jones's renewed motion for jail-time credit was also a nullity. Accordingly, the trial court's May 19, 2016 order remains in effect. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's decision to withdraw credit for jail-time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant's second assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In conclusion, the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to vacate his guilty plea is affirmed.
