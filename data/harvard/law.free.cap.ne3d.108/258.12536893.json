For the reasons set forth below, this Court reverses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellee, Patty Hayes, owned four Personal Seat Licenses (\"PSLs\") at the Cleveland Browns Stadium. Ms. Hayes's PSLs reserved four seats on the 50-yard line, at the railing, on the north side of the stadium in section 133. As the owner of the PSLs, Ms. Hayes was obligated each year to purchase season tickets for the seats which she could then use or sell. Failure to purchase season tickets would result in the PSLs reverting back to the Cleveland Browns and the seats being available to the general public or to those on a waiting list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mr. Younker's co-worker told him about Ms. Hayes's PSLs and available season tickets. Ms. Hayes and Mr. Younker never met in person and only communicated through email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2014 and 2015, Mr. Younker purchased the season tickets at face value from Ms. Hayes. At the end of the 2015 season, Mr. Younker asked Ms. Hayes if she would sell the PSLs to him. Ms. Hayes indicated that she \"paid $8[,]000 for the four licenses [and] would like to get $4[,]000 back.\" Mr. Younker agreed to the $4,000 price and sent Ms. Hayes a check for the full amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} During the next two weeks, Ms. Hayes confirmed receipt of Mr. Younker's payment and contacted the Cleveland Browns' front office to execute the necessary paperwork to transfer ownership of\n   the PSLs. The Cleveland Browns' front office indicated to Ms. Hayes that the PSLs were worth more than her asking price and that there was a 40-year waiting list for these specific seats. Based on this information, Ms. Hayes \"believe[d she could] get more than $1[,]000 per seat\" and advised Mr. Younker that she \"[could not] commit to selling [him her] PSL[ ]s for $4[,]000.\" A week later, Mr. Younker filed a complaint for breach of contract and sought specific performance and money damages. A few weeks later, Ms. Hayes returned Mr. Younker's $4,000 check to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Despite being properly served with the complaint and summons, Ms. Hayes did not file an answer. Mr. Younker filed a motion for default judgment which was granted as to the issue of liability and a hearing was scheduled as to the damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A magistrate presided over the damages hearing. Neither Ms. Hayes nor an attorney appeared on her behalf. The only witness at the damages hearing was Mr. Younker. During the hearing, Mr. Younker testified regarding the above facts and his damages. Mr. Younker requested relief in the form of specific performance and money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Mr. Younker testified that Ms. Hayes's PSLs were for four specific seats, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in the front row on the 50-yard line, and thus were not seats that could be obtained elsewhere or duplicated. Because of their location in relation to the playing field, the seats offered an unobstructed view of the game and protection from the lake winds. Mr. Younker described the seats as being \"primo seats.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Mr. Younker also testified to the value of the PSLs based on his research. He testified that a website that sells Cleveland Browns PSLs indicated that seats in the vicinity of Ms. Hayes's PSLs were worth approximately $10,000 to $11,500 each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The magistrate denied Mr. Younker specific performance and awarded him zero money damages. Mr. Younker timely filed objections and the transcript of the damages hearing. The trial court overruled Mr. Younker's objections and adopted the magistrate's decision. Mr. Younker has timely appealed this judgment and asserts three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Before addressing the merits of the appeal, this Court notes that Ms. Hayes did not file a brief. As such, this Court \"may accept [Mr. Younker's] statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if [Mr. Younker's] brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 18(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR AS A MATTER OF LAW IN ADOPTING THE MAGISTRATE'S DECISION FINDING [MS.

HAYES.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Mr. Younker argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it adopted the magistrate's decision and improperly applied the affirmative defense of mutual mistake to render the money damages decision when the issue of liability had been determined as a matter of law based upon Ms. Hayes's failure to answer the complaint. Mr. Younker also asserts that the\n   trial court applied the wrong test to determine the fair market value of the PSLs. This Court agrees with both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Initially, this Court notes that Mr. Younker has asserted the wrong standard of review.

However, the trial court effectively applied mutual mistake when it concluded that \"[t]he Magistrate did not err in finding the value of $44,000.00 was not within the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement was made and a judgment in that amount would result in a windfall to [Mr. Younker].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Despite the existing default judgment as to liability against Ms. Hayes, the trial court sua sponte applied mutual mistake in order to deny Mr. Younker money damages and effectively rescind the contract.
