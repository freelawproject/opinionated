Hartman, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution of Judgment Pending Appeal\n   </em>\n   wherein Plaintiff WBCMT 2007-C33 OFFICE 7870, LLC, seeks \"to maintain the status quo\" by staying execution or enforcement proceedings of the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   , entered on February 21, 2018, as well as staying the underlying\n   <em>\n    Opinion Concluding Court Lacks Continued Jurisdiction Over Current Proceedings\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Entry Vacating Order and Judgment Entered Under and Pursuant to the Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   . Because the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   neither enters a monetary award against WBCMT 2007-C33 nor compels WBCMT 2007-C33 to undertaken or perform any action, there is no execution or enforcement proceedings that could be stayed. Thus, it would be an illusory and futile act for the Court to stay execution or enforcement proceedings with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   . Alternatively, upon consideration and weighing of the four traditional stay factors applicable to stays pending appeal, WBCMT 2007-C33 has failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating the circumstances justify the exercise of this Court's discretion to issue the requested stay. Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution of Judgment Pending Appeal\n   </em>\n   is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The lengthy history of the proceedings\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   is set forth in detail in the\n   <em>\n    Opinion Concluding Court Lacks Continued Jurisdiction Over Current Proceedings\n   </em>\n   , entered on February 21, 2018. Pursuant to that\n   <em>\n    Opinion\n   </em>\n   , this Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over all proceedings under the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   which WBCMT 2007-C33 filed after final judgments had been entered in the foreclosure proceedings brought pursuant to the original\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   . Consistent with that conclusion, all interlocutory orders and the interlocutory judgment entered pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   were vacated and the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Included within the orders or judgment vacated was the\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Entry Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (entered on March 22, 2016) which entered a judgment against the THOMPSON DEFENDANTS \"in an amount not less than the $258,669.58\", as well as an additional deficiency judgment of nearly $7 million against two of the THOMPSON DEFENDANTS, including ANTHONY THOMPSON.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Previously, the THOMPSON DEFENDANTS appealed that\n   <em>\n    Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   to the First District Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Notice of Appeal (filed on April 20, 2016)\n   </em>\n   . Ultimately, on March 17, 2017, the First District concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   \"did not determine the action and prevent a judgment\" and, therefore, \"it is not a final order\". Accordingly, that earlier appeal was dismissed for want of appellate jurisdiction and the case remanded to this Court.\n   <em>\n    Judgment Entry of Dismissal (C-16-00422)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the interim, WBCMT 2007-C33 domesticated the\n   <em>\n    Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   in Lake County, Florida, on October 31, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Ensuing enforcement actions in Lake County resulted in the sheriff of Lake County seizing the personal property of Mr. THOMPSON, with such personal property continuing to be in the possession, custody or control of the sheriff.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the premature appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   was remanded from the First District, this case was transferred to the undersigned.\n   <em>\n    Entry of Assignment\n   </em>\n   . Upon a review of the pleadings, filings,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   , the Court questioned whether it continued to possess jurisdiction over the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . After affording the parties the opportunity to address the issues related thereto, this Court concluded that, prior to the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   which brought entirely new claims against new parties and eliminated all previous claims and parties named in the original\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , final judgments had been entered pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Complaint,\n   </em>\n   thus terminating the Court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Opinion Concluding Court Lacks Continued Jurisdiction Over Current Proceedings;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

And it was based upon the claims in the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   that this Court entered the\n   <em>\n    Judgment Entry Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   and WBCMT 2007-C33 undertook enforcement action in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Without jurisdiction over the claims asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , the Court entered the\n   <em>\n    Entry Vacating Order and Judgment Entered Under and Pursuant to the Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , together with the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   dismissing the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   . Subsequently,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on March 7, 2018, WBCMT 2007-C33 filed the presently-pending\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   , followed the next day by filing the\n   <em>\n    Notice of Appeal\n   </em>\n   . Through the\n   <em>\n    Notice of Appeal\n   </em>\n   , WBCMT 2007-C33 seeks review by the First District of this Court's ruling concerning whether this Court possessed continued jurisdiction over the claims asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ohio R. Civ. P. 62(B) authorizes the issuance of a stay pending the appeal of a judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   When an appeal is taken the appellant may obtain a stay of execution of a judgment or any proceedings to enforce a judgment by giving an adequate supersedeas bond. The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal. The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thus, even though an appeal has been taken, \" Civ. R. 62 specifically provides that the trial court is not divested of jurisdiction to grant a stay of execution.\"\n   <em>\n    Huntington Natl. Bank v.

Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   is properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before addressing the traditional factors as it concerns the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   , consideration must be given to that for which a stay is actually being sought. This is necessary because the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   from which the present appeal has been taken does not enter a judgment that is amenable to execution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   simply dismissed the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   for want of jurisdiction. And as a result of such disposition, any interlocutory orders or interlocutory judgment entered pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   were vacated.\n   <em>\n    See Entry Vacating Order and Judgment Entered Under and Pursuant to the Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   . Thus, to stay execution or enforcement proceedings of the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   would, at best, allow interlocutory orders or the interlocutory judgment to remain in place or effect; but there is not a final judgment subject to execution or enforcement proceedings, or even potential execution or enforcement proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ohio R. Civ. P 62(B) allows for \"a stay of execution of a judgment or any proceedings to enforce a judgment.\" Thus, it is the\n   <em>\n    execution\n   </em>\n   of a judgment or other\n   <em>\n    enforcement proceedings\n   </em>\n   of a judgment that are stayed; the judgment itself is not stayed. Generally speaking, there are two types of judgments for which execution or enforcement proceedings may arise,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , judgments for payment of money and judgments directing the performance of a specific act.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Ohio R. Civ. P. 69 &amp; 70. But with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   to which the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   is directed, nothing therein is of the nature by which the THOMPSON DEFENDANTS could execute or undertake proceedings in aid thereof\n   against WBCMT 2007-C33. The\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   does not adjudicate against WBCMT 2007-C33 a monetary award; similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment Entry\n   </em>\n   does not compel or require WBCMT 2007-C33 to undertake or perform any action for which, absent a stay, it could be held in contempt for the failure to perform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Instead, the result should the Court grant the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay Execution\n   </em>\n   would be illusory and a futile act.

In fact, the Ohio Supreme Court has expressly recognized that \"the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, including Civ. R. 62, were patterned after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. State Fire Marshal v.

Alternatively, consideration of the traditional stay factors further militate against the issuance of a stay pending appeal.

L.L.C. v. Payne\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-513\">\n     2017-Ohio-513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20249\">\n     85 N.E.3d 249\n    </extracted-citation>\n    \u00b6 39 (10th Dist.). However, that aspect of the opinion addressed waiver in terms of preserving an issue for appellate review,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 40 (\"[appellant's] failure to timely assert the lack of standing would result in waiver of the argument on appeal\"), and also constituted\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    as the Tenth District proceeded to consider the merits of the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction over the case,\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    (\"will consider [appellant's] standing argument on appeal\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Furthermore and notwithstanding the foregoing, the decision in\n    <em>\n     Nationstar\n    </em>\n    is bereft of any substantive legal analysis on the particular issue. The Tenth District failed to recognized, let alone consider, that, when a court lacks jurisdiction over a particular case, the final judgment that issues is, upon issuance, a voidable judgment. The Tenth District further failed to consider, let alone address, what it means for a judgment to be voidable and how and when such judgments can be challenged. When substantive legal analysis is actually given to these matters, as this Court does\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , it becomes readily apparent that a challenge to a court's jurisdiction over a particular case is not subject to waiver in the trial court, but is subject to being challenged for the first time on appeal or post-final judgment through a Rule 60(B) motion. Additionally, in\n    <em>\n     Filiaggi\n    </em>\n    , the Ohio Supreme Court expressly rejected the proposition that, through either consent or a failure to object, a party waives the opportunity to later challenge the exercise of jurisdiction over a particular case or portion of a case. But as the issue of this Court's exercise of jurisdiction over the claims under the\n    <em>\n     Amended Complaint\n    </em>\n    was raised prior to the entry of any final judgment,\n    <em>\n     Nationstar\n    </em>\n    and the other cases relied upon by WBCMT 2007-C33 are inapposite.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In seeking the stay pending appeal, WBCMT 2007-C33 has not raised or addressed directly the decision and rationale upon which the Court entered the\n    <em>\n     Final Judgment Entry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the\n    <em>\n     Opinion Concluding Court Lacks Continued Jurisdiction Over Current Proceedings\n    </em>\n    . Nonetheless, in considering the\n    <em>\n     Motion to Stay Execution\n    </em>\n    , the Court has\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    assessed again the analysis thereon, as well the arguments posited by WBCMT 2007-C33, in order to consider whether there is a strong likelihood that the issues presented on appeal could be rationally resolved in favor of WBCMT 2007-C33. While no legal precedent involved the particular context of the jurisdictional issue and the procedural posture in which it arose in the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    , the legal propositions supporting the\n    <em>\n     Opinion\n    </em>\n    are well-established, including, most notably, that a trial court's jurisdiction continues until entry of a final judgment on the merits, at which point, the court is divested of jurisdiction over the merits save limited post-judgment motions authorized by statute or the civil rules.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    During oral argument on the\n    <em>\n     Motion for Stay,\n    </em>\n    WBCMT 2007-C33 asserted that, through its\n    <em>\n     Notice of Conditional Waiver of Claims\n    </em>\n    (filed on June 7, 2017), the\n    <em>\n     Judgment Entry Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n    suddenly transmuted from a non-final judgment into a final judgment, albeit without any entry or endorsement of the Court. Stated otherwise, WBCMT 2007-C33 maintains that it alone somehow amended a judgment without involvement of the Court by declaring that, subject to certain conditions, it was foregoing its claim for attorney fees, punitive damages,\n    <em>\n     etc.\n    </em>\n    But a judgment, including an amended judgment, is a decree or order issued by a court, not a party. Whether a party, through a filing not even recognized by the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, may convert, independent of court action, a non-final judgment into a final judgment is highly questionable and doubtful. But the Court need not resolve this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \"Conditional dismissals, ones subject to further action given a predicted set of circumstances, cannot be final orders subject to appeal because such a dismissal by its nature leaves unresolved issues set to arise following the stated occurrence [or] the stated condition.\"\n    <em>\n     Myocare Nursing Home, Inc. v.
