In addition to Looby's five assignments of error, we sua sponte asked the parties to brief a supplemental assignment of error regarding whether the trial court complied with the requirements of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c). Based on the record and the parties' supplemental briefs, we find that the trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c) when it accepted Looby's guilty plea and that the lack of compliance warrants reversal of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} William Looby was charged, along with two codefendants, with three counts of attempted murder, three counts of aggravated arson, three counts of felonious assault, one count of breaking and entering, and one count of illegal manufacturing of drugs. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Looby pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated arson, one count of arson, and one count of felonious assault. However, before accepting Looby's guilty pleas, the trial court informed Looby of his constitutional and nonconstitutional rights, but never explained that Looby was waiving those rights by pleading guilty. The court sentenced Looby to eight years on the aggravated arson charge, 18 months on the arson charge, and six years on the felonious assault charge to be served concurrently for an aggregate eight-year prison term. Looby now appeals his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As previously stated, we sua sponte asked the parties to consider a supplemental assignment of error regarding whether the trial court complied with the requirements of Crim.R. 11 (C)(2)(a) when it accepted Looby's guilty plea. This issue implicitly includes the ensuing question as to whether the failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), if any, necessitates reversal of Looby's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} \"When a defendant enters a plea in a criminal case, the plea must be made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There is an implicit understanding that by entering a guilty plea, the defendant is waiving the rights associated with trial.

As stated in my dissenting opinion to\n   <em>\n    State v. Miller\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105363, a case involving Looby's codefendant Miller who entered his guilty plea in the same plea colloquy as Looby,\n   this was enough to satisfy Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). Not only is there no obligation for the court to use \"magic\" words when explaining the rights that a defendant waives by pleading guilty, we have held that the court does not even have to use the word \"waive\" when engaging in a Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) plea colloquy.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the majority acknowledges, the trial judge informed Looby that he did not have to plead guilty. He was told that he had a right to trial by jury, or before a judge; a right to confront and cross-examine witnesses; a right to subpoena witnesses; and a right to testify or remain silent. The trial judge told Looby that the state had the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Looby expressly stated that he understood that he retained all of these rights if he chose not to plead guilty and elected to have a trial. We have, on virtually identical facts, affirmed guilty pleas where the court did not use the word \"waive,\" but as in this case explained the consequences of a guilty plea in terms of the rights that a defendant would retain by going to trial, rather than the rights the defendant would forego by pleading guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

By acting sua sponte, without any indication from Looby that he actually desires to have his guilty plea vacated, the majority has nullified a favorable plea bargain that Looby may not subsequently receive-Looby is once again facing four counts of attempted murder; five counts of aggravated arson; one count of arson; five counts of felonious assault; breaking and entering; and illegal manufacture of drugs or cultivation of marijuana. The state obviously has no obligation to offer Looby a guilty plea on the same terms, and he is exposed to significantly more prison time should he go to trial and be found guilty. It might be that appellate counsel understood the adverse effects of having the guilty plea vacated and chose not to question its validity. \"Appellate lawyers are not obliged to raise issues that could boomerang on their clients; it is no failure of advocacy to leave well enough alone.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
