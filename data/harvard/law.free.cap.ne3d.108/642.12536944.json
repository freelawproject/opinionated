Clay appeals the decision of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court denying his petition for postconviction relief. He filed the petition nine years after the trial transcripts were filed in the direct appeal of his aggravated murder conviction. Appellant argues the trial court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing and denied his petition without declaring it untimely or issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law. He claims he was not advised by his attorney about postconviction relief or any deadlines. He also contends he could not file a timely petition because he was unaware of a third plea offer, which he believes the state offered to his trial counsel. Alternatively, he argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the state's correction of a police report upon which the complaint was based. Lastly, he makes an argument about voir dire. For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted for aggravated murder for purposely causing the death of Terrence Brown with prior calculation and design, with a firearm specification for discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2903.01(A) ; R.C. 2941.146(A). His cousin, Jason Clay, was jointly indicted, but the cases were later severed. Appellant's case was tried to a jury in December 2007. The testimony established Jason was driving a white sport utility vehicle down Woodcrest Avenue in Youngstown with Appellant as the front seat passenger and two others as back seat passengers. The back seat passengers testified a man named Chuck shot at their vehicle on Woodcrest, and they proceeded to a turnaround where they briefly parked\n   (near a van containing four female witnesses). Outrage was expressed about the gunshots, and a large gun was prepared before the SUV traveled back past the location of the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The passenger sitting behind Appellant testified he saw Appellant shoot the victim (who was not Chuck) and he heard Appellant say the victim should have stayed in his house. The passenger behind the driver said he was ducking and did not see who fired, but he heard gunfire from within the SUV. Appellant's position in the vehicle was confirmed by the back seat passengers and by two females who encountered the SUV just before the fatal shooting (one of whom saw Appellant holding a big gun). A third female saw a large gun protruding from the front passenger window of the SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The jury found Appellant guilty as charged. The court sentenced him to thirty years to life for aggravated murder consecutive to five years for the firearm specification. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the December 20, 2007 sentencing entry. New counsel was appointed for the appeal. Sixteen assignments of error were presented on appeal, dealing with speedy trial, impeachment, photographs, discovery, sufficiency and weight of the evidence, exculpatory evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, jury instructions, sentencing, and cumulative error. This court overruled Appellant's assignments of error and affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Clay\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-1204\">\n    2009-Ohio-1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20684585\">\n    2009 WL 684585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 2, 2017, Appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief setting forth various contentions, including the following arguments reiterated on appeal: failure of counsel to advise on postconviction relief; failure of counsel to convey a third plea offer; corrected police report affected subject matter jurisdiction; and failure to challenge a biased juror during voir dire. On June 9, 2017, the trial court denied the petition. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. Appellant's pro se brief sets forth four assignments of error, which we have divided into subject areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    JUDGMENT ENTRY &amp; UNTIMELY PETITION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant addresses multiple topics under his first assignment of error, which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"This Trial Court Denied the Petition without declaring it to be Untimely, nor making any findings of facts and conclusions of law, nor did the trial court hold a[n] Evidentiary Hearing on the Affidavits w[h]ere the State Prosecutor's Office never answered or Responded to the petition, nor sought out any Summary Judgement proceedings Pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code 2953.21 -23.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} As provided in R.C. 2953.21(A)(1), a convicted defendant who claims there was such an infringement of his rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio or the United States Constitutions may file a petition for postconviction relief in the court that imposed sentence. There are time deadlines for filing this petition. Under the prior version of the statute, a petition had to be filed no later than 180 days after the date the trial transcripts were filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Former R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) (unless no direct appeal was filed, in which case the 180 days started from day the time expired for filing the appeal). Effective March 23, 2015, the number of days changed from 180 to 365. R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). As the state points out, the transcripts were filed in Appellant's direct appeal on June 3, 2008. Appellant filed his petition for postconviction relief\n   on June 2, 2017, nine years after the transcripts were filed in the direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} There is an exception to these time deadlines provided in R.C. 2953.23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) (prefacing the deadlines with: \"Except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the Revised Code * * *\"). Pertinent to this case, R.C 2953.23(A)(1) states a court may not entertain an untimely petition unless: (a) the petitioner shows (i) he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which he must rely to present the claim for relief or (ii) after the time expired, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively and the petition asserts a claim based on that right; and (b) the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Initially, Appellant complains the trial court denied the petition without declaring it untimely or issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are required by R.C. 2953.21(D) and (H) when a court dismisses a timely petition or denies it after a hearing. However, \"a trial court need not issue findings of fact and conclusions of law when it dismisses an untimely [post-conviction relief] petition. * * * This rule applies even when the defendant, as here, claims, under R.C. 2953.23, that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts to present his claim for post-conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Although R.C. 2953.21(E) provides deadlines for any answer or summary judgment motion the state decides to file, the state has no obligation to respond to the petition for postconviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Even when a timely petition is filed, a hearing cannot be granted where the petition fails to allege substantive grounds for relief as the petitioner bears the burden of submitting evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to show his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711843\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/64/107/#p110\">\n    64 Ohio St.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110-111,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=413%20N.E.2d%20819\">\n    413 N.E.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). A trial court has the discretion to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief without any response from the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 102,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-1504\">\n    2009-Ohio-1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20825759\">\n    2009 WL 825759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10, 14 (where the untimely petition failed to set forth any substantive ground upon which relief can be granted, trial court could dismiss without waiting for petitioner's response to state's summary judgment motion);\n   <em>\n    In re J.B.\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist.

Contrary to Appellant's suggestion, an evidentiary hearing was not required merely because the state did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In discussing the exceptions for an untimely petition, Appellant first claims his attorneys (trial counsel and appellate counsel) failed to advise him of the remedy of a petition for postconviction relief and thus failed to advise him of the time deadlines for filing a timely petition. Initially, we note the awkward terminology of Appellant's affidavit submitted in support of the petition; at paragraph 9, he said he had no knowledge he could address issues that were off the record until he was advised by a \"Jail house Lawyer\" and clerks at the prison law library. The affidavit did not specifically attest his attorneys failed to advise him of postconviction relief or its deadlines. Notably, Appellant also attached to his petition a 2009 letter he received from the Ohio Supreme Court which mentioned postconviction relief. Furthermore, he filed a motion for transcripts in the trial court in August 2009, wherein he argued: the right to transcripts applies in state postconviction proceedings; he was not required to have a postconviction petition pending to assert this right; he needed the transcripts to file such a petition; and his receipt of the transcripts was the first step in the postconviction process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In any event, the general failure of counsel (appointed for trial or direct appeal) to advise a defendant of postconviction procedures does not equate to being \"unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which he must rely to present the claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a). The statute speaks of being unavoidably prevented from discovering facts, not the law. A petitioner's assertion that he was not informed of the procedural mechanism of postconviction relief is essentially an argument for the creation of an additional exception to the statutory deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Theisler\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. No. 2009-T-0003,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6862\">\n    2009-Ohio-6862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205064290\">\n    2009 WL 5064290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18-21. \"Merely because counsel failed to advise him of the deadline for filing a petition does not show he was 'unavoidably prevented' from discovering the deadline on his own or from other sources. Ignorance of the law as to the time for filing is no excuse.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Halliwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1060042\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/134/730/#p735\">\n    134 Ohio App.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=732%20N.E.2d%20405\">\n    732 N.E.2d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist. 1999). Accordingly, Appellant's alleged state of being unaware of the law on postconviction relief does not satisfy an exception to the statute's timeliness requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Wolff\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

However, this was a federal habeas decision, not a decision on a state postconviction petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Guy\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

In fact, the decision concerned the effect of the habeas petitioner's failure to file for state postconviction relief with a conclusion that a state postconviction petition would be futile due to the\n   filing deadlines.\n   <em>\n    Gunner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065173\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/511/#p520\">\n    749 F.3d at 516, 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a federal habeas petitioner must show cause why he failed to file a state postconviction petition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The foregoing arguments in Appellant's first assignment of error are without merit.

This rejected plea offer involved dismissing some charges and recommending a sentence of 51-85 months. The defendant was convicted at trial and sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of 185 to 360 months in prison. The defendant thereafter sought federal habeas relief. The United States Supreme Court pointed out an erroneous strategic prediction about the outcome of a trial is not necessarily deficient performance but the Court was not addressing the deficiency prong because the parties conceded the attorney rendered deficient performance in advising the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 556 U.S. at 174,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343160,3653482,3653315\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/129/1436/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Court therefore addressed only the prejudice prong and concluded a defendant must show that but for the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability: (1) the plea offer would have been presented to the court (meaning the defendant would have accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening circumstances); (2) the court would have accepted its terms; and (3) the conviction, sentence, or both would have been less severe than that imposed upon the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343160,3653482,3653315\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/129/1436/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the state's contention that \"there can be no finding of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice arising from plea bargaining if the defendant is later convicted at a fair trial.\").

(He does not mention the five-year consecutive firearm specification.) Appellant's affidavit states counsel conveyed two plea offers to him: the first offer was 25 years to life; and the subsequent offer, about a month later, was 15 years to life.

Disregarding that it is the court who decides whether counsel would be replaced, Appellant said he gave counsel a second chance after his attorney reassured him about his theory of the case.

He believes his attorney did not advise him of the third offer because he was \"still holding a grudge for trying to have [him] fired off my case!\" Appellant's affidavit states he did not learn about the third offer until his co-defendant told him about it on February 20, 2017.
