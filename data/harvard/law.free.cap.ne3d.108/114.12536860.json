The issues before this court are whether a party nominated as the guardian for a prospective ward is entitled to intervene in the guardianship proceedings when the nomination has been imperfectly executed under Ohio law and whether a power of attorney is entitled to intervene when it did not receive notice of the hearing on an application to appoint a guardian for the principal. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 16, 2016, Susan Doudican filed an Application for Appointment of Guardian of Alleged Incompetent [ R.C. 2111.03 ] on behalf of her half-sister, Norma Rosenberger, in the Lake County Probate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 16, 2016, a hearing was held on the Application before a probate court magistrate at which Rosenberger and Doudican gave testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 5, 2017, a Magistrate's Decision was issued finding, \"by clear and convincing evidence that Norma Rosenberger is mentally impaired as a result of various mental and physical disabilities, and incapable of independently caring for her person and safeguarding her income and assets.\" The magistrate recommended Doudican \"be appointed the guardian of the person and the estate of Norma Rosenberger for an indefinite period of time.\" The magistrate based her findings on the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Rosenberger is an 84-year old woman diagnosed with mixed dementia according to the Statement of Expert Evaluation completed on October 14, 2016 by Dr. Ami Hall and filed with the Application on November 16, 2016. Dr. Hall noted impairments in Ms. Rosenberger's orientation, thought process, memory, concentration and comprehension, and judgment. She found Ms. Rosenberger mentally impaired and recommended the guardianship be established. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Rosenberger moved to Mentor, Ohio from Spokane, Washington in August 2016. Ms. Rosenberger was living alone in Spokane prior to her move to Ohio, but Mrs. Doudican stated during the hearing that she and Ms. Rosenberger visited with each other annually in person and maintained regular telephone contact. In approximately November 2015, Mrs. Doudican noticed Ms. Rosenberger was repeating herself during telephone conversation[s] and learned Ms. Rosenberger was getting lost while driving. On or about March 2016, Mrs. Doudican offered and Ms. Rosenberger agreed to move to Ohio to be closer to Mrs. Doudican and her family which consists of adult children and younger grandchildren. Mrs. Doudican began to make arrangements for Ms. Rosenberger's move to Ohio, finding her an apartment at Parker Place in Mentor, Ohio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   However, during the process of arranging further Ms. Rosenberger's move to Ohio, Mrs. Doudican learned that Ms. Rosenberger engaged Northwest Trustee and Management Service, a trust and financial arrangement company located in Spokane, sometime in April 2016. According to a letter written to Mrs. Doudican by Cam McGillivray who is a Trust Officer and In-house Counsel for Northwest, Ms. Rosenberger named Northwest as agent under a durable general power of attorney agreement she executed on May 16, 2016 replacing Mrs. Doudican as agent in a previously executed agreement. Northwest has charged Ms. Rosenberger nearly $40,000 in account maintenance fees since April 5, 2016, for approximately $1,100,000 under its management. Mrs. Doudican explained that Ms. Rosenberger's funds are actually invested with Ameriprise, and suspects Ameriprise is also taking investment fees/commissions for its services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 9, 2017, the probate court adopted the Magistrate's Decision and appointed Doudican guardian of Rosenberger's person and estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 9, 2017, Northwest Trustee filed a Motion to Intervene on the following grounds: \"the Ward herein, Norma Rosenberger, in her Financial Durable Power of Attorney executed on May 12, 2016, named Northwest Trustee as an Agent, and instructed that any court that received or acted upon a guardianship application was to deny such application so long as the Agent (Northwest Trustee) was acting under the Power of Attorney\"; \"Northwest Trustee is * * * an interested party, necessary for the adjudication of the rights of all persons with an interest in the property before the Court in the instant Guardianship\"; and \"Northwest Trustee did not receive due process notice of the Guardianship application or the evidentiary Hearing, and was deprived of the opportunity to assert its property rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On March 17, 2017, Doudican filed a Response to the Motion to Intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On August 29, 2017, the probate court denied Northwest Trustee's Motion to Intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On September 27, 2017, Northwest Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal.

As grounds for intervention, Northwest Trustee argues that \"the Durable Power of Attorney in fact\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     nominated and appointed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Northwest Trustee to serve as guardian in the event a court found a guardianship necessary,\" and, therefore, \"[i]t was error for the Probate court to deny Northwest Trustee's Motion to Intervene as an interested party which had been nominated as guardian.\" Appellant's brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Northwest Trustee relies upon the Financial Durable Power of Attorney (referenced in the Magistrate's Decision) executed by Rosenberger on May 16, 2016, which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It is Principal's intention by executing this Power of Attorney to provide for the administration of Principal's affairs without the necessity of court action or the appointment of a representative payee. Principal requests in the strongest possible terms that any court or government agency that may receive or act upon a petition to appoint a guardian, conservator, or representative payee should deny such petition so long as Agent is acting under this Power of Attorney. If any court or government agency should deem it necessary to appoint a fiduciary (including a guardian, conservator, or representative payee) in spite of this request, then Principal nominates and appoints Agent to serve, and requests Agent be given priority for appointment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Relative to a prospective ward's capacity to nominate his or her guardian, the Revised Code provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (A) A person may nominate in a writing, as described in this division, another person to be the guardian of the nominator's person, estate, or both * * *, subject to notice and a hearing pursuant to section 2111.02 of the Revised Code.

At the December 16, 2016 hearing on the Application for Guardianship, the magistrate conducting the hearing was apprised of the existence of the Power of Attorney, although the document itself does not appear to have been entered into evidence nor were its substantive provisions considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was attached to Northwest Trustee's Motion to Intervene as evidence of Rosenberger's intent that \"any court considering an application for Guardian (of the estate) should deny the same, and appoint Northwest Trustee to continue to serve as her financial Agent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The law is clear that a probate court, while not bound by a party's nomination of a guardian, must at least consider the nomination.\n   <em>\n    In re Guardianship of MacHaney\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

In its proposed objections to the guardianship, Northwest Trustee asserted that it \"has no objection to Susan Doudican serving as the Guardian of the Person for Norma Rosenberger.\" Rather, it claimed that intervention was \"necessary because it is the only way for intervenor Northwest Trustee to assert its property rights which are based in statute and contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Inasmuch as Northwest Trustee disclaimed any interest in asserting its nomination as Rosenberger's guardian, the nomination provision in the May 16, 2016 Power of Attorney did not require the probate court to grant the Motion to Intervene. As explained further below, Northwest Trustee's ability to participate in the guardianship proceedings was not dependent upon it being formally granted the right to intervene. Irrespective of the Motion to Intervene, Northwest Trustee continued as Rosenberger's financial power of attorney until August 29, 2017. In these circumstances, the probate court did not err by failing to consider Northwest Trustee's nomination as guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The first assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In the second assignment of error, Northwest Trustee claims it was entitled to intervene as \"an interested party\n   in any application for a guardianship for Norma Rosenberger\" with \"the right to perform specific acts on behalf of the principal, and to receive compensation.\" Appellant's brief at 9. By not receiving notice that guardianship proceedings had been instituted, Northwest Trustee's rights of due process were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Northwest Trustee's argument largely rests on its claim to be an \"interested party\" under R.C. 2111.02(A), providing that \"[a]n interested party includes * * * a person nominated in a durable power of attorney under section 1337.24 of the Revised Code or in a writing as described in division (A) of section 2111.121 of the Revised Code.\" Northwest Trustee's status as Rosenberger's power of attorney at the time the Application for Appointment of Guardian was filed is not disputed. Northwest Trustee continued to serve as power of attorney after Doudican's appointment as guardian in accord with R.C. 1337.24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Northwest Trustee's status as Rosenberger's power of attorney did not entitle it to notice of the hearing on the guardianship application under relevant statute, R.C. 2111.04(A)(2)(a)(i) and (b) : \"In the appointment of the guardian of an incompetent, notice shall be served * * * [u]pon the person for whom appointment is sought by personal service,\" and \"[u]pon the next of kin of the person for whom appointment is sought who are known to reside in this state.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Guardianship of Baker\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.
