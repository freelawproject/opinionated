The indictment also included forfeiture specifications for $2,180 in cash and numerous firearms. Appellant initially entered a not guilty plea to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant eventually changed his plea. He pleaded guilty to all three charges and the trial court convicted him of those charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court subsequently held a sentencing hearing. It sentenced appellant to ten months for trafficking in drugs, eight years for possession of drugs (cocaine), and twelve months for possession of drugs (heroin). The court ordered appellant to serve his sentences consecutively for a total prison sentence of nine years and ten months. The court also ordered the $2,180 seized from appellant's home to be forfeited to the Jefferson County Drug Task Force, along with other contraband listed in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on May 26, 2017. He now raises a single assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant's sole assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN SENTENCING THE DEFENDANT TO A PRISON TERM OF NINE YEARS AND TEN MONTHS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant argues the trial court's sentence was in error. In support, appellant points to several factors he claims weigh against his sentence. Appellant states that he expressed genuine remorse. He points out he is a young individual (age 25) who has started up his own lawn care business. He has not served a prior prison term or ever previously been convicted of a felony. He was not on postrelease control or probation at the time of the offense. He admitted to a substance abuse problem. The firearms recovered from his house were legally purchased and he was not under a firearm disability. He is a high school graduate with some college and vocational training. And no great or unusual harm occurred as a result of his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Additionally, appellant argues that cocaine and heroin were jointly seized by police at the time of their search. Therefore, he contends this was the same conduct and same animus, which would require the sentences for these two possession offenses to run concurrently because the offenses were allied offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When reviewing a felony sentence, an appellate court must uphold the sentence unless the evidence clearly and convincingly does not support the trial court's findings under the applicable sentencing statutes or the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    State v. Marcum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774034\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/146/516/\">\n    146 Ohio St.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774034\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/146/516/\">\n    2016-Ohio-1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20N.E.3d%201231\">\n    59 N.E.3d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant was convicted of a first-degree felony, a fourth-degree felony, and a fifth-degree felony. The first-degree possession conviction carried a mandatory prison term. R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(e). The possible prison terms for a first-degree felony are three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or eleven years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). The trial court sentenced appellant to eight years on the first-degree felony. The possible prison terms for a fourth-degree\n   felony are six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen months. R.C. 2929.14(A)(4). The trial court sentenced appellant to twelve months on the fourth-degree felony. The possible prison terms for a fifth-degree felony are six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve months. R.C. 2929.14(A)(5). The trial court sentenced appellant to ten months on the fifth-degree felony. Thus, all of appellant's sentences are within the applicable statutory ranges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In sentencing a felony offender, the court must consider the overriding principles and purposes set out in R.C. 2929.11, which are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. The trial court shall also consider various seriousness and recidivism factors as set out in R.C. 2929.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant contends the court failed to properly consider the seriousness and recidivism factors. But the record reveals that the court properly considered these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that it considered the purposes and principles of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors relevant to the offense and the offender. (Tr. 49). The court found as to the seriousness factors that appellant's criminal activity was very organized and methodical. (Tr. 49). It found that none of the less serious factors applied. (Tr. 49-50). As to the recidivism factors, the trial court found appellant was not out on bail or under postrelease control at the time of the offense, however, the court noted appellant does have a history of misdemeanor criminal convictions. (Tr. 50-51). The court also found that appellant has not responded favorably to past sanctions and instead has demonstrated a pattern of drug abuse. (Tr. 52). Moreover, the court found appellant failed to show genuine remorse finding that appellant was sorry only that he got caught. (Tr. 52). The trial court reiterated each of these findings in its sentencing judgment entry. Thus, the trial court considered the applicable factors both at the sentencing hearing and in its judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Moreover, \"explanations regarding the trial court's consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 are not required at the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing entry.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He asserts the possession of cocaine conviction and the possession of heroin conviction should have merged for sentencing purposes because they shared a single animus.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   R.C. 2941.25 provides:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Ohio Supreme Court addressed the issue of offenses of similar import requiring merger in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court held that if a defendant's conduct supports multiple offenses, the defendant can be convicted of all of the offenses if any one of the following is true: (1) the conduct constitutes offenses of dissimilar\n   import, (2) the conduct shows the offenses were committed separately, or (3) the conduct shows the offenses were committed with separate animus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20N.E.3d%20892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus, citing R.C. 2941.25(B). Two or more offenses are of dissimilar import within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25(B)\"when the defendant's conduct constitutes offenses involving separate victims or if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20N.E.3d%20892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Pursuant to R.C. 2925.11, the drug possession statute, cocaine and heroin are classified and penalized differently based upon the type and quantity involved. \"It would thus defeat the legislature's intent to merge the drug possession offenses into a single offense for purposes of sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
