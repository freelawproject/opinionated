The indictments describe a course of events that occurred in the early morning hours of December 18, 2015, beginning at a bar in Lucas County, where Welninski pistol-whipped a patron on the head and then fired his gun, twice. A short time later, Welninski, his wife and his brother fled from the police into Wood County, where Welninski and his wife engaged in a gun battle with the police. In the end, Welninski was apprehended, and his wife Erica Lauro\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   committed suicide at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Welninski was found guilty of all charges against him. Many of the charges carried with it a gun specification and/or a repeat violent offender specification. The Wood County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to an aggregate term of 97 years in prison, 88 years of which are mandatory. Welninski appealed. As set forth below, we affirm the convictions but we find that the trial court erred when it failed to merge Welninski's attempted murder and felonious assault convictions in case No. 15-CR-552 because the two convictions are allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, in part, and the matter is remanded for a limited resentencing in case No. 15-CR-552, where the state will elect which of these convictions to pursue for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The following evidence was offered at trial: Welninski, Lauro, and Welninski's half-brother, Kenneth (\"Kenny\") Maldonado, were traveling from Chicago to New York on December 17, 2015. After a brief detour to Detroit, they stopped for the night and rented a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Oregon, Ohio. Once inside the hotel, Welninski told his brother to go to a nearby restaurant and bring back some food. When Maldonado returned to report that the restaurant was closed, they decided to eat out. While Welninski showered, Maldonado looked through his brother's travel bag and saw two handguns: a silver one and a black one. While in the room, each consumed one alcoholic beverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Around 10:30 p.m., the three left the hotel and walked to a restaurant next door, Icon's Bar and Grille, on Navarre Avenue in Oregon. Maldonado testified that he did not bring a weapon with him to the bar, and, at that time, he did not know if Welninski or Lauro had one either. While at Icon's, Maldonado said that each of them consumed \"maybe two shots and a couple of beers.\" Video surveillance from the bar and testimonial evidence established that Welninski and Maldonado were both wearing grey hooded sweatshirts. Welninski had a number of tattoos that were visible that night. Maldonado had no visible tattoos and was wearing a baseball hat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Also at Icon's that evening were Ana Pecina, Jay Davis, and Brandon Vergara. The three went there together, around 12:40 a.m., now December 18, 2015, to meet a mutual friend. Within a few minutes of entering the bar, they found their friend. All but Pecina went to an outdoor patio where smoking was allowed. Pecina used the restroom, and then began looking for her friends. As Pecina walked throughout the bar looking for them, she was approached by a man, later identified as Welninski, near the entrance. Welninski asked for her name, and when she ignored him, he asked again. Pecina testified that a\n   woman suddenly got \"in [Pecina's] face\" and told her \"not to be talking to him\" because \"he has a wife,\" and the woman called Pecina a \"bitch.\" Silent video footage captured part of that exchange, including: Pecina walking in front of the camera; Welninski speaking to somone (who was not within view of the camera); Lauro physically directing, almost pushing, Welninski out the door; and Welninski continuing to talk over his shoulder to someone. The video also shows Welninski with his hood pulled up over his head. At trial, the woman yelling at Pecina was identified as Erica Lauro, Welninski's wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Pecina walked away, in search of her friends and called Jay Davis to ask where in the bar they were. When Davis answered the call, he could hear a woman, not Pecina, yelling, \"[b]itch, I will beat your ass.\" Pecina found her friends outside, on the patio. The patio is enclosed by a fence that is chest high and has no separate entry, other than through the bar. Pecina reported that \"some girl was trying to fight [me] because the dude had said 'hi' to [me] and [the girl] got mad.\" As Pecina was retelling the story, Lauro, Welninski, and Maldonado were exiting the bar and appeared on the other side of the patio fence. The argument between the women then resumed. Lauro was described as \"going crazy\" and \"trying to fight\" and \"jumping up and down and yelling and screaming and cussing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The spat escalated to a physical altercation almost immediately, with Pecina's friends (Davis and Vergara) leaned up against one side of the fence, and the other two men (Welninski and Maldonado) outside of the fence. As described by Davis and Vergara, one of the men grabbed Vergara and tried to pull him over the fence. The other man, who was initially holding back Lauro, soon joined in and began punching Vergara. Vergara's view was obstructed by his tee-shirt that was pulled up over his head, but he insisted that he received blows to his torso from two different people. Davis, who was beside his friend Vergara, tried to free Vergara from the others' hold and punches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Vergara described feeling \"something [hard] hit me on the top of my head.\" Davis testified that the person who was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   wearing a baseball hat, i.e. Welninski, was the one who pulled out a gun and hit Vergara over the head with it. The gun came within six inches of Davis' face, and Davis found himself \"holding * * * [the] hand [of the person] with the gun in it and he is aiming it at me [in an] up and down motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} With Davis' help, Vergara broke free. Once freed, Vergara grabbed a patio chair and threw it over the fence at Welninski and Maldonado. According to Vergara, the two men \"stumble[d] back\" and \"two gunshots * * * were fired.\" Davis gave a similar account. He testified that the chair \"[flew] over the gated area and hit [the shooter] in the face and chest area and he falls, stumbles back, and that is when two rounds are fired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} At trial, during their direct examination by the state, Pecina, Vergara, and Davis independently identified Welninski as the person who was responsible for pistol-whipping Vergara and for firing two shots. Their respective testimony was challenged on cross-examination. For example, during her direct examination, Pecina testified that the person with the gun and the person who asked her name earlier were one and the same, and she identified Welninski as that person. Under cross-examination, Pecina acknowledged that she told the police that night that the person with the girl inside the bar was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the person who pistol whipped Vergara. Moreover, she repeated the latter version just days before trial, when she was interviewed by\n   Welninski's investigator. And while Vergara and Davis testified that they told police that the guy with a gray hoodie and tattoos had pistol-whipped Vergara on the patio, on cross examination they both acknowledged that neither had told police that the assailant had tattoos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Maldonado also testified. He stated that he was testifying voluntarily, and not as part of any plea agreement with the state. Maldonado identified his brother as the one who pistol-whipped Vergara and who fired the gun. As he described the scene, Maldonado left the bar around 1:30 a.m., which was right after Welninski and Lauro had left. Once outside, he saw that his brother \"had a guy by the shirt and he was like face-to-face with him saying something to him.\" Maldonado moved closer to Lauro, who was \"in a run-in with this girl and I stopped [Lauro] and told her 'it isn't worth it.' \" Maldonado watched his brother \"let [the man] go\" but when the man said something to Welninski, that is when Welninski \"started hitting him-pulled a gun out and started hitting him * * * on top of his head.\" Maldonado described the gun as the same silver gun that he had seen in the hotel room. Welninski hit the person two or three times. Once Maldonado realized what was happening, he \"went to pull [his brother] back and the gun went off in the air when I pulled him back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After the gun went off, everyone scattered. Vergara, Davis, and Pecina ran inside, to the kitchen bar, where Davis called 911. After reporting Vergara's injury, Davis told the 911 operator that the assailant and two others ran inside the hotel next door. Vergara received treatment at St. Charles Hospital and was diagnosed with a concussion. A scar remains on Vergara's head, along with two indents in his scalp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The incident at Icon's lasted a little over three minutes, from 1:06 a.m., when Pecina called Davis from within the bar, until 1:09 a.m., when Davis called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Maldonado felt \"scared\" when the gun went off and ran to the hotel ahead of Welninski and Lauro. Back in the room, Welninski started to pack and told Maldonado that they were leaving. When Maldonado said that he thought they should stay in the hotel, Welninski \"hit [him] in the back of the head with a gun and said 'we are leaving.' \" Welninski also instructed that Maldonado would drive. Maldonado testified, \"[w]ell, he said we're leaving and said I was going to drive and I took it that I was going to drive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As planned, the three left. Maldonado drove an SUV\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Lauro in the front passenger seat and Welninski in the back. At the time, Maldonado did not have a gun on him. About a mile into the trip, they were pulled over by a police car with flashing lights. Maldonado turned to his brother, in the back seat, and said that he was not going to run from the police. Welninski pointed the silver gun at Maldonado and said that he was \"not going back to prison, [and] to drive.\" Maldonado \"floored the gas\" for about a mile and a half, until they came into a residential neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Inside the SUV, he recalled Welninski handing Lauro the black handgun and the two of them saying \"we are fucked.\" Maldonado backed into a driveway and turned the lights off. They watched as a police car drove by. Welninski told Maldonado to go get a license\n   plate from another vehicle. As Maldonado exited the SUV, Welninski handed him the silver gun \"so the farmers don't shoot [me].\" Maldonado crossed the street in pursuit of license plates and realized that, without a screw driver, he would not be able to remove plates from another car. He also heard, what he assumed was a person on a phone, talking to the police, describing Maldonado's location. Maldonado \"froze\" and then saw two officers running after him. Maldonado ran from front yard to back yard, over a fence and onto another street, where another police officer was waiting for him, about ten yards away, gun drawn and directing him to \"get on the ground.\" Maldonado laid down flat and said, \"Don't shoot me.\" He threw the gun he had been carrying on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Six police officers testified at trial: Sergeant Kenneth Reno, Sergeant Jeff Martin, Officer Timothy Stecker, Officer John Kersker, Officer-in-Training Krystal Steller-Komenick, and Officer Joshua Hannum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The first officer to testify was Sergeant Kenneth Reno of the Oregon Police Department. Sergeant Reno was one of three officers to respond to a dispatch that shots had been fired at Icon's and that there was \"a person down in the parking lot with a head wound.\" The dispatcher also reported that \"two white males and a Hispanic female had fled south from Icon's towards the Holiday Inn.\" Sergeant Reno approached Icon's from the south, \"in hopes of catching the suspects fleeing.\" When he didn't see anybody, he pulled into Icon's parking lot. The time was 1:13 a.m. Two patrol cars were already there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} From the parking lot, Sergeant Reno watched an SUV driving through the parking lot of the Holiday Inn Express without its lights on, at a high rate of speed, before pulling onto Dustin Road. Sergeant Reno observed \"what looked to be two white males in the front seat,\" but he could not identify the driver. Sergeant Reno followed them in his car, which he reported over his radio. Oregon Police Sergeant Jeff Martin heard the call and provided back-up. At the time, Sergeant Martin was inside the lobby of the hotel, looking for the three who had fled Icons. Sergeant Martin had the department's police dog with him at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Sergeant Reno caught up to the SUV on Coy Road, notified dispatch that he would be stopping a vehicle, activated the patrol car's emergency lights, and watched the SUV pull to the side of the road. Although he had not been given a description of any vehicle to be looking for, he was suspicious of it because of the proximity in time between the dispatch and the time he saw it speeding through a parking lot with its lights off. Understanding that he had been dispatched on a \"weapons call,\" Sergeant Reno ordered the driver out of the vehicle, rather than to approach it himself. When he did, the SUV sped off, to the south. Sergeant Reno communicated to his fellow officers that he was in pursuit of the SUV. An Oregon Police Patrolman, Officer Timothy Stecker, heard the call and headed to the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Sergeant Reno estimated that the SUV accelerated to a speed of about 70 miles per hour in a 35 mile per hour speed zone. Sergeant Reno lost sight of the car when it ran a stop sign and crossed into Northwood, Ohio in Wood County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sergeant Reno, Sergeant Martin, and Officer Stecker scoured the area for approximately 10 minutes from their respective squad cars. Also in the area were other officers in three patrol cars from the Northwood Police Department who were responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person in the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} From there, events transpired quickly. From their respective squad cars, Sergeant Reno, Sergeant Martin, and Officer Stecker witnessed Northwood Police Officer John Kersker and Officer-in-Training Krystal Steller-Kominek chasing \"a white male suspect\" (later determined to be Maldonado) on foot. Sergeant Martin described the person as wearing a white shirt with a dark object in his waistband, running toward him. Maldonado ran around Sergeant Martin's vehicle and continued running. Sergeant Martin got out of his vehicle and gave \"multiple warnings\" that if Maldonado \"didn't stop\" he would release the dog on him. Maldonado did not stop, and Martin released the dog, who bit Maldonado in the arm. Maldonado went to the ground and surrendered. Later, the silver handgun, identified as a .9 millimeter, would be found in the area near where Maldonado surrendered. While law enforcement officers were focused on Maldonado, the officers \"heard a loud boom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Sergeant Reno described an \"extremely loud gunshot\" to the east. Reno looked and saw \"another male suspect holding a sawed-off shotgun.\" Reno observed the gun recoil and smoke exit the barrel. He also noticed that the man, whom he identified in court as Welninski, was standing outside the driver-side door of the SUV. The car was backed into a driveway, facing the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Officer Stecker described the incident similarly. That is, he also watched as Maldonado attempted to run on foot. To assist the Northwood police officers who were chasing him, Officer Stecker directed his spotlight on Maldonado. As he was adjusting the spotlight from within his patrol car, he heard a \"loud boom.\" Stecker testified, \"[a]s I am adjusting [my spotlight], a loud explosion, a bright flash of light to my left. I * * * experience[d] the overpressure of a projectile passing behind my head and neck.\" Overpressure is the air being pushed out of the way by a projectile as it cuts through the air. The bullet traveled through the open driver-side window, behind Stecker's neck and head and penetrated his passenger-side door, exiting the door and shattering the window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Sergeant Martin, who was parked behind Officer Stecker's car, about 50 feet away from Welninski, testified that after the first gunshot, \"multiple gunshots come from the other side of the vehicle,\" i.e. the passenger-side. Martin's dash-cam video indicates that the initial gunshot was immediately followed by two additional gunshots, also fired from the SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Suddenly, all attention turned to the SUV that was parked, backside in, in a driveway, with its lights off. Officer Stecker, who was the closest to the SUV at a distance of about 30 feet, fired two rounds from his handgun. As he returned fire, Officer Stecker noticed two figures retreat behind the SUV. Officer Stecker retrieved his patrol rifle from the trunk of his vehicle and \"pointed it towards the shadows that were moving behind the car.\" Officer Stecker fired three rounds through the windshield of the SUV. Officer Stecker also ordered Maldonado, who had surrendered in the grass, to \"crawl towards us * * * out of the field of fire * * * for his safety.\" On Officer Stecker's dash-cam video, Maldonado can be seen crawling through the grass towards the vehicle as instructed. Officer Stecker asked Officer-in-Training Sellers-Kominek to keep control of Maldonado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} From his location about 75 feet away, Sergeant Reno observed the female (Lauro) on the passenger side of the SUV, holding a handgun. Sergeant Reno ordered her multiple times to drop the gun. When she did not, Sergeant Reno fired at her once. When his gun malfunctioned, Sergeant Reno replaced it with a rifle. He fired a second shot at Lauro. Lauro returned\n   fire at Reno, and then fled to the rear of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Sergeant Martin also fired one round from his issued handgun and observed Northwood Police Sergeant Genzman also return fire. Sergeant Martin ordered the dog to run to the back of the SUV, where it attacked Welninski and bit him on the arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} It was described as a chaotic scene, with a lot of talking amongst the officers and the suspects. Sergeant Reno recalled Welninski yelling that he had a \"hostage,\" and Sergeant Reno yelled to his fellow-officers that there was no hostage and that both suspects were armed. At some point, Sergeant Reno became aware that the female \"went to the pavement\" but did not know the cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Welninski surrendered by walking around the driver's side of the SUV and throwing his shotgun \"out into the street which bounced off the front of [Officer Stecker's] patrol car's grill\" and back onto the street. Officer Stecker's dash-cam captured the shotgun sliding along the pavement before it came to a rest. When taken into custody, Welninski screamed profanity at the officers, spat at them and said, \"You killed my wife, you killed my wife.\" Police retrieved two unused shotgun shells from Welninski's pockets. In all, 17 minutes elapsed between the time Sergeant Reno began following the SUV at 1:13 a.m. until Welninski's surrender at 1:29:31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Officer Kersker found Lauro behind the SUV, on the ground, bleeding from the head. He checked for a pulse but could not find one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Welninski was taken to the hospital where a bullet was removed from his right calf. He was also treated for a dog bite on his right forearm. Blood tests revealed that Welninski's blood alcohol level was 0.111 percent. He also tested positive for cocaine and marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Patrolman Joshua Hannum reported to the hospital to transport Welninski to the Northwood Police Station. While waiting, Officer Hannum observed Welninski on a gurney with a towel over his head. Officer Hannum assumed Welninski was unconscious until Welninski announced that he wished he would have killed some cops and that \"[t]he coward pussies killed a 22 year-old girl hiding behind a truck.\" Officer Hannum took Welninski to the police station so that he could be fingerprinted and booked. While in a temporary holding cell, Welninski made several unsolicited comments, including, \"I ran up to that cop and popped one in his door.\" Officer Hannum observed Welninski say words to that effect \"multiple\" times and did so with \"a slight smile on his face.\" Two audio video clips from the station were also played. In one, Officer Hannum can be heard conducting an inventory. When he asked Welninski how much money he had, Welninski replied, \"What does my money have anything to do with it? I shot at a cop.\" The second clip was more difficult to hear, but clearly audible was Welninski's question to Officer Hannum in which he asked, \"[h]ey, did that squad car even get hit? I didn't even shoot [inaudible].\" Officer Hannum replied that he \"had no idea what happened out there\" because he was not at the crime scene. Welninski then added, \"I ran up on that motherfucker [inaudible]. That's what happened.\" On the witness stand, Officer Hannum testified that Welninski said that he had run up on an officer and \"dumped on him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\") is a branch of the Ohio Attorney General's Office that assists local law enforcement agencies conduct criminal investigations. BCI Agent David Horn arrived\n   at the crime scene at approximately 3:30 a.m. to secure it and to gather evidence. In all, Agent Horn took hundreds of photographs, many of which he identified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 35} A series of pictures depict Lauro's dead body near the back, passenger side of the SUV. Blood stains run from her body toward the front of the car. Pictures of Lauro's head indicate a wound to her temple. Next to Lauro is a black weapon, identified as a \"Hi-Point\" CF-380 semi-automatic handgun. Agent Horn testified that the position of the slide on the gun indicates that a round was fired. Also, \"red brown staining on the front of the gun\" indicates that the gun was either \"in close proximity to a wound\" or that blood was transferred there by hand. Another picture shows a \"spent\" Winchester .380 shell casing nearby. Inside the open front passenger door is a live, unused shell casing and a purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 36} A \"Harrington &amp; Richardson\" shotgun used by Welninski was also presented, as was an unused \"Remington\" 12-gauge shell casing that was found behind the SUV and \"wadding\" from the shotgun slug, which was found near Officer Stecker's cruiser. The wadding separates the gunpowder from the slug. Agent Horn investigated the weapon and testified it had been fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Kevin Belcik, also with the BCI, examined and tested the firearms in this case. According to Belcik, all three weapons (the black .380 semiautomatic that was recovered near Lauro's body, the silver Ruger .9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, that Maldonado discarded as he ran from the police, and the Harrington &amp; Richardon \"sawed off\" shotgun, that Welninski used) were all operable when recovered by police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Vickie Bartholomew is a fingerprint analyst with BCI. Bartholomew testified that none of the weapons had sufficient ridge details on them to allow a comparison of fingerprints. In other words, she could not identify who had handled the weapons, or eliminate anyone as having done so. She testified that \"very often we don't see positive results for weapons. We often see either negative or insufficient findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Special Agent Emahiser identified still shots created from video taken from Sergeant Reno's dash-cam. Sergeant Reno's car was parked behind Officer Stecker's vehicle, on the passenger side of the SUV. In three separate, grainy photos, Lauro can be seen dressed in white shoes and dark pants. In one, she is shown standing next to the passenger-side door of the SUV. A second shot shows Lauro and a flash of light, thought to be \"the muzzle flash coming from the weapon she's firing.\" A third photo shows her moving toward the rear of the SUV. A similar dashcam photo was shown from Sergeant Martin's vehicle, which was parked on the other side of Officer Stecker's patrol car, further down the street, facing the driver's side of the SUV. It depicts the muzzle flash from Welninski's shotgun blast at Stecker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The actual door of Officer Stecker's cruiser was presented to the jury, as were pictures showing a hole in the metal door and the remains of the shattered window. Part of a spent lead slug that was found in a yard, \"in line\" with the trajectory of the bullet was also presented. Also, after the evidence was transported to a secured garage, the police discovered a second area of damage to the patrol car, caused by a projectile that was found in the driver's door. An analysis of the spent bullet revealed that it was fired from the .380 handgun that was found near Lauro's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Agent Emahiser met Welninski and Maldonado at the Northwood Police Station. Both told Agent Emahiser that they would be willing to talk to him. After they were transported to the Wood County jail, Welninski told him, \"I don't know why those cops are saying I shot up those cars, I only shot once.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Agent Emahiser read Maldonado his Miranda rights later in the day on December 18, 2015. Initially, Maldonado told several lies. For example, he said that \"nothing really occurred\" at Icon's and that no shots had been fired there. He also said that he had not handled a gun and that it been Welninski who drove away from the hotel and ignored Officer Reno's instruction to exit the vehicle. When Agent Emahiser met with Maldonado a few days later, Maldonado had a lawyer with him. At that time, he claimed that he had been the one to take a gun to Icons, and had pistol whipped a person there. During a third interview seven months later, on July 7, 2016, Maldonado said that it was his brother who had assaulted the patron at Icons. Maldonado testified that he initially lied because he had been threatened by his uncle, who told him not to say anything against Welninski or Maldonado would \"wish [he] never did.\" Maldonado claimed that he also received a note in jail from Welninski directing Maldonado to accept a plea for the events that occurred in the bar, and that if he did not, Maldonado \"would get beat up all of the time\" in jail. Maldonado decided to tell the truth once prosecutors assured him that he would be \"kept separate\" while at the jail. Maldonado testified that Welninski blames him for Lauro's death-by-suicide and expected Maldonado to \"take the hit for the charges stemming from the bar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Maldonado told the jury that his brother told him a \"bunch\" of times that he wanted to commit \"suicide by cop,\" meaning that he would die in a gun fight with police.

Before inmates use the prison phone system at the Wood County Jail, they are warned that their phone calls are being recorded. The state proffered Welninski as the speaker in each call, without objection. In the clips, Welninski can be heard stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   1.

On January 6, 2016, in case No. 15-CR-552, Welninski was indicted on one count of attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02, a felony of the first degree. Attached to this charge were three specifications: a seven year firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.1412(A) ; a repeat violent offender specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(A), and a specification for forfeiture pursuant to R.C. 2941.1417(A). Welninski was also charged with felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), a felony of the second degree. Attached to this charge were two specifications: a seven year firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.1412(A) ; and a repeat violent offender specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(A). Welninski was arraigned on January 14, 2016, where he entered pleas of not guilty to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 46} On January 21, 2016, in Case No. 16-CR-039, Welninski was indicted on six separate counts: receiving stolen property, in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A), a felony of the fourth degree, carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2) and (F)(1), a felony of the fourth degree; illegal possession of a firearm in a liquor permit establishment, in violation of R.C. 2923.121(A) and (E), a felony of the third degree; felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), a felony of the second degree; having weapons under disability, in violation of 2923.13(A)(2), a felony of the third degree, and failure to comply, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B), a felony of the fourth degree. Each count carried with it one or more firearm specifications, and the felonious assault charge carried with it a repeat violent offender specification. Welninski entered not guilty pleas during his January 22, 2016 arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 47} A three day jury trial began on July 5, 2016. At the start, the state dismissed the receiving stolen property charge. The jury found Welninski guilty as to all remaining charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The court held a separate hearing regarding the repeat violent offender specifications. The court found that Welninski was convicted of the repeat violent offender specifications attached to Counts 1 and 2 in case No. 15-CR-552 and Count 4 in case No. 16-CR-039. The court sentenced Welninski to 97 years in prison, 88 years of which are mandatory. Welninski was appointed appellate counsel and raises six assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   1. First Assignment of Error: The trial court abused its discretion when it sentenced appellant to all firearm specifications in Case Number 16-CR-039.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   2. Second Assignment of Error: The offenses of attempted murder and felonious assault are allied offenses of similar import and subject to merger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   3. Third Assignment of Error: Appellant's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   4. Fourth Assignment of Error: The trial court erred when it prevented appellant from introducing into evidence the co-defendant's proffer, cooperation agreement, and plea of guilty and questioning witnesses regarding the same, and by commenting on appellant not testifying at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   5. Appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   6. The trial court erred when it imposed the costs of prosecution without consideration of appellant's present or future ability to pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 49} We will address the trial-related assignments of error first, followed by the sentencing-related assignments of error, in\n   the following order: (1) the trial court's failure to allow certain evidence relating to Maldonado's plea bargain and the trial court's alleged violation of Welninski's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent (fourth assignment of error): (2) whether the convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence (third assignment of error); (3) the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel (fifth assignment of error); (4) whether Welninski's convictions for attempted murder and felonious assault in case number 15-CR-552 are allied offenses of similar import and should merge (second assignment of error); (5) whether the trial court abused its discretion when it sentenced Welninski to all firearm specifications in case number 16-CR-039 (first assignment of error); and (6) whether the trial court erred by imposing costs of prosecution without a finding of Welninski's ability to pay (sixth assignment of error).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Impeachment of Maldonado; Welninski's Outburst\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In his fourth assignment of error, Welninski makes two separate arguments. He argues that the trial court erred when it prevented him from introducing into evidence Maldonado's cooperation agreement and plea bargain between Maldonado and the state. He also argues that the trial court violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by commenting on his failure to testify. We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 51} First, Welninski argues that he \"attempted to impeach\" Maldonado's credibility by questioning Agent Emahiser \"regarding [Maldonado's] plea deal.\" Welninski claims that the trial court \"denied * * * his right to elicit testimony from [Agent Emahiser] regarding these factors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 52} By way of context, Maldonado, who testified before Emahiser, was also questioned, albeit briefly, about a plea bargain. During his testimony, the trial court instructed Welninski's lawyer not to question Maldonado about the length of any prison sentence Maldonado faced if convicted of the charges for which he was indicted. On appeal, Welninski does not challenge that instruction. Instead, his complaint stems from what occurred later that same day, during his counsel's cross examination of Agent Emahiser. While examining Agent Emahiser on the subject of Maldonado's inconsistent statements to the police, Welninski's counsel asked him, \"[t]he deal was is that [Maldonado] was going to get nine years in prison, correct?\" [sic] An extensive sidebar conversation ensued, out of earshot from the jury. At its conclusion, the trial court ruled that counsel could \"talk about a statement that was made in anticipation of a [plea bargain], but when you talk about specific years A versus B, then you have gone across the line.\" The court then instructed the jury to disregard counsel's question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Criminal defendants are entitled to cross-examine witnesses as provided by Evid.R. 611(B), but the scope of cross-examination is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rather, it prohibited and struck his counsel's specific question as to the number of years Maldonado faced in prison. The trial court's ruling on this matter was proper.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Price\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 57} During closing arguments, Welninski interrupted his lawyer, Scott Coon, and blurted out, \"Hey, Mr. Coon? I apologize, but I am tired. I did all that shit, find me guilty on everything. I am saying-.\" The court responded, \"Excuse me, this isn't your closing argument, sir. It is not the time. You didn't take the stand and testify, but now you have to be quiet. You have to be quiet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 58} We find no merit to Welninski's argument that the trial court erred in its directive. Instead, we view the court's statement that \"[y]ou didn't take the stand and testify, but now you have to be quiet\" as an explanation that Welninski had an opportunity to testify, that he chose not to testify, and he could not testify now. We do not think that the court's statement can be construed as an invitation to the jury to draw an adverse conclusion from his decision not to testify. In fact, the trial court properly instructed the jury that Welninski \"has a constitutional right not to testify. The fact that the defendant did not testify must not be considered for any purpose.\" We see no violation of Welninski's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Welninski's fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The central issue in this case was whether Welninski brought a weapon to Icons, used it to pistol-whip Vergara, and then fired it twice. Welninski alleged that it was Maldonado, not him, who committed these offenses. Vergara, Pecina, Davis, and Maldonado\n   testified that it was Welninski. The jury chose to believe the testimony of these four eyewitnesses rather than Welninski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 61} In determining whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, we sit as a \"thirteenth juror.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although neither Vergara nor Davis initially told police that the assailant had tattoos, at trial they both testified that the assailant had visible tattoos. And Pecina admitted on the witness stand that she had made out-of-court statements, including to the police, that the person who asked for her name inside the bar (i.e. Welninski) was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the person who pistol whipped Vergara, while at trial she testified that they were the same person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Welninski also challenges the credibility of Maldonado. He says that Maldonado's testimony was \"self-serving and not credible\" because he \"greatly contradicted\" himself in the multiple statements he gave to police.

The shots were fired by Welninski and Lauro as they were standing on either side of the SUV. Welninski used a Harrison &amp; Richardson 12 gauge shotgun, and Lauro used a High Point Model CF .380 caliber handgun. The state argued, and proved, that when Welninski and Lauro shot at Officer Stecker with their respective weapons, they were acting in concert to grievously injure-and hopefully kill-Officer Stecker. Welninski was convicted of attempted murder for firing his own shotgun at Officer Stecker, and he was convicted of felonious assault for acting as Lauro's accomplice when she fired her .380 caliber handgun at Officer Stecker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 86} The state argues that these two convictions cannot merge because the felonious assault conviction was based on aiding and abetting charges-which, according to the state, means separate conduct and separate animus. The state claims that because complicity between Welninski and Lauro was argued, proven, and instructed\n   upon, Welninski could be convicted and sentenced for both attempted murder and felonious assault because \"two separate shots from the two separate weapons wielded by two separate shooters created separate animi.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 87} The state's argument, however, is inherently illogical given that Welninski's complicity conviction under R.C. 2923.03 required the state to prove that Welninski and Lauro shared the same animus.\n   <em>\n    State v.
