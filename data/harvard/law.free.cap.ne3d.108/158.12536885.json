For the reasons set forth below, this court affirms the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant, Michael C. Horn, was the 40 year old step-father and step-uncle to the two victims, S.M. and J.M., respectively, who were 13 to 14 years old at the times of the rapes. S.M. and J.M. are first cousins. On November 10, 2015, the Wood County prosecutor filed six bills of information against appellant: (Count 1) rape of S.M., in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) and (B), a first degree felony, during time period 1; (Count 2) rape of S.M., in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) and (B), a first degree felony, during time period 1; (Count 3) rape of S.M., in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) and (B), a first degree felony, during time period 2; (Count 4) rape of S.M., in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) and (B), a first degree felony, during time period 2; (Count 5) rape of J.M., in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) and (B), a first degree felony, during time period 3; and (Count 6) rape of J.M., in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) and (B), a first degree felony, during time period 3. Following the jury trial held March 7-10, 2016, appellant was convicted on all six counts. The jury verdict judgment entry was journalized March 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Each of the six counts also carried a sexually violent predator specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.148(A). Following a bench trial held July 26, 2016, appellant was convicted on all six counts of the sexually violent predator specifications. The\n   sexually violent predator specification verdict judgment entry was journalized September 8, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Subsequently on September 13, 2016, the trial court held the sentencing hearing. Appellee stipulated to the merger of Count 2 into Count 1, Count 4 into Count 3, and Count 6 into Count 5. For each of the Counts 1, 3 and 5, the trial court sentenced appellant to serve a prison term of ten years to life to be served consecutively. The trial court journalized the sentencing judgment entry on September 22, 2016 followed by a nunc pro tunc judgment entry on September 28, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} It is from the trial court's September 28, 2016, journalized judgment entry which appellant filed his appeal on October 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant sets forth five assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I. The admission of other-acts testimony violated Mr. Horn's right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   II. Application of the rape-shield law resulted in a deprivation of Mr. Horn's constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses, his right to present a defense, and his right to a fair trial and due process of law, in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments and Article I, Sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   III. Mr. Horn's conviction under the Sexually Violent Predator specification is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   IV. The trial court abused its discretion when it permitted a counselor to testify regarding Asperger's syndrome in violation of Evid.R. 401, 402, and 403 resulting in violation of Mr. Horn's right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   V. Mr. Horn's convictions for violations of R.C.

R.C. 2907.02(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The lengthy jury instructions stipulated by the parties and read to the jury contained all of the relevant definitions associated with the elements of these crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Admissibility-\"Other Acts\" Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The focus of appellant's first assignment of error are Counts 1 through 4 for the rapes of S.M. Appellant argues Evid.R. 404(B) prohibits the introduction of \"other acts\" evidence of matters extrinsic to the operative facts of the underlying charges in order to prove the offenses alleged, and his due process rights were violated because these other acts were neither temporally related, nor circumstantially related, to the operative facts of the offenses alleged. Appellant argues S.M.'s testimony was not temporally related \"regarding four other acts, some of which occurred at an unspecified time prior to the alleged incidents, and others that occurred six months after the charged offense in counts 1 and 2, and eight to nine months before the charged offense in counts 3 and 4.\" Appellant further argues S.M.'s testimony was not circumstantially related because \"there was nothing so unusual or distinctive about spanking a bare bottom, offering to assist in shaving pubic hair, performing cunnilingus, or putting her hand on [appellant's] penis. And each of those instances was different from each other, and each was different from the two charged incidents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In response appellee argues the trial court did not abuse its discretion because uncharged sex crimes against the same victim by the same defendant are not subject to exclusion under Evid.R. 404(B)\"for such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" In addition to identifying the perpetrator, the other acts testimony also showed appellant's grooming plan to create a trust relationship with S.M. to submit to his sexual conduct. Appellee argues the other acts testimony was admissible because it was more probative than any unfair prejudice to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Evid.R. 404(B) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. In criminal cases, the proponent of evidence to be offered under this rule shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Evidence of other acts may be used to show appellant is the actual individual who committed those offenses to establish a behavioral fingerprint to identify him as the perpetrator through the characteristics of the acts rather than through his character traits.\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-07-1214,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-471\">\n    2010-Ohio-471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20497343\">\n    2010 WL 497343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 69. The other acts evidence must also be temporally and circumstantially related to the operative facts of the charged offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Consideration of other acts evidence is a three-step analysis: (1) pursuant to Evid.R. 401 whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it\n   would be without the evidence; (2) whether the other acts evidence is presented solely to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose; and (3) pursuant to Evid.R. 403 whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Teal\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-15-1280,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12551536\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/95/1095/\">\n    2017-Ohio-7202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203446991\">\n    2017 WL 3446991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The operative facts of the charged offenses begins our analysis. The record shows the first two rape convictions (Counts 1 and 2) involved digital penetration of S.M.'s vagina and stimulating her clitoris while she was asleep, when she was a ninth grader. The third and fourth rape convictions (Counts 3 and 4), also when S.M. was a ninth grader, involved digital penetration of her vagina and stimulating her clitoris followed by the insertion and use of sex toys in her vagina and anus while awake. In each instance S.M. was alone with the appellant at the home they shared and in a situation where she felt helpless and could not stop the rape. After each rape S.M. felt ashamed and isolated from her family, friends and teachers because \"no one believed\" her, and no one stopped appellant, even when she did tell adults. S.M. came to fear appellant. S.M.'s mother testified she observed appellant yell at S.M., and on one occasion it was \"beyond normal dad behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The record also shows testimony regarding the following other acts evidence was discussed by S.M. and corroborated by one or more other witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} At trial S.M. testified to three separate events while an eighth grader: 1) appellant ordered her to drop her pants and panties and spanked her bare bottom and demanded she count the spanks and thank him for them; 2) appellant offered to shave her pubic hair; and 3) appellant gave her a birds-and-bees talk that involved appellant using his personal copy of the \"Kama Sutra,\" which she described as \"the Indian book on sex positions\" with graphic pictures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} At trial S.M. testified to two separate events while a ninth grader: 1) appellant ordered her to drop her pants and panties and he examined her vagina and clitoris with his tongue and fingers to make sure she's \"not ripped up\" and then examined her anus with his finger covered in Vaseline; and 2) while appellant wore boxer shorts and had a partial erection, he grabbed her hand to put it over his penis to demonstrate \"he was too big for me and that if he would have raped me, it would have tore me up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Grooming is the process by which appellant took deliberate actions to expose S.M. to sexual material and to sexual behaviors to prepare S.M. for sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125145\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/521/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5695\">\n    2012-Ohio-5695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20N.E.2d%201278\">\n    983 N.E.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21. The other acts testimony appeared to describe aspects of appellant's grooming process conditioning S.M. to submit to appellant's sexual behaviors that occurred while she was an eighth and ninth grader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The first step of other acts evidence analysis is pursuant to Evid.R. 401. Relevant evidence is generally admissible, while irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. Evid.R. 402. \" 'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Evid.R. 401. We find the other acts evidence about the grooming process was relevant that the rapes stated in Counts 1 through 4 were more probable than they would be without the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The second step of other acts evidence analysis is pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). We find the other acts evidence was presented for legitimate purposes other than solely about appellant's character, such as specifically identifying appellant as the perpetrator of the rapes in the absence of mistake or accident and to identify his plan or scheme or motive or intent to target the teenagers in the family and condition them to submit to his sexual conduct. Evid.R. 404(B) did not prohibit the introduction of such other acts evidence for those legitimate purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The third step of other acts evidence analysis is pursuant to Evid.R. 403, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Exclusion mandatory. Although relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Evid.R. 403(A). We find the probative value of the relevant other acts evidence substantially outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice. We do not find the other acts evidence resulted in material prejudice against appellant. The other acts evidence helped appellee to prove appellant's identity, motive, opportunity, preparation, and plan. The record does not indicate the jury was confused or misled by such other acts evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We find the trial court did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily or unconscionably and did not abuse its discretion regarding the admissibility of other acts evidence. Appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Admissibility-\"Rape Shield\" Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant next argues Ohio's rape-shield law must yield to his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The focus of appellant's second assignment of error are, again, Counts 1 through 4 for the rapes of S.M. Appellant argues he should have been able to introduce evidence of S.M.'s sexual activity with her teenage boyfriend to show that she had a reason to fabricate the allegations against appellant. Appellant argues S.M's reason to fabricate was in response to her mother and appellant forbidding S.M. from seeing her boyfriend. S.M.'s parents were divorced and shared custody of her. Appellant argues S.M. wanted to move in full-time with her biological father for his \"relaxed\" parenting standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In response appellee argues the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the purpose and spirit of the rape shield law is intended for precisely the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Ohio's rape shield law states in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual activity, opinion evidence of the victim's sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim's sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim's past sexual activity with the offender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   R.C. 2907.02(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} We find the record shows appellant did not seek to introduce evidence of specific instances of S.M.'s sexual activity, opinion evidence of S.M.'s sexual activity, or reputation evidence of S.M.'s sexual activity for any allowable reason. Appellant did not seek to introduce evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or S.M.'s past sexual activity\n   with appellant, which are the limited allowances by statute. Appellant sought to attack S.M.'s credibility by providing a reason to fabricate the allegations against appellant. \"Evidence of sexual activity offered merely to impeach the credibility of the witness is not material to a fact at issue in the case and must be excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Ector\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-07-1169,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-515\">\n    2009-Ohio-515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20282409\">\n    2009 WL 282409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21. The record shows the jury heard testimony from eight witnesses other than S.M., including forensic DNA evidence and expert testimony regarding the alleged sex toys used in Counts 3 and 4. The jury, as the trier of the facts, determined credibility of all the evidence, including the nine witness testimonies.\n   <em>\n    State v. Spaulding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    151 Ohio St.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20N.E.3d%20554\">\n    89 N.E.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 30} We find the record confirms the jury heard appellant cross-examine S.M. about her motives to fabricate her rape claims against appellant, including references to S.M.'s boyfriend, and S.M. answered each question. Perhaps S.M.'s answers did not support appellant's defense theory, but the application of the rape shield law did not deprive appellant of material evidence to a fact at issue nor deny testimony that was more probative than prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

S.M. testified that in contrast to her step-father \"my dad, he gives me-at some point he gives me a chance to express my opinion, tell him yes or no, and he'll actually listen to me.\" S.M.'s dad testified S.M. \"was pretty honest with me because I always kind of had a really good relationship with that.\" S.M.'s mom testified she can think of nothing that would motivate both S.M. and J.M. to fabricate the rape allegations against appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 32} We find the trial court did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily or unconscionably and did not abuse its discretion regarding the inadmissibility of evidence under the rape shield law.

Appellee further argues the school counselor's testimony was not unduly prejudicial to appellant because she had personally met with J.M. and had\n   personal experience with and training in counseling students involved with sexual and physical abuse.

It was appellant who explained to J.M.'s mom (his sister-in-law) what effect the medicines had. There was also testimony from J.M. describing her physics class in high school as, \"Isn't physics, like, gym or something?\" The testimony J.M. provided, both on direct and cross-examination, was sufficient to show that a rational jury could reach its own conclusions as to J.M.'s mental condition referred to by multiple witnesses as \"low functioning\" and whether that condition rendered her \"substantially impaired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} \"Substantial impairment\" is \"a present reduction, diminution or decrease in the victim's ability, either to appraise the nature of his conduct or to control his conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Some of her special needs foster children had Asperger's syndrome, which she described as a disorder where the person is socially awkward and does not know how to evaluate a social situation. The school counselor did not provide an opinion about J.M. and Asperger's syndrome. The school counselor testified a teacher referred J.M. to her because the teacher was concerned with J.M.'s grades dropping, poor hygiene, and her transformation into a withdrawn and untalkative girl. J.M. eventually told the school counselor about appellant forcing her to perform fellatio and \"family members that were angry that didn't want her to tell.\" The school counselor testified after J.M.'s disclosure she did not see improvement in her grades, hygiene or stress \"because this was an ongoing situation * * * there wasn't a resolution for her to have an end to it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 38} We find the trial court did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily or unconscionably and did not abuse its discretion regarding the admissibility of J.M.'s school counselor testimony.

While Count 3 was occurring, S.M. was afraid of appellant's temper and was resigned to the helplessness of a child who expected no adult would believe her about what her step-father did to her. S.M.'s testimony included statements such as, \"I felt if I didn't do [what he commanded], he was going to do it anyways,\" and \"[my step-father] gets these very stern looks on is face every time that you challenge him.

Then soon after J.M. turned 14 years old, she was at appellant's house to spend the night, which was a frequent, necessary occurrence due to transportation arrangements for her to get to school. That night she was not yet asleep, and appellant came to her room. He told her to come with him to another bedroom where they were alone. He removed his boxer shorts and guided her mouth to his penis for fellatio. She felt she had no choice but to obey appellant \"because he was family.\" Many witnesses described J.M. as \"low functioning.\" J.M. testified she was scared and tried to cope with the situation by \"shutting down.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q: What was going through your head when that happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A: At that time my brain was starting to shut down as I was getting scared and creeped out. * * * I was really scared, and I really didn't know what to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The record includes evidence from which the jury can reach its own determination as to J.M.'s ability to resist or consent being substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition of which appellant knew or should have known.
