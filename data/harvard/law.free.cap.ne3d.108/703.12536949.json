He pleaded guilty to attempted rape and the robbery charge was dismissed. On May 11, 1978, he was sentenced to two to 15 years' incarceration. He was paroled on July 19, 1981. On March 4, 1982, he was convicted of two counts of theft and sentenced to concurrent terms of two to five years. He was returned to prison on the parole violation for the attempted rape and on the theft\n   convictions. Because he had committed the thefts while on parole, former R.C. 2929.14(B)(3) required that the sentences for the thefts be served consecutively to the sentence for attempted rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Effective July 1, 1997, the General Assembly enacted former R.C. Chapter 2950 (\"Megan's Law\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.Sub.H.B. No. 180, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2560, enacted in 1996, amended in 2003 by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5, 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6556. Former R.C. 2950.04(A)(1)(a) provided that an offender who was serving a prison term for a sexually-oriented offense on July 1, 1997, was required to register as a sex offender. On April 7, 1997, while serving time for a parole violation, Stowers was ordered back from prison to the trial court for a sexual-offender-classification hearing under Megan's Law. He was adjudicated as a sexual predator. We affirmed his classification on appeal, overruling his constitutional challenges.\n   <em>\n    State v. Stowers\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-970423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20140097\">\n    1998 WL 140097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 27, 1998) (\"\n   <em>\n    Stowers I\n   </em>\n   \"). After being released on parole and reincarcerated various times for parole violations, Stowers was finally released from prison on December 3, 1997, after serving a total of nearly 17 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2005, the Ohio Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    State v.

In 2006, Stowers filed a motion to set aside the order requiring him to register based on\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   . Stowers argued that he had finished serving his sentence for the attempted rape prior to July 1, 1997, and therefore, Megan's Law could not be applied to him. The trial court overruled the motion, but did not order the clerk to serve Stowers with a copy of the order. Stowers did not appeal from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 7, 2014, in a separate case, Stowers was indicted for failing to notify the sheriff of an address change. Citing\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   , he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and requested an order removing his name from the sex-offender registry. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the indictment and ordered that his name be removed from the registry. The state appealed. We held that res judicata precluded Stowers from raising the\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   issue, because he had raised that issue in the 2006 motion in the other case, it had been decided against him, and he had not appealed from that judgment. We reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the indictment and removing Stowers's name from the sex-offender registry and remanded the cause for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He cited\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130469 (May 2, 2014), a judgment entry from this court, arguing that he had never been served with the 2006 judgment entry as required by Civ.R. 58(B), and therefore, the time to appeal the 2006 entry had not run. On September 6, 2016, the trial court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to serve Stowers with the 2006 judgment entry. Stowers filed his notice of appeal as\n   to the 2006\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   motion on September 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Before reaching the merits of Stowers's appeal, we must determine whether it is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Proceedings under Megan's Law were civil, not criminal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Clayborn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093592\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/125/450/\">\n    125 Ohio St.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-2123\">\n    2010-Ohio-2123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=928%20N.E.2d%201093\">\n    928 N.E.2d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which stated, \"An appeal from an R.C.

But\n   <em>\n    Clayborn\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    Clayborn\n   </em>\n   involved a direct appeal from an initial sex-offender-classification\n   judgment. In\n   <em>\n    Clayborn\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized its line of cases holding that sex-offender-classification procedures under Megan's Law were civil and remedial, but carved out an exception for the time for appealing a sex-offender-classification judgment, noting that \"the [sex-offender] classification and its concomitant duties appear in the criminal judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. The court held that \"an appeal from a sexual offender classification judgment is a civil matter within the context of a criminal case\" and that \"the appeal requirements applicable to criminal cases * * * apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. In\n   <em>\n    Clayborn\n   </em>\n   , as in all initial classification hearings, the defendant was present in court when the classification was announced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In this case, Stowers is not appealing from the initial sex-offender-classification judgment entered in 1997. He is appealing from the trial court's 2006 judgment overruling his motion to vacate his sex-offender classification, which was filed after conviction and to which Civ.R. 58(B) service rules apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reece\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Unlike his initial classification, Stowers was not present when the decision was announced, nor was it part of his criminal sentencing entry. Therefore, his appeal is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The state also argues that pursuant to our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Stowers II\n   </em>\n   , res judicata precludes Stowers from raising the issue of whether the trial court had the authority to order him to register as a sex offender. In\n   <em>\n    Stowers II\n   </em>\n   , Stowers had been indicted for failing to notify the sheriff of an address change. The trial court granted Stowers's\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   motion to dismiss the indictment, and the state appealed. We stated that where a jurisdictional issue has been fully litigated and decided by a court with the authority to pass on the issue, the decision is res judicata in a collateral action and can only be challenged in a direct appeal. We held, based on the record before us in that case, that Stowers could not collaterally attack the trial court's 2006 judgment where he had failed to appeal it. The parties did not raise, and we did not address, the issue of whether the time had run for appealing the trial court's 2006 judgment overruling Stowers's motion to set aside the order requiring him to register in the original attempted-rape case. We hold now that it had not. Stowers has now filed a timely appeal from that judgment, and we will address its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Stowers's sole assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in denying his 2006 motion to set aside the order requiring him to register as a sexual predator.

He was paroled on July 19, 1981. While on parole, he committed two theft offenses, for which he was sentenced on March 4, 1982, to concurrent terms of two to five years. Stowers was returned to prison on the parole violation for the attempted rape and on the theft convictions. Because he had committed the thefts while on parole, former R.C. 2929.14(B)(3) required that the theft sentences be served consecutively to the attempted-rape sentence. Following several returns to prison for parole violations, Stowers ultimately was released from prison on December 3, 1997. He had served a total of nearly 17 years. Therefore, he had to have completed the 15-year maximum sentence for attempted rape well before July 1, 1997, the effective date of Megan's Law's registration requirements. We note\n   that the state does not argue in its brief that Stowers had not completed his attempted-rape sentence before July 1, 1997. The state argues only that res judicata precludes Stowers from raising this issue and that Civ.R. 58(B) does not apply to Stowers's appeal, issues that we have resolved in Stowers's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We hold that the trial court erred in overruling Stowers's 2006 motion to set aside the order requiring him to register as a sexual predator.
