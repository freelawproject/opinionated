Dickerson obtained full ownership interest in approximately 82 acres of real property located in Section 20 of Cadiz Township, in Harrison County. Approximately four years later, John R. Dickerson transferred one-half of the property to his wife, Marjorie I. Dickerson. John and Marjorie Dickerson divorced prior to the transfer. On December 17, 1952, John and Marjorie Dickerson jointly transferred their interest in the property to the Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Company via a warranty deed; however John and Marjorie each retained a one-half interest in all of the oil and gas and the rights to drill and/or explore said oil and gas associated with the property. John and Marjorie transferred the rights to the property's surface, coal, and all other non-oil and gas minerals. Pursuant to the 1952 transaction, the mineral rights were severed from the surface estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} John Dickerson passed away on September 7, 1976. His mineral rights to the property were not included in his estate. Marjorie Dickerson passed away on August 24, 1994. Her estate was not probated at the time of her death. The sole heirs of John and Marjorie Dickerson are: Judith Dickerson, Mary Louise Foster, Elaine Harris, Claire Dickerson, Richard Dickerson, Robert Dickerson, Raymond Dickerson, Constance Clark, Deborah Snelson, Misty Engstrom, Ronald Dickerson, John Dickerson, and Wanda Dickerson (\"the Dickersons\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal strip-mined and reclaimed the property. In\n   1997, Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal sold the property to Neil Porter via a limited warranty deed. In 2006, Neil Porter sold the property to plaintiffs-appellants Christopher and Veronica Wendt (\"the Wendts\") via a survivorship deed. The deed to the property was recorded on April 21, 2006. The deed was subject to the reservation by, \"John R. Dickerson and Marjorie I. Dickerson, their heirs and assigns for all of the oil and gas with the right to drill for in Warranty Deed filed for record December 17, 1952 in Volume 133, page 69, Deed Records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} From 1952 to 2011, the Dickersons took no action related to their mineral rights to the property. In 2011, the Dickersons gave John L. Dickerson a power of attorney to deal with the inherited mineral rights on behalf of all the Dickerson heirs. On February 28, 2011, the Dickersons recorded two documents with the Harrison County Recorder's Office, each entitled, \"Affidavit for Transfer of Real Estate Inherited.\" Each of the affidavits stated the purpose of the affidavit was to obtain a transfer of the above-described premises to the heirs at law of Marjorie/John Dickerson and lists the names, addresses, and portions inherited by each heir. Each affidavit states it transfers, by inheritance, the \"undivided one-half interest in all oil and gas contained in and underlying the hereinafter described premises, together with the right to drill for, operate, produce, and market the same.\" In May of 2011, the Dickersons signed a lease with Chesapeake Exploration LLC for the mineral rights to the property. Chesapeake recorded the lease on November 2, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During 2011, the Wendts also sought to lease their mineral rights to the property. The Wendts signed a mineral lease with Chesapeake in the spring of 2011. The lease failed because of the Dickersons' potential interest in the mineral rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 11, 2011, the Wendts published a notification of abandonment in the Steubenville Herald-Star newspaper. On October 21, 2011, the Wendts recorded an affidavit of abandonment with the Harrison County Recorder's Office. The affidavit asserted the Wendts owned all the oil and gas rights by the automatic operation of R.C. 5301.56 and stated the \"mineral interest previously owned by holders John and Marjorie Dickerson were deemed abandoned pursuant to O.R.C. 5301.56(B) from 1989 to 2006 and vested in the owner of the surface as of March 22, 1992.\" The Wendts executed a second lease with Chesapeake on October 31, 2011, but the lease was terminated due to the conflict in the mineral rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On December 9, 2011, the Dickersons recorded two claims to preserve mineral interest regarding any mineral interests inherited from Marjorie and John Dickerson with the Harrison County Recorder's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On February 9, 2012, the Wendts filed a complaint against the Dickersons and Chesapeake Exploration LLC in the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint brought nine causes of action: declaratory judgment, quiet title, injunction, slander of title, unjust enrichment/quantum meruit, trespass, negligence/negligence per se, potential interference with business relationship, and constructive trust. The Wendts requested the trial court rule they were the lawful owners of the mineral rights. The Wendts argued that, pursuant to the 1989 version of the Dormant Mineral Act, the mineral rights merged with the surface estate no later than March 22, 1992. The Dickersons filed a counterclaim alleging slander of title and intentional interference with business relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Wendts and Dickersons filed competing motions for summary judgment in December of 2012. The Wendts dismissed Chesapeake as a party defendant on January 8, 2013. The trial court granted the Wendts' motion for summary judgment as it pertained to their claim for declaratory judgment, quiet tile, and injunction. The trial court found the 1989 version of the Ohio Dormant Mineral Act (\"ODMA\") applied and, as such, the mineral rights merged with the surface estate on March 22, 1992. The Wendts were therefore the owners of the mineral rights underlying the surface estate. The trial court found there were genuine issues of material fact as to the Wendts' remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court held a bench trial on the parties' remaining claims. The Wendts dismissed their claims for unjust enrichment and negligence. On January 15, 2014, the trial court issued its judgment entry that found the Wendts and Dickersons were not entitled to judgment on their remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Dickersons appealed to this Court and raised two assignments of error. They argued that the trial court erred by finding the 1989 version of the ODMA applied to this case and erred in finding the 1989 ODMA was constitutionally applied. In\n   <em>\n    Wendt v. Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 2014 AP 01 0003,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4615\">\n    2014-Ohio-4615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205306667\">\n    2014 WL 5306667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court found the trial court correctly determined the 1989 version of the ODMA applied, the mineral rights automatically vested with the surface owners on March 22, 1992, and that the trial court did not err when it found the 1989 ODMA was constitutionally applied to the Dickersons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Dickersons appealed this Court's decision to the Ohio Supreme Court and asserted three propositions of law: (1) the 2006 version of the ODMA controls the vesting of title in a surface owner who did not make a claim for the mineral interests before the 2006 enactment; (2) the 1989 version of the ODMA did not provide mineral owners with the due process of law required under the state and federal constitution; and (3) the ODMA is not now and never was self-executing. The Ohio Supreme Court accepted the appeal, but held the case pending the resolution of several other cases already accepted by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On September 15, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court reversed this Court's opinion on the authority of\n   <em>\n    Corban v. Chesapeake Exploration, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280760\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/512/\">\n    149 Ohio St.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280760\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/512/\">\n    2016-Ohio-5796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20N.E.2d%201089\">\n    76 N.E.2d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Shondrick-Nau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280502\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/282/\">\n    149 Ohio St.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280502\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/282/\">\n    2016-Ohio-5793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%20427\">\n    74 N.E.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Once the case was returned to the trial court, the trial court granted the Wendts' leave to file a motion for summary judgment relative to constitutional issues. Accordingly, both the Wendts and Dickersons filed motions for summary judgment and responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The trial court issued a judgment entry on June 2, 2017. The trial court found that, in\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court concluded the 2006 version of the ODMA applies to all claims asserted after June 30, 2006 and that the Wendts did not assert their ODMA claims against the Dickersons until after June 30, 2006. Thus, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   , the 2006 version of the ODMA applies in this case. Further, that, pursuant to the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   , the General Assembly modified only the method and procedure by which the right is recognized and protected and no vested, substantive right is altered. Accordingly, the Wendts' alleged property rights, including a cause of action, are not vested property rights. The trial court found the application of the 2006 ODMA to the Wendts in this case does not constitute the deprivation of the Wendts' property and is constitutional. The trial court overruled\n   the Wendts' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court issued a second judgment entry on July 14, 2017 on counts one, two, and three. The only issue the trial court addressed in this judgment entry was whether the Wendts could establish a claim to mineral rights under the 2006 ODMA. The trial court first found the Wendts' claim fails under the 2006 ODMA because the mineral rights they sought were not legally \"dormant\" as provided in the 2006 ODMA because they were subject to a \"savings event\" of R.C. 5301.56(B)(3) during the preceding twenty years, the two affidavits recorded on February 28, 2011 for the transfer of real estate inherited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The trial court next found the Wendts' claims fail under the 2006 ODMA because they did not comply with the notice requirement of the 2006 ODMA as there is no evidence in the record the Wendts ever attempted certified mail service or completed certified mail service before they served the Dickersons by publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Finally, the trial court found the Wendts' claims fail in light of the Ohio Supreme Court's case of\n   <em>\n    Dodd v. Croskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353710\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/293/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2362\">\n    2015-Ohio-2362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%20147\">\n    37 N.E.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that a mineral-interest holder's claim to preserve filed pursuant to R.C. 5301.56(H)(1)(a) is sufficient to preclude the mineral interest from being deemed abandoned if filed within sixty days after the notice of the surface owner's intent to declare those interests abandoned. The trial court noted that on October 21, 2011, the Wendts recorded an affidavit of abandonment with the Harrison County Recorder's Office and, on October 11, 2011, published a notification of abandonment in the Steubenville Herald-Star newspaper. Further, on December 9, 2011, the Dickersons recorded two claims to preserve mineral interests and thus, the Dickersons properly preserved their mineral rights. The trial court concluded the Wendts had no legal right to invoke the relief sought in Counts one, two, and three under the 2006 ODMA. The trial court denied the Wendts' motion for summary judgment, granted the Dickersons' motion for summary judgment, and found the legal title to the mineral rights at issue quieted in favor of the Dickersons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Wendts filed an appeal of the June 2 and July 14, 2017 judgment entries of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas and assign the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"I.

Walker argued the dormant mineral interest was abandoned and had vested in him on March 22, 1992, pursuant to the 1989 ODMA; that the 1989 ODMA was self-executing; and that the application of the 2006 ODMA to an already abandoned and vested dormant mineral interest was a violation of the due process clause of the federal constitution.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the trial court did not err in finding the 2006 ODMA applies to this case and in determining the application of the 2006 ODMA against the Wendts does not violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Additionally, in this case, even if the 1989 ODMA did confer upon the Wendts a substantive right in a conclusive evidentiary presumption, the Wendts due process rights were not violated because their property rights never vested. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a right which is not absolute, \"but is dependent for its existence upon the action or inaction of another is not basic or vested, and deprivation thereof does not constitute a deprivation of property\" and if there is no deprivation of a vested property right, it is not necessary to discuss the question of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Hatch v.

In this case, any property rights the Wendts had never vested, as their action in common pleas court was not filed prior to the effective date of the 2006 ODMA on June 30, 2006, but instead was filed in 2012. Thus, the Wendts' due process rights were not violated because they had, at most, a contingent right that never vested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The Wendts also argue their Fifth Amendment rights were violated as a taking occurred regarding their property rights when the ODMA was amended in 2006.

The Dickersons argue that the Wendts' notice of abandonment should not have been served by publication or without explaining why service could not have been made by certified mail. The Wendts contend since the Dickersons admit to receiving actual notice of the filing of the notice of abandonment, any service error they made was harmless. The Dickersons contend the affidavits for transfer of real estate inherited were filed eight months prior to the notice of abandonment and they constitute a \"title transaction\" under R.C. 5301.47(F) and thus qualify as a \"savings event\" under R.C. 5301.56(B)(3)(a). The Wendts argue the affidavits of real estate inherited were not valid title transactions because they incorrectly describe the next-of-kin. However, we find neither of these issues to be dispositive in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Even if the Wendts fully complied with the 2006 ODMA notice requirements and even if the affidavits of real estate inherited do not qualify as a savings event under R.C. 5301.56(B)(3)(a), the Wendts' second assignment of error fails in light of several rulings from the Ohio Supreme Court, as the Dickersons timely filed claims to preserve in accordance with R.C. 5301.56(H)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The Wendts do not dispute the Dickersons timely recorded two Claims to Preserve Mineral Interests with the Harrison County Recorder in response to their notice; they instead argue that they may seek judicial confirmation of the conclusive presumption of abandonment, regardless of the filing of the claims to preserve, as there was no preserving event in the twenty (20) years prior to their serving of the notice.

Thus, the trial court did not err when it held the severed mineral interests at issue were not subject to judicial abandonment under R.C. 5301.56 and when it found title to the subject mineral rights in question should be quieted in favor of the Dickersons. The Wendts' second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Based on the foregoing, appellants' assignments of error are overruled.
