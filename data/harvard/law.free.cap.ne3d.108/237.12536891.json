Gallick, appeals judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas that affirmed decisions of the Franklin County Board of Revision (\"BOR\") and denied Gallick's motions for new trial. For the following reasons, we reverse some judgments and dismiss the appeals of other judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In July 2012, Gallick purchased two adjacent, identical apartment buildings located at 1688 and 1704 East Livingston Avenue in Columbus, Ohio (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the Livingston properties\"). Gallick bought the two buildings in a single sale and paid a total of $120,000. Each building contained 15 units, and each unit was assigned its own tax parcel number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} For tax years 2012 and 2013, the Franklin County Auditor (\"Auditor\") appraised the units at the following true values:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1688 East Livingston Avenue\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1704 East Livingston Avenue\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 22, 2013, Gallick filed multiple complaints with the BOR seeking a decrease in the valuation of each unit. Each complaint challenged the valuation of three units, resulting in 10 complaints (covering all 30 units). In response to each complaint, appellee, the Board of Education of the Columbus City School District (\"Board of Education\"), filed counter-complaints seeking no change in the Auditor's valuations. The BOR combined the complaints and counter-complaints, and it held a single hearing on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the April 10, 2014 hearing, Gallick testified and presented documentary evidence. Gallick explained that he had purchased the Livingston properties after a realtor informed him that the properties were on the market. Without asking the offering price, Gallick placed a bid of $120,000 for both buildings. The previous owner accepted the bid, and the closing occurred in July 2012. Gallick presented the BOR with copies of the conveyance fee statement and deed to prove the occurrence of the sale and the sale price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to Gallick, the true value of each unit was $4,000, which he arrived at by dividing the $120,000 purchase price equally between the two buildings, and then dividing $60,000 by 15, the number of units in each building. Gallick, who \"own[s] that whole block,\" also testified that $4,000 was \"the going price\" for apartment units in the area. (Tr. at 8, 14.) The Board of Education presented no evidence or argument regarding the Livingston properties at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In decisions issued June 13, 2014, the BOR accepted $4,000 as the true value of each unit for the 2012 tax year. However, the BOR retained the Auditor's valuation of each unit for the 2013 tax year. Gallick appealed the BOR's decisions as to the valuations for the 2013 tax year to the trial court pursuant to R.C. 5717.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Although the trial court did not consolidate all the appeals into one case, the majority of the appeals proceeded similarly. Gallick and the Board of Education filed virtually identical briefs in each appeal. In the appeals involving the units listed above, the trial court affirmed the decisions of the BOR. In some of the appeals, Gallick moved for a new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 59. With one exception, the trial court denied those motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We have eight appeals involving the Livingston properties before this\n   court: (1) appeal No. 15AP-233, which involves units A, B, and C of 1688 East Livingston Avenue; (2) appeal No. 16AP-392, which involves units D, E, and F of 1688 East Livingston Avenue; (3) appeal No. 15AP-837, which involves units G, H, and J of 1688 East Livingston Avenue; (4) appeal No. 15AP-182, which involves units K, L, and M of 1688 East Livingston Avenue; (5) appeal No. 15AP-190, which involves units N, P, and Q of 1688 East Livingston Avenue; (6) appeal No. 15AP-564, which involves units A, B, and C of 1704 East Livingston Avenue; (7) appeal No. 15AP-419, which involves units K, L, and M of 1704 East Livingston Avenue; and (8) appeal No. 16AP-393, which involves units N, P, and Q of 1704 East Livingston Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We consolidated the eight appeals. In his appellant's brief, Gallick assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [1.] The Board of Revision and the lower courts erred as a matter of law by failing to base their property tax valuations upon the recent arm's-length sale prices of Appellant's several properties when the arm's-length nature of the sales were not rebutted by the BOR or the Appellees, no new appraisal was conducted by the auditor, no significant improvements were made to the properties, and no other factors existed for the Auditor or the BOR to dramatically increase the property valuations notwithstanding the recency of the arm's-length sales, thus requiring a remand to the Board of Revision and an order for the BOR to revert back to the arm's-length sales prices for tax valuation purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [2.] The BOR and the lower courts erred by failing to take into account that the valuations by the auditor and decisions upholding same by the Board of Revision are not entitled to a presumption of validity when monumental increases in property valuations for all properties subject to this appeal were unsustainable as a matter of fact and law when the auditor failed to conduct a formal up-to-date appraisal, failed to provide any comparable sales data, and failed to substantiate that any significant improvements had been made to the several properties, warranting reversal to the BOR and Franklin County Auditor and a decrease in property valuations commensurate with the original purchase prices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [3.] The BOR and the lower courts erred as a matter of fact and law by applying the incorrect legal standard to Appellant's testimony and evidence presented to the BOR despite it being reliable, substantial and probative, by failing to shift the burden of proof to the BOR based upon Appellant's testimony, and by failing to render an independent judgment to determine the taxable value of the subject properties when there was no evidence and no new appraisal supporting the auditor's valuations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [4.] The lower courts abused their discretion by failing to allow Appellant's offer of additional evidence or at the very least ordering a hearing on the evidence, and a hearing on the merits of Appellant's claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [5.] The lower courts erred by denying, failing to conduct merit reviews, and failing to hold hearings on Appellant's motion for relief from judgment and motions for new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [6.] The current property taxation scheme violates due process because it fails to give meaningful notice to the taxpayer why property valuations are increased, fails to provide for reasons in decisions rendered by the BOR, and leaves courts on appeal to guess at why valuations occurred causing insufficient judicial review, leaving the taxpayer and\n   public guessing why and how valuations are rendered making it impossible to defend against the valuation thus placing an improper burden of proof against the taxpayer and an improper presumption that the auditor's valuation is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Before we begin our review of the merits of Gallick's assignments of error, we must determine which of his eight appeals are properly before this court. To do that, we must consider whether Gallick filed all of his appeals in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"An appeal as of right shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within the time allowed by Rule 4.\" App.R. 3(A). If an appellant fails to meet the timing requirements of App.R. 4, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re H.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/120/499/\">\n    120 Ohio St.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-6810\">\n    2008-Ohio-6810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20N.E.2d%20607\">\n    900 N.E.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17.

On the other hand, if the clerk timely complies with Civ.R. 58(B), then the 30-day appeal period begins to run on the date of the final order's entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} App.R. 4(B) sets forth some exceptions to the timing requirements of App.R. 4(A). Of relevance to this appeal, under App.R. 4(B)(2)(b), if a party files a \"timely and appropriate\" motion for a new trial under Civ.R. 59, \"then the time for filing a notice of appeal from the judgment or final order in question begins to run as to all parties when the trial court enters an order resolving\" the motion. Importantly, in order for a party to benefit from the tolling effect of App.R. 4(B)(2)(b), the motion for a new trial cannot be untimely filed or inappropriate under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Besman v.

In each of these cases, the trial court entered a final order affirming the BOR's decision. On same day as the entry of each final order, the clerk served notice of that order on the parties and noted service on the docket as required by Civ.R. 58(B). Thus, under App.R. 4(A), Gallick had 30 days from the date of each final order's entry to file his notice of appeal. Gallick, however, failed to file notices of appeal within the 30-day period. Instead, in each case, he moved for a new trial. In all three cases, Gallick only filed a notice of appeal after the trial court denied him a new trial. To the extent that Gallick seeks to appeal the\n   judgments affirming the BOR's decisions, these notices of appeal are only timely if the App.R. 4(B)(2)(b) exception extends the filing deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Whether or not Gallick may claim an extension based on App.R. 4(B)(2)(b) depends on whether his motions for new trial were appropriate under the circumstances. This determination, in turn, requires this court to consider two issues: (1) whether Civ.R. 59, which governs motions for new trial, applies to appeals initiated under R.C. 5717.05, the statutory basis for Gallick's appeals of the BOR's decisions to the trial court, and (2) whether Gallick filed his motions after trials had occurred in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} With few exceptions, the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure \"prescribe the procedure to be followed in all courts of this state in the exercise of civil jurisdiction at law or in equity.\" Civ.R. 1(A). However, \"to the extent that [the rules] would by their nature be clearly inapplicable,\" they do not apply to procedure in \"special statutory proceedings.\" Civ.R. 1(C)(8). Because Civ.R. 1(C)(8) only exempts the application of a procedural rule if it is \"clearly inapplicable,\" the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure apply in special statutory proceedings adversary in nature unless a good and sufficient reason exists not to apply to the rules.\n   <em>\n    Hambuechen v. 221 Mkt.

By his first assignment of error, Gallick argues that the trial court erred in ignoring the arm's-length sale that occurred five and one-half months prior to the tax lien date.

The Board of Education points to Gallick's testimony before the BOR as evidence of its contention. During the April 10, 2014 BOR hearing, Gallick testified about the sale prices of properties located near the subject properties that he purchased in arm's-length transactions dating from April 2008 to the hearing date. Gallick stated, \"You can see-Actually, the value of the properties went down. I mean, the most-the newer-the most recent properties I'm buying, I'm buying cheaper than the ones I bought in '08 and '09.? (Tr. at 5.) Later in the hearing, Gallick represented, \"And I'm telling you right now the value of properties have gone down in '11 and '12 and '13 from where they were in '10. * * * The market's down. I may contract for properties now that are even lower than 4,000 a unit.\" (Tr. at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Thus, Gallick testified to a general downward trend in market prices from 2008 and 2014, and a drop in the market between 2010 and 2011/2012/2013. However, for our purposes, the relevant period is between July 16, 2012 and January 1, 2013. Gallick did not state that market conditions changed during that specific span of time, much less that the market changed so rapidly that a sale that occurred only five and one-half months prior to the tax lien date could no longer evince true value. Testimony of a downward trend in the market over seven years is not evidence that the market rapidly dropped between July 16, 2012 and January 1, 2013. Consequently, Gallick's testimony regarding the condition of the marketplace does not rebut the presumptions that the sale price met all the requirements of true value and best reflected the true value of the Livingston properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Next, the Board of Education reverses course and eschews its contention that the Livingston properties' value dropped. It, instead, argues that rising tenancy levels and a \"clean up\" of the properties raised the value of the properties such that the July 16, 2012 sale cannot be considered recent to the January 1, 2013 tax lien date. However, again, the evidence the Board of Education relies on does not support its argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 35} At the BOR hearing, the Board of Education's attorney asked Gallick, \"And how's your occupancy been since your purchase?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Did it increase any?\" (Tr. at 9.) Gallick answered, \"It's increased a little.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20N.E.2d%20312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Gallick testified that the number of tenants at the Livingston properties rose between the July 16, 2012 sale and the April 10, 2014 hearing, and not that the number of tenants rose between the July 16, 2012 sale and the January 1, 2013 tax lien date. Moreover, Gallick did not quantify the increase by stating how many more tenants he now has. Assuming that an increase in tenancy occurred between July 16, 2012 and January 1, 2013, the evidence regarding that increase is too meager to prove that the tenancy level affected the value of the properties between the two relevant dates. Consequently, evidence regarding the tenancy level does not rebut the presumptions regarding true value that arose when Gallick adduced evidence of the July 2012 sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 36} With regard to the physical condition of the Livingston properties, the Board of Education's attorney asked Gallick, \"Can you tell us a little about what condition [the properties] were in and whether any of them needed any improvements or repairs after your purchase[?]\" (Tr. at 5.) Gallick responded that, \"[b]y and large, they just needed cleaning up.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20N.E.2d%20312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The attorney then asked, \"So none of them required any kind of capital or structural updates or improvements?\" (Tr. at 6.) Gallick replied, \"No.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20N.E.2d%20312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Pursuant to R.C. 5713.03(B), the sale price in an arm's-length transaction cannot be the true value of the property if, subsequent to the sale, \"[a]n improvement is added to the property.\" With respect to buildings or structures, an \"improvement\" is \"a permanent addition, enlargement, or alteration that, had it been constructed at the same time as the building or structure, would have been considered a part of the building or structure.\" R.C. 5701.02(D) (setting forth definitions of certain terms used in R.C. Chapter 57). Consequently, ameliorative measures such as replacing carpet and repainting do not constitute improvements that preclude a sale price from reflecting the true value of property.\n   <em>\n    Cattell v.

It is clear, however, that Gallick did not go so far as to perform the type of improvements contemplated in R.C. 5713.03(B). Thus, that provision does not bar the use of the sale price to set the true value of the Livingston properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Nevertheless, even if post-sale enhancements do not qualify as improvements, they could conceivably change a property sufficiently to affect the recency of a sale. Here, however, the Board of Education fails to direct us to any evidence that Gallick performed any \"clean up\" between July 16, 2012 and January 1, 2013 or, assuming a \"clean up\" occurred, the degree to which the properties were \"cleaned up.\" Without more detail regarding the \"clean up,\" the record lacks proof that the \"clean up\" was so significant that it altered the value of the properties. Thus, evidence related to the \"clean up\" does not rebut the presumptions regarding true value that arose when Gallick presented evidence of the July 2012 sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The Board of Education has only ever argued the lack of recency to rebut the presumptions at issue. Nevertheless, in appeal Nos. 16AP-392 and 16AP-393, the trial court determined that the July 2012 sale did not qualify as an arm's-length transaction. We, therefore, must consider whether the record contains evidence of the nature of the transaction that\n   negates the presumptions regarding true value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Three factors are relevant in deciding whether a transaction occurred at arm's length: (1) whether the sale was voluntary, i.e., without compulsion or duress; (2) whether the sale took place in an open market; and (3) whether the buyer and seller acted in their own self-interest.\n   <em>\n    Olentangy Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v.

Here, the trial court concluded that the July 2012 sale was not an arm's-length transaction because Gallick neither knew nor asked the seller's listing price before Gallick offered to buy the properties for $120,000. We do not see how Gallick's failure to find out the list price prior to placing an offer results in the conclusion that the sale was not at arm's length. Gallick's decision to place an offer without knowing the asking price is neither evidence of compulsion or duress, nor evidence that Gallick betrayed his own self-interest. Gallick testified that the prior owner placed the Livingston properties on the market, a realtor informed him that the properties were available for sale, he viewed the properties and decided to make an offer of $120,000, and the seller accepted his offer. These facts establish that the July 2012 sale was an arm's-length transaction. Consequently, evidence regarding the circumstances of the July 2012 sale do not rebut the presumptions regarding true value that arose when Gallick presented evidence of the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Where a rebuttable presumption exists, the party challenging the presumption must produce evidence that counterbalances the presumption or leaves the case in equipoise.\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Edn. of the Cleveland Mun.

Here, the Board of Education failed to produce such evidence. Consequently, the presumptions prevail, and thus, the July 2012 sale price constitutes the best evidence of the true value of the Livingston Avenue properties. Because Gallick established $4,000 as the true value of each unit for the purposes of tax year 2013, the trial court erred in affirming the BOR's decisions. Accordingly, we sustain Gallick's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 43} By the remaining assignments of error, Gallick either advances alternative bases for finding error in the affirmance of the BOR's decisions or seeks a hearing before the trial court to present evidence regarding the true value of the Livingston properties.
