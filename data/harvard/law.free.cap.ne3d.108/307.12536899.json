The rule provides: When, in violation of Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution, the State gains evidence by illegal means (i.e., an unreasonable search or seizure), it may not then use that evidence against the defendant. Through the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, we've extended the exclusionary rule to exclude evidence directly or derivatively obtained from the illegal conduct. This present case tests that rule's limits. Specifically, this case asks, as a matter of Indiana constitutional law, does an illegal seizure and search irreparably stain\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   derivative evidence the police gain afterwards, making it inadmissible under the exclusionary rule, or can the evidence be sufficiently separated from that primary taint to be admissible? In simpler terms, does the attenuation doctrine apply in Indiana constitutional law?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While the Court of Appeals previously confronted these questions-and split over the answers-they are novel questions for us that we answer today. We hold the attenuation doctrine can apply under the Indiana Constitution. Evidence found after an unreasonable search or seizure can become attenuated from that illegality, meaning the evidence itself or the circumstances in which the evidence was discovered were sufficiently distinguishable or separated from the search or seizure. In this particular case, we find the challenged evidence-the defendant's statements to law enforcement-were amply attenuated from the illegal search. We, therefore, affirm the defendant's child-molestation convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant David Wright lived with his best friend's young family in an apartment located at 220 East Water Street in Hartford City, Indiana. Wright and the family were home on the afternoon of Friday, January 22, 2016, when the FBI and Indiana State Police SWAT, in the course of a federal child pornography investigation, knocked on the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based upon information that an IP address located and billed to 220 \u00bd East Water Street, Hartford City, Indiana, accessed known child pornography websites, FBI Special Agent Jeffrey Robertson secured a federal search warrant for the home. Upon arriving, Robertson realized the large home housed two smaller apartments, upstairs and downstairs units. The upstairs apartment's street address being 220 \u00bd East Water Street and the downstairs apartment's address being 220 East Water Street-Wright's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While searching the upstairs apartment and seizing the computer equipment therein, Agent Robertson learned both apartments shared the same internet connection, all occupants knew the password, and all occupants used the connection. Rather than securing a second search warrant for 220 East Water Street and instead of having 220's occupants sign written consent forms he kept in his vehicle, Robertson gave 220's occupants (including Wright) two options: (1) verbally consent to a search of their computer equipment, surrender those devices that day, and receive them back quickly; or (2) leave the residence and stay away until he secured and executed another federal search warrant. 220's occupants (including Wright) verbally consented to the search, handed over their computers, and provided Agent Robertson with their usernames and passwords.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Agent Robertson seized the equipment and searched them over the weekend. The\n   search-done by running software called OS Triage on the seized devices-revealed Wright's computer contained hash values matched to known child pornography images. Equipped with this information, Agent Robertson returned to the East Water Street apartments on Monday, January 25th, and released all the seized computer equipment, except Wright's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Wright inquired about his devices, Agent Robertson asked to speak with him privately, giving him the option of talking inside or outside the house. Wright chose to talk outside. Agent Robertson and Wright went to the former's car parked in front of the house. Agent Robertson sat in the driver's seat, Wright sat in the front passenger seat, and another officer sat in the backseat. Before beginning a conversation, Robertson told Wright the car was unlocked, and he could leave at any point. Agent Robertson informed Wright he was not under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Wright indicated he understood those warnings, Agent Robertson confronted him with the search results. He asked Wright if he used the TOR network\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to search for child pornography and Wright answered affirmatively. Agent Robertson informed Wright that standard protocol required him to conduct a forensic interview with any children living in the home \"just to make sure that no [sexual] contact has occurred.\" Wright then admitted having sexual contact with two children living in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With this disclosure, Agent Robertson immediately stopped the interview, exited the vehicle, and phoned Hartford City Police to report what Wright just told him. The police asked Robertson to place Wright under arrest and take him to the station. Robertson returned to the car, informed Wright he was now under arrest, and handcuffed him. After transporting Wright to the Hartford City Police Department, Robertson handed Wright over to Detective Cody Crouse, but he stuck around to sit through the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Crouse read Wright the standard\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Wright signed a waiver form and agreed to talk to Crouse. During that interview, Wright admitted to repeatedly molesting two children, W.S. (age 11) and F.S. (age 4) over a year's span, with the most recent sexual contact occurring within the last two weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State charged Wright with four counts of Level 1 felony child molesting: two counts for the sexual contact with W.S. and two counts for the sexual contact with F.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wright moved to suppress all evidence obtained from the FBI search and subsequent police interviews. Invoking the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution, Wright alleged he'd been illegally detained and searched. Specifically, he argued he did not give valid consent to search his computers because Agent Robertson failed to inform him that he had the right to refuse consent. Following a hearing on Wright's motion, the trial court granted in part, and denied in part. Finding that Wright's consent to the search proved invalid under both the federal and state constitutions, the trial court suppressed evidence obtained from searching Wright's computer\n   and electronic equipment. But the court denied suppression of Wright's statements to Agent Robertson and Detective Crouse, concluding they were sufficiently independent and attenuated from the illegal search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Wright's incriminating statements were admitted during the subsequent bench trial. The court found Wright guilty as charged, and, after identifying aggravators and mitigators, imposed an aggregate sixty-year sentence. The court deemed Wright a sexually violent predator and a credit restricted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wright appealed, arguing the trial court erred by only partially granting his suppression motion and by admitting his statements to law enforcement. He also argued his sixty-year sentence proved inappropriate since he had no criminal history, he admitted his crimes, he appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct, and he had been victimized as a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court of Appeals reversed Wright's convictions, holding the trial court improperly admitted Wright's confessions to Agent Robertson and Detective Crouse.\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Asking these questions helps courts examine the means by which police gained evidence following the initial illegality. When did police find the evidence? How much time passed between the illegality and securing the evidence? What intervening events occurred in that time frame? Did the police discover the evidence where the illegality occurred? How did the evidence present itself, through police action or through the defendant or through a third party? If answering these questions reveals the means of discovering the evidence were sufficiently separated from the illegal search or seizure by time, circumstances, location, and agency, then the link between the initial unreasonable search or seizure and the derivative evidence becomes sufficiently attenuated that the evidence is admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As we see it, by examining the causal chain between the illegality and the discovered evidence or looking at the totality of the circumstances, attenuation is the natural, reasonable limit to the exclusionary rule's fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indiana constitutional law embraces the attenuation doctrine.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Considering Indiana's unique constitution and our emphasis on reasonableness in the totality of the circumstances, we think the attenuation concept fits nicely within our jurisprudence. Indiana law has not endorsed a but-for exclusionary rule that automatically excludes all derivative evidence acquired from an illegal search or seizure. And the attenuation doctrine sets the outer limits for exclusion by tailoring the rule to its purpose-deterring police misconduct and defending Hoosiers' privacy rights. Today we hold the attenuation doctrine applies to claims challenging the reasonableness of a search or seizure under Article 1, Section 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Indiana's attenuation doctrine parallels the federal doctrine to the extent it considers the totality of the circumstances.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Having decided the attenuation doctrine applies to claims brought under Article 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution, we must determine how to evaluate if evidence is sufficiently distinguishable or attenuated from the illegal search or seizure to become admissible at trial. In other words, what should Indiana's attenuation doctrine look like?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus far, Indiana's exclusionary rule parallels the federal rule in three areas. First, the two rules share similar origins and histories.\n   <em>\n    Mers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11034665\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/482/778/#p782\">\n    482 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   782 n.6. Early iterations of the federal rule cited the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as bases for excluding illegally obtained evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11034665\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/482/778/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Indiana's nascent exclusionary rule relied upon the Indiana Constitution's counterparts: Article 1, Section 14 (self-incrimination) and Article 1, Section 11 (unreasonable searches and seizures).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11034665\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/482/778/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the rules already share two familiar exceptions. Like federal jurisprudence, Indiana law adopted the good-faith and\n   new-crime exceptions. Third, the federal and state exclusionary rules share the same prime purpose-deterring police from illegal conduct.\n   <em>\n    Membres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179858\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/889/265/#p273\">\n    889 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   273 (citing\n   <em>\n    Spillers\n   </em>\n   , 847 N.E.2d at 957 ) (\"Indiana search and seizure jurisprudence, like federal Fourth Amendment doctrine, identifies deterrence as the primary objective of the exclusionary rule.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Since Indiana's exclusionary rule compares to the federal rule, it reasons that our attenuation doctrine parallel (but not parrot) the federal exception. The theoretical and practical differences between Article 1, Section 11 and the Fourth Amendment prevent us from simply copying the federal rule. As we have said, the two provisions differ in both application and scope. Because Article 1, Section 11 hinges upon reasonableness considering the totality of the circumstances, this \"Indiana provision in some cases confers greater protections to individual rights than the Fourth Amendment affords.\"\n   <em>\n    Shotts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7233818\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/925/719/#p726\">\n    925 N.E.2d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These differences, however, do not demand a different attenuation test for Indiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Precisely because Indiana places as paramount what is reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and because the Indiana Constitution can offer more protection, it follows that Indiana's attenuation exception\n   <strong>\n    begin\n   </strong>\n   with the federal three-part test but not necessarily end there. An attenuation inquiry under Article 1, Section 11 will begin by considering three elements: (1) the timeline-particularly, the time elapsed between the illegality and the acquisition of the evidence; (2) the intervening circumstances-what, if any, intervening circumstances occurred in that time; and (3) the police misconduct. This third element, like the federal test, scrutinizes the purpose and egregiousness behind the official misconduct. It examines whether the police exploited the initial illegality to gain more evidence against the defendant and then whether \"the evidence came from the 'exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.' \"\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

We, therefore, see this three-part test as a good starting point for considering attenuation because it essentially looks at the totality of the circumstances. To be sure, the above test considers the entire timeline, what happens during that timeline, and scrutinizes the police's misconduct-which comports with Indiana's Article 1, Section 11 precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Wright's confessions were admissible evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning to these particular facts and applying the above totality-of-the-circumstances test, we find Wright's statements to Agent Robertson and Detective Crouse sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search that we will not exclude them. Specifically, the timing of Wright's statements, the intervening circumstances between the search and the statements, and the non-flagrant, non-exploitative police misconduct, amply attenuate the evidence from the illegal search and seizure. Wright's incriminating statements, therefore,\n   constituted admissible evidence at his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The timeline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A weekend passed between the illegal search and seizure. Agent Robertson took possession of Wright's computers on a Friday afternoon and Wright's incriminating statements came on the following Monday. He had two full days, free from police presence, to mull his options or decide what to say when Robertson returned. Yet he did not seek counsel from friends, family, or an attorney. Wright did not have to make a split-second decision on whether to speak with police; he had the benefit of time. His confessions cannot be attributed to mid-search nervous ramblings. Wright's statements were temporally detached from the illegality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The intervening circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Much happened between the search and Wright's confessions. Wright initiated a conversation with law enforcement by inquiring into when he would get back his computer equipment. Though not under arrest, he voluntarily spoke with Agent Robertson. And, without being asked, Wright admitted that he had sexual contact with W.S. and F.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Only after this disclosure did Agent Robertson formally arrest Wright and take him to the Hartford City Police Department. There Wright received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings (both written and oral) and waived\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Then he participated in a voluntary discussion with Detective Crouse where he admitted to the molestations. These are compelling intervening circumstances supporting attenuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The police misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The police did not commit flagrant misconduct here or exploit the illegal search. Based on his testimony at the suppression hearing, Agent Robertson believed he presented Wright with two constitutional options: give verbal consent or wait for a federal search warrant. In fact, he testified that FBI procedure allowed him to get either written or verbal consent to a warrantless search. Although he thoroughly discussed the two options with 220's occupants, Agent Robertson failed to inform them (and Wright) that they could refuse consent. That omission prompted the trial court to suppress the evidence from the search. While we certainly don't condone Robertson's oversight, especially when he had consent forms in his vehicle, his failure to tell Wright he could refuse consent does not strike us as flagrant misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   What's more, this record does not suggest the police manipulated Wright's invalid consent to search his computers in order to coerce him into confessing to child molestation. Agent Robertson arrived at Wright's home in the course of a federal child-pornography investigation. He did not suspect Wright to be a child molester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When Agent Robertson spoke with Wright on the Monday following the search and seizure, he took pains to make sure Wright understood he was not under arrest and not required to talk to him. He allowed Wright to choose where they spoke. Once in the car, he reminded Wright the car doors were unlocked, and Wright could stop the conversation and leave at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Only after Wright admitted to having child pornography on his computers did Agent Robertson say that FBI protocol required him to speak to any children living in the home. He did not ask Wright if he had any sexual contact with the children, but Wright voluntarily confessed to the molestations. Robertson immediately ended the interview and sought direction\n   from local police because his federal investigation just gained a state layer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Upon taking custody of Wright, the Hartford City Police behaved reasonably. The record does not suggest Detective Crouse exploited the illegal search. Detective Crouse\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   Wright and obtained a written waiver from him before interviewing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Considering the totality of the circumstances-the timeline, the intervening circumstances, and the police misconduct-we conclude that Wright's confessions were sufficiently attenuated from the unreasonable search so as to be purged of the primary taint. There was a meaningful time gap between the search and Wright's confessions during which he had no further contact with law enforcement. Once he did encounter law enforcement again, Wright voluntarily spoke with Agent Robertson and Detective Crouse and disclosed he molested two children. And scrutinizing the police conduct here shows that law enforcement did not flagrantly flout Wright's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and the police did not exploit that illegal search to secure his confessions. Accordingly, Wright's statements amounted to admissible evidence, and the trial court rightly admitted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Wright's 60-year sentence is not inappropriate.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Since it reversed the convictions, the Court of Appeals did not address Wright's argument that his sixty-year sentence proved inappropriate considering his crime and character. Wright requested we revise his sentence downward to thirty years and the State countered by asking us to revise the sentence upward to 120 years. Having granted transfer and taking jurisdiction over this matter, we are duty-bound to address these arguments now. Ind. Const. art. 7, \u00a7 6 (guaranteeing the right to one appeal); Ind. Crim.

He argued his character alone merited a lesser sentence; specifically, Wright noted he had no criminal history, he admitted his crimes, he appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct, and he had been victimized as a child. We find these reasons unconvincing, especially in light of the crimes he committed. Over the course of a year, Wright repeatedly molested two of his best friend's young children. He occasionally filmed himself abusing four-year-old F.S. and showed it to eleven-year-old W.S. During this time Wright also viewed and downloaded child pornography. No positive character traits, no matter how admirable or sympathetic, can redeem these crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The State rightly points out that our constitutional authority to review and revise criminal sentences under Article 7, Section 4 also includes the power to\n   <strong>\n    increase\n   </strong>\n   a defendant's sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimbrough v.

But we decline to exercise that power here. Wright's sixty-year sentence essentially\n   amounts to a life-sentence for this thirty-three-year-old credit restricted felon. Even though Wright committed unspeakable crimes against children, we think his sixty-year sentence not inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Today we hold that the Indiana Constitution embraces the attenuation doctrine. In our view, the attenuation concept settles well into Indiana's distinctive constitutional landscape since it essentially considers what is reasonable given the totality of the circumstances. By grafting the attenuation doctrine onto our Article 1, Section 11 jurisprudence we fix it as the reasonable, natural limit to the exclusionary rule. In application, our attenuation test will begin by examining the timeline between the illegality and finding the derivative evidence, the intervening circumstances occurring over that timeline, and the initial police misconduct. But if other circumstances arise strengthening or weakening attenuation, then they must also be considered. Applying this test here, we conclude Wright's statements to law enforcement were sufficiently attenuated from the illegal search so as to be purged of the original taint and these were admissible at trial. We, therefore, affirm Wright's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David, Massa, and Slaughter, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Agent Robertson testified that \"TOR\" stands for The Onion Router.
