For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} ECOT initiated this case on June 14, 2017 seeking to invalidate a decision made by BOE at its June 12, 2017 public meeting. ECOT alleged violations of Ohio's Open Meetings Act (\"OMA\"), codified at R.C. 121.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} ECOT is the largest of Ohio's community based schools, and specifically is an internet or computer based community school as defined in R.C. 3314.02(A)(7). As a public school, ECOT receives funding from the state of Ohio based on the number of full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") students enrolled in the school. R.C. 3314.08(C) ;\n   <em>\n    Elec.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Classroom of Tomorrow v. Ohio Dept. of Edn.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 16AP-863,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549300\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1269/\">\n    2017-Ohio-5607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202814002\">\n    2017 WL 2814002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Previously, the Ohio Department of Education (\"ODE\") had determined that ECOT owed the state money for FTE funding overpayments for the 2015-2016 school year. A community school that disagrees with ODE's determination on funding has a right to an appeal to the BOE or its designee. R.C. 3314.08(K)(2)(a). ECOT disputed ODE's finding and appealed the determination to a BOE designee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Under R.C. 3314.08(K)(2)(b), \"[t]he board or its designee shall conduct an informal hearing on the matter within thirty days of receipt of such an appeal and shall issue a decision within fifteen days of the conclusion of the hearing.\" After notice to the parties, a hearing officer conducted a 10-day hearing in which ECOT introduced more than 2,000 exhibits. On May 10, 2017, the hearing officer issued a 100-plus page report recommending recovery\n   of over $60 million owed to the state of Ohio by ECOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Under R.C. 3314.08(K)(2)(c), \"[i]f the board has enlisted a designee to conduct the hearing, the designee shall certify its decision to the board. The board may accept the decision of the designee or may reject the decision of the designee and issue its own decision on the matter.\" Under R.C. 3314.08(K)(2)(d), any decision made by the BOE on the appeal is final. The hearing officer's recommendation was slated for a final determination by BOE at its June 12, 2017 public meeting. Notice of the meeting had been published on the BOE website on June 8, 2017. Included in the agenda for the meeting was consideration of a resolution regarding the hearing officer's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} ECOT submitted 140 pages of objections to the hearing officer's report and recommendation. ODE's chief legal counsel indicated, by means of a letter, that the BOE would consider ECOT's objections at its next regularly scheduled meeting in which it would take up the hearing officer's report. BOE conducted its June 12, 2017 meeting as scheduled. BOE went into executive session to discuss personnel cases and pending or immediate legal action. After emerging from executive session, the chief legal counsel for ODE gave a presentation about BOE's consideration of a resolution to accept the decision of the hearing officer (\"ECOT resolution\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After further presentations on unrelated topics, the discussion returned to the ECOT resolution, and BOE spent nine minutes formally deliberating the ECOT resolution. The bulk of the discussion concerned whether the amount for recovery should be approximately $60 million or $64 million. BOE then voted to adopt the hearing officer's recommendation to recover $60,350,791 owed by ECOT. Public comment followed the vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Two days later, on June 14, 2017, ECOT filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The first amended complaint alleged three violations of the OMA. On June 28, 2017, BOE filed an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C) in which it argued that ECOT's claims under the OMA were barred for two reasons. First, BOE argued that the pleadings demonstrated that it did comply with the requirements of the OMA. Second, BOE argued that the hearing process afforded to ECOT was quasi-judicial in nature, and that the requirements of R.C. 121.22 do not apply to quasi-judicial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings after finding ECOT had failed to state a viable claim under the OMA. The trial court concluded the procedure outlined in R.C. 3314.08(K) was quasi-judicial in nature and, therefore, its deliberations that led to the decision were quasi-judicial in nature and not within the purview of R.C. 121.22. (July 12, 2017 Decision and Entry at 14, 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} ECOT has alleged that BOE violated the OMA in three ways. In Count I of the amended complaint, ECOT claims that BOE violated the OMA by unlawfully deliberating and substantively discussing the ECOT resolution in a closed executive session or in serial communications designed to avoid the need for public discussion. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 55.) In Count II of the amended complaint, ECOT alleges that BOE violated the OMA by conducting an improper executive session to discuss the ECOT resolution because none of the statutory exceptions allowing for such a discussion apply. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 58.) And in Count III of the amended complaint, ECOT claims that BOE violated the OMA by failing to provide reasonable notice of its public meeting. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} BOE has countered these arguments in two ways. First, BOE contends that ECOT has failed to present a viable claim that BOE violated the OMA. Second, BOE argues that it was exempt from the purview of the OMA because the actions taken by BOE at the June 12, 2017 meeting were part of a quasi-judicial proceeding leading to a quasi-judicial determination and thus outside the purview of R.C. 121.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} It is undisputed that the June 12, 2017 meeting of the BOE was a public meeting within the meaning of the OMA. The question is whether the portion of the meeting dealing with the ECOT resolution was exempt from the requirements of the OMA. BOE argues that a hearing officer presided over a 10-day hearing, notice of the hearing was provided to all prior to the hearing, and ECOT participated and presented over 2,000 exhibits related to the matter. After submission of the 100-page report, BOE contends that it was engaging in a quasi-judicial function when it decided whether to adopt the hearing officer's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trustees of the Tobacco Use Prevention &amp; Control Found. v.

The\n   <em>\n    requirement\n   </em>\n   of conducting a quasi-judicial hearing is the key point of exercising that authority.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Scherach v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090111\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/123/245/\">\n    123 Ohio St.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-5349\">\n    2009-Ohio-5349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=915%20N.E.2d%20647\">\n    915 N.E.2d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23 (fact that board of elections held a protest hearing resembling a judicial trial even though not required to do so did not constitute the exercise of quasi-judicial authority).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n   <em>\n    Zeigler\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant case in that in\n   <em>\n    Zeigler\n   </em>\n   , there was no statute that required the board of commissioners to conduct a hearing before it removed Zeigler from office, whereas here the statute expressly provides for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Here, the statute in question provides for an informal hearing before the board or its designee. R.C. 3314.08(K)(2)(b) expressly provides for a hearing, and it is undisputed that ECOT was afforded the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. ECOT availed itself of that opportunity during a 10-day evidentiary hearing in which it introduced more than 2,000 exhibits. By issuing its final determination after providing notice, a hearing, and the opportunity to provide evidence, BOE was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} ECOT further argues that BOE's final determination to adopt the ECOT resolution was a policy decision, not a quasi-judicial determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Here, the statute lays out a procedure for an appeal from a determination that a community school owes money to the state. R.C. 3314.08(K) provides, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If the review results in a finding that the community school owes moneys to the state, the following procedure shall apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) Within ten business days of the receipt of the notice of findings, the community school may appeal the department's determination to the state board of education or its designee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) The board or its designee shall conduct an informal hearing on the matter within thirty days of receipt of such an appeal and shall issue a decision within fifteen days of the conclusion of the hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (c) If the board has enlisted a designee to conduct the hearing, the designee shall certify its decision to the board. The board may accept the decision of the designee or may reject the decision of the designee and issue its own decision on the matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (d) Any decision made by the board under this division is final.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} As can be seen from a plain reading of the statute, BOE is not required to conduct the hearing itself, but can enlist a designee. Then BOE considers the evidence and the report and recommendation of the hearing officer, much as a trial court acts on the report and recommendation of a magistrate. BOE's determination is the final step in the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As such, it is part of a quasi-judicial proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Finally, ECOT argues that BOE is bound by a letter written by the chief legal counsel for the ODE in which counsel stated that the statutory provision at issue is not listed in the BOE's policies and procedures manual as one of the department's quasi-judicial determinations, is not subject to R.C. Chapter 119, and is therefore not an adjudication under R.C. Chapter 119. The chief legal counsel then stated, \"Thus it is not at all clear that Board review of a decision from an 'informal hearing' under R.C. 3314.08(K) constitutes a 'quasi-judicial' determination as that term is used in those Department reference materials.\" (May 19, 2017 Letter at 2, Ex. A to First Am. Compl.) The letter goes on to state that even if a BOE review of the hearing officer's decision is a quasi-judicial determination as that term is used in those reference materials, ECOT would not have the right to appear in person at the BOE meeting to present additional evidence or testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} This letter is not an admission as ECOT asserts. The legal counsel presented alternative possibilities, but the question of whether the proceeding was quasi-judicial is one of law for the court. The subject matter of the letter had to do with whether BOE's review of the hearing officer's decision was subject to R.C. Chapter 119. The letter was not an admission that the process was not quasi-judicial but, instead, dealt with what procedures would be followed at the June 12, 2017 meeting. Whether ECOT could appeal the BOE decision to the court of common pleas under R.C. Chapter 119 is not relevant to the issue of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Because we have determined that the proceeding before BOE was quasi-judicial, we need not address the BOE's remaining arguments that they fully complied with the OMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Based on the foregoing, we overrule the assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   SADLER and BRUNNER JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
