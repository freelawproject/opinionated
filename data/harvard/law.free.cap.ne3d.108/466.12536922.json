L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Quigley has been charged in the District Court with several motor vehicle offenses. He filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the police failed to file the citations with the court in a timely manner, as required by G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2. The motion was denied after an evidentiary hearing, and Quigley's petition ensued. We affirm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The case is before us pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n    434 Mass. 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), which requires a party challenging an interlocutory ruling of the trial court to \"set forth the reasons why review of the trial court decision cannot adequately be obtained on appeal from any final adverse judgment in the trial court or by other available means.\" S.J.C. Rule 2:21 (2). Quigley has not met his burden under the rule. \"The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is not appealable until after trial, and we have indicated many times that G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, may not be used to circumvent that rule. Unless a single justice decides the matter on the merits or reserves and reports it to the full court, neither of which occurred here, a defendant cannot receive review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, from the denial of his motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734988,734975\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/1008/\">\n    437 Mass. 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1009,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20N.E.2d%20469\">\n    770 N.E.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), and cases cited.
