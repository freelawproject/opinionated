The arrest report and probable cause affidavit stated that, on or about August 28, 2016, appellant's wife (Carrie) reported to the Circleville Police Department that her two daughters, K.F. (DOB 3/22/03) and R.F. (DOB 6/20/00), disclosed to her that appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse with them since the age of nine. The affidavit further alleged that appellant caused physical harm, or threatened to cause physical harm or death, to them by hitting or threatening to kill while brandishing a handgun. The affidavit further noted that the last date of this activity occurred on July 17, 2016, while at their Pickaway County residence. Furthermore, R.F. reported that appellant is the biological father of her child (DOB 2/20/15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 9, 2016, a Pickaway County Grand Jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with (1) four counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and (2) five counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2). Appellant pled not guilty and requested a competency evaluation. Subsequently, the trial court found appellant competent to stand trial and granted the state's two motions to amend the indictment to correct typographical errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At trial, Carrie testified that on August 28, 2016 she learned from her daughters that appellant had been having sexual relations with them for several years. When she confronted appellant, he told her \"How can you dare say that I'm doing that? You do what you need to do. I have done nothing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After filing a report, Carrie took the girls to Columbus Children's Hospital for examination and left her other children at home in her mother's care. Appellant also remained in the home due to his medical condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Shortly thereafter, officers arrived at the home to either assist Carrie in leaving with her children or asking appellant to leave the home. Carrie also advised officers that appellant might have a firearm. When officers entered the home, appellant refused to drop his weapon. An officer then tased appellant and transported him to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} During the trial, Carrie testified that she, appellant, their children and her mother had lived at multiple Ohio residences. The family lived in Blacklick (Franklin County) until March 2006, moved to Chillicothe (Ross County) until 2012, moved to Stoutsville (Fairfield County) from August 2012 through October 2013, resided with Carrie's mother in Circleville (Pickaway County) from October 2013 until January 2014, and lived with appellant's mother in Wellston (Jackson County), then returned to Pickaway County in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.F. testified that she remembered being raped in the Blacklick home and at each home in which the family lived. K.F. also testified that appellant began to abuse her when she was 8 or 9 years old, and that she, too, had been molested in each home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The evidence also revealed that on February 20, 2015, R.F. gave birth to a daughter. Based on indications that the child could be the product of sexual abuse, officers obtained a search warrant for appellant's DNA. After submitting appellant's DNA, along with samples from both R.F. and her daughter, for analysis, Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Information (BCI) forensic scientist Michael Monfredi testified about the DNA analysis and stated that (1) appellant could not be excluded as the father of the child, (2) the evidence is 2,734,000 times more characteristic of appellant being the biological father than a random man, and (3) a 99.9999% probability exists that the child is appellant's biological child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Carrie also testified that she delivered appellant's laptop computer to Detective Roar. Carrie stated that her mother had actually purchased the laptop for her, but appellant used it almost exclusively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on consent from Carrie and her mother, as well as a search warrant, Detective Roar's computer forensic analysis revealed multiple photographs that depicted suicide methods, as well as a document regarding the strengths and weaknesses of children's memories and how children can make false accusations. In addition, Detective Roar located a file that appeared to be a suicide note. In terms of a time frame, Detective Roar testified that the document about children's memories and false accusations was downloaded on August 28, 2016 at 8:47 p.m., the suicide images downloaded between 11:20 p.m. and 11:47 p.m., and the suicide note created around 11:45 p.m. Circleville Police Department Officer Kenneth Fisher testified that on August 28, 2016, officers arrived at the Ferguson home at 11:51 p.m., that Carrie arrived home from Children's Hospital at 12:30 a.m., and officers entered the home at 12:36 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Concerning the suicide note, Detective Roar testified that the note states: \"I have decided to commit suicide. I follow bushido.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I will follow my teacher Musashi, in to ensure my family's honor. I shot myself in the head with a-There's just a period there. I also planned a provoked response from the police. Thank you if you helped me as I had this is not a cry for help. I am not depressed. I simply wish to depart in an honorable to my wife I will always love and be with you. To my children I love you all. I am sorry we didn't have more time together. To the rest of my family I love all of you. This is something I have considered for a very long time. Rationally and with great care I must do this. Skip.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 7, 2017, after considering the evidence adduced at trial, the jury found appellant guilty of counts one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, and nine, but not guilty on count five. Subsequently, the trial court (1) adjudicated appellant a tier III sex offender, (2) sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count three due to the special finding that the victim was under age ten at the time of the offense, and (3) sentenced appellant to serve 11 years on count one, 11 years on count two, 11 years on count four, 11 years on count six, 11 years on count seven, 11 years on count eight, and 11 years on count nine, with all sentences to be served consecutively to one another. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Because all of the assignments of error raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, we first discuss the applicable standard of review.

Appellant argues that the fact that another unknown BCI forensic person performed a portion of the testing procedure and was not subject to cross-examination constitutes ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At trial, BCI forensic scientist Michael Monfredi, defined DNA and explained the process of a DNA comparison. Monfredi stated that he did much of the comparison work on the samples collected from appellant, his daughter, and her child. Monfredi also testified about how the BCI testing process is \"technically reviewed, meaning that another qualified forensic scientist looked at all of the information from the laboratory, looks for the comparisons that I have made in the case, and makes their report, and makes their own conclusions based on all that information. And if our conclusion differs in any way, then we discuss that review process. That didn't happen in this case.\" Monfredi testified that appellant could not be excluded as the biological father of R.F.'s child, and that a 99.9999% probability exists that appellant is the biological father of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant argues that because Monfredi did not personally perform every step of the procedure, and further described a process that included other BCI staff, this procedure violates appellant's constitutional right to confront witnesses because other participants in the process did not appear in court to testify, and Monfredi did not state with precision what actions the other scientists performed. Monfredi detailed his participation in the analysis, such as examining the three known standards and comparing the profiles that other scientists created. Appellant also points out that trial counsel did not object to this testimony, or challenge the evidence through any pre-trial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,\n   <em>\n    Pointer v.

The state contends that appellant's trial counsel's candid and realistic statements enhanced defense credibility with the jury and focused the jury's attention on the portion of the case that appellant actually contested. We recognize that the record does reveal that defense counsel continued to argue against convictions on the other eight counts of the indictment, as well as the special findings in counts one through three concerning the victims' ages.

Rather, Count seven carried a maximum sentence of eleven years.
