INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The California Plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seek relief from the actual and/or threatened contamination of their water supply with the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d). Plaintiffs assert, among others, causes of action under California Civii Code \u00a7 1882.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants now move to dismiss the section 1882 claims, arguing that the provision does not apply to the alleged contamination of water. In addition, defendants move to strike plaintiffs\u2019 prayers for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to section 1882.2 of the California Civil Code and section 1021.5 of the California .Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 motion is granted for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b484-18\">A. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b484-19\">Under Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss should be granted only if \u201c \u2018it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim which would entitle [it] to relief.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the motion to dismiss stage, the issue \u201c \u2018is not whether a plaintiff is likely to prevail ultimately, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims. Indeed it may' appear on the face of the pleading that a recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the test.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The task of the .court in ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \u201cmerely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When deciding a motion to dismiss, courts must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">B. Motion to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) permits the Court to \u201corder stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Courts are generally \u201cvery reluctant to determine disputed or substantial issues of law on a motion to strike.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A motion to strike on the ground that the matter is impertinent and immaterial should be denied \u201c \u2018unless it can be shown that no evidence in support of the allegation would be admissible.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cImmaterial\u201d matter is that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief, and \u201cimpertinent\u201d material consists of statements that do not pertain to, and are not necessary to resolve, the disputed issues.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">A. California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 1882-1882.6</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Section 1882.1 of the California Civil Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">A utility may bring a civil action for damages against any person who commits, authorizes, solicits, aids, abets, or attempts any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">(a) Diverts, or causes to be diverted, utility services by any means whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">(b) Makes, or causes to be made, any connection or reconnection with property owned or used by the utility to provide utility service without the authorization or consent of the utility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">(c) Prevents any utility meter, or other device used in determining the charge for utility services, from accurately performing its measuring function by tampering or by any other means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">(d) <em>Tampers with any property owned or used by the utility to provide utility services.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-17\">(e) Uses or receives the direct benefit of all, or a portion, of the utility service with knowledge of, or reason to believe that, the diversion, tampering, or unauthorized connection existed at the time of the use, or that the use or receipt, was without the authorization or consent of the utility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-18\">Section 1882 defines \u201ctamper\u201d as \u201cto rearrange, injure, alter, interfere with, or otherwise to prevent from performing normal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>or customary function.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The term \u201cutility service\u201d is defined as \u201cthe provision of electricity, gas, water, or any other service or commodity furnished by the utility for compensation.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be dismissed because section 1882.1 does not apply to the contamination of water. They contend that the statute\u2019s plain language and legislative history demonstrate that it addresses tampering with equipment used to provide utility services.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, they argue that the phrase \u201cproperty ... to provide utility services\u201d does not include groundwater, and that the word \u201ctamper\u201d does not encompass contamination of groundwater. According to defendants, plaintiffs are seeking redress for injuries to the water itself, rather than to \u201cproperty owned or used\u201d by them to provide that water.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Plaintiffs respond that groundwater constitutes \u201cproperty ... used to provide utility services\u201d because plaintiffs have usu-fructuary rights in the water pumped by their wells, and they \u201cuse\u201d it to deliver potable drinking water to consumers. Plaintiffs argue that defendants\u2019 characterization of the section 1882 claims as seeking a recovery for injury to the water itself, improperly conflates raw groundwater with the finished, treated, potable water that plaintiffs deliver to their customers\u2019 taps. In addition, they assert that contamination is covered by the term \u201ctamper\u201d because it constitutes \u201cinjury\u201d to, \u201calteration\u201d of and/or \u201cinterference\u201d with property under state law. Hence, the central dispute between the parties concerns the meaning of the words \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201ctamper\u201d as used in section 1882.1 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Under California law, in construing the meaning of a statute, courts \u201clook first to the words the Legislature used, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, then the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute. The meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible. [] Literal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The term \u201cproperty\u201d is not defined in section 1882, and plaintiffs\u2019 argument regarding its usufructuary rights cannot be dismissed out of hand. \u201cThe concept of property in California is extremely broad .... [and] is sufficiently comprehensive to include every species of estate, real and personal, and everything which one person can own and transfer to another....\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cOwnership is not a single concrete entity but a bundle of rights and privileges as well as of obligations.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe authorities in [California] have uniformly defined the right to appropriative water as a possessory property right.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, under a liberal interpretation of the word \u201cproperty,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 usufructuary rights would be covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Nonetheless, the term \u201cproperty\u201d cannot be interpreted in isolation. When read in conjunction with the rest of section 1882.1, it is plain that the word \u201cproperty\u201d in subsection (d) does not mean property rights, but rather the physical object to which those rights attach' \u2014 in this case, the instruments used to provide utility services <em>{e.g., </em>pipes, pumps, and meters). Subsection (d) prohibits tampering with any \u201cproperty <em>owned or used </em>by the utility....\u201d This \u201cproperty\u201d must be capable of both ownership and use because \u201cproperty\u201d cannot have one meaning when paired with \u201cowned\u201d and another when paired with \u201cused.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered definition is logical when coupled with the latter but not the former. While plaintiffs might exercise or \u201cuse\u201d their usufructuary rights to provide water to customers, they cannot \u201cown\u201d or have property rights in usufructuary rights. Moreover, subsection (d) is not the only place where the term \u201cproperty\u201d is employed. Subsection (b) also makes it actionable to connect or reconnect one\u2019s utility service with \u201cproperty owned or used by the utility....\u201d This use of the word \u201cproperty\u201d only makes sense with respect to tangible objects, and not legal rights. Finally, all the provisions of section 1882.1 relate to the unauthorized use of utility services. To read subsection (d) as including the right to sue for groundwater contamination would conflict with the rest of the statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">This construction comports with the statute\u2019s legislative history.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>1882-1882.6 were adopted as civil companion statutes to California Penal Code \u00a7 498, which makes the theft of utility services a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although state law criminalized energy diversion and meter tampering, \u201cexisting law [did] not authorize utilities to recover damages from individuals who [stole] energy or to obtain an injunction against prohibited practices.\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The purpose of Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 1882-1882.6 was \u201cto deter energy theft\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by \u201cestablish[ing] a civil procedure for utilities to recover damages.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Plaintiffs rely on the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Jennings,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that the legislative purpose does not affect or limit the broad reach of a statute\u2019s plain language. In that case, the defendant had served beer to a minor in his home, and the minor later caused a drunk driving accident. The defendant was convicted under a statute that prohibited the \u201cpurchase\u201d of an alcoholic beverage for a minor who thereafter proximately causes death or great bodily injury. The defendant argued that the statute did not apply to him because the legislature\u2019s primary concern in enacting the statute was to deter \u201cshoulder tapping\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>asking an adult in front of a liquor store to purchase alcohol for the minor). The California Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that \u201calthough the Legislature was focused on the shoulder tap scenario, the language of [the statute was] not so limited.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\"><em>In re Jennings </em>does not dictate a different result in this case. <em>First, </em>I have already determined that the plain language of the statute precludes plaintiffs\u2019 section 1882 claims based on groundwater contamination. <em>Second, In re Jennings </em>is distinguishable because in that case the legislature\u2019s overarching concern was the ease with which minors obtained alcoholic beverages. Shoulder tapping happened to be \u201c[o <em>]ne of the top ways </em>in which minors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>gain[ed] access to alcohol.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It was therefore reasonable for the court to determine that the statute applied to \u201cany situation in which an individual purchases alcoholic beverages for an underage person,\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> even though legislative discussions centered around a particular <em>method </em>of access <em>(ie., </em>shoulder tapping). An analogous situation here would occur if the general assembly\u2019s debate had focused on meter tampering, <em>i.e., </em>a means of energy theft, but the statute was worded more broadly. In any event, the legislative purpose here is to deter the theft of utility services \u2014 not to protect environmental resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The section 1882 claim of the <em>Silver </em>Plaintiffs is defective for the additional reason that only a \u201cutility\u201d may bring a civil action for damages under section 1882.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The <em>Silver </em>Plaintiffs allege that they \u201care owners of ... a mobile home park located in Alpine, California\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and that they \u201cown and operate a public water system which serves 152 mobile homes.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, \u201c[a]ny person ... that maintains a mobilehome park ... and provides, or will provide, water service to users through a submeter system is <em>not a public utility.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, the <em>Silver </em>Plaintiffs are specifically excluded from the definition of \u201cutility,\u201d and their section 1882 claim must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Permitting the California Plaintiffs\u2019 section 1882 claims to proceed on the basis of groundwater contamination would be contrary to both the plain meaning and legislative history of the statute. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Because these claims are dismissed, plaintiffs\u2019 corresponding requests for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to section 1882.2 are stricken under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>12(f).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">B. California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1021.5</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Section 1021.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure allows a court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAe\">award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.... With respect to actions involving public entities, this section applies to allowances against, but not in favor of, public entities, and no claim shall be required to be filed therefor, unless one or more successful parties and one or more opposing parties are public entities, in which case no claim shall be required to be filed therefor.... <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Defendants move to strike Plaintiff City of Fresno\u2019s prayer for attorneys\u2019 fees under section 1021.5 because plaintiff is a public entity suing private defendants. Although Fresno concedes that it cannot obtain attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to this section, it asks the Court to strike only that portion of the prayer referring to section 1021.5 and to modify the requested relief to read: \u201cReasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in prosecuting this action, and prejudgment interest, to the full extent permitted by law.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Fresno\u2019s fifth prayer for relief is stricken because plaintiff is not eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees under section 1021.5.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court declines to amend Fresno\u2019s complaint in the manner requested, as attorneys\u2019 fees are not normally recoverable in California,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and plaintiff may not invoke California Civil Code \u00a7 1882.2 as a statutory source for attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">For the reasons set forth above, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action under section 1882 and to strike plaintiffs\u2019 prayers for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees is granted. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close this motion. A conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. on June 9, 2005, in Courtroom 15C.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-11\">.
