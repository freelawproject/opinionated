Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APT\">The defendant, Ned Ladd Bobo, was arrested on June 5, 1968 and convicted of entering without breaking with intent to commit larceny in violation of 1931 PA 328, \u00a7 111, as amended by 1964 PA 133, \u00a71; MCLA 750.111; MSA 28.306. On June 26, 1972 the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The question before us as posed by defendant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\"Where an accused exercises his constitutional right to remain silent at the time of arrest, does the use of such silence against him at trial under the doctrine of impeachment by prior inconsistent statement constitute prejudicial error where he made no allegations on direct examination as to what was said or not said at the time of arrest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">We answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">When arrested by Detroit police officers Bobo exercised his constitutional right to remain silent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and made no statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">At his trial when testifying on his own behalf Bobo stated on direct examination that just prior to his being arrested near the scene of the crime two men presumably potential suspects, ran past him from the general area of the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Bobo was not asked by his counsel and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>volunteer whether or not he made any statement to the police officers. However, the prosecutor over timely objection by defense counsel was permitted by the court to ask Bobo on cross-examination if he had, at the time of his interrogation told the officer about the two men who had run past him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The court also permitted the prosecutor to remark during his closing argument to the jury that Bobo had said nothing to the police about two men running past him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The prosecutor urges that we allow the prosecution to impeach a defendant by questioning him about what was said or not said to the police at the time of arrest as part of the res gestae citing <em>People </em>v <em>Noble, </em>23 Mich App 100, 101; 178 NW2d 118, 119 (1970), or as an inconsistent \"nonutter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>anee\u201d, citing <em>People v Calhoun, </em>33 Mich App 141, 147; 189 NW2d 743, 746 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The use of a \"nonutterance\u201d as approved in <em>Calhoun </em>was analyzed and criticized by Justice Levin in his dissent in <em>People v McColor, </em>36 Mich App 455, 458-465; 194 NW2d 99-103 (1971). We can add nothing to his analysis and criticism except our endorsement and the observation that <em>Calhoun </em>conflicts with and must be regarded as overruled by <em>People v Graham, </em>386 Mich 452; 192 NW2d 255 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">We will not condone conduct which directly or indirectly restricts the exercise of the constitutional right to remain silent in the face of accusation. \"Nonutterances\u201d are not statements. The fact that a witness did not make a statement may be shown only to contradict his assertion that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">In <em>Graham, supra, </em>which was decided following the decision in <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971), we permitted the prosecution to cross-examine the defendant with respect to his silence at the time of arrest because the defendant testified on direct examination that he had repeatedly told the police at the time of arrest and while incarcerated that he wanted to explain the whole situation involved in his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">In <em>Graham, supra, </em>458, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">\"In our holding today, we stress that the defendant\u2019s refusal to speak during interrogation is admissible only to impeach his own inconsistent statements at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">In the present case on direct examination defendant gave no testimony whatsoever regarding any statement made to the police or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">On appeal the parties properly drew no distinction from the circumstance that the \"non-statement\u201d was made to the questioning officer rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>than the arresting officer. The prosecutor\u2019s counterstatement of questions involved is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\"Whether the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of <em>arrest silence </em>for impeachment?\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Here the defendant might well have considered himself to be under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Officer Berryman testified that while off duty after completing his shift, he was driving near the scene of the crime here involved. He observed a holdup in progress from which some suspects fled. Because he was but a block away he circled around and saw two men running through an alley. One of the men was defendant Ned Ladd Bobo. Believing them to be the suspects he had seen fleeing the holdup he stopped them at gun point and identified himself as a police officer. He asked them for identification and while he was checking their identification, Officer Selick came running up and two other officers came up in a car and Officer Selick placed the two men under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">What concerned the parties and what prompted our grant of leave was the propriety of using the fact of defendant\u2019s silence either as evidence of guilt or for the purpose of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Whether his silence was prior to or at the time of arrest makes little difference\u2014the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent is constant.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">In Michigan we have been committed to the doctrine since long before <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694; 10 ALR3d 974 (1966) that even in the face of specific accusation of a crime that an accused\u2019s silence may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>be used against him. In <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich 417; 285 NW 5 (1939), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\"The time has not yet come when an accused must cock his ear to hear every damaging allegation against him and, if not denied by him, have the statement and his silence accepted as evidence of guilt. There can be no such thing as confession of guilt by silence in or out of court. The unanswered allegation by another of the guilt of a defendant is no confession of guilt on the part of a defendant. Defendant, if he heard the statement, was not morally or legally called upon to make denial or suffer his failure to do so to stand as evidence of his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">If silence in the face of specific accusation may not be used, it would be a strange doctrine indeed that would permit silence absent such an accusation to be used as evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">It is unimportant whether the accuser be a police officer or not. Manifestly whenever a person is stopped for interrogation by the police, whether technically under arrest or not, the Fifth Amendment guarantees that his silence may not be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s reliance on <em>Noble, supra, </em>as authority for admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s silence as part of the res gestae seems misplaced. <em>Noble </em>held that a complainant\u2019s report of an assault after 12 hours could be considered as part of the res gestae of that crime, but it did not speak at all to the question of a defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In <em>People v Todaro, </em>253 Mich 367; 235 NW 185 (1931) and on rehearing 256 Mich 427; 240 NW 90 (1932) a majority of the Court held that silence in the face of accusation by an unidentified accuser might be shown as part of the res gestae and such silence be regarded as acquiescence in the truth of the charge. We are persuaded that the reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of the dissenters in that case is more persuasive and in light of our conviction that such a doctrine is wholly at odds with the law defining our rights under the Fifth Amendment, overrule <em>Todaro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Borrowing from Justice Higbee in <em>State v Hogan, 252 </em>SW 387 (Mo, 1923), we quote his observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\"This humane rule has higher sanction than mere judicial precedent. At the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin, we read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\" '59. Now the chief priests and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\" '60. But found none; yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\" '61. And said, This fellow said I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">\" '62. And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness against thee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">\" '63. But Jesus held his peace.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">\u2014Matthew 26:59-63.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\"When he was before Pilate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">\" '11. And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">\" '12. And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">\" '13. Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-18\">\" '14.

The fact that a witness did not make a statement may be shown only to contradict his assertion that he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">These excerpts from the majority opinion demonstrate that the majority are of the mistaken view that the defendant in this case was under arrest and accused of burglary at the time of the alleged \"nonutterance\u201d. In fact, the defendant was not under arrest at that time, nor had he been accused of anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The following is an excerpt from the testimony of the defendant upon direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>What did you see with reference to anybody running down the street toward you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\"><em>\"A. </em>I didn\u2019t see nothing but two men running past me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\"><em>\"Q. </em>Did they\u2014had you reached the alley in the middle of the street when these men ran past you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\"><em>\u2019A: </em>I believe I was past. As a matter of fact, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And how long was it after these men ran past you that you were stopped by the policemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\"><em>'A.

I had told him where I was and where I was going. And he let us go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-16\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Then what happened, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-17\"><em>\"A. </em>Well, me and Milton Edison, we made our first steps and then another squad police car came and stopped us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-18\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And did those police officers say anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-19\"><em>\"A. </em>Those were officers who put us under arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-20\">This testimony clearly shows, by defendant\u2019s own words, that the first officer who stopped him on the evening in question did not place him under arrest, nor did he accuse the defendant of burglary. This comports with the testimony of officer Berryman. He was not investigating a burglary. He had observed a holdup in progress a few moments before his encounter with the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>He was investigating a robbery. He told the defendant that a man had been robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The cross-examination of the defendant upon the question of whether or not he informed Berryman of the \"two men running\u201d, concludes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\"><em>\u201dQ. (By Mr. Stephens) </em>You did indicate you did not tell the officer about these two men running, allegedly running down the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\"><em>\"A. </em>What did I do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>You did not tell the officer who stopped you about these men running down the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\"><em>\"A. </em>I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did you tell the officer they went down that alley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\"><em>'A. </em>I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did you point down the alley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\"><em>\u201dA. </em>I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>Did you describe these men to the officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\"><em>\u201dA. </em>I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-16\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did you get in the officer\u2019s car and go down the alley with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-17\"><em>\u2019A. </em>No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-18\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Your testimony is that you took another step, you talked to the officer, and somebody else came up and arrested you; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-19\"><em>\u201dA. </em>I said I took more than a couple of steps. I said he let us go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-20\">Again it is clear that the defendant was not under arrest at the time of his conversation with officer Berryman.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-21\">I cannot conceive that our Court really intends to extend the rule of <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694; 10 ALR3d 974 (1966), to all cases where citizens engage in conversations of any kind with law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">If every conversation between a policeman and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>citizen on the street must begin with a recitation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings then we may as well consign the whole matter of public safety to Divine Providence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Certainly there could no longer be any meaningful police-community relations, nor any effective citizen assistance to officers of the law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-5\">Swainson and M.
