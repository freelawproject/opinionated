Nemeth appeals a denial of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Nemeth, an employee of defendant Michigan Building Components, received his employer\u2019s permission to stay after hours and use the upright radial saw he used during regular hours to do some work for a fellow employee. Thirty-five minutes after his check-out time, Nemeth severely injured his hand while operating the saw. The injury resulted in the amputation of the four fingers of his left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the hearing referee\u2019s denial of recovery on the ground that Nemeth\u2019s after-hours injury was not an injury \"arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d. MCLA 418.301; MSA 17.237(301). The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">The sole issue is whether Nemeth\u2019s injury, resulting from authorized after-hours work on his employer\u2019s premises for the benefit of a fellow employee, was an injury \"arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The Act provides that \"[ejvery employee going to or from his work while on the premises where his work is to be performed, and within a reasonable time before and after his working hours, shall be presumed to be in the course of his employment.\u201d MCLA 418.301; MSA 17.237(301).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In <em>Whetro v Awkerman, </em>383 Mich 235, 243; 174 NW2d 783 (1970), in granting recovery, it was said: \"[I]f the employment is the occasion of the injury, even though not the proximate cause, compensation should be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Previously this Court, in language recently quoted with approval <em>(Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co of New York v DeShone, </em>384 Mich 686, 692-693; 187 NW2d 215 [1971]), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">\"For the purposes of the compensation act the concept of course of employment is more comprehensive than the assigned work *. * * . Course of employment is not scope of employment. The former, as the cases so clearly reveal, is a way of life in a working environment. If the injury results from the work itself, or from the stresses, the tensions, the associations, of the working environments, human as well as material, it is compensable.\u201d <em>(Crilly v Ballou, </em>353 Mich 303, 326; 91 NW2d 493 [1958]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Clearly, Nemeth\u2019s injury \"arose\u201d out of the employment relationship. We are also persuaded that it occurred in the \"course\u201d\u2014the \"flow\u201d (The Oxford Universal Dictionary), the \"path, route or channel\u201d (The Random House Dictionary)\u2014of the worker\u2019s employment; it resulted from \"the associations, of the working environments, human as well as material.\u201d <em>Crilly v Ballou, supra, </em>p 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">But for the employment relationship, Nemeth probably would not have been importuned by the fellow employee to use the saw and, but for the employment relationship, he would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>allowed to use either the employer\u2019s saw or his premises for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">In real terms, there is little difference between Nemeth\u2019s injury and an injury sustained during horseplay on the employer\u2019s premises <em>(Crilly v Ballou, supra) </em>or on adjoining parking lots <em>(Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co of New York v DeShone, supra), </em>in which cases compensation has been awarded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The employer is not at fault in this case. However, \"[f]ault has nothing to do with whether or not compensation is payable. The economic impact on an injured workman and his family is the same whether the injury was caused by the employer\u2019s fault or otherwise.\u201d <em>Whetro v Awkerman, supra, </em>p 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Employers expend large sums in efforts to establish employee goodwill. Christmas parties and other social affairs are sponsored to further this goal. No tangible products are produced at such affairs. Yet their cost is recognized as a cost of doing business. Injuries suffered by a workman attending social affairs have been held to arise out of and in the course of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Nemeth to use the machine after hours similarly served to promote and maintain good employer-employee relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">There is a sufficient nexus between the employment and the injury in a case where an employee sustains an injury while using equipment provided by the employer on the employer\u2019s premises so that recovery should be allowed even though the injury occurred after regular working hours and the equipment was being used for a purpose other than the manufacture of the employer\u2019s products.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Reversed and remanded to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b838-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. E. Brennan, T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b838-9\">M. S. Coleman, J., concurred in the result.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\"> <em>Cf. Burchett v Delton-Kellogg School, </em>378 Mich 231, 236; 144 NW2d 337, 339 (1966), where this Court remanded to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board \"for proper application of the dual-purpose doctrine.\u201d The worker, an elementary school teacher, had been injured in ah automobile accident while driving home from school. This Court reasoned that as the teacher was transporting school papers and other material to work at home, she was performing a duty for her employer at the time of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Compensation was recovered by the injured employee in the following cases: <em>Freiborg v Chrysler Corp, </em>350 Mich 104; 85 NW2d 145 (1957) (employee struck by fellow employee\u2019s automobile while walking on parking lot near plant entrance 45 minutes before check-in time); <em>Dyer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>350 Mich 92; 85 NW2d 152 (1957) (employee slipped and fell while descending the stairs of a lunchroom on the employer\u2019s premises; she had checked out for the lunch hour and was at liberty to leave the employer\u2019s premises).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\"> The anticipated benefit to the employer of improved employer-employee relationships has been held to justify the awarding of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to employees who sustained injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>while voluntarily attending employer sponsored social gatherings held on the employers\u2019 premises <em>(Du Charme v Columbia Engineering Co, </em>31 NJ Super 167, 169; 106 A2d 23, 24 [1954]; <em>Cf.
