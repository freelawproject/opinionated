They are repeated here in the language of the opinion below. However, in four important places, we have used italics to emphasize certain statements by the Court of Appeals. They will be discussed later.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">\"Plaintiff Bertil S. Fornell initiated litigation on May 19, 1965, in Wayne County Circuit Court, seeking a temporary restraining order prohibiting defendant Fornell Equipment, Inc. from holding a shareholder\u2019s meeting. From this suit springs the instant appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">\"Bertil and his wife, Nancy U. Fornell, owned 105 of the 250 outstanding shares of defendant corporation\u2019s stock. Bertil\u2019s sister, Margit E. Lowe, and Margit\u2019s husband, Richard G. Lowe, were the owners of 111 shares of stock in defendant corporation. The remaining 34 shares of stock had been held by David E. Fornell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the deceased father of Bertil and Margit, and were involved in a probate contest in Wayne County Probate Court at that time. Acting on plaintiff Bertil\u2019s motion, Judge Lila M. Neuenfelt granted the requested temporary restraining order, and ordered defendant corporation to appear and show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\"On June 8, 1965, Judge Neuenfelt ordered Nancy U. Fornell added to the cause as a party plaintiff, and Richard G. and Margit E. Lowe added as parties defendant. Following a hearing on June 25, 1965, Judge Neuenfelt declined to issue the preliminary injunction and dissolved the temporary restraining order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\"Subsequently, on November 12, 1965, defendants Fornell Equipment, Inc., Margit, and Richard filed a supplemental answer and counter-complaint, petitioning for a declaratory judgment. In this pleading for the first time defendants alleged 'that plaintiff Bertil S. Fornell is a spendthrift.\u2019 Among other requested relief, <em>defendants asked that Bertil S. Fornell be declared a spendthrift and that a spendthrift guardianship be created for the bene\u00f1t of Bertil, his wife Nancy, and their child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\"Without any hearing on the <em>allegation that Bertil was a spendthrift, </em>by consent of all the parties a declaratory judgment was entered on March 2,1966, by Judge Joseph G. Rashid, sitting in the place of absent Judge Neuenfelt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\"Paragraph four of the declaratory judgment reads, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">\" 'It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that plaintiff Bertil S. Fornell <em>is a spendthriB within the meaning of that term as it is used in the statutes of the State of Michigan relating to conserving the property of spendthrifts, </em>and in order to preserve the property of said plaintiff for the benefit of said plaintiff himself, his daughter Kristin Fornell, and plaintiff Nancy U. Fornell, his wife, it is further ordered and adjudged that City National Bank of Detroit, a national banking association, be and it is hereby appointed Trustee of all the assets of Bertil S. Fornell of every kind and nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>presently held by him or hereinafter acquired by and for him.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\"Paragraph five of the declaratory judgment added the following language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\" 'It is further ordered and decreed that City National Bank of Detroit, a national banking association as trustee of the assets of plaintiff, Bertil S. Fornell, is hereby vested with all the powers and duties of a statutory guardian for a spendthrift under the laws of the State of Michigan.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\"Under the terms of the declaratory judgment, Nancy was to receive two-thirds of the income from this spendthrift account, for the benefit of herself and Kristin, while one-third of the income was to go to Bertil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\"Over two years later, Nancy moved to amend the terms of the declaratory judgment. During that time, she had been granted a divorce from Bertil. The judgment of divorce, entered by Judge Philip Pratt of the Oakland County Circuit Court on February 26, 1968, utilized the spendthrift account created by declaratory judgment to effect the division of property and income between the parties in the divorce action, subject to the approval of Judge Rashid. In accordance with the terms of the divorce decree, Judge Rashid then approved Nancy\u2019s motion to amend the declaratory judgment on November 22, 1968. The amendment in relevant part provided that the spendthrift 'trust\u2019 was to endure for the lifetime of Bertil or until July 1, 1974, whichever should later occur, and that the income was to be divided into thirds, with Bertil, Nancy, and their daughter, Kristin, each receiving one-third every month. This 1968 amendment to the 1966 declaratory judgment was also entered with the consent of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\"Then, on May 29, 1969, plaintiff Bertil moved to have vacated the declaratory judgment and amended declaratory judgment, and to have terminated the <em>spendthrift guardianship. </em>Thereafter, upon consent of the parties and pursuant to a prior order of Oakland County Circuit Judge Pratt entered on August 19, 1969, amending the divorce judgment, Judge Rashid provided, on October 13, 1969, that the assets and income from the spendthrift 'trust\u2019 would be held by Bertil and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Nancy, as tenants in common, and such assets and income should be divided between those parties on an equal basis. Following this order, Bertil and Nancy filed a stipulation on October 24, 1969, agreeing that the spendthrift 'trust\u2019 established in the 1966 declaratory judgment and the 1968 amendments thereto, should be terminated, with Bertil and Nancy in the future to divide equally all moneys which were to be paid into the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\"After a hearing on January 20, 1970 concerning plaintiffs motion to have vacated the 1966 declaratory judgment and amendments thereto, Judge Rashid delivered his judgment on April 3, 1970. He denied plaintiff Bertil\u2019s motion to terminate the spendthrift 'trust\u2019 created by the 1966 declaratory judgment as amended, vacated the order of October 13, 1969, and further provided that money paid into the 'trust\u2019 from whatever source derived would be distributable in equal parts to Bertil and Nancy. Thereafter, Judge Rashid rejected plaintiff Bertil\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">It was true, as noted by the Court of Appeals, that the defendants alleged Bertil S. Fornell to be a spendthrift.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">It was not true, however, that the defendants alleged Bertil S. Fornell to be a spendthrift <em>within the meaning </em>o/MCLA 703.1; MSA 27.3178(201).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Neither is it true that defendants asked that Bertil S. Fornell be declared to be a spendthrift, or that the defendants prayed for the creation of a spendthrift guardianship for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The actual language of the defendants\u2019 counter-complaint is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\"That plaintiff Bertil S. Fornell is a spendthrift, and has squandered large amounts of property received from defendant corporation and from his parents during their lifetime, to the detriment of himself, his wife, Nancy U. Fornell, and his two daughters. Defendants further allege on information and belief that said plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>tiff is attempting to assign his interests, if any, under the instruments above referred to, in order to further squander and dissipate such interests actual and potential, to the detriment of himself, his wife and his two daughters, and that said plaintiff should be restrained from doing any act that will constitute an assignment or transfer of said plaintiff\u2019s interest under the instruments above referred to, and that a spendthrift trust should be created under decree of this court with plaintiff, Nancy U. Fornell, as Co-Trustee with a corporate fiduciary to be selected by her as the other Co-Trustee, for benefit of plaintiffs, and that all payments due under the instruments above referred to or otherwise from defendant, Fornell Equipment, Inc., should be decreed to be paid to the Trustees of such spendthrift trust, \"for the benefit of plaintiff, Bertil S. Fornell, his wife, Nancy U. Fornell, and his two daughters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The prayer of defendants\u2019 counter-complaint contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\"E. That said court set up by decree in this cause a spendthrift trust for benefit of plaintiff Bertil S. Fornell, Ms wife Nancy U. Fornell and his two children, as petitioned for in paragraph 6 of the Counter-Complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">There is evident confusion in the courts below over the distinction between a spendthrift <em>guardianship </em>and a spendthrift <em>trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">A spendthrift guardianship is created by a probate court under MCLA 703.1(3); MSA 27.3178(201)(3). Under such guardianship, all of the assets of the ward come under the control of the guardian. The ward is legally unable to dispose of, pledge, or assign any of his assets. Creditors may not reach his assets, except through allowance of claims by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>A spendthrift trust is quite a different thing. It is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\"In a broad sense, a spendthrift, support, or other similarly protective trust is one created to provide a fund for the maintenance of the beneficiary and at the same time to secure it against his improvidence or incapacity. In a narrower and more technical sense, a spendthrift trust is one that restrains either the voluntary or involuntary alienation by a beneficiary of his interest in the trust, or which, in other words, bars such interest from seizure in satisfaction of his debts. The name 'spendthrift trusts\u2019 is poorly descriptive, since no spendthriftiness or profligacy of a beneficiary is requisite to, or open to inquiry in determination of, the existence of such a trust.\u201d 54 Am Jur, Trusts, \u00a7 148, p 123.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">It is not requisite to the creation or validity of a spendthrift trust that the beneficiary be in fact a spendthrift.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Spendthrift trusts are upheld on the theory that the donor of the trust has the right to give his property on any condition he sees fit, and the beneficiary\u2019s creditors cannot complain that the settlor did not give his bounty to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">A person cannot, however, create a true spendthrift trust for himself. Public policy does not permit a man to place his own assets beyond the reach of his creditors. But a settlor is not precluded from transferring his own property in trust, to protect himself against his own improvidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\"Such a trust is binding on him except in so far as it is still within his power to alien or encumber it with debts, and will not be set aside as improvident because of the broadness of the discretion given to the trustee and because it is irrevocable, where its general purpose is wise and proper.\u201d 54 Am Jur, Trusts, \u00a7 166, p 135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">It is difficult to garner the intention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>parties and of the circuit judge in the consent judgment entered March 2, 1966. There are many words, phrases and provisions which seem to exhibit an intention to create a spendthrift guardianship, as that relationship is defined in the Probate Code. The judgment expressly restrains plaintiff from assigning certain assets, including rights as a co-licensee under a patent, his interest in a pension and profit sharing trust, and his stock ownership in the defendant corporation, including dividends thereon. The judgment announces that the plaintiff is found to be a spendthrift within the meaning of the Probate Code. MCLA 703.13; MSA 27.3178(213).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The trustee is purportedly given all of the assets of the plaintiff, including those presently held and thereafter acquired. It is stated that the trustee has the power of a spendthrift guardian. These provisions all appear intended to place the plaintiff in the position of a ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The analysis of the decision in the Court of Appeals with respect to the subject-matter jurisdiction of a circuit court to adjudge a person to be a spendthrift and appoint a guardian for such person is quite accurate and is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">However, there are other indications that the parties and the circuit judge intended to create a spendthrift trust rather than a spendthrift guardianship. The fiduciary named in the judgment, City National Bank, was denominated throughout as a trustee and the judgment specifically provided that the trust would terminate upon the appointment of a guardian. Further, with respect to the court\u2019s attempt to restrain the plaintiff from assigning away or disposing of his assets, there was some independent legal ground for finding a limitation upon the plaintiff\u2019s right to make such assignment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>With respect to the shares of stock in the defendant corporation, the bylaws of the company established that the corporation would have a prior right to purchase the stock of any stockholder. To the extent that the consent judgment was merely declaratory of that limitation, it did not purport to place the plaintiff under the disability of a ward. With respect to the employee\u2019s profit sharing trust, there was an allegation in the defendants\u2019 counter-complaint that the profit sharing trust agreement itself provided that no participant therein would have a vested right or interest in the trust estate. It was further alleged that the interest of the plaintiff in the patent license was subject to an agreement that the plaintiff would not assign his interest in the license to third parties without the consent of a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">It would appear, therefore, that the language of the consent judgment, which appears to place the plaintiff under the disability of a ward, is merely declaratory of existing contract provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Further, the operative language of the consent judgment placing all of the plaintiff\u2019s assets in trust would vest the legal title to the stock and the patent license in the trustee and would entitle the trustee to collect the dividends and the royalties subject to disposition in accordance with the terms of the trust. It is consistent with the nature of a trust, as a separation of the legal and equitable ownership of property, that a <em>cestui que trust </em>has no legal power to dispose of assets which have been conveyed to the trustee. And that fact is not to be confused with any attempt to restrain the beneficiary\u2019s power of alienation over his beneficial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">With respect to the language of the judgment purporting to vest the trustee with assets of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>plaintiff acquired after the date of the consent judgment, it must be observed that such attempt was ineffectual. A conveyance in trust must operate upon an identifiable res. But the fact that the judgment was ineffective to convey to the trustee after acquired property does not prevent the judgment from being effective with respect to property then held or owned by the plaintiff and capable of being identified, including the further right to receive dividends, royalties, and the like, where the source of such funds are capable of being identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Further, in support of the proposition that the consent judgment, irrespective of its apparent thrust, actually created a trust and not a guardianship, is the fact that the amendment to the declaratory judgment filed November 22, 1968, provides for the paying over of all of the income from the trust on a monthly basis without reference to living expenses of the beneficiaries. This eliminated the discretion of the trustee to withhold payment of income, thereby terminating the principal aspect of the judgment which had the character of a spendthrift trust. What remained after the 1968 amendment would not even purport to be a spendthrift trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">A second and perhaps equally important question is whether the trust created by the 1966 consent judgment, and amended in 1968, was revocable or irrevocable. Ordinarily, revocability is a question of the intention of the settlor, and further, it is within the power of a court of equity to decree a termination of a trust where the purpose for which it was created is fulfilled and all of the parties owning the entire beneficial interest are in agreement that the trust be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">But, the case before us does not present a simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>situation in which the only interests to be considered are those of the settlor and the beneficiaries. The consent judgment was entered as an amicable disposition of litigation then pending in the circuit court. It was based upon the stipulation of the parties and agreed to by all concerned. It follows that there was a valuable consideration flowing to the settlor Bertil S. Fornell in exchange for the creation of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We conclude that the trust was not intended to be revocable without the concurrence of the defendants in that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the cause remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-8\">T.
