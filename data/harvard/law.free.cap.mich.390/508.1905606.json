During the Great Lakes navigation season (April 1 of each year to November of such year), a substantial portion of its needs for steel coils in 1965, 1966 and 1967 was obtained from foreign mills and was delivered to Taxpayer at Detroit on an average of a two and one-half months lead time after same was ordered. A substantial portion of such imports were, on December 31, 1965, stored outside of the boat dock, not under customs warehouse bond, some was stored in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Taxpayer\u2019s warehouse on Humboldt Street near the dock, and small amounts were on tax date stored at other warehouses. Such imported steel is transported to Taxpayer\u2019s plant at 20001 Sherwood, fourteen (14) miles from the dock, when there is room at Taxpayer\u2019s plant on Sherwood. On tax date Production Steel Strip, Inc. had sufficient steel coils at its plant on Sherwood for its needs for about two months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\"After the close of navigation season between November of 1965 and April 1, 1966 and between November 1966 and April 1, 1967, Taxpayer purchased its supply of steel coils from domestic mills only and not from foreign mills. The time elapsing from date of Order to date of Delivery of such purchases from domestic mills during such periods between November 1965 and April 1, 1966 and between November 1966 and April 1967 was one-half month.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Defendants are the local governmental authorities who annually assess, levy and collect personal property taxes on such property as is within their corporate limits on the tax date, December 31 of each year. The assessments in question are for the tax years 1966 and 1967. The following facts are not stipulated but are of record as indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The 1966 assessment, made on the basis of property on hand December 31, 1965, was made by both the local Board of Assessors and the State Tax Commission on the basis \"that a 2 1/2 month usage was 'essential to current requirements.\u2019 \u201d (In re Appeal No. 1155 of Production Steel Strip Corporation, 1967, Michigan State Tax Commission, paragraph 5; and see complaint, p\u00e1ragraph 6, answer, paragraph 6.) The State Tax Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\"2.

The Board of Assessors assessed on the basis that, and the State Tax Commission affirmed that the amount of imported inventory that had lost its constitutional immunity and was taxable \"was the entire amount of such imports and was not limited to two and one-half (2-1/2) months processing and shipment.\u201d (Complaint, \u00b6 6; answer, \u00b6 6, <em>Production Steel Strip Corp v City of Detroit, </em>No 121450; In re Appeal No 1377 of Production Steel Strip Corp, 1968, Michigan State Tax Commission.)

The defendants resumed their 1966 assessment position \"that a 2 1/2 months usage was 'essential to current requirements.\u2019 \u201d Plaintiff, of course, continued to argue for a 1/2 month basis. (Affidavit in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of motion for partial summary judgments, September 1, 1970, No 121450, <em>supra.)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The circuit court r\u00bflying on <em>Denver v Denver Publishing Co, </em>153 Colo 539; 387 P2d 48 (1963); <em>Orr Felt &amp; Blanket Co v Schneider, </em>3 Ohio 2d 14; 209 NE2d 150 (1965) and <em>Knight Newspapers, Inc v Detroit, </em>16 Mich App 438 (1969) accepted plaintiffs 1/2 month replenishment from domestic sources formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Defendant taxing authorities appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals with a divided Court affirmed holding that 14 days was the correct replenishment time to be used in computing the taxpayer\u2019s current operational needs. 42 Mich App 698, 703; 202 NW2d 719. The minority opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\"We are here considering the taxable status of the plaintiffs foreign inventory, and I cannot see why the fact that the plaintiff satisfies some of his needs domestically should make any difference.\u201d 42 Mich App 698, 705.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We granted leave to appeal. 388 Mich 808 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">II\u2014STATE TAXATION OF IMPORTS\u2014 UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ANALYSIS OF ART I, \u00a7 10, CL 2</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">As this is a case involving the interpretation of the United States Constitution and a case of first impression before this Court, an analysis of controlling United States Supreme Court decisions is essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">In any historical analysis of the decisions relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ing to state taxation of imports from a foreign country, we must begin with the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Brown v Maryland, </em>25 US (12 Wheat) 419; 6 L Ed 678 (1827), the landmark case dealing with art I, \u00a7 10, cl 2 of the United States Constitution. <em>Brown </em>was concerned with a Maryland statute declaring that importers of foreign goods by the bale or package must secure a license in order to sell their goods. The Court held that the statute levied a prohibited impost on imports and was, therefore, unconstitutional and in the course of the opinion Chief Justice Marshall stated that \"there must be a point of time when the prohibition ceases, and the power of the State to tax commences.\u201d Having stated the premise, he elaborated on the vexatious nature of it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\"The constitutional prohibition on the States to lay a duty on imports, a prohibition which a vast majority of them must feel an interest in preserving, may certainly come in conflict with their acknowledged power to tax persons and property within their territory. The power, and the restriction on it, though quite distinguishable when they do not approach each other, may yet, like the intervening colours between white and black, approach so nearly as to perplex the understanding, as colours perplex the vision in marking the distinction between them. Yet the distinction exists, and must be marked as the cases arise. Till they do arise, it might be premature to state any rule as being universal in its application. It is sufficient for the present to say, generally, that <em>when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported, that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, </em>and has become subject to the taxing power of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 25 US (12 Wheat) 419, 439.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Chief Justice Marshall also elaborated on some acts or conduct of the importer which would cause the goods to be \"mixed up with the mass, of property in the county [and to lose] its distinctive character as an import\u201d. He held that the goods lose their character as imports when the importer (1) \"sells them,\u201d or (2) \"[breaks] up his packages, and [travels] with them as an itinerant pedlar,\u201d or (3) that the goods brought into this country by an importer \"for his own use\u201d and here \"used\u201d by him are to be regarded as a part of \"the common mass\u201d of property and are not immune from state taxation. 12 Wheat 419, 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Thus, Marshall\u2019s discourse went beyond the scope of the question actually presented in <em>Brown, </em>but the United States Supreme Court subsequently applied the principle that imported goods themselves cannot be taxed by the states while held in the importer\u2019s warehouse in the original package for resale. See <em>Low v Austin, </em>80 US (13 Wall) 29; 20 L Ed 517 (1871); <em>License Cases, </em>46 US (5 How) 504; 12 L Ed 256 (1847).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized, as had Chief Justice Marshall, that the point comes when an import loses its constitutional immunity by ceasing to be an import. They have stated that immunity is lost when:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">(1) the original package is broken;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">(2) the goods are sold;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(3) the character of the goods imported is changed by subjecting them to a manufacturing process;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">(4) by making use of the goods. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In <em>Hooven &amp; Allison Co v Evatt, </em>324 US 652; 65 S Ct 870; 89 L Ed 1252 (1945)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court considered the validity of an Ohio ad valorem tax levied on imported bales of hemp and other fibers which were stored in the manufacturer\u2019s warehouse in their original packages prior to their use in the manufacture of cordage and similar products. The Ohio Supreme Court had held the tax valid on the ground that imports for use, as opposed to imports for sale, lost their constitutional immunity upon storage in their original packages because they had become intermingled with the common mass of property within the state. The United States Supreme Court held that the tax violated the Import-Export Clause. The Court held that the mere storage of hemp anticipatory to its being placed in the manufacturing process did not itself constitute a \"putting to use\u201d and thus held the tax upon hemp invalid. Justice Stone, speaking for a majority of the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">\"It cannot be said that the fibers were subjected to manufacture when they were placed in petitioner\u2019s warehouse in their original packages. And it is unnecessary to decide whether, for purposes of the constitutional immunity, the presence of some fibers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>factory was so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they could be said to have entered the process of manufacture, and hence were already put to use for which they were imported, before they were removed from the original packages. <em>Even though the inventory of raw material required to be kept on hand to meet the current operational needs of a manufacturing business could be thought to have then entered the manufacturing process, the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court did not rest on that ground, and the record affords no basis for saying that any part of petitioner\u2019s \u00f1bers, stored in its warehouse, were required to meet such immediate current needs. </em>Hence we have no occasion to consider that question.\u201d 324 US 652, 667. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Thus, the <em>Hooven </em>Court specifically stated that it left open the question as to whether the presence of some fibers in the factory were so essential to \"current manufacturing requirements\u201d that they could be said to have entered the process of manufacture and hence had already been \"put to the use\u201d for which they were imported.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">That precise question was faced by the United States Supreme Court in the companion cases of <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co v Bowers </em>and <em>(United States Plywood Corp v Algoma), </em>358 US 534; 79 S Ct 383; 3 L Ed 2d 490 (1959).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The question posited by the <em>Youngstown </em>Court also was the basis of their new standard. The Court asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\"><em>\"Do the facts as stipulated and found, in the cases before us, </em>when considered in the light of applicable legal principles, show that these manufacturers <em>have so acted upon the imported materials as to cause them to lose their distinctive character as imports\u2019 by irrevocably committing them, after their importation journeys </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>have definitely ended, to 'use in manufacturing\u2019 at the plant and point of final destination, and by 'entering\u2019 and 'using\u2019 them 'in manufacturing\u2019 </em>at that place?\u201d 358 US 534, 543. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In the <em>Youngstown </em>case, 166 Ohio St 122; 140 NE2d 313 (1957) (which involved ores shipped in bulk), the Ohio Supreme Court upheld an ad valorem tax on imported iron ores (used in the process of manufacturing iron and steel) which were stored in \"ore yards\u201d in storage piles according to country of origin and grade adjacent to the manufacturing facilities of the importer. A portion of the foreign ores was periodically removed from these \"ore yards\u201d to \"stock bins\u201d or \"stock houses\u201d located close to the furnaces. These \"stock bins\u201d held a one or two day\u2019s supply and were the source from which the furnaces were fed ores. This repetitive removal to the \"stock bins\u201d gradually depleted the stock piles of ores in the \"ore yards\u201d which in turn were replenished by new imports of bulk iron ores from foreign sources. This resulted in a commingling of old and new shipments of iron ores in the \"ore yards\u201d. The Supreme Court of Ohio held that the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\"[P]rotection [of the Import-Export Clause] cannot extend to such iron ore (1) after it has been commingled with other iron ore imported at a different time, even though such iron ore is of the same grade and was imported from the same place, and (2) after portions of such ore have been removed for use in manufacturing.\u201d 166 Ohio St 122; 140 NE2d 313, 314-315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Similarly, in the <em>United States Plywood Corporation </em>case, 2 Wis 2d 567; 87 NW2d 481 (1958), the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that raw materials imported from foreign countries and stored at the importer\u2019s factory in their original packages are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not immune from a general property tax when such goods are \"put to the use for which acquired\u201d in the sense of being essential to the current manufacturing requirements of the importer. The goods involved in this case were imported lumber and veneers. The lumber imported in bulk was unloaded from railroad cars and stacked in piles adjacent to the importer\u2019s plant to air dry. Since most of the lumber was imported in a \"green\u201d condition, it had to be dried before it could be used for manufacturing purposes. This air-drying was a preliminary step to a subsequent kiln drying operation. The Wisconsin Supreme Court readily found that the dominant purpose of the stacking was to air dry the lumber so that it had \"entered the process of manufacture\u201d and was thus \"put to the use for which [it was] imported.\u201d The City of Algoma imposed a property tax on one-half of the lumber and veneer on the ground that that portion was committed for immediate use in manufacturing. The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the tax on the same ground. This finding, not contested on appeal, was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The veneers in the <em>Plywood </em>case were imported in bundles secured by metal straps or in wooden crates and kept in such packages in the importer\u2019s warehouse until used in the manufacturing process. The Wisconsin Supreme Court approved the lower court\u2019s findings that one-half of the amount of the veneers on hand was necessary to meet the importer\u2019s current operational needs and therefore had lost constitutional immunity since the veneers were \"in substance being put to the use for which the raw materials were imported, even though not yet removed from their wrappings or subjected to any physical or chemical change.\u201d The United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>States Supreme Court affirmed this holding using as its principal authorities <em>Brown v Maryland </em>and <em>Hooven &amp; Allison Co v Evatt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Perhaps of particular significance in this case because of the opinions and arguments below and on appeal are the formulas used in <em>Youngstown </em>and <em>United States Plywood </em>by Ohio and by Wisconsin. There is nothing in either the report of <em>Youngstown </em>in the Ohio Supreme Court or in the United States Supreme Court to indicate that Ohio did not tax the entire amount of imported ore present on tax day. The only clue to the amount of ore then present is that \"Youngstown endeavors to maintain 'a supply of imported ores to meet its estimated requirements for a period of at least three months.\u2019 \u201d 358 US 534, 537. In <em>United States Plywood, </em>\"[t]he Assessor of the City of Algoma, believing that one-half of the lumber and veneers on hand on the taxing date was necessarily required to be kept on hand to meet the current operating needs of petitioner\u2019s manufacturing plant, assessed an ad valorem tax upon the value of that one-half of the lumber and veneers.\u201d 358 US 534, 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Quite simply in <em>Youngstown </em>it appears that the assessor assessed all the imports that were there, which probably was in the neighborhood of a three months supply. In <em>United States Plywood, </em>the assessor judged half of what was on hand was necessary for \"current operating\u201d needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">There is no mention and no evidence of interest in <em>Youngstown </em>in the specifics of daily or monthly usage or of replenishment time which have figured so largely in the arguments and opinions in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Without any such evidence, the United States Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>\u201d[T]he facts as stipulated and found in the cases before us, </em>when considered in the light of applicable legal principles, show that these manufacturers <em>have so acted upon the imported materials as to cause them to lose their distinctive character as \\imports\u2019 by irrevocably committing them, after their importation journeys have de\u00f1nitely ended, to 'use in manufacturing\u2019 at the plant and point of f\u00ednal destination, and by \\entering\u2019 and \u2019using\u2019 them \u2019in manufacturing\u2019 </em>at that place [.]\u201d 358 US 534, 543. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The United States Supreme Court deals with the \"current operational needs\u201d test of <em>Hooven </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\"Unlike <em>Hooven, </em>these are not cases of the mere storage in a warehouse of imported materials intended for eventual use in manufacturing but not found to have been, essential to current operational needs. <em>Here the Ohio and Wisconsin courts have in effect held that the stipulated and found facts show that the imported materials that were taxed by those States were so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they must be said to have entered the process of manufacture, </em>and those courts have rested their judgments, in major part at least, on that ground. Our question therefore is precisely the one which the Court did not reach or consider in the <em>Hooven </em>case.\u201d 358 US 534, 544. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">A fair conclusion to be drawn from <em>Youngstown </em>is that the United States Supreme Court grants the states a reasonable amount of latitude in determining what \"current operational needs\u201d are<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> once it is clear that the \"manufacturers <em>have so acted upon the imported materials </em>as to lose their distinctive character as 'imports\u2019 \u201d. 358 US 534, 543. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">We turn now to determining whether and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>what extent the hot roll steel coils in the instant case had lost \"their distinctive character as 'imports\u2019 \u201d under the standards established in <em>Youngstown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Ill\u2014 <em>YOUNGSTOWN &amp; PRODUCTION STEEL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We begin a comparative analysis of <em>Youngstown </em>and <em>Production Steel </em>with a transitional quotation from <em>Youngstown:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\"And inasmuch as 'the reconciliation of the competing demands of the constitutional immunity and of the state\u2019s power to tax, is an extremely practical matter\u2019 <em>(Hooven &amp; Allison Co. v.

But the flow of material from boat docks and surrounding warehouses to the factory curtilage and into the factory itself is certainly the same kind of manufacturing materials feeding process with which almost everyone in Michigan is generally familiar. So the supply line in <em>Production Steel </em>is strictly comparable to <em>Youngstown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The aforementioned comparative analysis brings <em>Production Steel </em>within the <em>Youngstown </em>rule relative to losing the \"distinctive character of imports\u201d, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">What about <em>Hooven\u2019s </em>\"current operational needs\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">This is a point we considered specifically above, and concluded that once the importer has irrevocably committed imports at their journey\u2019s end to use in manufacturing, the states have a reasonable amount of latitude in determining \"current operational needs\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The fact of the matter appears to be that the Board of Assessors and the State Tax Commission have not been entirely sure what the legal guidelines should be in determining \"current opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tional needs\u201d. They have employed at least two formulas, the first assessing all imports present on the taxing date, the second assessing of the imports present on the taxing date the equivalent of daily requirements multiplied by the number of days needed to replenish such requirements from the foreign source derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">There may be justification for the first formula in <em>Youngstown </em>and the California case, for which the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, which upheld assessing all imported property present on the taxing date. <em>(Virtue Bros v Los Angeles County, </em>239 Cal App 2d 220; 48 Cal Rptr 505 [1966], <em>cert den, </em>385 US 820; 87 S Ct 45; 17 L Ed 2d 58 [1966].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">However, since defendants have receded from that position and since that matter was not argued before us, we leave the question open and express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">As to the second assessment formula that the \"current operational requirements\u201d are 2-1/2 months usage with a patent or latent reference to the replenishment time from abroad, certainly there is nothing in <em>Youngstown </em>that precludes approving this formula. As a matter of fact, Production Steel\u2019s 2-1/2 months usage compares favorably with Youngstown\u2019s attempted maintenance of 3 months requirements, and, of course, we have no comparable standard from <em>United States Plywood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">If we look to the facts further we find that on the taxing date plaintiff had about nine months usage on hand (derived from Exhibit V, Stipulation of Facts). Recognizing the facts of life of Great Lakes shipping, this would suggest that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>had established a manufacturing service of supply sufficient to meet its operational requirements until the reopening of navigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since plaintiff freely admitted the cost advantage of such imports, it would appear that plaintiff had prudently established a manufacturing supply line to meet its operational needs which would advantage it most.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In the face of such a general fact situation, it certainly cannot be said that defendants\u2019 judgment as to \"current operational requirements\u201d was excessive whatever theoretical argument might be made that replenishment of usage was possible in 1/2 month.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As <em>Youngstown </em>held \"we must approach the question whether these materials had been 'put to the use for which they [were] imported\u2019 <em>[Hooven, </em>p 657] with full awareness of realities and treat them in a practical way.\u201d 358 US 534, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We therefore mindful of the injunction in <em>Youngstown </em>(358 US 534, 550) not to \"impute to Framers of the Constitution a purpose to make such a discrimination in favor of materials imported from other countries as would result if we approved the views pressed on us by the manufacturers\u201d hold that defendants were quite within their authority in assessing plaintiff\u2019s imported steel coils on a formula of 2-1/2 months usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\"><em>IV\u2014KNIGHT </em>AND <em>DENVER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The courts below, the State Tax Commission and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>counsel\u2019s arguments have referred significantly to <em>Knight Newspapers, Inc v Detroit, </em>16 Mich App 438 (1969) and <em>Denver v Denver Publishing Co, </em>153 Colo 539; 387 P2d 48 (1963). We will therefore comment briefly on their applicability to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Insofar as <em>Knight </em>adopts \"[t]he rule and formula used in the <em>Denver Case\u201d </em>as the rule in Michigan, 16 Mich App 438, 442, it is disapproved and overruled. This Court prefers to, and must rely on the original and basic authority of <em>Youngstown. </em>However, whether the decision reached in <em>Knight </em>is correct or incorrect is not before us. As <em>Denver </em>says, \"[t]here is no rigid and inflexible rule which can be laid down to determine the 'current operational needs\u2019 of a taxpayer. This is an area where in the policy of the law dictates ad hoc determinations based on the facts presented in each particular case.\u201d 153 Colo 539, 548-549; 387 P2d 48, 53. <em>Knight </em>appears to raise the question of assessing the entire import or of an \"arbitrarily set\u201d 15 days\u2019 supply standard. 16 Mich App 438, 440. We have expressly reserved the question of assessing the entire import and, of course, we do not have before us the record to judge whether or not the 15 day standard was arbitrary or reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">As to <em>Denver, </em>we have reserved the question on which it rules, namely whether the whole import is assessable, and we see no purpose in limiting the broad general rules of <em>Youngstown </em>by raising \"the distinction between 'current operational needs\u2019 and good business practices dictated by prudent management,\u201d if indeed there necessarily is any distinction. In any event, <em>Denver\u2019s </em>comment, quoted above, against a \"rigid and inflexible rule\u201d in these cases, we believe the better lesson from this case. Furthermore, it is not at all certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>that the decision does not support defendant\u2019s formula as it is based on replenishment from Canada although the taxpayer also had a domestic source. See <em>Beall Pipe &amp; Tank Corp v State Tax Commission, </em>254 Or 195, 200; 458 P2d 420, 423 (1969) interpreting <em>Denver </em>as determining \"current operational needs on the basis of the length of time required to secure additional supply from the foreign source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Court of Appeals and the circuit court are reversed.

387 P2d 48 (1963), and was adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Knight Newspapers, Inc v Detroit, </em>16 Mich App 438; 168 NW2d 318 (1969).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Without the benefit of adversary presentation on the appropriateness of this test, the opinion of the Court declares that \"[i]nsofar as <em>Knight </em>adopts '[t]he rule and formula used in the <em>Denver Case\u2019as </em>the rule in Michigan, 16 Mich App 438, 442, it is disapproved and overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The Court so rejects the replenishment time test after explaining its reversal of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision on a basis neither briefed nor argued, nor mentioned in the decisions and opinions filed by the circuit and appeals courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The parties having agreed that the pertinent inquiry is Production\u2019s \"current operational needs\u201d and that those needs are to be measured by the replenishment time test, the question before us, again as stated by the taxing authorities, is whether the taxing authorities have \"a right to assess foreign steel inventory in the amount of 2 1/2 months\u2019 usage based on a 2 1/2 month replenishment lead time from foreign suppliers\u201d or whether Production is correct in contending that \"only 1/2 month\u2019s usage is necessary to satisfy current operational needs and only that amount is assessable, because on tax day Production could replenish steel from domestic sources within 1/2 month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Foreign and domestic steel are functionally (\"so far as utility is concerned\u201d), or at least the parties so stipulate, the same. Although Production was using foreign steel both during the 1/2 month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>replacement period (contended for by Production) and the 2-1/2 months period (contended for by the taxing authorities), it could have satisfied all its operational needs throughout the 2-1/2 months period with domestic steel having a replacement lead time of 1/2 month.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The replenishment time test is a two-factor test: (i) time required to obtain additional supplies of the commodity, and (ii) quantity used during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">While the parties disagree on whether the applicable time is the time required to obtain additional supplies from foreign sources or from domestic sources, in their stipulation they have computed the quantity factor based on the actual amounts of <em>foreign </em>steel used after the tax day (December 31) during the 1/2 month and 2-1/2 months periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The parties, thus, are in apparent agreement that the term \"current operational needs\u201d refers not to the importer-manufacturer\u2019s entire need for supplies of the commodity but rather to so much of his need as is filled with foreign supplies, and that the quantitative amount of his foreign supply needs is to be determined by his actual usage of foreign supplies during the relevant replacement time period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Turning to the time factor, both parties urge us to look at the \"actual\u201d time of replacement. Production contends that the actual time of replacement is the 1/2 month lead time required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>acquiring the domestic supplies of steel Production was actually purchasing and receiving in the January-March period. The taxing authorities contend that the actual time of replacement is the time required to obtain a new supply from the foreign sources actually being used by the importer-manufacturer, in this case, by stipulation, 2-1/2 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We are persuaded that the taxing authorities have the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The agreed-upon inquiry is current operational needs. The agreed-upon test for determining current operational needs is replenishment time. The agreed-upon quantity factor to be used in applying that test is actual usage during the relevant replacement time of December 31 inventory acquired from foreign sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">It seems more consonant with the concept of a test designed to measure current operational needs \u2014by stipulation meaning the importer-manufacturer\u2019s usage of foreign supplies during the relevant replacement period\u2014to determine the time portion of the equation based on the time required to obtain replacement supplies from the foreign sources actually being used.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">While Production might have covered with domestic steel its customer requirements during the 2-1/2 months agreed-upon time for acquiring new supplies of foreign steel, it chose, for whatever reasons, to meet those requirements with steel purchased abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">\"Current operational needs\u201d\u2014assuming as the parties do that it is the relevant criterion\u2014does not seek to measure the importer-manufacturer\u2019s need for domestic supplies but rather the quantities of foreign supplies required to maintain the segment of his manufacturing operations he chooses to stoke with foreign supplies. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>replenishment time test, if an importer-manufacturer meets his needs from domestic supplies during the relevant replacement time period, if he does not actually use his foreign inventories during that period, the quantity factor of the two-factor replenishment time test would be zero and, therefore, none of his foreign inventories would be subject to taxation. In such a case it would make no sense to allow the tax collector to substitute the manufacturer\u2019s actual domestic usage on the ground that the manufacturer <em>might </em>have met his customer requirements out of his foreign inventories.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Similarly, we reason that it would be inconsistent with the function of the replenishment time test, as a measure of the quantity of foreign supplies used and time required to obtain replacement supplies, to multiply foreign inventory usage times a replacement time for supplies which are not actually used to displace foreign supplies in meeting customer requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In <em>Orr Felt &amp; Blanket Co v Schneider, </em>3 Ohio St 2d 14, 24; 209 NE2d 150, 156; 32 Ohio Opinions 2d 13 (1965), the Ohio Supreme Court, faced with a similar question, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\"[Although the evidence indicates that the taxpayer <em>could </em>have secured a new supply of imported grease wool from eastern importers within 30 days, the tax-; payer chose to import its own grease wool from foreign countries * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\"The taxpayer having made this choice, the rule applied to the taxpayer should be that the amount of grease wool removed from the bonded warehouse and in inventory which is required to meet 'current operational needs\u2019 for the length of time it takes to secure an additional supply from the foreign source which the taxpayer has selected to supply its grease wool is taxable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Production distinguishes this case on the ground that, in contrast with the taxpayer in the Ohio case, it was actually buying steel on the tax date from domestic sources. While that is true, it was not meeting its <em>relevant </em>operating needs with the domestic supplies so purchased. If it were, then the amount of the quantity factor would, to that extent, have been reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">If Production had met all customer requirements from domestic supplies, if domestic supplies replaced dependence on the December 31 inventory of foreign supplies, then, as of the end of the 1/2 month period Production would have us adopt, the quantity factor of the two-factor equation would be zero and Production would have achieved by its own method of operation what it seeks to accomplish by this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We conclude, subject to the agreed-upon computations set forth in the stipulation of the parties,. that the portion of Production\u2019s December 31 inventory of foreign steel subject to taxation is the amount needed to cover Production\u2019s actual usage of foreign steel in the 2-1/2 months agreed-upon time required to obtain new supplies of foreign steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">This Court, without briefing or argument directed to the question of the propriety of the replenishment time test, rejects that test and derives its own which at once both begs the question and seems to leave the matter at large in the discretion of the tax assessor subject to the supervision of the State Tax Commission. This Court writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">-\u25a0\"A fair conclusion to be drawn from <em>Youngstown </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that the United States Supreme Court grants the states a reasonable amount of latitude in determining what 'current operational needs\u2019 are <em>once </em>it is clear that the 'manufacturers have so acted upon the imported materials as to lose their distinctive character as \"imports\u201d \u2019. 358 US 534, 543.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">This Coiirt thereby treats \"current operational needs\u201d as a concept separate from \"so act[ing] upon the imported materials as to lose their distinctive character as 'imports\u2019 \u201d. But the rationale of <em>Youngstown </em>was that <em>because </em>of the proven current operational needs of the importer-manufacturers, they would, on the facts, record and findings in the consolidated cases, be deemed to have so \"acted upon\u201d the imported materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The distinction which Chief Justice Marshall said exists and \"must be marked as the cases arise\u201d, <em>Brown v Maryland, supra, </em>p 441, ceases to exist as a perceptible rule of law insofar as commodities imported for use in manufacturing in Michigan are concerned if as soon as the commodty hits the dock it becomes, apparently as a matter of law, part of the \"supply line\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, ergo, \"irrevocably committed to 'use in manufacturing\u2019 at [the] plant\u201d for which it is destined. <em>Cf. Beall Pipe &amp; Tank Corp v State Tax Commission, </em>254 Or 195; 458 P2d 420 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In <em>Youngstown </em>the Court distinguished <em>Hooven </em>on the ground that \"these are not cases of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>mere storage in a warehouse of imported materials intended for eventual use in manufacturing\u201d. Clearly then a line must yet be drawn between mere storage for <em>\"eventual </em>use\u201d and \"use\u201d/\"putting to use\u201d/\"acting upon\u201d. The courts of other states have taken varying approaches in their line-drawing efforts, and the several approaches (see fn 4) are each arguably correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Sometimes it is difficult to evaluate the significance of statements and phrases in a lengthy opinion of the United States Supreme Court, whether they are merely descriptive or \u00e1re limiting or are intended to lay down a rule. We would reserve until a case where th\u00e9 question is briefed and argued any attempt to explicate <em>Youngstown </em>or to generalize about where the line should be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Reasoning from one analogy to \u00e1nother can carry one into infinity. Merely because the <em>Youngstown </em>Court upheld the taxation of all the ores at Youngstown\u2019s plant and said it could see no valid basis for distinguishing between the ores in stock bins containing one or two days\u2019 supply located in close proximity to the furnaces (conceded by Youngstown to be subject to taxation) and ores in the ore yard piles a short distance further away (claimed not to be taxable), does not mean that the Court would hold to be taxable separately identifiable steel coils located, not at the plant but at the waterfront, coils perhaps part of an unbroken lot or order or, indeed, an unbroken shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In <em>Youngstown, </em>the imported iron ore had been <em>\"commingled </em>with other iron ore imported at a different time.\u201d \"[P]ortions of such iron ore [had] been removed for use in manufacturing.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) \"[Indiscriminate portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>whole\u201d importation of veneers were actually being used.
