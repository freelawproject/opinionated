Corace, Jr. appeals a disciplinary order of the State Bar Grievance Board which suspended him from the practice of law for 60 days and assessed costs. The State Bar Grievance Administrator has cross-appealed contending that a more severe penalty should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In contrast with most State Bar disciplinary proceedings, here the complainants are not former clients of the lawyer. The complainants are persons who were opposed by Corace\u2019s clients and a person who, at the time, was the Clerk of the Common Pleas Court of Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We reverse and dismiss the charges because the findings do not warrant disciplinary action:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Corace, while representing a 50% stockholder of a close corporation, requested corporate records from Robert L. Coopes, a lawyer and secretary of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain the records, Corace commenced a replevin action against Coopes. The Administrator\u2019s formal complaint charged that the action \"was without foundation and filed solely to harass said Robert L. Coopes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">The hearing panel found that Corace \"infringed\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>former Canon 31 because \"respondent in bringing suit for Kalka [Corace\u2019s client], did so rather hastily though within his legal rights\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Former Canon 31 stated: \"[t]he responsibility for advising as to <em>questionable </em>transactions, for bringing <em>questionable </em>suits, for urging <em>questionable </em>defenses, is the lawyer\u2019s responsibility.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The hearing panel did not find that the replevin action \"was without foundation and filed solely to harass\u201d Coopes. Absent such a finding, a finding that the replevin action was \"questionable\u201d, the conclusion that Canon 31 was infringed must be set aside as unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">No canon or other authority has been cited proscribing the \"rather hasty\u201d commencement of a proper action. Speed in asserting a client\u2019s rights does not subject a lawyer to professional discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The complaint also charged that Corace \"did cause\u201d the name of Robert L. Coopes to be signed to a stipulation for adjournment without Coopes\u2019 authorization or consent. The stipulation had been signed by a clerk employed by Corace who acted under the supervision of an associate lawyer. The hearing panel found Corace culpable because he \"stated that he took the responsibility for the running of his office. Although it appears that he did not in fact sign Mr. Coopes\u2019 name to the stipulation the responsibility must be his. There is no evidence that upon discovery he took any steps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>to explain to Mr. Coopes why his name was used on the stipulation without his consent or under the circumstances 'showing cause before the Court\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The Administrator did not substantiate his charge that Corace \"did cause\u201d the name of Robert L. Coopes to be signed. Rather them \"causing\u201d Coopes\u2019 name to be signed, Corace was oblivious of the inclusion of Coopes\u2019 signature until after the commencement of disciplinary proceedings against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Although Corace did acknowledge that he was legally responsible for the actions of his employees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a lawyer is not subject to bar discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>on a theory of vicarious responsibility when there is no evidence or finding that he should have been aware of and guarded against a possible impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We are at a loss to understand the hearing panel and Grievance Board\u2019s criticism of Corace for failing to explain the signature to Coopes under the circumstance that bar disciplinary proceedings were commenced before Corace learned of the signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The formal complaint does not charge a failure to explain unauthorized conduct by a clerk or an associate lawyer but rather that Corace had \"caused\u201d the placing of the signature. Hearing panels and the Grievance Board far too frequently stray from the specifications of the charge, finding a lawyer guilty not of the conduct charged in the complaint but of something else. We have recently had cause to emphasize that a lawyer may not be disciplined on the basis of findings of wrongdoing not charged in the formal complaint. <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Jackson, </em>390 Mich 147, 155; 211 NW2d 38 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Corace, while representing a finance company, obtained a judgment of $346.92 against Robert Kelley, Jr. Kelley paid $20 toward the judgment on an installment plan, but failed to pay other installments. Corace caused the issuance of six writs of garnishment addressed to Kelley\u2019s employer, each claiming the balance due of $332.42. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The employer eventually paid Corace the total amount garnisheed, $505.45, for a release of the writs of garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Contending that Corace had wrongfully appropriated for attorney\u2019s fees and costs the difference between the amount of the judgment and the amount collected from Kelley\u2019s employer, Kelley commenced an action and obtained a judgment against Corace and his client in the sum of $173.53 plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees, which was affirmed on appeal to the circuit court. Leave to appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals, and Corace did not apply for leave to appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Kelley\u2019s request for investigation was filed February 10, 1969. Corace\u2019s answer was filed March 3, 1969. On November 6, 1969 the State Bar Grievance Administrator advised Corace and Kelley that Kelley\u2019s request for investigation had been dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">A year later, on November 24, 1970, following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>receipt of Coopes\u2019 request for investigation, counsel for the State Bar Grievance Administrator advised Corace and Kelley by letter that Kelley\u2019s request had been \"reopened by this office for further consideration\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The hearing panel found that Corace \"did wrongfully after entry of Default Judgment, collect, hold and withhold monies belonging to Mr. Kelley; did sign affidavits of garnishments without regard to their truth or falsity of the exact amount due and owing at the time of signature; that the methodology or scheme gives the appearance (of improper conduct) so that attorney fees added in a judgment could be the determining feature of compensation between a lawyer and client. That he failed to return proofs of service of Writs of garnishment to Court files where they properly belong. As before stated every Court file should be complete when finished. No one has the right to tamper with Court files without authority. That in electing to unilaterally or arbitrarily determine the 'reasonableness of attorneys fees\u2019 usurped the function of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Corace claimed the right to charge Kelley $20 in respect to each writ of garnishment and to charge him for the fees and mileage of the sheriff in serving the writs of garnishment, and that this left a balance of $22.73. Corace\u2019s client calculated the interest due on the judgment at $4.08 and sent Kelley a check for the difference of $18.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Corace relies on \u00a7\u00a7 2441 and 2558 of the Revised Judicature Act and the court rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *8 He maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>that a garnishee defendant\u2019s liability to a plaintiff upon writs of garnishment may be settled just as any other liability between two litigants may be settled. Their settlement would not be binding upon the principal defendant and he would thereafter be free to litigate the matter, as he did. On that basis, Corace argues, a settlement between the plaintiff and the garnishee defendant could properly include any amount properly allowable in the event the matter were pursued to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Corace relies on former Canon 32 which provided that \"until a statute shall have been construed and interpreted by competent adjudication, [a lawyer] is free and is entitled to advise as to its validity and as to what he conscientiously believes to be its just meaning and extent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">There is no evidence, nor is it claimed, that Corace did not conscientiously believe that his client was entitled to charge Kelley the statutory costs claimed. It is not necessary to decide whether Corace\u2019s construction of the statute and the court rule is correct. In the absence of a controlling court rule, statute or judicial precedent there is no reason to doubt Corace\u2019s claim that he simply resolved a debatable question in favor of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The record does not support the finding that Corace \"did sign affidavits of garnishment without regard to their truth or falsity of the exact amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>due and owing at the time of signature\u201d. Corace was not charged with filing untrue or false affidavits. Nevertheless, his office procedures and the safeguards followed to avoid the filing of an improper affidavit were explored at the hearing. Careful records were maintained by Corace to avoid the filing of improper affidavits and imposition on debtors or the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">A \"methodology\u201d of a lawyer on behalf of his client, proper in itself, does not render him subject to bar discipline because it \"gives the appearance\u201d of impropriety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Corace was not charged in the formal complaint with failing to file with the court proofs of service of the writs of garnishment. Absent a showing that his failure to file proofs of service was more than a harmless oversight, that someone was prejudiced, this should not concern the State Bar Grievance Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The then Clerk of the Common Pleas Court of -Detroit charged Corace with improperly including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees (generally $45) as damages in a large number of actions commenced on written instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The formal complaint charged that Corace\u2019s practice was contrary to statutes and court rules and constituted \"overreaching, an abuse of process and abuse of the courts\u201d. It further charged Co-race with perpetrating a \"fraud on the Court and upon the litigants\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In several instances, judges of the common pleas court had disallowed Corace\u2019s claim that he had a right to add attorney\u2019s fees as part of the damages. The hearing panel concluded that Corace\u2019s concession in his answer to the formal complaint that \"certain judges of the Common Pleas Court of Detroit have refused to award attorney\u2019s fees as part of the damages in said action, because they conceived they had discretion in the matter\u201d substantiated the \"conflict he was having on the question of awarding attorneys fees as part of damages. Clearly he knew he should seek Court review for unanimity on the question even if there be differing opinions. Further clarification of cases so well argued in the briefs could be viewed as necessary to the better Administration of Justice. This was not done. A definitive decision could have prevented the violation of Canon 15. (The Canon must be read in its entirety and understood.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Former Canon 15 provided that a lawyer may not \"do whatever may enable him to succeed in winning his client\u2019s cause\u201d. He may not violate the law or indulge in \"any manner of fraud or chicane. He may obey his own conscience and not that of his client.\u201d The Canon also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\"The lawyer owes 'entire devotion to the interest of the client, warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights and the exertion of his utmost learning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ability,\u2019 to the end that nothing be taken or be withheld from him, save by the rules of law, legally applied. No fear of judicial disfavor or public unpopularity should restrain him from the full discharge of his duty. In the judicial forum the client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy and defense that is authorized by the law of the land, and he may expect his lawyer to assert every such remedy or defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In including a $45 attorney\u2019s fee as part of the claimed damages in actions commenced in the common pleas court, Corace relied on written agreements between the obligor-defendants and his obligee-clients, the owners and holders of commercial and chattel paper, providing that upon default and reference to an attorney the obligor would pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees expended by the obligee.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In <em>In re Schafer\u2019s Bakeries, </em>155 F Supp 902, 909 (ED Mich, 1957), the court held that agreements \"for payment of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses do not violate the public policy of Michigan, are also valid under the law of Michigan and are therefore enforceable under Michigan law\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>We need not decide whether <em>Schafer\u2019s Bakeries </em>accurately states the law of Michigan. In light of that decision, it cannot be said that Corace was \"violating the law\u201d or indulging in \"any manner of fraud or chicane\u201d in asserting a right of his clients to recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. Seeking, undeterred by \"fear of judicial disfavor\u201d, to enforce his client\u2019s claimed contractual right to recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, was consistent with Corace\u2019s duty to insure that \"nothing be taken or be withheld from [his client], save by the rules of law, legally applied\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">A lawyer has no duty, professional or moral, to appeal an adverse decision. Each adverse ruling resulted in a monetary loss of $45. The costs of appeal might well have been regarded as outweighing the benefit of possible vindication in a higher court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Corace was not obliged to obtain a \"definitive decision\u201d from an appellate court. He could not insist that his client appeal an adverse ruling of a judge of the Common Pleas Court of Detroit. If his client had been interested in appealing, Corace could not have assured him that if the circuit court ruled against him either the Court of Appeals or this Court would grant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The amount Corace sought as attorney\u2019s fees was specifically set forth in the declaration filed in each action: \"The plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees of $45.\u201d Attached to the declaration was a copy of the written agreement between Corace\u2019s client and the defendant requiring payment of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.__</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>If the judges of the Common Pleas Court of Detroit desire a local court rule requiring clearer disclosure of contractual claims for attorney\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they may proceed as provided in GCR 1963, 927. That rule states that this Court must be notified in writing ten days before the adoption or amendment of any local court rule and that the adoption or continuance of such a rule is subject to the superintending control of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The hearing panel and Grievance Board reprimanded Corace essentially for representing his clients too zealously and for acting contrary to controlling precedent. We have previously referred to former Canon 15 which the Grievance Board apparently interpreted as restricting a lawyer to conduct which is clearly within the bounds of the law. Corace contends that the language of the Canon, \"the great trust of the lawyer is to be performed within and not without the bounds of the law\u201d, bars only conduct clearly without the bounds of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Present Canon 7 reads: \"A lawyer should represent his client zealously within the bounds of the law.\u201d The accompanying statement of Ethical Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>siderations supports Corace\u2019s construction of this language.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Disciplinary Rule 7-\u00cd02(A) also elaborates on the lawyer\u2019s obligation to represent a client within the bounds of the law. It states that in his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not advance a claim or defense \"when he knows or when it is obvious that such action would serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another\u201d; and that he may not \"knowingly advance a claim or defense that is unwarranted under existing law, except that he may advance such claim or defense if it can be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">There are a large number of gray areas in the law. When a question is doubtful, the lawyer\u2019s obligation to his client permits him to assert the view of the law most favorable to his client\u2019s position. The <em>in terrorem </em>effect the Grievance Board reads into the Canon would unduly restrict a lawyer in fulfilling his professional responsibility of representing his client \"competently\u201d (Canon 6) and \"zealously\u201d (Canon 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We agree with Corace that our adversary system \"intends, and expects, lawyers to probe the outer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>limits of the bounds of the law, ever searching for a more efficacious remedy, or a more successful defense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">A lawyer may not properly be disciplined for acting without the bounds of the law unless it is established that he knowingly advanced a claim or defense that was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">If a trial judge or local court administrator believes a construction of a statute or court rule advanced by a lawyer is erroneous and the lawyer refuses to follow the judge\u2019s construction in subsequent cases and the question appears to be eluding appellate review, the judge or local court administrator may so advise this Court which, in the exercise of its general superintending control, may consider granting leave to appeal<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or promulgating an administrative order or court rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Reversed. The State Bar Grievance Administrator shall reimburse Corace for all amounts he may have paid to the Administrator in respect to costs assessed by the Grievance Board.</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-9\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. E. Brennan, T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, and M. S.

The Administrator\u2019s formal complaint repeated the allegation that Corace had been advised that the records were located at the corporate offices but stated that Coopes had requested that Corace obtain a \"release\u201d from his client, not from the lawyer who formerly represented his client. The hearing panel did not advert to these factual contentions in its findings of fact or conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> Corace testified that the details of the action against Coopes had been handled by one of his associate lawyers..Corace further testified that the first he knew about the stipulation was when he received the \"first letter\u201d from the Administrator. He said that he explained to the lawyer employed by him that he had made it a practice <em>not </em>to sign another lawyer\u2019s name to a pleading even with the lawyer\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The lawyer employed by Corace testified that the unauthorized signature resulted from a misunderstanding he had with a clerk he was supervising. The clerk erroneously signed both lawyers\u2019 names and filed the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">There was no other testimony relating to this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\"> The following are the relevant questions and answers on this concession by Corace:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\"><em>\"Q. </em>You are responsible for your employees in your office, are you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\"><em>'IA. </em>I am, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>So, whatever they do, the responsibility is yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir, legally. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\"><em>\"The Chairman: </em>I think in fairness to everyone you are contending that you do not have the responsibility to know what is going on in your office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\"><em>\"A. </em>No, sir, that is why I answered the question the way I did.
