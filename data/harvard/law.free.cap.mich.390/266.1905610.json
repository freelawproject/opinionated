Also, we consider whether a prosecutor may attempt to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility on cross-examination by questions relating to the duration and details of prior prison sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">I\u2014FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Defendant was jury convicted of rape (MCLA 750.520; MSA 28.788) and kidnapping (MCLA 750.349; MSA 28.581). The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, 25 Mich App 62; 180 NW2d 900 (1970). We granted leave on July 17, 1972. 387 Mich 809-810.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">On direct examination Rappuhn testified that in August, 1966 he had been convicted of attempted felonious assault on a plea of guilty. He also admitted three other arrests which led to convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">On cross-examination the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>You were arrested at that time for kidnapping and felonious assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\"><em>\"Mr. H\u00faoe [defendant\u2019s counsel]: </em>Objection, your Honor, the only thing that the Defendant has admitted he was arrested and convicted of attempted felonious assault. That\u2019s all there is to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\"><em>\"The Court: </em>What is the objection; are you just repeating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>He said something about attempted kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\"><em>\"Mr. Davey [assistant prosecuting attorney]: </em>I didn\u2019t say 'attempted\u2019, I said kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>I object, he was convicted of attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>felonious assault. I don\u2019t think the Prosecutor is able to inquire into the details surrounding the arrest. That is all there was to it, he admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">After much discussion the judge overruled the objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Well, the Court is going to allow the Prosecutor to inquire as to other arrests of this Defendant. Your objection is on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\"You may return the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">And the question about the kidnapping was asked and answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\"><em>\"Q. (By Mr. Davey): </em>Have you ever been arrested for kidnapping, Mr. Rappuhn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\"><em>\"Q. </em>And have you ever been arrested for felonious assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\"><em>\"A. </em>At the same time, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\"><em>\"Q. </em>The same time as the kidnapping charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-14\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>Court please, for the record, I\u2019m going to object on the grounds that the Defendant answered the question, he has given the information about the February, 1966, arrest and conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-15\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-16\"><em>\"Q. (By Mr. Davey): </em>You were charged with two counts at that time, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-17\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>Court please, the same objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-18\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Are you objecting on the grounds it is repetitious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-19\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>Yes, your Honor, and going into the details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-20\"><em>\"The Court: </em>He isn\u2019t going into the details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-21\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-22\"><em>\"The Court: </em>He hasn\u2019t gone into details as yet, Counsel, he\u2019s just repeating, bringing out the repetition of the answer which you already elicited. It is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-23\"><em>\"Q. (By Mr. Davey): </em>For that particular offense you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>were charged with two counts, is that correct, kidnapping and felonious assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><em>\"Mr. Hooe: </em>Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\"><em>\"The Witness: </em>Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The fact that the defendant had been charged with kidnapping, the very offense with which he was charged in this case, was argued to the jury during the prosecutor\u2019s final argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\"Here is a man convicted of beginning in 1960 of simple larceny, then at a later time in 1960 of unlawfully driving away an automobile, who was arrested for breaking and entering, although not convicted in 1964, was convicted of another crime, larceny from an auto, in 1960 <em>[sic; </em>actually 1966] was charged with kidnapping, the very same offense, and felonious assault, although he pled guilty to a lesser offense. The year before this happened, he was charged with a separate\u2014 this offense\u2014on a separate occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">II\u2014IMPEACHMENT OF DEFENDANT BY USE OF PRIOR ARRESTS</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">In the recently decided case of <em>People v Falkner, </em>389 Mich 682, 695; 209 NW2d 193, 199 (1973), Chief Justice T. M. Kavanagh speaking for this Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">\"[I]n the examination or cross-examination of <em>any witness, </em>no inquiry may be made regarding prior arrests or charges against such witness which did not result in conviction; neither may such witness be examined with reference to higher original charges which have not resulted in conviction, whether by plea or trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">In <em>Falkner </em>the credibility of alibi witnesses was impeached by reference to an arrest record. Here it was defendant himself who was impeached by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>reference to his arrest record. <em>Falkner </em>clearly speaks to the impeachment of any witness by use of an arrest record. Therefore, defendant is entitled to a new trial on the basis of <em>Falkner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Ill\u2014IMPEACHMENT BY REFERENCE TO THE LENGTH AND DETAILS OF SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">As we stated above, defendant is entitled to a new trial under the rule of <em>Falkner. </em>However, since a new trial is required this Court will address itself to one of the other issues which might arise again at the new trial. That is, may a prosecutor impeach a witness\u2019s credibility on cross-examination by questions relating to the duration and details of prior prison sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\n<em>A. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">On direct, defendant did not make any statement as to the length of sentence resulting from his prior convictions to which he did testify. On cross-examination the following exchange took place between the defendant and prosecutor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And where had you lived three days prior to this particular crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\"><em>\"A. </em>Brighton, Michigan; Howell, Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-12\"><em>\"Q. </em>What kind of institution were you living in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\"><em>\u201dA. </em>Camp Brighton Prison Camp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-14\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You had just been released from prison three days when this crime occurred, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-15\"><em>\u201dA. </em>Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-16\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And what offense were you in prison for at the time you were released?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-17\"><em>'A. </em>Attempted felonious assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-18\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>And what was your sentence, Mr. Rappuhn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-19\"><em>\u201dA. </em>One and a half to two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-20\"><em>\"Q. </em>And how much time did you serve on the one and a half to two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-21\"><em>'A. </em>Eighteen months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>\"Q. </em>Now, have you ever been incarcerated in any other penal institution besides the State Prison Camp at Brighton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir, I was in Michigan Training Unit, Ionia, Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>What year was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\"><em>'A. </em>1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\"><em>\"Q. </em>And how long were you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\"><em>\"A. </em>Approximately ten and a half months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\"><em>\"Q. </em>And for what offense were you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\"><em>\"A. </em>Larceny from an auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\"><em>\"Q. </em>And what was your sentence as a result of that conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\"><em>\"A. </em>One and a half to five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-15\"><em>\"Q. </em>How much time did you serve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-16\"><em>\"A. </em>Altogether?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-17\"><em>\"Q. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-18\"><em>\"A. </em>Approximately three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-19\"><em>\"Q. </em>And what do you mean 'altogether,\u2019 did you serve in a different way; what do you mean by that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-20\"><em>\"A. </em>I went back as a parole violator on attempted felonious assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-21\"><em>\"Q: </em>You were on parole when that offense occurred, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-22\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-23\">\n<em>B. Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-24\">Former Justice, now Judge, O\u2019Hara in <em>People v Nelson White, </em>26 Mich App 35; 181 NW2d 803 (1970) considered this exact issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-25\">In this case, on cross-examination defendant admitted that he had been convicted. The prosecution then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-26\"><em>\"Q. </em>And what was your sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-27\"><em>\"Mr. Evans [defendant\u2019s counsel]: </em>I\u2019ll object to that as being immaterial, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>\"The Court: </em>The sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW1\"><em>\"Mr. Evans: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\"><em>\"The Court: </em>I overrule your objection. This is cross-examination. He is testing his credibility. He may answer the question.\u201d 26 Mich App 35, 38-39; 181 NW2d 803, 805.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Court of Appeals held that the introduction of the length of defendant\u2019s prior sentence was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">We agree with Judge O\u2019Hara\u2019s analysis and reasoning, which he pithily set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\"It is the prior conduct undertaken by the accused, and not the ensuing punishment, which is relevant. Moreover, sentences for the same offense often vary from tribunal to tribunal and from judge to judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\"We choose not to speculate whether, and to what extent, the testimony of a maximum ten-year sentence may have influenced the jury and denied the defendant the constitutional guarantee of a fair and impartial trial. The introduction of the length of defendant\u2019s prior sentence was reversible error. We cannot say that it did not inure to the prejudice of the defendant. MCLA \u00a7 769.26 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1096). The statute permitting evidence of prior convictions should be strictly construed.\u201d 26 Mich App 35, 39-40; 181 NW2d 803, 805-806.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The length of sentence, the conditions under which served and so on, as Judge O\u2019Hara observes, are not defendant\u2019s conduct but an uncertain sequel. It is defendant\u2019s conduct that is relevant and by which his credibility may be tested. We therefore hold that it is error to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>defendant as to the duration and details of his prior prison sentences to test his credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We are not unmindful on the one hand of <em>People v Kotek, </em>306 Mich 408, 412; 11 NW2d 7, 9 (1943) where we implied that the use of a previous prison sentence to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility would have been reversible error had the reference to the sentence been made in the presence of the jury. We, however, prefer to base our decision on the factual precedent of <em>White </em>and Judge O\u2019Hara\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We are not unmindful on the other hand of the traditional leading cases of <em>Wilbur v Flood, </em>16 Mich 40; 93 Am Dec 203 (1867) and <em>Clemens v Conrad, </em>19 Mich 170, 174 (1869). These cases, however, deal not with questions of the duration and details of prior prison sentences but with \"whether [defendant] was ever confined in the state prison\u201d in the first case or \"whether he had been convicted\u201d in the second case. Consequently, <em>Wilbur </em>and <em>Clemens </em>are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Neither of the two Michigan statutes dealing with credibility touch this exact issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Thus, a prosecutor may not impeach a witness on cross-examination by referring to the length and details of a sentence at the new trial which we have granted on the basis of <em>Falkner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-6\">T.

E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMW\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I agree that evidence of the length of sentence, the place of confinement, or the time of parole are all irrelevant to credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Any former decisions of this Court, which are to the contrary, ought to be overruled in a case properly presenting the issue. The issue is not presented here because no objection was made to the irrelevant testimony. In that respect, this case is to be distinguished from <em>People v White, </em>26 Mich App 35; 181 NW2d 803 (1970), where the objection was clearly made, and the trial court ruled erroneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The distinction between this case and <em>White </em>is not casual. It lies at the heart of the functions of both trial judges and appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">When a trial judge makes an error in a ruling upon an objection to irrelevant evidence, the appellate court performs its traditional function in ordering reversal and new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>But what error does the trial court commit when irrelevant evidence is received without objection? What should a trial judge have done?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Should he object?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Should he order the testimony stricken and instruct the jury that it is irrelevant?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Should he reprimand counsel for asking the question or opposing counsel for failing to object?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Should he excuse the jury and make a separate record establishing that the failure to object was strategic and deliberate?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Should he declare a mistrial <em>sua sponte? </em>(And, if so, does jeopardy attach?)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The Canons of Judicial Ethics require a trial judge to avoid interference in the trial of causes, except in rare instances to prevent miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">The expanding notion in this Court that a trial judge in a criminal case has some overriding duty to step into the breach whenever he feels that defense counsel needs help is a dangerous departure from our established jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">It is difficult to suppose that the concept can be limited to the protection of the defendant. Certainly, the people are also entitled to a fair trial. If a previously convicted prosecution witness were cross-examined by defense counsel concerning the details of his incarceration, without objection from the prosecutor, would not the trial judge be obligated to intrude?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Haying thus undertaken the burden, sans objection, to keep all irrelevant matter from the jury, from whatever source, the role of the trial judge in a criminal case is completely transformed. He is no longer the impartial referee in an adversary proceeding. He becomes the censor who must, upon pain of reversal, pass judgment upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>admissibility of every question asked by either lawyer. The judge becomes the central figure in the trial. He is, in effect, the inquisitor. Being obligated to interfere with cqunsel\u2019s questioning without invitation or objection, his silence denotes approval of the relevance and admissibility of every question asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Being required to assume responsibility for every question posed, trial judges will reasonably expect an opportunity to consider the propriety of each question before it is heard by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">When the trial judge has thus assumed the rol\u00e9 of inquisitor, he will bear the responsibility for successful as well as errorless prosecution. And, in that day, who will stand between the prisoner at the bar and his interrogator?</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-7\">M. S. Coleman, J., concurred with T. E.
