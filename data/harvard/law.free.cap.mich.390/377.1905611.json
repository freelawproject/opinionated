First, is a felony defendant charged by grand jury indictment with an offense triable in recorder\u2019s court entitled to a preliminary examination? Second, is a d\u00e9fendant charged by grand jury indictment with an offense punishable by not more than one year imprisonment entitled to a preliminary examination in recorder\u2019s court? We answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">I \u2014FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Barbara, Weinbaum, and four other defendants who have joined in this appeal, were indicted by a Wayne County citizens\u2019 grand jury for conspiring in Detroit to solicit personal injury claims. MCLA 750.410; MSA 28.642; MCLA 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1). The conspiracy statute elevates the penalty for the offense in furtherance of which the alleged conspiracy was directed\u2014here, solicitation of personal injury claims, a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months imprisonment in the county jail and/or fine not to exceed $500\u2014to a maximum of one year\u2019s imprisonment and fine of $1,000, or both. MCLA 750.157a(c); MSA 28.354(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">After arraignment on these charges, the case was assigned on April 18, 1973, to a recorder\u2019s court magistrate for examination. At that time, the magistrate ordered, over defense objections, that the preliminary examinations be held the following morning. Defendants filed complaint for superintending control in Wayne County Circuit Court, seeking an adjournment of the preliminary examinations pending delivery of the grand jury transcript to the defendants. The requested stay was granted by a circuit judge. Then, however, the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>corder\u2019s court examining magistrate entered an order on April 20, 1973, stating that the defendants had no right to a preliminary examination, and setting a trial date for April 30, 1973. The magistrate formally denied the defendants\u2019 motion for preliminary examination by order of April 30,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which by order filed June 4, 1973, affirmed the denial of preliminary examination, \"for the reason that under the authority of <em>People v Duncan, </em>388 Mich 489 [201 NW2d 629] (1972), the right to a preliminary examination from a grand jury indictment extends only to those accused of a felony.\u201d In our November 21,1973, decision this Court reversed and held that the defendants were entitled to a preliminary examination. The case is before us again upon grant of rehearing on the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">II \u2014PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION &amp; GRAND JURY INDICTMENT FOR FELONY</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">We find that a felony defendant charged with an offense triable in recorder\u2019s court comes within the rule of <em>People v Duncan, </em>388 Mich 489, 502; 201 NW2d 629, 635 (1972), which held that: \"In <em>all </em>future cases wherein a defendant is accused of a felony, the right to a preliminary examination shall exist.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">In the three cases consolidated in <em>Duncan, </em>the defendants were indicted by citizens\u2019 grand jury, as in the instant case. Justice Adams reasoned in his majority opinion that this Court had inherent power to deal with the preliminary examination issue \"as a matter of criminal procedure\u201d 388 Mich 489, 502; 201 NW2d 629, 635 and ruled that defendants charged with a felony prosecuted by grand jury indictment should be entitled to the same right to preliminary examination as exists for defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>be charged by information. The Court concluded by prospectively establishing the right to a preliminary examination in \"allfuture cases\u201d charging felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Ill \u2014PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION &amp; INDICTMENT FOR ONE YEAR OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The one year misdemeanor offense with which the defendants are charged, conspiracy to solicit personal injury claims, occurred, according to the citizens\u2019 grand jury indictment, in the City of Detroit at a named address from on or about December, 1971, to on or about February, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The recorder\u2019s court act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\"Except as provided in the preceding section, prosecutions in the recorder\u2019s court for crimes, <em>misdemeanors, </em>and offenses arising under the laws of this state, and within the jurisdiction of said court, shall be by information as provided for in chapter 261 of the Compiled Laws of 1871 * * * .\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCLA 726.13; MSA 27.3563.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The \"preceding section\u201d (MCLA 726.12; MSA 27.3562) of the recorder\u2019s court act provides that indictments presented by a grand jury to the Wayne Circuit Court for offenses committed in Detroit shall be transmitted to recorder\u2019s court; it thus confers jurisdiction on recorder\u2019s court for offenses prosecuted by grand jury indictment and does not speak of procedural matters such as preliminary examinations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382a\">*382a</page-number>The Compiled Laws of 1871, ch 261, referenced in MCLA 726.13; MSA 27.3563, quoted above, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\"(7937.) SECTION 1. <em>The People of the State of Michigan enact, </em>That the several courts of this State shall possess and may exercise the same power and jurisdiction to hear, try, and determine prosecutions upon information for crimes, misdemeanors, and offenses, to issue writs and process, and do all other acts therein, as they possess and may exercis\u00e9 in cases of like prosecutions upon indictment.\u201d (Emphasis in 1871 Compiled Laws).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\"(7944.) SEC. 8. No information shall be filed against any person for any offense, until such person shall have had a preliminary examination therefor, as provided by law, before a justice of the peace, or other examining magistrate or officer, unless such person shall waive his right to such examination * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\"(7945.) SEC. 9. The recorder\u2019s court of the city of Detroit shall be deemed and held to be one of the courts referred to in the first section of this act, and the provisions of this act shall apply and extend to said court, in the same manner and to the same extent as to any of the courts of this State, referred to in said first section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">This 1859 act was repealed in 1927 by 1927 PA 175. However, the portion of 1871 CL 7944, quoted above, was reenacted verbatim in 1927 PA 175; 1929 CL 17256. Sections 7937 and 7945 of the 1871 Compiled Laws were \"superseded\u201d and \"merged\u201d in the Compiled Laws of 1929, 1929 CL 17215. (See the historical note to that section.) This \"merged\u201d section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\"17215. SECTION 1. The several circuit courts of this state, the recorders\u2019 courts and any court of record having jurisdiction of criminal causes, shall possess and may exercise the same power and jurisdiction to hear, try, and determine prosecutions upon informations for crimes, misdemeanors and offenses, to issue writs and process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382b\">*382b</page-number>and do all other acts therein as they possess and may exercise in cases of like prosecutions upon indictments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">These provisions of the Compiled Laws of 1929 appear unchanged in the Compiled Laws of 1948, with \u00a7 17215 appearing at MCLA 767.1; MSA 28.941; and \u00a7 17256 (1871 CL 7944) appearing at MCLA 767.42; MSA 28.982.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Accordingly, statutory provisions 7937 and 7945 of the Compiled Laws of 1871, incorporated by reference in the recorder\u2019s court act, which enabled recorder\u2019s court, <em>inter alia, </em>to exercise jurisdiction to hear prosecutions upon information in like manner as upon indictment, have not been changed <em>in substance </em>since 1871. In <em>Duncan, </em>we recognized conversely that felony defendants charged by indictment should have the right to a preliminary examination, in like manner as defendants prosecuted by information. Under 1871 CL 7944, incorporated by reference in the recorder\u2019s court act, MCLA 726.13; MSA 27.3563, it is clearly stated that <em>'[n]o information shall be died against any person for any offense, until such person shall have had a preliminary examination.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reading <em>Duncan </em>in conjunction with this provision, since a preliminary examination is a condition precedent to prosecution by information, a preliminary examination must be required for defendants prosecuted by indictment as well for them to be treated in like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The Recorder\u2019s Court Local Rules do not restrict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382c\">*382c</page-number>the right to a preliminary examination to felony cases alone. Recorder\u2019s Court Local Rule 8 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\"The Examining Magistrate <em>shall conduct all preliminary examinations </em>and all arraignments <em>on </em>felony and <em>high misdemeanor warrants* </em>* * .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">It is significant that this Court, in 1972, considered amendment of Rule 8. It was proposed that Rule 8 be amended to read as follows: \"There shall not be a preliminary examination in any case that can be tried in a district court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Had this proposed change been adopted, the right to a preliminary examination in any case with a penalty of a year\u2019s imprisonment or less would have been abolished. The amendment, however, was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Clearly, the decision not to amend a rule is as important and material as the recognition that a rule has been amended. It demonstrates a reasoned choice among alternatives. Despite the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the district court act in 1968, MCLA 600.8311; MSA 27A.8311, as amended in 1969, denying the right to a preliminary examination in district courts for offenses punishable by imprisonment up to one year, this Court\u2019s reasoned choice in 1972 was <em>not </em>to abolish the right to a preliminary examination for \"high misdemeanor\u201d cases in recorder\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Moreover, in July, 1970, this Court approved amendments to Recorder\u2019s Court Local Rule 7 which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \"Misdemeanor Docket shall consist of all offenses and other matters cognizable by a District Judge (See C.L. 1948, 600.8311; MSA Sec. 27A.8311).\u201d Rule 7, \u00a7 2, Rules of the Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit. Section 8311 of the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382d\">*382d</page-number>court act had been amended in 1969 to provide that \"there shall not be a preliminary examination for any misdemeanor to be tried in a district court.\u201d 1969 PA 261; MCLA 600.8311(d); MSA 27A.8311(d). A district court has jurisdiction to try \"[mjisdemeanors punishable by a fine or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year, or both.\u201d MCLA 600.8311(a); MSA 27A.8311(a). Clearly, reading Recorder\u2019s Court Local Rule 7 in conjunction with Rule 8, this Court decided that recorder\u2019s court was to be treated differently from the district courts, in respect to the right to a preliminary examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The one year misdemeanor charged in the instant case is a \"high misdemeanor\u201d. Therefore, the right to a preliminary examination attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">This opinion relates strictly to the recorder\u2019s court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The procedures in district, municipal, and other courts are governed by different legislation and rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Court of Appeals order, and the ruling of the recorder\u2019s court magistrate are reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, Levin, M. S. Coleman, and J. W. Fitzgerald,  JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\"> MCLA 726.12; MSA 27.3562 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">\"Sec. 12. All indictments for offenses committed within the limits of the city of Detroit, which may be found and presented to the circuit court for the county of Wayne, by the grand jury of said county, shall be forthwith certified and transmitted by the clerk of said circuit court to said recorder\u2019s court, and thereupon said recorder\u2019s court shall have as full and complete jurisdiction of said indictments as if the same had been originally presented to said recorder\u2019s court, and shall have full power to take all further proceedings thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> It appears that at one time, perhaps from the inception of recorder\u2019s court, and until 1919, preliminary examinations were conducted for recorder\u2019s court by a police court. Since 1919, when police courts were abolished and their functions, \"including the holding of examinations,\u201d (1919 PA 369 \u00a7 10; MCLA 725.10; MSA 27.3950) transferred to the municipal courts, \"the judges of the recorder\u2019s court have held examinations to determine whether there was good cause to hold for trial persons who had been arrested.\u201d <em>People v Miller, </em>217 Mich 635, 639; 187 NW 366 (1922); <em>similarly, see People v Cason, </em>387 Mich 586; 198 NW2d 292 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\"> Proposed by a member of the Recorder\u2019s Court Rules Committee, and rejected by this Court, with one Justice not participating.
