Clark discriminated in renting on account of race or color. Another complaint filed with the CRC alleged that Mr. and Mrs. Frank Misko discriminated in refusing to allow complainants to purchase the Misko home.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Clark and the Miskos filed petitions in the circuit courts of the county of their residence seeking the removal of the CRC proceedings to the circuit court pursuant, to \u00a7 401a of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. That section provides that upon the filing of such a petition and payment of the required filing fee, \"the court shall immediately issue an order removing the complaint from the jurisdiction of the civil rights commission. The court shall assume jurisdiction of the proceedings and the civil rights commission shall take no further action in regard to the complaint upon receiving a copy of the court order.\u201d The petitions for removal were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">In upholding the constitutionality of the removal provision (\u00a7 401a), the Court of Appeals considered the so-called diminish-the-right clause of Const 1963, art 5, \u00a729<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> establishing the CRC. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The Court said that the debate at the Constitutional Convention \"confirms our opinion that the language involved means just what it says, namely: a party to a proceeding before the CRC is entitled to a court determination on the complaint in lieu of a commission determination, if he so desires.\u201d <em>Michigan Civil Rights Commission v Clark, </em>42 Mich App 271, 275; 201 NW2d 658 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The Attorney General contends that the diminish-the-right clause does not create, or permit the Legislature to create, an automatic right to remove a proceeding from the jurisdiction of the CRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The Miskos assert that \u00a7 401a implements the diminish-the-right clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The amicus curiae, Michigan Real Estate Association, proffers an alternative analysis asserting that since the right of the complainants and of the CRC to proceed against Clark and the Miskos is derived from legislation* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Legislature can at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>tach any conditions it may wish to that right. The Legislature, says the amicus, may oust the CRC altogether from jurisdiction of a legislatively created right.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">There were statements by some delegates in the lengthy arguments at the Constitutional Convention which tend to support the view that the diminish-the-right clause was intended to create a constitutional right to remove any CRC proceeding to the courts. We are persuaded, however, that John B. Martin, the chairman of the committee responsible for the CRC proposal, speaking shortly before the final vote, expressed the ultimate under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>standing of the meaning of the diminish-the-right clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">\"Mr. President, it seems to me that it should be clear that this does not permit a defendant to take his cause elsewhere unless his rights are in some way being violated. He doesn\u2019t get out of dealing with the commission simply because he starts an action in a court. If he takes the action to a court, it is because his due process is being violated in some way, and if that is true, then he has a case. If it isn\u2019t, he has no case and he can be in court but he is also still involved with the commission and the commission can proceed just as it otherwise would, * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Just as \u00a7 29 of article 5 does not create any new civil rights (\u00e1ee fn 3) neither does it create a new judicial remedy. The diminish-the-right clause assures persons against whom CRC proceedings are instituted that, despite the constitutional status of the CRC, they may have recourse to the courts of this state if the CRC proceeds in a manner justifying judicial intervention or, as the amicus states it, \"under appropriate circumstances\u201d. \"[A]n individual against whom the Commission has proceeded may seek injunctive relief from threatened harm under the same principles applicable to threatened illegal action by other administrative agencies\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including further developments (after the adoption of the 1963 Constitution) of general application of such principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Section 29 obliges the CRC to \"investigate\u201d alleged discrimination and to \"secure\u201d the equal protection of civil rights and grants the CRC the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>power to \"issue appropriate orders\u201d and provides that an appeal from such an order \"shall be tried de novo before the circuit court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">CRC\u2019s duty to investigate alleged discrimination and to secure the equal protection of civil rights is qualified by the words \"in a manner which may be prescribed by law\u201d. The power to issue appropriate orders is subject to the qualification \"in accordance with the provisions of this constitution and of general laws governing administrative agencies\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">A balanced construction of \u00a7 29 requires recognition of limitations on the power of the Legislature to restrict the powers of the CRC. The CRC, just as the Legislature, Governor and this Court, derives its powers directly from the people under the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The Legislature, although it may legislate with regard to the exercise of executive and judicial functions, may not prevent the executive, or judicial branches from exercising their powers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the Legislature, although it may legislate - with regard to the CRC, may not do so in a manner which prevents the CRC from functioning effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The sense of the Constitution is that the CRC shall have the power to \"investigate\u201d, \"secure\u201d, and \"issue appropriate orders\u201d regarding any civil right guaranteed by law subject to reasonable regulation by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">While the Constitution contemplates the legislative enactment of reasonable regulations for CRC procedures and remedies,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8it does not authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>legislation preventing the CRC from securing equal protection of a civil right guaranteed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The removal provision, for all practical purposes, eliminates the constitutionally-expressed power of the CRC to investigate and secure the legislatively-created civil right against discrimination in the rental and sale of private housing by precluding the CRC from issuing an appropriate order in any case where the person charged timely exercises the statutory right of removal. If we were to hold the removal provision constitutional, the CRC would have no meaningful function in enforcing that civil right against persons who choose to exercise that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">It is not necessary to decide whether there is a civil right against discrimination in private rental and sale of housing apart from the provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Even if this civil right is legislatively derived, once it becomes a \"civil fight guaranteed by law\u201d the CRC has the power and the duty to investigate allegations of unconstitutional discrimination in the enjoyment of that right, to secure equal protection of that right, and to issue appropriate orders to enforce that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>We conclude that \u00a7401a is not a reasonable regulation of CRC procedures and remedies and it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">On the day following the filing with the CRC of the complaint against the Miskos, the CRC sought and obtained a circuit court injunction restraining the Miskos from taking any action to sell or otherwise dispose of their house and doing or procuring any act which would tend to render ineffectual any order of the CRC. Section 405 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 provides for the filing of such a petition to pres\u00e9rve the status quo pending CRC consideration of a complaint and charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The filing of such a petition, which does not seek an adjudication on the merits, does not operate as an election of remedies barring the CRC from issuing a charge pursuant to a complaint and issuing an appropriate order after a hearing on the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Reversed and remanded to the circuit courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>with directions that they dismiss the petitions removing the CRC proceedings to those courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b829-5\">T.

E. Brennan, \u00abJ.</author>\n<p id=\"ANd\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I do not accept my Brother\u2019s analysis of the constitutional role of the Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The commission is not a branch of government. Although it derives its power from the Constitution, it is still a commission, and prop\u00e9rly an arm of the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">It is a constitutional cbmmission, not unlike the State Highway Commission (art 5, \u00a728) or the State Civil Service Commission (art 11, \u00a7 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The Civil Rights Commission is not a court. It has no in personam jurisdiction over citizens. It may compel the attendance of witnesses only through the aid of a court of competent jurisdiction. Its final orders do not rise to the dignity of writs; that is to say, the commission has no power to direct the sheriff or other law enforcement officer to carry out its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Ultimate enforcement of commission orders requires application to a circuit court. In such case, the commission may appear in circuit court as a litigant, urging that the judicial power of the state be used to accomplish the end sought to be achieved by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">The framers of the Constitution clearly intended that the Civil Rights Commission would act as an advocate for the enforcement and protection of the civil rights of Michigan residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">But, it must be kept in mind that the Civil Rights Commission exists for the protection of civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>rights. Civil rights are those rights which are recognized by law, and cognizable by courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Therefore, when the Legislature provides for removal of a given dispute to circuit court, it does not limit or restrict the Civil Rights Commission in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The power of the circuit court to adjudge the guilt or innocence of an accused does not conflict with or infringe upon the power of the prosecuting attorney to investigate crimes or prosecute criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Similarly, the power of the courts to adjudicate civil rights does not infringe upon the power and duty of the Civil Rights Commission to secure such rights or investigate claimed infringements thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">It may be true that the Civil Rights Commission can accomplish more by investigation than by litigation, just as it may be that a prosecuting attorney can accomplish more by the threat of prosecution than by the prosecution itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">But, such a state of affairs is not only irregular, it is a denial of civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">A man may indeed do more than the law requires as a means of avoiding the expense and inconvenience of litigation, but it is unthinkable that any public agency should be empowered or permitted to use its investigatory powers as a form of coercion to achieve results which could not be commanded by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">The final paragraph of Const 1963, art 5, \u00a729, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">\"Appeals from final orders of the commission, including cease and desist orders and refusals to issue complaints, shall be tried de novo before the circuit court having jurisdiction provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Since, by constitutional mandate, any matter considered by the commission must be relitigated in circuit court upon the option of the respondent, I see no harm whatever in permitting such aggrieved party the right to accelerate his appeal by a legislatively approved process of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
