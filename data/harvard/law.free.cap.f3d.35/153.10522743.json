This Court affirmed her conviction on direct appeal, but vacated her sentence and remanded for re-sentencing because of the district court\u2019s misapplication of the sentencing guidelines. On remand, the district court revised its calculation of the amount of drugs and resen-tenced O\u2019Leary to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding that the district court properly followed our mandate, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-22\">' I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b247-23\">O\u2019Leary was convicted of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, a controlled substance. Authorities seized 51 pounds of phenylacetic acid (PA), which was used in calculating O\u2019Leary\u2019s base offense level. In the first presentence report (PSR), the probation officer converted the 51 pounds of PA to 19.32 pounds of phenylacetone (P2P), then converted 19.32 pounds of P2P to 3,645 kilograms of marijuana, which resulted in a base offense level under the sentencing guidelines of 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-24\">In an unpublished opinion on direct appeal, this Court found that the probation officer had \u201capparently used the Drug Equivalency Table (\u201cDET\u201d) to determine how much methamphetamine could be manufactured from 51 pounds of PA.\u201d We found that the use of the DET in calculating the base offense level was error and remanded for resentencing. We further stated that \u201c[t]he sentence should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>determined according to the formula enumerated in <em>[United States v. Hoster, </em>988 F.2d 1374, 1380-83 (5th Cir.1993) ],\u201d and remanded for resentencing \u201cconsistent with\u201d <em>Hoster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Upon resentencing, using a \u201cstandard\u201d DEA formula for the conversion of PA to methamphetamine, the probation officer converted 51 pounds of PA to 20.043 pounds of P2P, which he then converted to 19.32 pounds, or 8.76 kilograms, of methamphetamine. 8.76 kilograms of methamphetamine resulted in the same base offense level of 34. The probation officer stated that he took this Court\u2019s ruling and \u201cthe limited impact of <em>U.S. v. Hoster </em>\u201d into consideration in his recalcula-. tion. The court overruled O\u2019Leary\u2019s objections and adopted the revised calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">II. CALCULATION OF BASE OFFENSE LEVEL ON REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">O\u2019Leary argues that the district court failed to recalculate her base offense level in accordance with <em>Hoster, </em>988 F.2d at 1381-82, as mandated by this Court. In our opinion remanding for resentencing, we found that the district court erred by using the DET to determine how much methamphetamine could be manufactured from 51 pounds of PA. We stated that this calculation was an impermissible use of the DET and remanded for resentencing \u201caccording to the formula enumerated in <em>Hoster.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In <em>Hoster, </em>this Court held that the district court plainly erred by failing to consider the effect \u00f3f U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11 on the sentence of a defendant who had been convicted of possessing amphetamine with the intent to distribute it. 988 F.2d at 1381-83. Section 2Dl.ll(a) provides that the base offense level for unlawfully possessing a listed chemical is set forth in the Chemical Quantity Table. Hoster had agreed to purchase one pound of amphetamine.and 110 pounds of PA from an undercover agent. <em>Id. </em>at 1376. PA is a \u201clisted chemical.\u201d To calculate his sentence, the district court considered the attempted possession of the PA as relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1380. The PSR converted the PA to phenylacetone, converted the amphetamine and phenylacetone to marijuana using the \u00a7 2D1.1 DET, and then added the two amounts to come up with a base offense level of 34. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">This Court determined that, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.11, comment, (n. 3), when a defendant is convicted of an offense involving a listed chemical and a related offense involving a controlled substance, the appropriate method for calculating the defendant\u2019s sentence is to follow the grouping rules set out in \u00a7 3D1.2(d) on the basis of the aggregate quantity of the substances involved. <em>Id.' </em>at 1382. Applying this method resulted in a six-level reduction for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1382-83. We then concluded that the district court plainly erred by not taking \u00a7 2D1.11 into account. <em>Id. </em>at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In the case at bar, on remand for resen-tencing, the district court did not expressly mention \u00a7 2D1.11. Section 2D1.11(e)(1), however, cross references \u00a7 2D1.1 as the correct guideline when the offense involves the <em>manufacturing </em>of controlled substances. That section provides that if \u201cthe offense involved unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance, or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully, apply \u00a7 2D1.1 ... if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\u201d Commentary note 2 explains this subsection to mean, with respect to \u201cattempt,\u201d that the defendant \u201ccompleted the actions sufficient to constitute the offense of ... attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">O\u2019Leary\u2019s offense of conviction was conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, rather than manufacturing or attempting to manufacture methamphetamine. In <em>United States v. Bellazerius, </em>however, this Court recently stated that conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine is an offense encompassed by \u00a7 2Dl.ll(c)(l). 24 F.3d 698, 703-04 (5th Cir.1994). Rejecting an argument similar to O\u2019Leary\u2019s, we concluded that the district court did not err by using the Drug Quantity Table found in \u00a7 2D1.1 rather than the Chemical Quantity Table for' precursor chemicals found in \u00a7 2D1.11 to sentence two defendants convicted of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Additionally, we cited <em>United States v. Myers, </em>993 F.2d 713 (9th Cir.1993), in support of the conclusion reached in <em>Bellazerius. </em>24 F.3d at 704 n. 18. In <em>Myers, </em>the Ninth Circuit noted that Appendix A listed \u00a7 2D1.1 as the guideline applicable to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), and that \u00a7 2D1.11 cross-referenced \u00a7 2D1.1 as the correct guideline when the offense involves the manufacturing of controlled substances. <em>Myers, </em>993 F.2d at 716. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine with intent to distribute, there was \u201cno reason the offense of his conviction should not determine the guideline used to calculate his sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">O\u2019Leary argues that <em>\u201cBellazerius </em>is inapplicable because Ms. O\u2019Leary has never asked, as did those defendants, that her [base offense level] be based solely on \u00a7 2D1.11. Rather, she asks only that that provision\u2019s effect on \u00a7 2D1.1 be taken into account as is specifically required by this Court\u2019s mandate to follow <em>Hoster.\u201d </em>O\u2019Leary further argues that if <em>Bellazerius </em>is read to conflict with this Court\u2019s mandate, the law of the case doctrine controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">However, regardless of our decision in <em>Bel-lazerius, </em>O\u2019Leary \u201ccompleted the actions sufficient to constitute ... attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.11, comment, (n. 2). O\u2019Leary attempted a \u201ccook,\u201d an attempt to produce methamphetamine from PA, in March 1989, supplied materials necessary for a cook, and acted as a go-fer, user, transporter, and helper with cooks. A hand-written formula was also discovered in O\u2019Leary\u2019s handwriting. <em>See United States v. Acuna, </em>9 F.3d 1442, 1447-48 (9th Cir.1993) (evidence showed defendant \u201cintended to manufacture methamphetamine and ... took a substantial step towards the completion of that objective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">O\u2019Leary\u2019s offense of conviction was conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, an offense encompassed by the cross-referencing provision in \u00a7 2Dl.ll(e)(l), and her base offense level of 34 under \u00a7 2D1.1 was greater than that under \u00a7 2D1.11 (possession of 20 kilograms or more of PA yields a base offense level of 28). Thus, \u00a7 2D1.1 was the applicable provision. Further, as instructed, the district court considered <em>Hoster </em>and did not use the DET to determine how much methamphetamine could be manufactured from 51 pounds of PA. Although the district court did not specifically state that it used the cross-referencing provision in \u00a7 2D1.11(c)(1) to arrive at its application of \u00a7 2D 1.1, the court reached the correct result by applying \u00a7 2D1.1. As the court recognized, Hosier\u2019s effect on O\u2019Leary\u2019s sentencing was limited by the fact that, unlike Host-er, O\u2019Leary was convicted of conspiracy to <em>manufacture </em>a controlled substance. Thus, the district court\u2019s resentencing of O\u2019Leary was not inconsistent with <em>Hoster </em>or our instructions on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
