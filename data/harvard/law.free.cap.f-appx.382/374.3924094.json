He argues that the immigration judge (IJ) failed to consider all of the relevant factors and improperly weighed the factors that he did consider. The Government has moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">When, as in this case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopts the IJ\u2019s decision as its own, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). As a general rule, we have jurisdiction to review BIA removal orders, but because the IJ denied Perez\u2019s application for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b on the merits, we lack jurisdiction to review his challenge to that unfavorable exercise of discretion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Although Perez contends that his claim presents a question of law that we have jurisdiction to resolve, c/ \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we have held that a claim that the IJ did not consider all of the relevant factors in denying relief under \u00a7 1229b(b) does not present a question of law. <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Perez\u2019s claim does not fall within \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), and we do not have jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">MOTION GRANTED; PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
