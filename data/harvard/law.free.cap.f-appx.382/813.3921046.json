He contends that the indictment\u2019s reference to \u201ca\u201d visual depiction necessarily meant the original video and that the statute did not include later copies of the original video. We review <em>de novo </em>allegations of duplicity. <em>See United States v. Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2007). An indictment is duplicitous where it \u201ccharges two or more separate and distinct crimes in a single count.\u201d <em>United States v. Burton, </em>871 F.2d 1566, 1573 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-19\">Here, contrary to McBurnette\u2019s argument, section 2251(a) does not require that a defendant can be prosecuted based upon only the original visual depiction. Instead, the statute criminalizes using, persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing any minor to engage in <em>\u201cany </em>sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing <em>any </em>visual depiction of such conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) (emphasis added). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>by the plain language of the statute, any of the five video recordings the government introduced at trial, whether the original or a later copy, could fulfill the elements of a section 2251(a) violation. By introducing the videos, the government simply explained that McBurnette could violate the statute in multiple ways; and an indictment is permitted to charge a defendant with violating a statute in more than one way in a single count. <em>See Burton, </em>871 F.2d at 1573-74 (in the context of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 violation, explaining that acts of embezzling and converting government property simply constituted two separate ways that a section 641 violation could occur, not separate crimes). We conclude that the indictment was not duplicitous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGCM\">McBurnette argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the warrant was based on stale information: the last incident of alleged sexual contact had occurred almost two years before and, thus, no factual basis existed for believing that the items to be seized still were present at his residence. In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review \u201cthe findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Mercer, </em>541 F.3d 1070, 1073-74 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 954, 173 L.Ed.2d 150 (2009). And we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party \u2014 here, the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"A0F\">The staleness doctrine \u201crequires that-, the information supporting the government\u2019s application for a warrant must show that probable cause exists at the time the warrant issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1264 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cProbable cause to support a search warrant exists when the totality of the circumstances allow a conclusion that there is a fair probability of finding contraband or evidence at a particular location.\u201d <em>United States v. Brundidge, </em>170 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1999). Whether information is stale is determined \u201con the peculiar facts of each case.\u201d <em>Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"A9ni\">We conclude that the information in the warrant affidavit was not stale. Here, the victim spoke to police officers almost two years after the alleged sexual contact with McBurnette ended; and she detailed the incidents that had occurred, including that McBurnette had made her watch child pornography with him. The officer who made the warrant affidavit (which -provided for the seizure of videotapes) told the warrant-issuing court that pedophiles never dispose of their child pornography; therefore, she had reason to believe that the pornography still would be in McBurnette\u2019s house even though the sexual abuse had occurred almost two years before. This statement directly relates to the habits of the accused and the character of the items sought, appropriate factors in the staleness determination. <em>See id. </em>(when determining staleness, courts should consider the length <em>of </em>time, \u201cnature of the suspected crime (discrete crimes or ongoing conspiracy), habits of the accused, character of the items sought, and nature and function of the premises to be searched\u201d). And the affidavit indicated that the sexual abuse occurred multiple times and was not an isolated event, so the time between the cessation of the conduct and obtaining the warrant was \u201cof less significance.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(in the staleness inquiry, \u201c[i]f an affidavit recites activity indicating protracted or continuous conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>time is of less significance\u201d than in the case of an isolated incident).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">We now address McBurnette\u2019s sentencing challenges. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2007). McBurnette argues that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), because, before trial, he offered to stipulate that he had sexual contact with the victim, but the government would not accept his stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">A defendant who exercises his con- \u2022 stitutional right to trial may receive an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction in \u201crare situations,\u201d such as \u201cwhere a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues\u201d unrelated to factual guilt, such as a constitutional challenge to a statute. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), comment, (n.2). But here \u2014 contrary to his argument that he contested only constitutional and jurisdictional issues \u2014 McBurnette challenged issues about his factual guilt. He failed to admit that the videotapes were produced using materials that had traveled in interstate commerce, which was an essential element for the government to prove. So, the court was entitled to deny McBurnette an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction because he \u201cfalsely denie[d] ... conduct for which he [was] accountable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>115 F.3d 1531, 1537 (11th Cir.1997). And the district court denied the reduction after considering a pre-trial psychological evaluation that McBurnette introduced as evidence, which indicated that McBurnette had not come to terms with his acts. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), comment, (n.2) (where a defendant proceeds to trial, a district court should make its acceptance of responsibility determination based mainly on pre-trial statements and conduct). McBurnette has failed to show that the district court\u2019s denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">McBurnette also argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on its conclusion that McBurnette had care, custody or supervisory control over the victim, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5). Section 2G2.1(b)(5) provides for a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the defendant \u201cwas a parent, relative, or legal guardian of the minor involved in the offense, or if the minor was otherwise in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant.\u201d This enhancement \u201cis intended to have a broad application and includes offenses involving a minor entrusted to a defendant, whether temporarily or permanently.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The district court committed no clear error in assessing this enhancement. When the victim visited McBurnette, he instructed her not to bring the dog into his house and told her not to tell anyone about the sexual abuse. And the victim\u2019s mother would call McBurnette when it was time for the victim to return home. These acts indicate that McBurnette had temporary supervisory control over the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-12\">. The victim in this case was McBurnette\u2019s neighbor, a seven-year-old female. The child would go to McBumette's home to visit her dog, which McBurnette kept for the victim\u2019s family. On many occasions, McBurnette sexually abused the child and filmed the sexual contact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AmmJ\">. Also contrary to McBurnette\u2019s argument, section 2251(a) does not require that the jury agree on which visual representation, if there is more than one, satisfied the elements because the creation of \u201cany\u201d visual depiction is sufficient to violate the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">. We reject McBurnette\u2019s argument that section 2251 violates the Commerce Clause because the conduct it prohibits does not affect interstate commerce and because no evidence showed that he sold or delivered visual depictions of the sexual conduct in interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>commerce. These arguments are foreclosed by Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1284-86 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding the application of section 2251(a) to a defendant who produced intrastate pornographic photographs, but used materials that had traveled in interstate commerce); <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>446 F.3d 1210, 1218 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that \"it is within Congress\u2019s authority to regulate all intrastate possession of child pornography, not just that which has traveled in interstate commerce or has been produced using materials that have traveled in interstate commerce\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
