California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Colin-Garcia has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Article III, section 2, of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Upon revoking her supervised release, the district court sentenced Colin-Garcia to 15 months of imprisonment, but the court did not impose any additional term of supervised release. During the pen-dency of this appeal, Colin-Garcia completed her term of imprisonment and has been discharged from prison. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for us to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is DISMISSED as moot, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
