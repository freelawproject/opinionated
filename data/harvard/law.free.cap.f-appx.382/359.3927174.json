In his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reduction of sentence, identified as arising under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Santos contends that the district court erroneously calculated the advisory sentencing guidelines range when it failed to reduce his offense level for his minimal role in the offense and when it attributed a larger quantity of marijuana to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Section 3582(c) provides the statutory basis for the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment, viz., (1) on motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), (2) when authorized by Fed. R.CRIM.P. 35 or statute, or (3) if the defendant\u2019s guidelines range has been lowered subsequently. None of these conditions is present in this ease. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), (b). Likewise, because Santos did not file a notice of appeal from his judgment of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 is not available as a jurisdictional basis for his motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3742; <em>see also United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Consequently, Santos\u2019s motion is an unauthorized motion without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. The district court\u2019s denial of Santos\u2019s motion for reduction of his sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
