R.Crim.P. 35(b). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Agnew was indicted for drug trafficking in 2003. As part of a plea agreement, Agnew pleaded guilty to one count; he agreed to cooperate with the government. On its part, the government reserved the right to evaluate Agnew\u2019s cooperation and to share its evaluation with the court at the time of sentencing. The plea agreement provided that the government might, at or before sentencing, make a motion for a downward departure or, post-sentencing, make a Rule 35 motion for reduction of sentence, \u201c[i]f in the sole and unreviewable judgment\u201d of the government, Agnew\u2019s substantial assistance so warranted. The plea agreement provided further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">The defendant acknowledges and agrees, however, that nothing in this Agreement may be construed to require this Office to file such a motion and that this Office\u2019s assessment of the nature, value, truthfulness, completeness, and accuracy of the defendant\u2019s cooperation shall be binding on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">At sentencing, the government requested a sentence at the low end of the 262 to 327-month guidelines range; it stated that it would consider filing a Rule 35 motion in the future. The court imposed a 262-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In November 2008, Agnew filed a motion to compel the government to file a motion to reduce sentence. According to Agnew, he provided \u2014 -at some risk to himself and his family \u2014 substantial assistance to the government and that assistance was critical to the conviction of a drug kingpin. The government responded that it had considered Agnew\u2019s cooperation and determined that a sentence reduction was not warranted. The government argued that the district court had no jurisdiction to grant Agnew\u2019s motion: Agnew had neither alleged nor shown that the government\u2019s failure to file a substantial assistance motion was the product of a constitutionally impermissible motive. Because no constitutionally impermissible motive was alleged, the district court denied Agnew\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s authority under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) to reduce a sentence in the absence of a government motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993) (considering government refusal to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion). Because Rule 35(b) provides the government with \u201c \u2018a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted,\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1500 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992)), \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy [only] if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive,\u201d such as \u201crace or religion.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>112 S.Ct. at 1843-44, <em>See United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Wade </em>limitations on judicial review to Rule 35(b) substantial assistance motions). And, as we have said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-11\">A defendant who merely claims to have provided substantial assistance or who makes only generalized allegations of an improper motive is not entitled to a remedy or to even an evidentiary hearing. Thus, judicial review is appropriate only when there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"><em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">On appeal Agnew questions whether the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion on his behalf was because he \u201cwas \u2018Black with Dred Locks\u2019 [sic]? Was this done because \u2018Dred Locks\u2019 [sic] is not a style, but a Religious Belief?\u201d We note that this suggestion of unconstitutional motive was not advanced before the district court. And, in any event, district court authority to review a government refusal to file a substantial assistance motion is triggered only when the allegation is supported by a substantial showing of unconstitutional motive. \u201c[A] claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>112 S.Ct. at 1844. Agnew\u2019s assertions that he provided substantial assistance \u2014 together only with speculative and generalized suggestions of unconstitutional motivation \u2014 support no review of the government\u2019s discretionary decision to make no Rule 35(b) motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ahkq\"> Agnew's related argument that the government violated his plea agreement also is without merit. The plea agreement obligated the government only to consider filing a substantial assistance motion on Agnew\u2019s behalf. Because nothing in Agnew's plea agreement required the government to request a sentence reduction, Agnew fails to show that the government breached its obligations under the plea agreement. <em>See Forney, 9 </em>F.3d at 1499-1500 (government\u2019s failure to make a section 5K1.1 motion was not a breach of plea agreement that provided that government would \u2018\u2018consider\u2019\u2019 whether defendant\u2019s assistance qualified as substantial assistance).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
