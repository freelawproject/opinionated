He argues that the district court erred by denying him the benefit of the safety-valve provision under U.S.S.G. 5C1.2(a). Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Benitez-Garcia\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Benitez-Garcia argues that despite receiving a firearm sentencing enhancement, he was entitled to safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a) because he did not actually or constructively possess the firearms found in his bedroom. Benitez-Garcia asserts that because Lorenzo Hernandez-Villegas, another co-conspirator, confessed to owning the firearms, he was unable to exercise control or ownership over the guns. He argues that mere presence inside of the bedroom containing the firearms does not constitute \u201cpossession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">\u201cWhen reviewing the denial of safety-valve relief, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cWe review de novo the court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The burden of proving eligibility for safety-valve relief is on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-17\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll), Benitez-Garcia is permitted a two-level reduction if he qualifies for all five of the safety-valve provisions under \u00a7 501.2(a). To qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>for safety-valve relief under \u00a7 501.2(a), the defendant must show, among other things, that he \u201cdid not ... <em>possess </em>a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) <em>in connection </em>with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(2) (emphasis added). The purpose of the safety-valve provision is to ensure that less culpable offenders are not subject to statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums. <em>United States v. McFarlane, </em>81 F.3d 1013, 1014 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">A defendant can possess a firearm through both actual and constructive possession. <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). A defendant has actual possession of a firearm when he has \u201cdirect physical control\u201d over the item. <em>Id. </em>at 1235 (citation and quotation omitted). A defendant has constructive possession if he exercises \u201cownership, dominion, or control\u201d over the firearm. <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted); <em>see United States v. Martinez, </em>588 F.2d 495, 498 (5th Cir.1979) (citation and quotation omitted) (constructive possession if one has dominion or control of the place of concealment of the contraband). Constructive possession also exists when a person \u201chas knowledge of the thing possessed coupled with the ability to maintain control over it or reduce it to his physical possession even though he does not have actual personal dominion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wynn, </em>544 F.2d 786, 788 (5th Cir.1977) (citation and quotation omitted); <em>Martinez, </em>588 F.2d at 498 (stating that \u201cin essence, constructive possession is the ability to reduce an object to actual possession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">After review of the record, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Benitez-Garcia had possession of the firearms. Benitez-Garcia had constructive possession of the firearms because he had knowledge of the firearms coupled with the ability to maintain control over them since they were located and concealed inside his bedroom. Because neither of the parties objected to the facts in the PSI, we find no error -with the district court\u2019s reliance on its facts. The facts of the PSI contradict Benitez-Gar-cia\u2019s assertion that Hernandez-Villegas claimed ownership of the firearms, or that Hernandez-Villegas later retracted these statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that Benitez-Garcia failed to carry his burden, and we find no reversible error on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Next, Benitez-Garcia argues for the first time on appeal, that there was no proof that he possessed the firearms \u201cin connection\u201d with the underlying drug offenses and cites to a case concerning nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">\u201cWhen a defendant fails to object to an error before the district court, we review the argument for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted). This includes circumstances in which a party objects to a trial court\u2019s ruling on a specific ground and subsequently attacks the ruling via a different argument on appeal. <em>United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1148-49 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Plain error exists if defendant satisfies his burden of showing that there was (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and quotation omitted). If the first three prongs are satisfied, this Court has the discretion to remedy the error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted). Regarding the second prong, we have held \u201cthere can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Although Benitez-Garcia asserts on appeal that there is no evidence that he possessed the firearms \u201cin connection with\u201d the underlying drug offenses, the record shows that Benitez-Garcia did not raise an issue concerning nexus between the crime and possession of the gun before the district court. The record reflects that Benitez-Garcia\u2019s objection was based on the contention that he did not actually or constructively possess the firearms. Thus, Benitez-Garcia has failed to appropriately preserve the \u201cin connection with\u201d argument on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Therefore, we will assess Benitez-Garcia\u2019s \u201cin connection with\u201d argument for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">While Benitez-Garcia argues that there is no evidence that he possessed the firearms \u201cin connection\u201d with the drug offenses, he does so in a conclusory manner. On appeal, we require appellants to not only state their contentions to us, but also give the \u201creasons for them, with the citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Love v. Deal, 5 </em>F.3d 1406, 1407 n. 1 (11th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Harris v. Plastics Mfg. Co, </em>617 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1980) (per curiam)) (where an issue raised but not argued, deemed abandoned). Benitez-Garcia\u2019s cursory restatement of the issue followed by case citations fail to raise the issue sufficiently for discussion here and is deemed abandoned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-6\">. Benitez-Garcia argues that in <em>United States v. Clavijo, </em>this Court held that a defendant is eligible for safety-valve relief even if the firearm is possessed by a co-conspirator. <em>See </em>165 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). He thus argues that because Hernandez-Villegas allegedly stated that he owned the guns, he is still eligible for safety-valve relief. However, <em>Clavijo </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the record does not indicate that the firearm was actually possessed by anyone. Neither did the district court impute possession onto Benitez-Garcia as a co-conspirator. <em>Id. </em>(holding that \u201cpossession\u201d does not include reasonably foreseeable possession of a firearm by co-conspirators). Rather, in the instant case, the district court found that Benitez-Garcia had constructive possession of the firearm because he was aware of the firearm and its location in the room where he tested cocaine prior to the police\u2019s arrival.
