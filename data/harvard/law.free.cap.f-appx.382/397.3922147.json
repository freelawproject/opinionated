The district court found that Brooks\u2019s claims for monetary damages were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). To the extent Brooks was seeking habeas relief, the district court dismissed his claims without prejudice. The district court noted that its dismissal of Brooks\u2019s complaint counted as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">Brooks has failed to brief the district court\u2019s reasons for the dismissal and has therefore abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). His conditions-of-confinement allegations were not presented to the district court and need not be considered. <em>See Henderson v. Cockrell, </em>333 F.3d 592, 605 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">Brooks\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because it is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This court\u2019s dismissal of Brooks\u2019s appeal counts as another strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Brooks is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-24\">Brooks\u2019s request for an extension of time to file anything else that might be necessary is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
