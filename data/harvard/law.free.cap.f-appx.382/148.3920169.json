Young filed the instant mandamus petition to have this Court declare the following laws unconstitutional: the \u201cfinality clause\u201d of the Judicial Conduct Act and three provisions of the PLRA, including its three-strikes provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Young has also moved for appointment of counsel, an \u201cemergency ruling\u201d on his mandamus petition, and \u201ca stay of the dismissal of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in the most extraordinary of circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). Its \u201ctraditional use ... has been \u2018to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re School Asbestos Litig., </em>977 F.2d 764, 773 (3d Cir.1992) (citation omitted). As such, there should be some underlying, within-eircuit district court proceeding or order being challenged by the mandamus petitioner. <em>See Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 76-77 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cA writ of mandamus ... constitutes a procedural mechanism through which a court of appeals reviews a carefully circumscribed and discrete category of district court orders.\u201d); <em>see also Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, </em>542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (\u201cThe common-law writ of mandamus <em>against a lower court </em>is codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) ....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Rodgers v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>508 F.2d 152, 161 (3d Cir.1975) (\u201cThe power to issue such writs in aid of our potential appellate jurisdiction comprehends our responsibility for the orderly and efficient administration of justice <em>ivithin the circuit.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Here, there is no underlying district court proceeding or order in this circuit about which Young complains. In fact, it does not appear that Young has <em>ever </em>been a party in a legal action in this circuit prior to the mandamus petition at issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have no power to issue writs with respect to a matter not within our jurisdiction. <em>See Russell v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 78, 79 (9th Cir.1962) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Accordingly, we will deny Young\u2019s mandamus petition. Young\u2019s pending motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">. \"Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly restrictive conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general prison population.\" <em>Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 213, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Similar claims were improperly raised by Young in one of his recent habeas petitions. <em>See Young v. United States, </em>2010 WL 1506545, *2 (D.Mass. April 12, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A2n\">.This should not be read as an invitation, and we note that Young has worn out his welcome elsewhere. <em>See Young v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 283, 291 (2009) (\"The plaintiff continues to inundate the courts of the United States with his repetitive filings without waiting for a response from the courts. Mr. Young has made himself an example of the type of plaintiff Congress was trying to address when it enacted the [PLRA].\")</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
