Jr., Texas prisoner # 590316, moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) following the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Under \u00a7 1915(g), a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g). The determination whether a prisoner is under \u201cimminent danger\u201d must be made at the time the prisoner seeks to file his suit in district court or to proceed with his appeal, or when he files a motion to proceed IFP. <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, 144 F.3d 883, </em>885 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">King\u2019s allegations warrant a determination that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. Accordingly, King\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is granted. We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No further briefing is required. <em>See Clark v. Williams, </em>693 F.2d 381, 382 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>IFP GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
