However, these amendments are not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) as any of the amendments that could result in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence modification. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">To the extent that Anderson\u2019s brief is liberally construed to contend that his sentence should be reduced based on Amendment 706, Anderson is ineligible for relief on this basis because his offense level was based on his responsibility for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.10(D)(ii)(I)).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Anderson also argues that his sentence should be reduced under Guideline Amendments 484, 506, and 599. However, all of these amendments were effective long before Anderson\u2019s offense conduct occurred in 2006. <em>See </em>Amendment 484, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, App. C., Vol. 1, pp. 379-80 (2003) (noting November 1, 1993, effective date); Amendment 506, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, App. C., Vol. 1, pp. 417-18 (2003) (noting November 1, 1994, effective date); Amendment 599, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, App. C., Vol. 2, pp. 69-71 (2003) (noting November 1, 2000, effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">To the extent that Anderson\u2019s brief is liberally construed to raise arguments concerning his lack of notice for an aggravated felony enhancement, the use of a magistrate judge in his criminal proceedings, his innocence of the offense, the constitutionality of his sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the treatment of \u00a7 1B1.10 as mandatory after <em>Booker, </em>a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Furthermore, this court has recognized that <em>Booker </em>did not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 1B1.10\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Therefore, these claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1011; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for </em>cert. <em>filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">In light of the foregoing, Anderson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5m Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
