We granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to resolve the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-19\">(1) Whether the district court erred in failing to consider the timeliness of [Weeks\u2019] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, in light of having been filed within one year of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>[553] U.S. [507], 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.E.2d 912 (2008), in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeB\">(2) Whether the district court en*ed in finding that [Weeks\u2019] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate was successive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">Rl-11. Our review of the record and the law leads us to conclude that the district court committed error as to both issues. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Weeks is currently serving a 360-month sentence for a 1994 jury conviction on multiple counts: conspiracy to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; four counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; two counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; two counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956; interstate transportation of stolen property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314; conspiracy to murder, in violation of 18 U.S.C; \u00a7 1117; illegal possession of silencers, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5681; and two counts of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition by fugitives, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. <em>See United States v. Weeks, </em>295 Fed.Appx. 942, 943 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (unpublished). We affirmed Weeks\u2019 convictions and sentences on direct appeal in an unpublished opinion, with the mandate issuing on 15 April 1998. <em>United States v. Weeks, </em>No. 95-2403, 134 F.3d 385 (11th Cir. Dec. 31, 1997); Doc. 457. Weeks did not petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In December 1998, Weeks filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. Doc. 467. In August 1999, the district court dismissed the motion without prejudice for failure to file a brief or legal memorandum. Doc. 485. In January 2006, we denied as unnecessary Weeks\u2019 application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>In re: Jason Weeks, </em>No. 06-10002-J (11th Cir. Jan. 24, 2006); Doc. 499. We explained that Weeks did not need permission to file a second or successive petition because his first \u00a7 2255 motion was not decided on the merits, but rather dismissed without prejudice. <em>See </em>Doc. 499 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Weeks filed this \u00a7 2255 motion on 1 June 2009. Rl-1. Citing <em>Santos, </em>he challenges his convictions and sentences on the two federal money laundering counts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1). Specifically, he argues that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions, or he is actually innocent, because his transactions did not involve \u201cprofits\u201d from a crime; (2) the indictment was defective because it did not allege that the charged transaction involved profits from unlawful activity; (3) the jury instruction omitted two necessary elements of the charged crimes \u2014 that profits from a crime were involved in the transaction, and Weeks knew of this fact; and (4) his sentence exceeded the legal maximum because the district court erroneously used expense transactions to calculate his offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 5-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">On 26 June 2009, 2009 WL 1862426, the district court denied Weeks\u2019 motion as time-barred and successive. R1-5 at 3-4. The court found that Weeks\u2019 2009 motion was untimely because it was not filed within one year of 1998, the date his conviction became final. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The court did not address Weeks\u2019 argument that his motion was timely because it was filed within one year of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Santos. See </em>Rl-1 at 12. Additionally, the court concluded that Weeks\u2019 motion should be denied as successive because we had not authorized a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Rl-5 at 3. The district court denied a COA. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Weeks appealed, and we granted a COA limited to the issues of whether the district court erred in failing to consider the timeliness of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3), and whether the district court erred in finding that his motion was successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">A. <em>Whether Weeks\u2019 Motion was Untimely</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion was time-barred. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed within one year of the latest of the following four dates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was pi-evented from making a motion by such governmental action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) (2009). For purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(3), the one-year limitations period begins running on the date the Supreme Court decided the case which initially recognized the right being asserted. <em>See Dodd v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 353, 357, 360, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 2482-83, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Santos, </em>which was decided on 2 June 2008. Because Weeks filed his \u00a7 2255 motion within one year of that date, on 1 June 2009, his motion met the one-year filing deadline. <em>Compare id. </em>at 360, 125 S.Ct. at 2483 (concluding that \u00a7 2255 motion filed in April 2001 was untimely because it was filed more than one year after the Supreme Court decided the relevant case in June 1999). Weeks must still demonstrate that <em>Santos </em>retroactively applies to a case on collateral review, however. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">In general, Supreme Court decisions that result in a new substantive rule retroactively apply to final convictions. <em>See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004); <em>see also United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (\u201cDecisions of the Supreme Court construing substantive federal criminal statutes must be given retroactive effect.\u201d). New substantive rules \u201cinclude! ] decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 351, 124 S.Ct. at 2522. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Schriro, </em>retroactive application is warranted because such rules \u201cnecessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 124 S.Ct. at 2522-23 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">The Supreme Court did not expressly state that its holding in <em>Santos </em>was retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, and we have not yet decided this issue in a published opinion. In <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1241-42 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 421, 175 L.Ed.2d 272 (2009), we addressed <em>Santos\u2019 </em>application to a money laundering conviction on direct appeal. We noted that <em>\u201cSantos </em>has limited prece-dential value\u201d because it was a plurality opinion, and thus its holding was limited to the position that garnered five votes. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. \u201cThe narrow holding in <em>Santos, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>at most, was that the gross receipts of an unlicensed gambling operation were not \u2018proceeds\u2019 under section 1956.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Demarest had laundered funds from the proceeds of an illegal drag trafficking enterprise, rather than gross receipts of an illegal gambling operation, we concluded that <em>Santos </em>did not undermine his conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">More recently, we determined in an unpublished opinion that <em>Santos </em>does retroactively apply to a case on collateral review. <em>See King v. Keller, </em>372 Fed.Appx. 70, 73-74 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (unpublished). The petitioner, King, had filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), challenging his convictions for conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. <em>See id. </em>at 71-72. King asserted that <em>Santos </em>had decriminalized the conduct for which he had been convicted because the government had relied on \u201cgross receipts,\u201d whereas <em>Santos </em>limited \u201cproceeds\u201d to \u201cprofits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order for King to obtain relief under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), he had to first demonstrate that his claim was based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See id. </em>at 72-73. We concluded that he had satisfied this requirement. Citing our decision in <em>Peter, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he <em>Santos </em>opinion clearly construed a substantive federal criminal statute\u201d by defining the meaning of the term \u201cproceeds\u201d in \u00a7 1956. <em>Id. </em>at 73-74. Accordingly, <em>Santos </em>retroactively applied to King\u2019s case on collateral review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Although <em>King </em>is not binding precedent, we find its reasoning persuasive. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 36-2 (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not considered binding precedent, but they may be cited as persuasive authority.\u201d). A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 occurs when a person knowingly conducts or attempts to conduct a financial transaction involving \u201cthe proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1) (2009). <em>Santos </em>narrowed the scope of the money laundering statute by interpreting the term \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201cprofits\u201d rather than \u201creceipts.\u201d <em>Santos, </em>553 U.S. at 512-14, 128 S.Ct. at 2025.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By construing the statute in this way, <em>Santos </em>resulted in a new substantive rule that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review because it carries \u201ca significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S.Ct. at 2522-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion would be considered timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) and that the district court erred in failing to consider the timeliness of the motion under this subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">B. <em>Whether Weeks\u2019 Motion ivas Successive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">We also conclude that the district court erred in denying Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion as successive. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of the motion on this basis <em>de novo. See McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). A federal prisoner seeking to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must first obtain certification from the appropriate court of appeals in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (2009). However, \u201c[w]hen an earlier habeas corpus petition was dismissed without prejudice, a later petition is not \u2018second or successive\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d <em>Dunn v. Sin-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number><em>gletary, </em>168 F.3d 440, 441 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">As the government correctly recognizes, Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion is not successive under \u00a7 2244(b) because his first and only other \u00a7 2255 motion was dismissed without prejudice. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, Weeks did not need to obtain authorization to file a second or successive motion. Indeed, we previously denied as unnecessary Weeks\u2019 application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion for this very reason. The district court therefore erred in denying Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion as successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">C. <em>Whether Weeks is Entitled to Relief Under Santos</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Although the government concedes that Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion was timely and not successive, it urges us to affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief based on the merits of his <em>Santos </em>claim. Specifically, the government argues that <em>Santos </em>does not apply, under our rationale in <em>Demurest, </em>because Weeks was involved in a complex Ponzi scheme, not in an illegal gambling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">We may not examine this issue, however, because our review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Our COA did not include the underlying merits of Weeks\u2019 <em>Santos </em>claim. Furthermore, because the district court dismissed Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion on purely procedural grounds, the COA could not have properly included the merits of the underlying claim. <em>See Ross v. Moore, </em>246 F.3d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (\u201cWhen a district court dismisses a petition as time-barred, it is inappropriate to grant a COA on the constitutional claim e.g., the due process claim in this case.\u201d). Thus, Weeks\u2019 entitlement to substantive relief based on <em>Santos </em>and <em>Demarest </em>is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">We conclude the district court erred in denying Weeks\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred and in denying his motion as a successive filing. Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. Since <em>Santos, </em>Congress has amended \u00a7 1956 to include a definition of \"proceeds\u201d that explicitly encompasses the \"gross receipts\u201d of unlawful activity. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
