Edwards appeals the district court\u2019s order granting him a reduced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues that the record does not sufficiently reflect whether the district court considered the sentencing factors outlined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in amending his sentence. Edwards also argues that, based on his post-sentencing conduct, the district court should have sentenced him below the amended guidelines range. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 926 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">District courts have discretion to modify prison terms where those terms were calculated within a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In November 2007, after Edwards was originally sentenced, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 706, lowering the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). In October 2009, Ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>wards filed a motion for modification of his sentence in accordance with Amendment 706. The district court granted his motion, sentencing him towards the low end of the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">If a district court chooses to resentence a prisoner under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), it must first calculate the new guidelines range, and then it must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine the appropriate amended sentence. <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927. The district court is required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, although it need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors\u201d were considered. <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1997). Where the district court states on the record that it \u201creviewed the motions, the Government\u2019s [response], the record, and [was] otherwise ... duly advised,\u201d it has satisfied this requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">While the district court did not explicitly address the \u00a7 3553 factors, its order mentions Edwards\u2019s response memorandum, which requested a lower sentence in light of Amendment 706 and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The order also explains the court\u2019s reasoning that the new sentence is consistent with the original sentence\u2019s placement within the guidelines range. We are satisfied that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Cf. United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (vacating and remanding where the record lacked any evidence that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors after it summarily granted the defendant\u2019s motion for resentencing); <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Edwards argues that, based on his post-conviction conduct, the district court should have sentenced him below the amended guidelines range. However, any reduced sentence must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Here, the applicable policy statements prohibit the district court from reducing Edwards\u2019s sentence below the minimum of the amended guidelines range. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (Nov.2009). In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), we explicitly held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) do not apply to resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192. As a result, the district court could not deviate below the amended guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 1193-94. Although Edwards encourages us to abandon <em>Melvin, </em>we are bound by our precedent \u201c \u2018unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u2019\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1219 (quoting <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the record is sufficient to show that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in resentencing Edwards. We AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
