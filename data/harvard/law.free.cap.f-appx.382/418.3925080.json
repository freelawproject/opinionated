He sought to reduce the sentence he received for his methamphetamine conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">Boliver contends that Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines applies retroactively to his criminal history calculation. He also contends that he is entitled to relief because he was sentenced on incorrect factual information affecting his criminal history calculation. The government argues that the amendment does not apply retroactively and that Boliver otherwise cannot challenge his sentencing calculations in a postconviction motion to modify his sentence. Boliver replies that this court has inherent power to grant him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a sentence that was based on a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(e)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The court may grant a reduction if the reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d at 982. Section 3582(e)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments as set forth in the guidelines policy state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, so the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c) motion is reviewed for abuse of that discretion. See <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The Sentencing Commission has stated in \u00a7 1B1.10 that unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(c). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), a court is not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709, because that would be inconsistent with Commission policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)); <em>Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Moreover, \u201c[a] 3582(c)(2) motion is not the appropriate vehicle for raising issues related to the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009) (internal punctuation marks and citation omitted), cert. <em>denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2010). Boliver\u2019s contentions that his criminal history was incorrectly calculated are \u201carguments for direct appeal and are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under th\u00e9 limited circumstances set forth in 5th C\u00edr.
