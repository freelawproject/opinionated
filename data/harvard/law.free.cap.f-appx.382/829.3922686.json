Stat. \u00a7 782.071(1), appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. On appeal, he argues that his trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective for failing to properly preserve for appeal cause challenges to jurors. He contends that the state court decisions were contrary to or were unreasonable applications of clearly established federal law when the state courts determined whether or not he was prejudiced by his attorneys\u2019 failures at trial, instead of examining whether he was prejudiced on appeal. He also argues that, in any event, the state courts erred by concluding that a juror- \u2014 Inman\u2014was not actually biased, and therefore that he was prejudiced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">When examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, \u201cwe review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>LeCroy v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>421 F.3d 1237, 1259 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s determination that the state court decision was reasonable is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a federal court may only grant habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated in state court if the state court proceedings: \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Maharaj v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t. of Corr., </em>432 F.3d 1292, 1308 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">In Florida, \u201cto preserve for appellate review a claim that the trial court improperly denied a cause challenge to a juror, a defendant must exhaust his peremptory challenges, request an additional peremptory challenge from the court, and demonstrate that an objectionable juror was seated.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>824 So.2d 977, 981 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002). When the record demonstrates a properly preserved objection, and the court finds error involving the seating of an objectionable juror on direct appeal, \u201creversal is automatic, even where the trial is otherwise perfect, even if the questioned juror actually served with the wisdom of Solomon.\u201d <em>Carratelli v. State, </em>832 So.2d 850, 857 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002). However, when the issue is raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>in postconviction proceedings without being properly preserved, the defendant must show that a biased juror actually served on the jury. <em>Jenkins, </em>824 So.2d at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, a defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068-64, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show: (1) that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that the defendant was prejudiced as a result, meaning that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>the Supreme Court examined a case involving trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal on behalf of a defendant. 528 U.S. 470, 474, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1033, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). The Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 120 S.Ct. at 1039. The Court noted that counsel\u2019s performance deprived the defendant of an appellate proceeding altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[wjhen a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69. It contrasted this with a prejudice inquiry regarding ineffective assistance at the sentencing phase of a capital case, at issue there, where the inquiry was whether there was a reasonable possibility the fact-finder would have concluded that the balance of mitigating and aggravating circumstances did not warrant the death penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">In <em>Davis v. Sec. for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>the petitioner argued that his trial attorney was ineffective, under <em>Strickland, </em>for failing to preserve a Batson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim for appeal. <em>Davis, </em>341 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2003). We determined that the dispute was whether this failure prejudiced Davis\u2019s trial or his appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1314. We noted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Flores-Ortega </em>\u201cthus establishes that the prejudice showing required by <em>Strickland </em>is not always fastened to the forum in which counsel performs deficiently: even when it is <em>trial </em>counsel who represents a client ineffectively in the <em>trial court, </em>the relevant focus in assessing prejudice may be the client\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. We observed that, in Davis\u2019s case, \u201cthe only effect of <em>trial </em>counsel\u2019s negligence was on Davis\u2019 <em>appeal.\u201d Id. </em>Therefore, we held that \u201cwhen a defendant raises the unusual claim that trial counsel, while efficacious in raising an issue, nonetheless failed to preserve it for appeal, the appropriate prejudice inquiry asks whether there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome on appeal had the claim been preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316. Of significance, in coming to this conclusion, we noted that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) deference, necessitating a finding that the state court\u2019s ruling was contrary to or an unreasonable application of established federal law, was not required because the state courts did not resolve the merits of his case. <em>Id. </em>at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">In <em>Purvis v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 739-40 (11th Cir.2006), the defendant argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the state court clearing the courtroom of most of the public during a young victim\u2019s testimony failed to preserve the issue for appeal, and that, had it been preserved, the case would have been reversed. <em>Purvis, </em>451 F.3d at 739. We noted that, first, had he objected at trial, the trial court might have agreed with the defendant and corrected the error. <em>Id. </em>Second, we cited <em>Strickland </em>for the proposition that when an error is claimed at the guilt stage of a trial, the focus of the prejudice inquiry is the result at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 739 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694-95, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69). We distinguished our holding in <em>Davis </em>by noting that \u201cbecause the failure of counsel was <em>solely in his role as appellate counsel at trial </em>(those are not the words we used in <em>Davis, </em>but it is what we meant), the prejudice inquiry should focus on the effect that counsel\u2019s omission at trial had on the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739 (emphasis added). We noted that this was distinguishable from another case, <em>Jackson v. Herring, </em>42 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir.1995), where the failure to raise a <em>Batson </em>complaint was held to be a trial failure, not an appellate one, because in <em>Jackson </em>the attorney was entirely silent and did not bring the issue to the court\u2019s attention at all. <em>Purvis, </em>451 F.3d at 739 (citing <em>Jackson, </em>42 F.3d at 1361-62). We noted that Purvis\u2019s case was similar to <em>Jackson, </em>in that his attorney did not raise the issue at all, and therefore the prejudice inquiry was focused on the outcome at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 739-40. Notably, we stated that <em>Purvis, </em>unlike <em>Davis, </em>was not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A48\">the \u201cunusual case\u201d involving the \u201cpeculiar circumstances\u201d where counsel recognized and pressed an issue before the trial court and then neglected to take some step that is relevant only to the appellate stage. This is the more typical ineffective assistance of trial counsel case where the claim is that trial counsel did not raise the issue at all. The broad, generally applicable rule of measuring prejudice in terms of impact on the result of the trial instead of on the result of the appeal, which is set out in <em>Strickland </em>and followed in decisions like <em>Jackson, </em>applies; the razor thin exception recognized in the <em>Davis </em>ease does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL6M\"><em>Id. </em>at 740. Finally, we also stated, \u201c[o]ur reasoning and the result in <em>Davis </em>arguably were pushing things given what the Supreme Court said in <em>Strickland </em>about measuring the effect of counsel\u2019s errors at the guilt stage of a trial against the result of the trial instead of the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Our decision in <em>Davis </em>is not clearly-established federal law under the AED-PA. <em>See Hammond v. Hall, </em>586 F.3d 1289, 1340 n. 21 (11th Cir.2009). In any event, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the facts of this case are similar to <em>Davis, </em>the standard of review is different. In <em>Davis, </em>the court\u2019s review was <em>de novo, </em>and in this case we review whether the state courts\u2019 decisions were contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that the prejudice inquiry focuses on the forum where it occurred. In <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>it indicated that this is not always the case, but it did not address a situation such as this one, where the issue was raised but not properly preserved. Thus, there is no clearly established federal law by the Supreme Court specifically addressing whether the federal court should examine the prejudice on appeal rather than at trial in a case like this one. Accordingly, the district court correctly affirmed the state court decisions holding that the relevant prejudice inquiry should focus on trial, not the appeal, under the facts presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Under Florida law, to obtain relief in a postconviction motion where the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>error is counsel\u2019s failure to preserve a cause challenge, a movant must demonstrate that a biased juror actually served on the jury. <em>Carratelli v. State, </em>961 So.2d 312, 324 (Fla.2007). A juror is competent if he or she \u201ccan lay aside any bias or prejudice and render his verdict solely upon the evidence presented and the instructions on the law given to him by the court.\u201d <em>Lusk v. State, </em>446 So.2d 1038, 1041 (Fla.1984). The defendant must demonstrate that the juror was not impartial, meaning he or she was biased against the defendant, and the bias was evidenced on the face of the record. <em>Carratelli, </em>961 So.2d at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Carratelli has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the state courts erroneously concluded that In-man was not actually biased. The court found that Inman admitted to having some exposure to the case and having been affected by it, but he also indicated that he had not formed a definitive opinion and would listen to all the evidence with a blank slate. Under the circumstances, Carratelli has not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence the state court\u2019s conclusion. Therefore, Carratelli did not demonstrate he was prejudiced at trial by his attorneys\u2019 failure to obtain a definitive ruling on the denial of his motion to strike Inman and other jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Carratelli federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\">. <em>Batson v.
