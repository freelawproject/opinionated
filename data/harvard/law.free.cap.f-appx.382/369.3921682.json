Lewis seeking compensation for allegedly inadequate medical care while he was a pretrial detainee at the Dallas County Jail. The district court\u2019s dismissal was based in part upon its determination that several of Lewis\u2019s claims were precluded by the dismissal as frivolous of his previous \u00a7 1983 lawsuit in <em>Lewis v. Keliher, </em>No. 3:08-CV-0775-D, 2008 WL 3166804, at *1 (N.D.Tex. July 28, 2008). The district court certified that Lewis\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith and therefore denied his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. We are now presented with Lewis\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal and challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Lewis also seeks appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Lewis argues that (1) the magistrate judge fraudulently replaced his actual statement of the case with the statement from his prior \u00a7 1983 lawsuit in order to justify the dismissal of his instant claims, (2) Dr. Leach and Dallas County were not defendants in his prior \u00a7 1983 lawsuit, and (3) the district court erroneously determined that he failed to establish that Dr. Leach and Parkland Jail Health were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. Because Lewis has not shown that he will present any nonfrivolous issue on appeal, his motions for leave to proceed IFP and for appointment of counsel are denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
