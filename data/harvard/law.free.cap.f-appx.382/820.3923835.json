United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). On appeal, Lee points out that the district court failed to give him the required warnings mandated by <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), when it recharacterized his prior habeas petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, as a section 2255 motion. Thus, he contends, the district court erroneously dismissed his instant filing as successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-24\">Under <em>Castro, </em>when a district court construes a <em>pro se </em>pleading as a first section 2255 motion, it must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8x5\">notify the <em>pro se </em>litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent [section] 2255 motion will be subject to the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>strictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the [section] 2255 claims he believes he has. If the court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a [section] 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\u2019s \u201csecond or successive\u201d restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\"><em>Castro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Here, the record reveals that, upon Lee\u2019s first construed section 2255 motion, the district court failed to comply with the rule in <em>Castro. </em>Thus, the district court erred in construing the instant motion as impermissibly successive. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for additional proceedings consistent with <em>Castro.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-17\">. We previously remanded Lee's case because \u2014 although the district court construed Lee's filing as a section 2255 motion \u2014 the court failed to construe his notice of appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d), as required. <em>See Edwards v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that a district court must treat a notice of appeal from the denial of a section 2255 motion as a motion for COA and that the district court must rule on COA before we will act on an application for COA). On remand, the district court denied COA and, later, this Court granted a COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-17\">. Even if the instant motion is construed as a section 2255 motion and is untimely, as the government contends, Lee still has not properly been given the opportunity to include all the claims and arguments that may be applicable to the timeliness of a section 2255 motion. <em>See Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that \"[i]f there is an issue that the district court did not decide in the first instance, it is not properly before this Court and we remand for the district court\u2019s consideration\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
