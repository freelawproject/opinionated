Cardona\u2019s IFP motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Cardona was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute both drugs. He was sentenced to 480 months of imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed, <em>United States v. Whittington, </em>269 Fed.Appx. 388, 411 (5th Cir.2008), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Cardona v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2523, 171 L.Ed.2d 803 (2008); <em>Cardona v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 151, 172 L.Ed.2d 112 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The appellant sought relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, contending, inter alia, that this court deprived him of due process on direct appeal and applied an incorrect standard of review to one of his appellate claims. The district court determined that his claims as to our opinion were beyond the scope of \u00a7 2255 and that it lacked jurisdiction to review our opinion, whether pursuant to \u00a7 2255 or otherwise. The district court denied relief as to Cardona\u2019s claims challenging our opinion, but granted him relief in the form of a new sentencing hearing on an unrelated ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">After the district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief as to most of Cardona\u2019s claims, but before it resentenced him to the same 480-month term of imprisonment, he petitioned for habeas corpus relief pursuant \u00a7 2241. Cardona challenged our opinion on direct appeal on numerous grounds and contended that \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate vehicle for his claims. The district court concluded that he failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate so as to allow him to pursue \u00a7 2241 relief. The district court iterated its determination that it lacked authority to review the opinions of this court. The district court certified that Cardona\u2019s appeal was taken in bad faith and denied him leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">The appellant moves for leave to proceed IFP on appeal. Cardona argues that he should be allowed to pursue relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 because (1) a grant of certiorari is discretionary, rendering it inadequate as a vehicle for relief, (2) \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate vehicle to challenge an appellate decision because that statute addresses violations that occur at trial and sentencing, and (3) because this court issued \u201can unpublished fraudulent opinion\u201d in his case that he should be allowed to challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">When a district court certifies that an appeal is frivolous and is not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3), an appellant may either pay the filing fee or challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by filing a motion for leave to proceed IFP in this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into the litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). If the court upholds the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith and the litigant persists in the appeal, he must pay the appellate filing fee or the appeal will be dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Alternatively, this court may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th CiR. R. 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>We review de novo the district court\u2019s determinations as to jurisdiction. <em>Zolicoffer v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>315 F.3d 538, 540 (5th Cir.2003). The relevant statutes provide that the final rulings of district courts are reviewable by the Courts of Appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Decisions of the Courts of Appeals, in turn, are reviewable by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). Cardona sought certiorari from the Supreme Court and was unsuccessful. <em>Cardona, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2523; <em>Cardona, </em>129 S.Ct. at 151. He thus exhausted the process for challenging our opinion on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">District courts lack habeas jurisdiction to review the decisions of appellate courts; instead, the habeas determinations of district courts are reviewable by the Courts of Appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). The district court in Cardona\u2019s case lacked jurisdiction to review the opinion rendered by this court on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Cardona\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220 (5th Cir.1983). His IFP motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We take note that Cardona has two additional appeals pending-one from the resentencing resulting from the \u00a7 2255 proceeding and another from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the resentencing proceeding. We express no opinion on the merits of those appeals; we merely note that they are pending. Moreover, he proceeded to file his \u00a7 2241 petition after the district court admonished him that it lacked jurisdiction under any provision to review our opinions. Cardona is warned that future frivolous collateral challenges to his conviction or our opinion on direct appeal may result in sanctions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">IFP DENIED. APPEAL DISMISSED. SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
