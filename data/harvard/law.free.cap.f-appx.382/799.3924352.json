Tolbert argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Tolbert entered an agreement to plead guilty to two counts of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, <em>id., </em>in exchange for a recommendation from the government for a sentence at the low end of the guideline range and the dismissal of a charge for knowingly receiving, possessing, and concealing stolen firearms, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(j). Tolbert admitted in the factual resume that he had pawned a 12 gauge shotgun and had burgled a residence, during which he stole five firearms. Tolbert also admitted that he had previously been convicted of third degree burglary, first degree theft of property, and fraudulent use of a credit card. The district court accepted Tolbert\u2019s pleas of guilty to twice possessing illegally a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The presentence investigation report revealed that Tolbert had a substantial criminal history. In September 1996, Tolbert was convicted of third degree theft of property for stealing gasoline from a convenience store. In May 1997, Tolbert was convicted of first degree theft of property and third degree burglary after attempting to break into a convenience store and fleeing in a stolen truck, after which the state moved to revoke his probation four times. In January 2005, Tolbert was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and in March 2005, Tolbert was convicted of fraudulent use of a credit card and resisting arrest. In September 2008, Tolbert was convicted of second degree burglary, third degree burglary, and breaking and entering a motor vehicle. Tolbert also was arrested in 2004 for reckless endangerment and in 2007 for breaking and entering a motor vehicle and committing second and third degree burglary, but the four charges were nol prossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Tolbert was subject to the Armed Career Criminal Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(e), but his status changed before the sentencing hearing. In October 2009, an Alabama court granted a joint motion by Tolbert and the state to amend Tolbert\u2019s September 2008 conviction for third degree burglary to the lesser charge of second degree theft of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The presentence report stated that Tol-bert had a total offense level of 25. With a criminal history of VI, Tolbert faced a sentencing range between 110 and 137 months of imprisonment and a maximum statutory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment. The report mentioned that the district court could depart upward from the guideline range to address Tolbert\u2019s substantial criminal history, United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3(a) (Nov. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">At the sentencing hearing, Tolbert moved to dismiss his counsel, and counsel responded that he had \u201cdone everything [he] could think of to do for [Tolbert],\u201d which included having Tolbert\u2019s conviction reduced \u201cto resolve the armed career offender situation.\u201d The district court opined that Tolbert had \u201cmanipulat[ed] ... the system\u201d in an \u201cattempt to circumvent the statutory intent of Congress\u201d to punish recidivists.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">The district court \u201creviewfed] the statutory purposes of sentencing\u201d and determined that the guideline range failed to \u201cadequately reflect [Tolbert\u2019s] criminal history,\u201d to address his \u201clikelihood of recidivism,\u201d or to \u201cadequately punish [Tolbert] for the offense for which [he] [had] been convicted.\u201d The district court \u201cvar[ied] [its] sentence above the guidelines.\u201d It imposed a sentence of 180 months of imprisonment, which was \u201cthe same sentence [the court] would have given [Tolbert] had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>[he] been subject to the provisions of 924(e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Tolbert argues that his sentence is the product of a \u201cpunitive whim,\u201d but we disagree. The district court reasonably determined that the guideline range did not adequately reflect Tolbert\u2019s criminal history. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237-40 (11th Cir.2009). Tolbert had avoided prosecution for several serious crimes, and his crimes had escalated over time in quantity and severity. The district court considered the sentencing factors and determined that an upward variance was necessary to deter Tolbert from future similar crimes, protect the public against those potential crimes, and impose a just punishment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), (c); <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1239-40; <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1188 (11th Cir.2005). The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Tolbert to a term of 180 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We AFFIRM Tolbert\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
