He now appeals his sentence, arguing that it is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-23\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008), under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing a sentence, we first \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines [sentencing] range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. at 594. Section 3553(a) requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the district court to consider (1) the applicable Guidelines sentencing range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (6) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; (7) the need to provide the defendant with needed training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and (8) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Once we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court should have imposed a sentence that was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) [purpose] is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed within the Guidelines sentencing range. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). That is, we \u201cordinarily ... expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">We find no procedural errors in the imposition of Rodriguez-Lemos\u2019s sentence in this case. Moreover, we find no abuse of its discretion in the imposition of a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines sentencing range because the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning the sentence. In short, the sentence in this case is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
