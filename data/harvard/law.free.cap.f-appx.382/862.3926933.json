(\u201cSentry\u201d) on Plaintiffs\u2019 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) claims, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692a-p; (2) dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims against Lak-ebridge and Sentry; (3) dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint against Porges, Hamlin, Knowles, Prouty, Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Najmy, P.A., a law firm representing Lak-ebridge (\u201cLaw Firm\u201d), for failure to prosecute; and (4) denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>leave to amend their amended complaint post-dismissal of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Plaintiffs owned a condominium unit and, according to the records of Lake-bridge, Plaintiffs were in arrears on monies owed to Lakebridge. Beginning in July 2007, Sentry, acting as property manager for Lakebridge, sent Plaintiffs a \u201cNotice of Intent to File Lien.\u201d The notice included a statement of assessments owed to Lakebridge as of 13 July 2007. On 10 August 2007, Plaintiffs demanded an explanation of the assessments and alleged a portion of the assessments already had been paid. On 28 August 2007, Sentry sent a \u201cNotice of Lien;\u201d the notice included a statement of assessments owed as of 23 August 2007. On 7 September 2007, Sentry filed a lien against Plaintiffs\u2019 condominium. The statements sent to Plaintiffs set out Lakebridge\u2019s name, address and telephone number; they detailed the date, description, assessment amount, interest amount and total amount due. On 3 October 2007 and 8 October 2007, Law Firm, acting as Lakebridge\u2019s attorney, sent letters to Plaintiffs stating an intent to foreclose. The letters included an amended claim of lien for past due assessments, costs, and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The district court granted Lakebridge and Sentry judgment on the pleadings-\u2014 with prejudice \u2014 on Plaintiffs\u2019 FDCPA claims: the district court concluded that neither Lakebridge nor Sentry acted as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). The remaining state law claims were dismissed without prejudice. Because Plaintiffs failed to respond both to Law Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss and failed also to respond to a district court order to show cause why the court should not grant Law Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss or should not dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 case for failure to prosecute, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the district court committed reversible error when it considered a \u201cManagement Services Agreement\u201d between Lakebridge and Sentry, filed with the motion for judgment on the pleadings, to conclude that Sentry acted as Lake-bridge\u2019s agent and was no debt collector under FDCPA. Plaintiffs argue that the Management Services Agreement was disputed and that Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d) required that the motion for judgment on the pleadings be converted into a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Judgment on the pleadings was granted appropriately in favor of Lakebridge. Lakebridge was not subject to the FDCPA because it was no debt collector; it was a creditor. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) defining \u201cdebt collector\u201d as \u201cany person who ... regularly collects ... debts owed ... or due another;\u201d and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(4) defining \u201ccreditor\u201d as \u201cany person ... to whom a debt is owed.\u201d But consideration of the disputed Management Services Agreement to determine that Sentry also was no debt collector for purposes of FDCPA constituted error: it violated Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(d)\u2019s prescription that a motion for judgment on the pleadings that presents matters outside the pleadings \u2014 and are not excluded by the court \u2014 be treated as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56. Nonetheless we conclude judgment on the pleadings was granted appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>priately in favor of Sentry: even ignoring Sentry\u2019s status under the Management Services Agreement, the pleadings make clear that Sentry\u2019s acts did not violate FDCPA. <em>See Bircoll v. Miami-Dade County, </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1088 n. 21 (11th Cir.2007) (we may affirm on any ground supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The purpose of FDCPA is \u201cto eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). Section 1692f provides that a \u201cdebt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.\u201d Under section 1692g, after a debt collector\u2019s initial communication with a consumer, if the consumer notifies the debt collector that the debt is disputed, \u201cthe debt collector shall cease collection of the debt ... until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt ... or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification ..., or the name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1692g(b). Sentry sent Plaintiffs verification of the debt with its Notice of Intent to File Lien; and Sentry updated that verification in later correspondence. Again after Plaintiffs\u2019 requested verification \u2014 and contemporaneously with the filing of the lien \u2014 Sentry sent Plaintiffs a current statement in verification of the debt. <em>See Shimek v. Weissman, Nowack, Curry, &amp; Wilco, </em>374 F.3d 1011, 1014 (11th Cir.2004) (if permitted by state law, section 1692g(b) does not preclude debt collector from contemporaneously filing lien and sending letter of demand to consumer). So, even if Sentry was a debt collector under FDCPA, it complied with the verification requirements; Sentry\u2019s collection efforts complied with section 1692g(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Plaintiffs complain that the district court erred when it dismissed their state law claims without prejudice. According to Plaintiffs, the decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction was an abuse of discretion because the statute of limitations had expired on at least some of their state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">A district court with original jurisdiction in a civil action has \u201csupplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). But a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if all claims over which it has original jurisdiction are dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1367(c)(3). We have concluded that a federal court may abuse its discretion when pendent state claims are dismissed and no viable state forum exists at the time of dismissal. <em>Roper v. Edwards, </em>815 F.2d 1474, 1477 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The district court committed no abuse of discretion when it dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims: Plaintiffs contend incorrectly that the statute of limitations had expired at the time of dismissal. Under Florida law, Plaintiffs had four years to commence suit for slander of title and intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(o); Plaintiffs had two years from the alleged violation to file suit under the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act (\u201cFCCPA\u201d). <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.77(4). At the time of dismissal, Plaintiffs had approximately four months to file FCCPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>claims and over two years to file the other state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 case against Law Firm for want of prosecution. Plaintiffs failed to respond to the district court\u2019s order to show cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe court may dismiss a claim if the plaintiff fails to prosecute it or comply with a court order.\u201d <em>Equity Lifestyle Prop. Inc. v. Fla. Mowing &amp; Landscape, </em>556 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In their last assertion of error, Plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their amended complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their amended complaint was filed 22 days after final judgment. After judgment, the plaintiff who seeks leave to amend must do so within 10 days of the entry of judgment by seeking relief under Rule 59(e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (motion to alter or amend a judgment) or Rule 60(b)(6) (motion for relief from a judgment).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Plaintiffs failed to act within 10 days of judgment, no relief was available under Rule 59(e); and because Plaintiffs failed to seek relief from final judgment, Rule 60(b) has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We have considered all errors advanced by Plaintiffs; no basis for reversal has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">. Also named as a defendant was Don Wester-hoff, president of Lakebridge and an owner of a unit at Lakebridge Condominium. Plaintiffs' brief proffers no argument about Wester-hoff; challenges to the district court's orders as they pertain to Westerhoff are waived. <em>See Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002). Plaintiffs also included in their amended complaint a count charging Lakebridge with retaliation; because Plaintiffs' brief fails to address this issue, it is deemed to have been waived. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\">. We see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations that Sentry's communications violated several other sections of the FDCPA because they allegedly contained falsities, were misleading or otherwise were threatening. Just indicating that a matter may be referred to an attorney and a lien filed if payment is not made is not a deceptive practice, <em>see Shimek, </em>374 F.3d at 1013; nor was it threatening to advise that Lakebridge had the ability to collect reasonable attorney's fees incurred in the course of filing a lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Afi\">. Plaintiffs explain their failure to respond to Law Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss by asserting that they never received the motion. But Plaintiffs also failed to respond to the district court's order to show cause; they never alleged non-receipt of that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Afi4\">; Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) has been amended, effective 1 December 2009, to expand the 10-day period to 28 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A7uy\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) \u2014 cited by Plaintiffs \u2014 has no application after dismissal of a complaint and the entry of final judgment for defendant. <em>See Friedman v.
