The district court sentenced him to the statutory minimum of fifteen years imprisonment under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which provides for an enhanced sentence if the offender has three prior \u201cviolent felon/\u2019 convictions arising from separate occasions. On appeal, Mr. Oner challenges his sentence, arguing that none of his three prior convictions \u2014 namely two convictions for aggravated fleeing or eluding a police officer in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a) and one conviction for armed robbery in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(2)(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-19\">Under the ACCA, the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined in pertinent part as any felony that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). We have noted that this definition is virtually identical to the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1)-(2). <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2009). <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l)-(2), <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). For that reason, the same analysis used to determine whether an offense qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is also used to determine whether an offense qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l)-(2). <em>See Harris, </em>586 F.3d at 1285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Florida law makes it a second-degree felony for a person to \u201c[d]rive[] at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d while \u201cwillfully fleefing] or attempting] to elude a law enforcement officer\u201d in a marked patrol car with its sirens and lights activated. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a). Whether this crime qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d depends on whether it falls within the ACCA\u2019s so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d in that it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). As Oner concedes, our precedent squarely requires us to hold that it does.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">In <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1183 (11th Cir.2007), we held that a conviction under \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a) qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it fell within the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). After reviewing the statutory language of the offense and noting that the touchstone of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is the \u201c \u2018potential risk\u2019 of injury, rather than actual violence or actual injury,\u201d we reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ani\">[t]he dangerous circumstances surrounding a person\u2019s attempt to flee from law enforcement coupled with the person\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle most assuredly presents a \u201cpotential risk of physical injury\u201d to others. And the stress and urgency of the situation will likely cause the person fleeing to drive recklessly, turning any pursuit into a high-speed chase with the potential for serious harm to pedestrians, other drivers, and the pursuing officers. Indeed, collisions between fleeing vehicles and pedestrians or other vehicles sharing the road are common. Moreover, by deliberately disobeying a law enforcement officer, the fleeing motorist provokes an inevitable, escalated confrontation with the officer when he is finally apprehended. \u201cSuch a confrontation inherently presents the serious potential risk of physical injury because the fleeing driver[,] intent on his goal of eluding the offieer[,] faces the decision of whether to dispel the officer\u2019s interference or yield to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-12\"><em>Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d at 1182-83 (quoting <em>United States v. Martin, </em>378 F.3d 578, 583 (6th Cir.2004)) (second and third alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Following our decision in <em>Orisnord, </em>the Supreme Court decided a trilogy of cases considering whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009); <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); <em>James v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number><em>United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Those cases established a categorical approach whereby courts ask whether, based on the statutory text, the offense of conviction involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct whose risks for potential injury are similar in degree and kind to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and any offense involving the use of explosives. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(33)(ii); <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1284-90 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">In light of those cases, we again considered in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir.2009), whether \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a) qualifies as \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). We held that it did, reasoning that the statutory elements of \u201cwillfully flees or attempts to elude\u201d a police officer either at a \u201chigh speed\u201d or with \u201ca wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d required purposeful conduct and that the risks flowing from such action presented, like the enumerated crimes, a serious potential risk of physical injury to others. <em>Harris, </em>586 F.3d at 1288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">In light of our analysis and holding in <em>Harris, </em>we hold that convictions under \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a) qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. The district court thus did not err with respect to Oner\u2019s two convictions thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Oner\u2019s argument that his conviction for armed robbery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.131(2)(a) does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is likewise without merit. In <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1255 (11th Cir.2006), we held that an armed robbery under Florida law in 1974 \u201cundeniably\u201d qualified as a violent felony because it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). The same conclusion unambiguously follows from the face of Florida\u2019s armed robbery statute today.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(2)(a). That statute requires the taking of another\u2019s money or property by \u201cthe use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear\u201d while carrying a firearm or other deadly weapon. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Perhaps realizing the futility of his argument, Oner mentions that he only raises it in anticipation of a favorable ruling in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), regarding the scope of offenses that qualify as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court held that a simple battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a)(l), (2) \u2014 namely the \u201c[a]ctual[ ] and intentional touching] of another\u201d \u2014 did not have as \u201can element the use ... of physical force\u201d because the physical force contemplated by the ACCA is <em>\u201cviolent </em>force.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1269, 1271. The Court\u2019s holding in no way requires us to revisit our holding in <em>Dowd.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The carrying of a firearm or other deadly weapon during a robbery surely implicates violent force and of the most severe kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">The district court thus did not err in finding that Oner\u2019s conviction for Florida armed robbery qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-11\">. The statutes have not been amended since Oner\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-10\">.

Serv. 87-317 (West).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AaG\">. The holding in <em>Johnson </em>did not implicate the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). It is therefore not relevant to our analysis in Part I.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
