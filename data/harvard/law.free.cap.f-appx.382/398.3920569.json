Ornelas argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that he should have been sentenced below the guidelines range.. He contends that his prior conviction for transporting illegal aliens was double counted. Ornelas, citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), argues that his sentence is unreasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and is flawed. He also contends that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not based on empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">Ornelas\u2019s argument that this court should not accord his within-guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness because the applicable guideline is not supported by empirical data is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Ornelas acknowledges this argument is foreclosed but raises the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-28\">The substantive reasonableness of Orne-las\u2019s sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Ornelas\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not based on empirical data is without merit. \u201cWhatever appropriate deviations <em>[Kim-brough] </em>may permit or encourage at the discretion of the district judge, <em>Kimbrough </em>does not force district or appellate courts into a piece-by-piece analysis of the empirical grounding behind each part of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 6). Additionally, this court has rejected the argument that double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. Ornelas\u2019s argument that his sentence does not take into account his health, family ties, and good work history is without merit. The record shows that the district court listened to Ornelas\u2019s arguments but ultimately determined that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. His arguments are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Ornelas has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
