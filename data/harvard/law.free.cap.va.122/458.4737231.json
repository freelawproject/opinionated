Law op the <em>Case\u2014Different Facts on Second Trial\u2014Case at </em>Bar.\u2014In an action by a railway mail clerk against a carrier for injuries sustained, it appeared that the accident was due to the removal of a device called a catcher and safety bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>fixed across the side doors of a postal car, as required by the regulations and instructions of the United States Post Office Department. On the first trial a judgment for plaintiff was reversed on the ground that the plaintiff knew of the removal of the bar and had acquiesced in its removal.

On the other hand, if under such circumstances he went to the door of the car, not knowing that the safety bar upon which he had been accustomed to rely had been removed, and without any contributory negligence on his part, sustained the injury complained of, as appears from his testimony, then he is entitled to recover.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-9\">8.

The first resulted in a judgment in favor of the petitioner, which was reversed by this court for errors in granting certain instructions requested by the plaintiff, and in amending one instruction requested by the defendant <em>(Washington &amp; Old Dominion Railway </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>117 Va. 424, 85 S. E. 482), and.the case was remanded to be further proceeded with in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion. On the second trial there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, which the trial court set aside as contrary to the law and the evidence, to which action the plaintiff excepted. At the third trial no evidence was introduced and there was a verdict for the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The petitioner assigns as error the action of the trial court in setting aside the verdict of the jury on the second trial, and the entering of judgment for the defendant on the third trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The established rule in such cases is that this court will look first to the record of the second trial, and if there was error in setting aside that verdict, no further inquiry will be made and judgment will be entered by this court thereon.

St. Rep. 77; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Valley R. Co., </em>99 Va. 798, 34 S. E. 455; <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>Valley R. Co., supra; Morien </em>v. <em>Norfolk, etc., Co., </em>102 Va. 622, 46 S.

E. 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The circumstances of the accident are sufficiently set out in <em>Washington &amp; Old Dominion Ry. </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>and it is only necessary to repeat that it was caused by the removal of a device called a catcher and safety bar, which had been theretofore fixed across the side doors of the postal car, as required by the regulations and instructions of the United States Post Office Department. These bars are put there, for use in delivering the mail while the train is in motion as well as for the safety of the postal clerk, whose duties call him to the door for the delivery of mail. This bar had been removed, and when the case was before this court before, it was determined from the evidence then in the record that the plaintiff knew of the removal of the bar and had acquiesced in its removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">. The company claims that the evidence was substantially the same upon the second trial, and that all of the questions involved are concluded by the previous opinion and judgment of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The doctrine of the \u201claw of the case\u201d has been recently stated by this court in <em>Steinman </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Corporation, </em>121 Va. 611, 93 S. E. 684, in this language: \u201cWhere there have been two appeals in the case, between the same parties, and the facts are the same, nothing decided on the first appeal can be re-examined on a second appeal.\u201d And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>also thus: \u201cAgain, the doctrine of the \u2018law of the case\u2019 can only be invoked, even between the same parties, where the facts reappear on the second trial the same as when originally presented. Nothing is more common than a material difference between the facts presented on a second trial from those shown on the first trial, and the \u2018law of the case\u2019 is applicable to the state of facts existing at the time the law is announced. There is nothing in the rule to inhibit a party, on a second trial, from 'supplying omitted facts or from averring a different state of facts. 26 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2d Ed.) 191; <em>Carper </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; W. R. Co., </em>95 Va. 43, 27 S. E. 813.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In the case of <em>Buchner Chair Co. </em>v. <em>Feulner, </em>28 Ind. App. 479, 63 N. E. 239; <em>Id., </em>164 Ind. 368, 73 N. E. 816, the plaintiff\u2019s arm had been caught and injured by the bit of a boring machine. On the first trial he testified that he was not looking at the bit at the time his arm was caught, and the appellate court reversed the judgment upon the ground that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence. Upon the second trial the plaintiff explained his former answer, that he was not looking at the bit, by saying this: \u201cI meant I wasn\u2019t just looking directly at the bit. I was looking at all of it. I was looking to where I was going to put the piece of wood, and watching the bit as best I could.\u201d The court there held that the \u201claw of the case doctrine did not apply, and in the head note this is said: \u201cWhere.in an action by a servant for injuries, the cause was reversed on appeal on the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, as shown by his testimony that he was not looking, at the time of the injury, at the piece of machinery which caused the injury, but on the next trial he testified that he was looking at it, the holding on the former appeal was not the law of the case on the next appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>In order to apply this doctrine the facts on both trials must be substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">This raises the issue now to be determined. It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on the second trial that he did not either know of the removal of the bar or acquiesce therein, whereas it was expressly upon such knowledge and acquiescence that the court, in its former opinion, as noted above, based its conclusion that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence. Not that there is an irreconcilable conflict between his testimony upon the two trials, but an express denial of knowledge and acquiescence at the second trial which was omitted at the first trial. The company\u2019s chief witness testified to facts which, if true, show that the plaintiff did know of the removal of the safety bar, and while there was a conflict between this testimony and that of the plaintiff, there was at the first trial no explicit and positive denial of such knowledge by the plaintiff, though from his account of' the transaction his counsel then claimed that upon a fair construction of his testimony it was clear that he did not know of the removal of the bar. This court, however, inferred otherwise, and upon that testimony was of opinion that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence. It is impossible for us to reach that conclusion now, if the plaintiff\u2019s testimony upon the second trial is true, because he clearly, distinctly and positively stated that he did not know that the bar had been removed. So that we have a- case in which the evidence upon the second trial as to the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was materially different from the evidence upon the first trial with reference to that determining \u25a0 fact, and this issue has been properly submitted to a jury, and the plaintiff has, by the verdict in his favor, been acquitted of the charge of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It is observed, in passing, that the plaintiff, who was a postal clerk, was a passenger upon the train, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>entitled to the very highest degree of care from the defendant company. <em>N. &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>v. Shott, 92 Va. 34, 22 S. E. 811; <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Pa. R. Co., </em>26 App. Cas. (B. C.) 503, 6 Ann. Cas. 863; <em>Virginia R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>115 Va. 430, 79 S. E. 396, Ann. Cas. 1915a, 804. The negligence of the company, which was alleged to be the proximate cause of the' accident\u2014that is, the operating of the postal car without the safety bar\u2014was perfectly apparent upon both trials, and cannot be doubted. The decisive question is whether the recovery should be denied because of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. If he went to the door of the poorly lighted car in the performance of his duties, while the train was in motion, knowing that the safety b\u00e1r had been removed, and was thrown out of the car because he failed to take proper precautions for his own safety, then it is clear, as appears from the former decision, that he was guilty of such contributory negligence as bars any recovery. On the other hand, if under such circumstances he went to the door of the car, not knowing that the safety bar upon which he had .been accustomed to rely had been removed, and without any contributory negligence on his part, sustained the injury complained of, as appears from his testimony upon the second trial, then he is entitled to recover. These opposing theories of the case were submitted to the jury under proper instructions upon the second trial and upon evidence substantially different from that submitted to the jury on the first trial, and the issues having been determined in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the court erred in setting a\u00e1ide that verdict. Therefore, this court will enter the judgment thereon which the trial court should have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
