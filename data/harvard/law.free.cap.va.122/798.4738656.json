The evidence is not certified, but it appears that at the January term, 1917, of the court an indictment was found against him, charging that \u201cHenry Blair, within one year next prior to the finding of this indictment in the said county of Clarke, did unlawfully sell, give away, offer, dispense, keep and store for sale and gift ardent spirits and within said time did have in his possession in said county at the same time two quarts of whiskey against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">There was a demurrer to the indictment, which the court overruled. The grounds of the demurrer were: First, \u201cthat said indictment failed to state the violation of any law of the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d and second, \u201cthat said indictment in the charging part thereof, mingles acts that, if committed, are not violations of the statute with acts that may be such violations.\u201d After the demurrer was overruled the Commonwealth was required to elect for which offense it would go to trial, and it \u201celected to proceed against the defendant on the charge contained in the indictment that the defendant did unlawfully have in his possession at the same time two quarts of whiskey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The prohibition law, under which the indictment was framed, did not go into effect till after November 1, 1916, and prior to that date it was not an offense for a person to have in his possession at one time two quarts of whiskey. So that every fact charged in the indictment may be true and yet the defendant be not guilty of any offense. Whenever this is true, the indictment is bad on demurrer. <em>Shiflett\u2019s Case, </em>114 Va. 876, 77 S. E. 606; <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>15 Gratt.
