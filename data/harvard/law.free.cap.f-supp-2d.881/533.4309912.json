FORREST, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Pending before this Court are a series of actions to enforce money judgments against the Islamic Republic of Iran (\u201cIran\u201d) relating to acts of terrorism for which it has been found liable in various courts in the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">Among the assets as to which plaintiffs seek turnover is real property located at 650 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York (alternatively, plaintiffs seek payment of a sum of money of equivalent value).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This building is currently held in the name of two of the defendants herein- \u2014 -the Alavi Foundation (\u201cthe Foundation\u201d) and the 650 Fifth Avenue Company (\u201c650 Fifth Avenue\u201d and collectively with the Foundation, the \u201cMoving Defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">Defendants have moved to dismiss these actions pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), for lack of subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Moving Defendants\u2019 core argument as to both bases is the same: any action to enforce a judgment against the government of Iran must be brought against Iran \u2014 and neither the Foundation nor 650 Fifth Avenue is \u201cIran\u201d in any sense, including as an agency or instrumentality. As a result, according to Moving Defendants, plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action for turnover of assets. Moreover, Moving Defendants argue, even if there was some arguable connection to Iran, the only basis for subject matter jurisdiction against Iran here is the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d), and, for the same reason that the claim fails as a matter of law (ie., neither the Foundation nor 650 Fifth Avenue is \u201cIran\u201d), plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to support subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Moving Defendants have previously defeated similar attempts by judgment creditors seeking to collect judgments for other acts of terrorism and obtained dismissal of several actions. <em>See, e.g., Gabay v. Mostazafan Foundation of Iran, </em>152 F.3d 918, 1998 WL 385909 (2d Cir.1998); <em>Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>67 F.Supp.2d 535 (D.Md.1999); <em>Gabay v. Mostazafan Foundation of Iran, </em>968 F.Supp. 895 (S.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">They cannot do so here. There is a critical and dispositive difference between prior determinations with respect to other \u201cturnover actions\u201d and the one now before this Court: in 2008 and 2009, documents were obtained via search warrants executed against both Moving Defendants as well as the other, non-moving defendants. The historical record assembled from seized documents is extensively quoted in the verified complaint of the United States and incorporated by reference into the three complaints that are the subject of this motion. Those documents \u2014 the authenticity of which Moving Defendants do not dispute \u2014 demonstrate a robust factual basis to find that plaintiffs have sufficiently set forth a basis for subject matter jurisdiction because Moving Defendants \u201care\u201d in fact, \u201cIran,\u201d or are legally \u201calter egos\u201d or \u201corgans\u201d of Iran; accordingly, plaintiffs have also stated a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">For the reasons set forth below, Moving Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">The disposition of this motion turns upon this Court\u2019s determination, consistent with the standards for a motion pursuant to 12(b)(1), as to whether the Moving Defendants are in fact either synonymous with the Iranian government, are alter egos of the Iranian government (which would then place them in the equivalent legal position of the Iranian government), or are organs of the Iranian government whose activities provide a basis to ignore their separate corporate forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">On March 29, 2011 (and prior to transfer of this matter to this Court), Judge Holwell issued a decision denying a motion to dismiss the <em>in rem </em>forfeiture action brought by the United States against these and the non-movant defendants (that action has also been transferred to this Court).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That opinion sets forth a detailed chronology of the lineage of the defendant entities and their interconnections. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, 777 </em>F.Supp.2d 529 (S.D.N.Y.2011). This Court assumes familiarity with that opinion and recites only facts relevant to its decision on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>A. <em>Plaintiffs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">On October 23, 1983, Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard bombed a U.S. Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 United States Servicemen. A group of nearly 1000 plaintiffs, representing those injured, the estates of those killed, and family members, commenced a wrongful death class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On September 7, 2007, that court ruled that Iran and the Iranian Ministry of Information and Security (\u201cMOIS\u201d) had acted as state sponsors of terrorism and were liable for the deaths of the servicemen, awarding damages totaling $2,656,944,877. <em>Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>515 F.Supp.2d 25 (D.D.C.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On November 5, 1990, El Sayyid Nosair, a member of AI-Gam\u2019aa Islamiyah \u2014 a terrorist organization led by Sheik Omar Ahmad Ali Abdel Rahman \u2014 shot and killed Rabbi Meir Kahane and wounded Irving Franklin and U.S. Postal Officer Carlos Acosta (collectively, the \u201cAcosta plaintiffs\u201d). The Acosta plaintiffs commenced a wrongful death suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Iran and MOIS. They were awarded $350,172,000. <em>See Acosta v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>574 F.Supp.2d 15 (D.D.C.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">On August 9, 2001, a suicide bomber in Israel killed Judith Greenbaum, a pregnant American woman. Her husband, father, mother, and her estate (collectively, the \u201cGreenbaum plaintiffs\u201d) commenced a wrongful death suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Iran and MOIS. <em>See Greenbaum v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>451 F.Supp.2d 90 (D.D.C.2006). In 2006, that court found that Iran and MOIS had \u201cprovided material support and assistance to Hamas, the terrorist organization that orchestrated the bombing\u201d and were therefore jointly and severally liable for damages in the amount of $19,879,023. <em>See id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">B. <em>The Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The Alavi Foundation was originally established by the government of Iran and all facts appear to indicate that it has been continuously operated as part of the Iranian governmental apparatus. (Am. Compl. of the United States (Dkt. No. 51) (\u201cU.S. Compl.\u201d) \u00b6 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">The Foundation has gone through several name changes: it started as the Pahlavi Foundation in 1973; in 1980, following the Iranian Revolution, its name was changed to the Mostazafan Foundation of New York; in 1992 its name was again changed, this time to the Alavi Foundation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (U.S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">In 1973, Shah Reza Mohammad Pahlavi, who was then the Shah of Iran, established the \u201cPahlavi Foundation,\u201d a New York not-for-profit corporation. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 24.) Once the Foundation was established, the government of Iran, through its central bank, loaned to Bank Melli, which in turn loaned the Foundation, the funds to purchase the building located at 650 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. (Id.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">The Iranian revolution began in 1978; by 1979 the Shah had fled the country and the then-exiled religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (\u201cKhomeini\u201d or the \u201cAyatollah\u201d), returned to Iran and assumed control. Khomeini proclaimed es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tablishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in April 1979. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In March 1979, the Ayatollah ordered the creation of the Bonyad Mostazafan va Janbazan (\u201cBonyad Mostazafan\u201d) as an umbrella organization to take possession of, manage and control property expropriated by the new Iranian revolutionary government. (U.S. Compl. \u00b626.) The Revolutionary Council of the Islamic Republic of Iran approved the creation of the Bonyad Mostazafan. The Bonyad Mostazafan took control of the assets of the Pahlavi Foundation, including one of its major assets \u2014 the building located at 650 Fifth Avenue. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In 1978-79, the new revolutionary government in Iran forced all five of the directors of the Pahlavi Foundation to resign. The Iranian Bonyad Mostazafan appointed new directors in 1980. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 27.) That same year, the Pahlavi Foundation filed an amended certificate of incorporation which, <em>inter alia, </em>renamed the Foundation the \u201cMostazafan Foundation of New York.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>More than a decade later, in 1992, the Mostazafan Foundation of New York renamed itself the Alavi Foundation. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\n<em>G. Factual Record Derived from Seized Documents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Nearly thirty years after the Iranian Revolution and the establishment of the Foundation, in 2008 and 2009, search warrants were executed at the Alavi Foundation, a residence of a member of the board of the Foundation, a residence owned by Bank Melli, and the offices of 650 Fifth Avenue. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 69, 75, 82.) Documents obtained pursuant to these warrants reveal the following facts regarding extensive and continuous connections between the Foundation, 650 Fifth Avenue, Bank Melli, the Assa Corp., Assa Co. Ltd., and the Iranian government:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">\u2022 In November 1980, the Bonyad Mostazafan held a conference in Tehran for the directors and managers of all of the offices of the various Iranian Mostazafan foundations worldwide. The then-president of the Mostazafan Foundation of New York, Manoucher Shafie (\u201cShafie\u201d), communicated with the supervisor of the Iranian Bonyad Mostazafan, Mahmood Karimi Nouri (\u201cNouri\u201d) regarding arrangements for the conference. Nouri wrote to Shafie that reservations to attend the meeting could be made via the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and that he should bring with him all of the \u201cbeneficial suggestions you have to discuss the improvement of your unit.\u201d (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">\u2022 In 1981, Shafie notified two employees of the Mostazafan Foundation of New York that they were terminated; the letterhead he used bore the symbol for the Islamic Republic of Iran. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">\u2022 By the 1980s, the Mostazafan Foundation of New York had incurred a tax liability relating to rental income from the 650 Fifth Avenue property. To avoid the tax, Iranian government officials and directors of the Mostazafan Foundation of New York discussed various options. The plan that was ultimately adopted led to the creation of the 650 Fifth Avenue Company. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">\u2022 As part of the discussions that led to the decision to create the 650 Fifth Avenue Company, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iran at that time, Tahmasb Mazaheri, wrote to the then Prime Minister of Iran, Mir-Hossein Mousavi regarding the tax issue and the possibility of creating the new legal entity. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u2022 Mousavi noted his approval for this option stating, \u201cThe above circumstances were discussed in the office of the brother Ghasemi, the president of the Central Bank, in the presence of brother Najafi Elmi and both promised to cooperate. Your recommendation of this action, which will surely be beneficial to the Islamic Republic, will expedite processing this by the end of 1987 and allow new arrangements to be made for 1988.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 32.) At that time, Ghasemi was the director of the Central Bank of Iran and Najafi Elmi was the general director of Bank Melli. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\u2022 In November 1987, Mazaheri wrote to Mousavi seeking the Iranian Prime Minister\u2019s approval for the creation of the new entity to avoid paying taxes. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\u2022 In December 1987, the Iranian Prime Minister\u2019s office responded by giving authorization to proceed with the proposal to create the new legal entity. The letter was written on letterhead bearing a symbol for the Islamic Republic of Iran and the words \u201cIslamic Republic, Office of the Prime Minister.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u2022 Meeting minutes dated May 24,1989, on letterhead for the Bonyad Mostazafan, describe a joint meeting held in Tehran that was attended by the Iranian Assistant Director of Commerce and International Affairs for the Bonyad Mostazafan and a member of the board of Bank Melli. The minutes state that \u201cBank Melli Iran company will partner with the New York Foundation\u201d; the building at 650 Fifth Avenue was to be contributed to the new company. The minutes state \u201ca representative from Bank Melli Iran should supervise the plan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\u2022 In 1989, the Assistant Director of Commerce and International Affairs for the Bonyad Mostazafan requested approval of the partnership agreement between the Mostazafan Foundation of New York and Bank Melli Iran and states, \u201cPlease note the partnership is based on prior agreements between the Ministry of Finance, Bank Melli Iran, and the Bonyad Mostazafan ... [I]t was decided to set the value of the building at $128 million and the share of Assa Company (Assa Co., which belongs to Bank Melli, is the partner of the Mostazafan Foundation) at $44,800,000, thus Bank Melli will earn $200,000 in cash.\u201d This letter was copied to the president of the Foundation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\u2022 In a telex from early 1990 that was found in a search of the residence owned by Bank Melli, two individuals employed by Bank Melli discuss the history of the formation of 650 Fifth Avenue. That telex confirms that the Bonyad Mostazafan was involved in the formation of the new company. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">\u2022 According to the partnership agreement entered into between the Foundation and Bank Melli, it was agreed that the partnership would be called the 650 Fifth Avenue Company, that the Foundation would contribute the building at 650 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, and that Assa Corp. would contribute capital. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b642.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">\u2022 Formalizing the creation of 650 Fifth Avenue required various filings with the State of New York\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office. In a letter dated September 21, 1989, the Attorney General\u2019s Office requested a list of officers and directors of the Assa Corp. and a statement as to whether there was any personal or business relationship between those persons and the Foundation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 43.) The Foundation\u2019s letter in response listed the officers and directors and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>state that two of them were affiliated with Bank Melli or detail the extensive prior contacts with the Foundation. Alavi\u2019s counsel responded \u201cto the best of counsel\u2019s knowledge, \u2018there were no pre-existing agreements or understandings between any director, officer or principal of Assa Corp. and the Foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\u2022 On September 29, 1989, the Attorney General\u2019s office specifically asked whether the transaction was \u201carms length.\u201d On October 4, 1989, Alavi\u2019s counsel stated that the formation of \u201cthe Partnership was an arms-length transaction between the Foundation and Assa Corp.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u2022 A verified petition filed in New York State Supreme Court requesting leave to transfer the 650 Fifth Avenue building from the not-for-profit charitable foundation to the new 650 Fifth Avenue Company stated that the transaction was arms-length. Notably, that petition did not disclose the involvement of Bank Melli. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\u2022 In 1991, the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations demanded the resignation of the Mostazafan Foundation\u2019s president. Subsequently, three of the Mostazafan Foundation\u2019s board members, including its president, wrote directly to the Ayatollah that they would resign from the Foundation pursuant to his instructions that had been conveyed to them. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b649, 50.) Their letter stated, \u201cIn obedience to the Supreme Leader\u2019s Directives, we herewith announce our readiness to resign our posts of responsibility at the Mostazafan Foundation of New York ...\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b650.) The letter also set forth the activities undertaken by the Foundation and stated, \u201cOur hope is that these activities will further improve and develop under the supervision of your Excellency and respected representative in the Mostazafan and Janbazan Foundation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">\u2022 In 1991, the Foundation held a meeting in Switzerland with the General and Regional International Chairmanship of the Bonyad Mostazafan regarding changes to the board of the New York Mostazafan. The minutes of that meeting reflect that the changes were \u201cdirected by our Supreme Leader.\u201d The minutes also describe (i) the status of the building at 650 Fifth Avenue; and in a section entitled \u201cBuilding 650,\u201d (ii) the minutes describe the collection of rent from tenants, and (iii) payments made to Assa Corp. The minutes reflect that group also discussed charitable activities of the Foundation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">\u2022 Later in May 1991, the soon-to-be-former president of the Mostazafan Foundation, Badr, wrote to Sobhani, (Iran\u2019s International Director of the Bonyad Mostazafan), \u201cBrother Kharrazi\u201d [the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations] said to me that from now on, the role of the Managing Director and the role of the Board of Directors [of the Mostazafan Foundation] will be just a formality and he will be conducting all of its affairs. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">\u2022 On May 80, 1991, Badr wrote to the Ayatollah that he had followed the Ayatollah\u2019s directives concerning his own resignation from the Foundation and that the final meeting would be in August 1991. Badr wrote that his and the other board member\u2019s resignations had been obtained \u201cby resorting to a channel unacceptable by the laws and regulations governing non-profit organizations in America.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">\u2022 In a separate letter attached to his letter to the Ayatollah, Badr warned Kharrazi (the Iranian Ambassador to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the U.N.) that the pressure he was exerting on the board members to resign immediately could cause problems for the Foundation since it did not follow New York State law protocols. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 57.) He stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIM\">Dear brother, the danger posed by your direct interference in the affairs of the Foundation, in view of the very dire political and security atmosphere in America, is not hidden to all; God forbid it should cause numerous problems for the Foundation ... However, we will all wholly abide by this decision as it was made through the judgment, wisdom and insight of the Supreme Leader ... I therefore once more announce my sole obedience of the Supreme Leader\u2019s orders ... I reiterate that I have presented, in written and verbal form, all the problems and dangers associated with changing 80 percent of the members of the Board of Trustees and that dear brother\u2019s official and unofficial interference, to you and the brothers in charge of the Mostazafan and Janbazan Foundation ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aop\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\u2022 In June, Badr wrote to Sobhani that Kharrazi had been interviewing employees of the Foundation \u201cto make the point that hereafter he is to be considered the Foundation\u2019s employees\u2019 point of contact and the Foundation will operate under the Iranian Mission Office.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 58.) Badr also wrote that Kharrazi had \u201ctold almost everyone that they [Kharrazi and the Ayatollah] will be directly responsible for the Mostazafan Foundation of New York and will not only control its activities, but supervise it as well.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\u2022 In that letter, Badr set forth the dangers of an open connection between the Foundation and the Islamic Republic of Iran:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">... I and members of the Foundation\u2019s Board of Trustees have frequently signed affidavits addressed to American authorities ... stating that the Foundation is independent and devoid of any connection to the Government of Iran and the Iranian Government\u2019s qualified authorities. If this Issue, which has created a connection between the Foundation and the Government of Iran and is surely known to the American authorities, is deemed a violation and causes actions to be taken against the Foundation, I and the other members of the Board of Trustees ... will be culpable of a heavy of-fence [sic]. Therefore a solution needs to be thought of for us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">\u2022 Following Badr\u2019s resignation from the Mostazafan Foundation, Kharrazi and Seyed Mohammad Hadi Nejad Hosseinian (Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the U.N. after Kharrazi stepped down until approximately 2002) attended the Foundation\u2019s board meetings. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 63.) Hosseinian set forth the formula that the Foundation would use to distribute funds. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">\u2022 In the late 1990s, two Bank Melli employees met with Kharrazi to discuss the possibility of Assa Corp. selling its interest in the building at 650 Fifth Avenue. Kharrazi did not give them permission. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">\u2022 There were numerous meetings at which individuals from the Foundation and employees from Bank Melli met to discuss business associated with the Foundation, the building at 650 Fifth Avenue, distributions to the Assa Corp. and other matters. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 83-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u2022 In 2004, the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations and the Finance Minister for Iran met to discuss the resolution of a lawsuit brought against the Foundation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65, 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\u2022 Starting in approximately 2007, the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations would meet with individuals from the Foundation in a closed room in Queens or at one of the Ambassador\u2019s residences. At those meetings, issues with respect to management of the building at 650 Fifth Avenue and the charitable activities of the Foundation were discussed. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\u2022 In 2007, Mohammad Khazaee became the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 66.) At a meeting relating to the Foundation held at the residence of the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations, he stated that it should only allocate grants to Shiites and that he would determine the composition of the Board of the Foundation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 70.) He also stated that if there was an issue \u201cthat needs to be conveyed to Tehran, let me know, I will convey it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 72.) During that meeting in 2007, the Iranian Ambassador to the U.N. and individuals from the Foundation discussed that the Cultural Assembly of Iran would provide \u201ccultural guidance\u201d regarding to the activities of the Foundation. At the same meeting, the participants discussed \u201cWhat are you doing to safeguard the interests of the regime and Islam ... ?\u201d and \u201cWe need your opinion in relation to the cultural strategy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 74-75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\u2022 The Foundation has played an ongoing role in managing the operations of the building at 650 Fifth Avenue. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 98-100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Documents obtained pursuant to the search warrants also reveal that there was an ongoing attempt to deny any relationship between the Foundation and the Government of Iran in order to avoid paying civil judgments obtained against Iran in courts in the United States. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 103.) For instance, in 1992 a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Foundation to obtain compensation for assets expropriated by the Government of Iran. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 102.) In 1992, the Foundation submitted an affidavit<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in connection with that lawsuit which represented, \u201cThe New York Foundation conducts no business with the Government of Iran or the Mostazafan Foundation of Iran ... The New York Foundation has never been an agent or instrumentality of the Government of Iran or the Mostazafan Foundation of Iran.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Similarly, in a 1995 deposition, the president of the Foundation was asked whether there was a \u201crelationship between ... the Mostazafan Foundation of Iran, and the Alavi Foundation of New York,\u201d to which he responded, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d (U.S. Compl. \u00b6 104.) In his 1996 deposition, the Foundation\u2019s Ahmadi was asked, \u201cDid you ever receive instructions in terms of your role as a director for the New York Foundation from any person or entity in Iran?\u201d to which he responded, \u201cNo.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 105.) Ahmadi had been one of the individuals who had resigned from the board pursuant to the direction of the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations as instructed by the Ayatollah. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>D. <em>Additional Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">Moreover, documents seized pursuant to the search warrants revealed that the New York Foundation in fact communicated with the Iranian Mostazafan Foundation regarding the <em>Gabay </em>litigation pending against the Foundation at various times during 1992-1993. (U.S. Compl. \u00b6106.) The <em>Gabay </em>case was dismissed on the grounds that there was no connection between the Bonyad Mostazafan of Iran and the New York Foundation. <em>See Gabay, </em>968 F.Supp. at 900. The Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal stating, \u201cWe affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction over this Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u2018FSIA\u2019) suit because plaintiff Gabay has offered insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of independence between defendants Mostazafan Foundation of Iran and Mostazafan Foundation of New York.\u201d <em>Gabay, </em>152 F.3d 918, 1998 WL 385909, at *1.

Flatow brought a wrongful death lawsuit against Iran relating to the death of his daughter resulting from a terrorist bombing in the Gaza Strip, with which Iran was associated. Flatow obtained a default judgment against Iran, but when he attempted to attach assets of the Foundation, the court dismissed his action on the grounds that Flatow could not demonstrate a connection between the Foundation and the government of Iran. <em>See Flatow v.

LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">A. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Plaintiffs have asserted that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over their actions, <em>inter alia, </em>by virtue of the FSIA. <em>(See </em>Third Am. Compl. of Steven Greenbaum (\u201cGreenbaum Compl.\u201d) (Dkt. No. 256-1) \u00b6 4; Am. Acosta of Carlos Acosta (\u201cAcosta Compl.\u201d) (Dkt. No. 256-3) \u00b6 5; Am.

No. 259-1) \u00b6 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Determining the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold inquiry and a case is properly dismissed under 12(b)(1) when the district court lacks the constitutional power to adjudicate the action. <em>See Arar v. Ashcroft, </em>532 F.3d 157, 168 (2d Cir.2008). The party invoking federal subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <em>Makarova v. United States, </em>201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">In determining whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 actions, the court accepts as true all material factual allegations in the complaint, but refrains from drawing inferences favorable to the plaintiff because the burden of establishing jurisdiction is the plaintiffs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>See APWU v. Potter, </em>343 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, for jurisdictional purposes, the court may resolve disputed factual issues by reference to evidence outside of the pleadings. <em>See Flores v. Southern Peru Copper Corp., </em>343 F.3d 140, 161 n. 30 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also Makarova, </em>201 F.3d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Here, the verified complaint filed by the United States government is incorporated by reference into each of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. <em>(See, </em>e.g., Greenbaum Compl. \u00b6 20; Acosta Compl. \u00b6 21; Peterson Compl. \u00b6 37.)

The factual matters addressed in the U.S.\u2019s complaint have been verified by a Special Agent of the FBI; that verified complaint is legally treated as an affidavit that may be considered on this motion. <em>See Patterson v. Cnty. of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d 206, 219 (2d Cir.2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moving Defendants have failed to controvert the authenticity or accuracy of the extensive quotations from the seized documents in that complaint and thus, those facts are uncontested for purposes of determining subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

In other words, the complaint must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Starr v.

In applying that standard, the court accepts as true all well-plead factual allegations, but does not credit \u201cmere conclusory statements\u201d or \u201cthreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court can infer no more than \u201cthe mere possibility of misconduct\u201d from the factual averments\u2014in other words, if the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint have not \u201cnudged claims across the line from conceivable to plausible,\u201d dismissal is appropriate. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <em>Starr, </em>592 F.3d at 321 (quoting <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">C. <em>The FSIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">The FSIA codifies \u201cthe restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Verlinden B.V. v.

Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, </em>462 U.S. 611, 627, 103 S.Ct. 2591, 77 L.Ed.2d 46 (1983) <em>(\u201cBancec </em>\u201d). The \u201cpresumption of independent status\u201d is not to be \u201clightly overcome.\u201d <em>Hercaire Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Argentina, </em>821 F.2d 559, 565 (11th Cir.1987). Such \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d include a foreign state\u2019s \u201cpolitical subdivisions <em>and </em>agencies or instrumentalities,\u201d as set forth in the statute. <em>See Hester Int\u2019l Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>879 F.2d 170, 176 n. 5 (5th Cir.1989) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Despite the presumption of independent status, in <em>Bancec </em>the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cequitable principle[s]\u201d allow a court to disregard the corporate form \u201cwhere it is interposed to defeat legislative purposes\u201d or would \u201cwork fraud or injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629-630, 103 S.Ct. 2591. Indeed, the Supreme Court found that \u201cwhere a corporate entity is so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created, we have held that one may be held liable for the actions of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629-630, 103 S.Ct. 2591.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, where a court disregards the corporate form and determines that an entity is an \u201calter ego\u201d of a foreign state, it essentially finds that the entity \u201cis\u201d a foreign state for purposes of the FSIA. <em>See, e.g. Hester Int\u2019l Corp., </em>879 F.2d at n. 7; <em>Hercaire Int\u2019l, Inc. v.

In <em>Kalamazoo, </em>the district court found that where the government had assumed day-to-day operations of a government-owned corporation as well as, <em>inter alia, </em>expropriated the majority of the corporation\u2019s stock, the corporation was no longer distinguishable from the government itself and thus, was an instrumentality of the foreign state. 616 F.Supp. at 666.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Two examples where courts did <em>not </em>disregard the corporate form under <em>Bancec </em>also provide insight into what type of conduct is affirmatively required to find an entity \u201cis\u201d a foreign state for purposes of the FSIA. In <em>Gibbons v. Republic of Ireland, </em>532 F.Supp. 668 (D.D.C.1982), the court declined to find that the defendant was a foreign sovereign or an instrumentality thereof on the basis that plaintiffs had failed to show that the government officials acted in concert with the employees of the instrumentality: \u201cundisputed affidavits ... establish that no representative of the ministries had any actual involvement with these matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In <em>Letelier v.

The court reviewed <em>Bancec </em>and stated that although it did not find that LAN itself had engaged in the sort of abuse that eliminated the presumption of separateness, it acknowledge that \u201c[t]he broader message [from <em>Bancec </em>] is that foreign states cannot avoid their obligations by engaging in abuses of corporate form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In <em>Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, </em>538 U.S. 468, 123 S.Ct. 1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003), the Supreme Court refined the doctrine set forth in <em>Bancec. </em>There, the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201c[t]he veil separating corporations and their shareholders may be pierced in some circumstances ... The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, however, is the rare exception, applied in the case of fraud or certain other exceptional circumstances ... and is usually determined on a case by case basis.\u201d The Court noted that \u201ccontrol and ownership, however, are distinct concepts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 123 S.Ct. 1655.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The language of \u201ccontrol\u201d is nonetheless consistent with <em>Bancec </em>in which the Supreme Court found that control can rise to such a level that an agent/principle relationship is effectively created. <em>See Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 629, 103 S.Ct. 2591; <em>see also United States Fidelity and Guar. v. Braspetro Oil Services Co., </em>199 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Bancec </em>for the proposition that control can rise to such a level that an entity becomes the alter ego of another entity).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">In <em>EM Ltd. v. The Republic of Argentina, </em>720 F.Supp.2d 273 (S.D.N.Y.2010), applying the rationale of both <em>Bancec </em>and <em>Dole, </em>Judge Griesa held that the Central Bank of Argentina was the alter ego of the Republic of Argentina on the basis that corporate formalities will be disregarded where to recognize them would work a fraud or injustice. <em>See id. </em>at 298. In <em>EM, </em>the court correctly noted that in <em>Bancec </em>the Supreme Court set forth a distinction between an \u201cagent\u201d of a foreign government and an \u201cagency\u201d of a foreign govern<em>ment </em>\u2014 i.e., where an entity is an \u201cagent,\u201d there is no legal distinction between it and its principal and thus, it can become liable for the debts of its principal. <em>Id. </em>at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Although those illustrations provide guidance as to how to determine whether the corporate form may be disregarded to determine that an instrumentality \u201cis\u201d a foreign state, or an \u201corgan\u201d thereof, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(2), the body of caselaw sets forth various relevant factors a court can consider, including (1) whether the foreign state created the entity for a national purpose; (2) whether the foreign state actively supervises the entity; (3) whether the foreign state requires the hiring of public employees and pays their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>salaries; (4) whether the entity holds exclusive rights to some right in the [foreign] country; and (5) how the entity is treated under foreign state law. <em>See Filler v. Hanvit Bank, </em>378 F.3d 213, 217 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Kelly v. Syria Shell Petroleum Dev. B.V., </em>213 F.3d 841, 846-47 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Hausler v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>845 F.Supp.2d 553, 572-73 (S.D.N.Y.2012). No one factor is dispositive or should be given particular weight. <em>See Hausler, </em>845 F.Supp.2d at 572-73. In both <em>Weininger v. Castro, </em>462 F.Supp.2d 457 (S.D.N.Y.2006), and the recently-decided <em>Hausler </em>case, the court noted that it is mindful of the fact that the \u201cinstrumentality and its related government\u201d will frequently possess most of the information needed to establish organ status. <em>See Weininger, </em>462 F.Supp.2d at 495; <em>Hausler, </em>845 F.Supp.2d at 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Those principles set the ground work for determining (a) whether Moving Defendants are Iranian<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and thus, subject to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction under the FSIA, and (b) whether, at this stage of the proceedings, plaintiffs have stated a claim for turnover of the assets for satisfaction of a judgment under TRIA. The inquiry that provides the answer to both questions is whether the assets to which plaintiffs seek turnover are \u201cIranian\u201d: if so, this Court must determine whether one of the exceptions to the FSIA confers subject matter jurisdiction; if not, then they do not fall within the definition of TRIA and this action would therefore be subject to dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The relevant legal principles along with the facts derived from the documents seized pursuant to search warrants (the authenticity of which have not been contested by Moving Defendants) amply supports this Court\u2019s determination that Moving Defendants are \u201cIran,\u201d or alter egos or organs thereof, and that the terrorism exception to the FSIA precludes immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs have set forth a sufficient factual basis for subject matter jurisdiction and have stated a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">A. <em>Iran</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">First, the Court finds that the Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue meet the definition of \u201cIran\u201d as set forth in E.O. 13599 and the definition promulgated by the U.S. Department of Treasury at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">E.O. 13599 defines Iran as \u201cany political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, ... and any [individual or entity] owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran.\u201d Based on the facts set forth in the seized documents, there can be no serious debate at this stage of the proceedings that Moving Defendants well and truly meet that definition. As of the date of the Iranian Revolution, it is clear that the operations and direction of the Foundation were driven from Tehran based upon the direct orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of the Ayatollah and/or the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations acting at Khomeini\u2019s direction. It is apparent from the numerous interactions that occurred between members of the Iranian government and individuals associated with the Foundation over the years that Iran drove decisions on charitable strategy, operation of the 650 Fifth Avenue building, the creation of the separate 650 Fifth Avenue Company, distributions to Assa Corp. (an entity openly acknowledged to be the Iranian government and, although not dispositive, an entity on the SDN list), as well as the leadership and board membership of the Foundation. The Foundation corresponded on letterhead of the Islamic Republic of Iran, terminated employees and board members pursuant to directives from the government of Iran, and was told that the Iranian Ambassador would be in fact managing its affairs. Those facts leave little question that the Foundation was an entity \u201ccontrolled\u201d by the Government of Iran. <em>See </em>E.0.13599.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Indeed, those facts inexorably drive towards the conclusion that the Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue have no true separate decision making authority, power or real existence except that allowed and directed by the Iranian government. That is far from the type of mere \u201ccontrol\u201d without ownership that the Supreme Court in the <em>Dole </em>case stated was insufficient. <em>See also United States Fidelity and Guar., </em>199 F.3d at 98. The fact that the Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue are situated in the United States and have obtained the trappings of corporate form by submitting what may be perjurious and false statements (that may be proven or disproven at trial but has not been contested on this motion) cannot change the clear reality of what is before this Court at this time. The Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue are the Iranian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Treasury\u2019s 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304 provides for an even broader definition of the Iranian government than E.0.13599:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">(a) the state and Government of Iran, as well as any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof; (b) Any entity owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the foregoing; (c) Any person to the extent that such person is, or has been, or to the extent that there is reasonable cause to believe that such person is, or has been, since the applicable effective date, acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of any of the foregoing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Under that guidance, the Court finds \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue have been acting directly or indirectly on behalf of the Iranian government. Certainly the facts recited directly above and in the detailed recitation of facts support such reasonable cause. Accordingly, this Court finds that the Moving Defendants are \u201cIran\u201d or the \u201cgovernment of Iran.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">B. <em>Alter Egos of the Iranian Government</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Second, under <em>Bancec </em>and its progeny, the Court finds that the Foundation and 650 Fifth constitute \u201calter egos\u201d of the Iranian Government such that they can be considered one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Again, the facts set forth above support that conclusion. In addition to the above recitation, it is clear that by taking all significant direction from the Ayatollah and/or the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations, the government of Iran dominated Moving Defendants such that they are at least \u201cagents\u201d of the Iranian government. The Foundation\u2019s charitable giving appears to be driven by directives from the Iranian government; and the management and operations of the property at 650 Fifth Avenue appears to be over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>seen and controlled by the Iranian government. The facts in the seized documents demonstrate (at least at this stage) that Moving Defendants have no ability to act in any significant way without authorization from Tehran. That is certainly enough at this stage of the proceedings for a finding that Moving Defendants are \u201calter egos\u201d of Iran. <em>See Kalamazoo, </em>616 F.Supp. at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">C. <em>Organs of Iran Under the FSIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Third, even if this Court were to assume that the Moving Defendants are neither part of the Iranian government nor alter egos of the Iranian government, it would nonetheless conclude that they meet the definition of an organ of a foreign state under the FSIA. As set forth above, section 1603 of the FSIA sets forth a three factor test for determining whether an entity is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Here, Moving Defendants purport to meet the first factor of having formalistically separate corporate forms (the Foundation is incorporated in New York and 650 Fifth Avenue purports to be organized as a partnership under New York state law). The facts before the Court indicate, however, that the corporate forms were obtained (or maintained) fraudulently.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Moving Defendants also meet the second factor of constituting \u201corgans\u201d of a foreign state. Although there is no specific definition of \u201corgan\u201d, caselaw sets forth relevant, non-exclusive factors. Among those met here are that the Pahlavi Foundation was created by the Shah for a national purpose; this purpose was overtaken by the purposes of the Ayatollah who assumed control over its direction on behalf of the Iranian government; the extensive history of Iranian government involvement in all aspects of the Foundation and the creation of the 650 Fifth Avenue Company make it clear that the Iranian government actively supervises both entities; and the Ayatollah appears to have required the termination of board members and replacement with other board members. As set forth above, there are numerous additional facts suggesting that the Foundation and the 650 Fifth Avenue Company have no true independent discretion regarding their operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The fact that a receiver was put in place after the commencement of this action by Order of this Court does not alter that analysis. That receiver was appointed to insure that the assets were maintained in accordance with U.S. law pending the outcome of this lawsuit. The fact of the receivership does not alter the history of the organizations or what would occur if the receivership were to be terminated. Indeed, the fact that on the date of the execution of the search warrants the FBI caught the Foundation\u2019s president attempting to destroy documents demonstrating the Foundation\u2019s connection to the Iranian government further demonstrates that the passage of time has done nothing to alter the unmistakable connection with (and control by) the Iranian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">An additional requirement under the FSIA \u201corgan\u201d test is that the entities in question are not citizens of a State. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(3). Moving Defendants argue that since the Foundation was incorporated in New York by the Shah in 1973, it is duly incorporated in a state, and the partnership that established 650 Fifth Avenue meets the requirements to be a citizen of New York state as well. Moving Defendants emphasize that point by citing instances in which plaintiffs allege that the Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue are citizens of the state of New York. This argument is without merit. The caselaw recited above and as set forth in <em>Bancec, </em>demonstrates that courts have long recognized instances in which formal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>istic adherence to corporate form can work inequity \u2014 particularly, where there is fraud. <em>See </em>462 U.S. at 629-30, 103 S.Ct. 2591. As the Supreme Court stated clearly in <em>Bancec, </em>in those instances, the Court may disregard the corporate form. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">That is precisely the case here. The extensive facts suggesting that the Foundation submitted false affidavits and made false representations to the Attorney General\u2019s Office of the State of New York support an equitable disregard of the Foundation\u2019s corporate form and 650 Fifth Avenue\u2019s alleged citizenship. To adhere to corporate formalities that the factual record suggests were achieved in order to obscure ownership by Iran, would privilege form over substance, and thereby form over equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Accordingly, this Court finds that Moving Defendants constitute \u201corgans\u201d under \u00a7 1603(b) of the FSIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">D. <em>The Terrorism Exception to the FSIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As a foreign sovereign (or instrumentality thereof) (as found in Part III.A. <em>supra) </em>or as an alter ego of a foreign sovereign (as found in Part III.B <em>supra), </em>Moving Defendants would necessarily be immune from suit. However, section 1605A of the FSIA states that \u201c[a] foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction ... in any case ... in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A. The TRIA provides for the same. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(f)(1)(A). Where, as here, plaintiffs seek turnover of assets to fulfill judgments obtained in actions that were premised upon terrorist acts, those exceptions do away with any immunity Moving Defendants may have had. Accordingly, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Moving Defendants.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The motion to dismiss is denied in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">IV. PLAINTIFFS STATE A CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuits seek compensation from the Iranian government for the wrongful death of numerous individuals who died as a r\u00e9sult of Iran\u2019s acts of terrorism. This Court has found that at this stage of the proceedings, there is a sufficient basis \u2014 and plausible facts alleged \u2014 to determine that Moving Defendants are the Iranian government, or agencies or instrumentalities thereof. For that reason, the Court finds that plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">For the aforementioned reasons, Moving Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">The parties are directed to appear for a status conference on September 7, 2012 at 1:30 p.m. to set a date for a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">The Clerk of the Court is directed to terminate the motion at Docket No. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">.

Pt. 560, App. A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b578-15\">. Bank Melli has conceded that it is an instrumentality of Iran. <em>See, e.g., Weinstein </em>v. <em>Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>609 F.3d 43, 48 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">. As set forth above, just prior to the submission of that affidavit in the other matter, the Foundation had had a meeting with individuals from Bank Melli to discuss all aspects of the Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue's operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. In <em>Flatow, </em>the court based its decision in part on the fact that although Flatow asserted interconnections between the entities, he had failed to support certain assertions with an affidavit. <em>See </em>67 F.Supp.2d at 542.

As Moving Defendants acknowledge in footnote 1 of their Memorandum in Support of this motion (Dkt. No. 251), and in footnote 3 of their Supplemental Brief in Support (Dkt. No. 271), when considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, this Court can examine affidavits submitted in connection with such a motion. <em>See, e.g., Filetech S.A. v. France Telecom </em>S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 932 (2d Cir.1998.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b586-14\">.

In <em>Bancec, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether Citibank could assert a set-off against a claim made by Bancec against Citibank, for assets previously seized by the Cuban Government. Based on the facts of that case, the Court determined that Bancec was not an independent entity from the Cuban government and found that if Bancec recovered the full amount it sought from Citibank, the true beneficiary would have been the government of Cuba. The Court found that there would have been an obvious inequity in allowing the government of Cuba to \"obtain relief in our courts that it could not obtain in its own right without waiving its sovereign immunity and answering for the seizure of Citibank\u2019s assets ...\u201d <em>Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 632, 103 S.Ct. 2591.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that although Israel had exerted substantial control over the operations of certain companies, on the facts before it, such control was not commensurate with ownership and thus, was insufficient for piercing the veil. <em>Id. </em>at 1659-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\">.

On page 8 of their Reply Memorandum (Dkt. No. 261), Moving Defendants argue (without citation) that plaintiffs cannot import definitions of \"Iran\u201d from the Executive Order or from Treasury Regulations. There is no basis for that position. The FSIA is designed to provide immunity to sovereign governments (unless an exception applies); it does not purport to provide an exclusive manner of defining a sovereign government. It only provides a set of factors for determining if an entity is an agency or instrumentality if one needs to inquire at that level. Here, the Court finds a sufficient factual support to find that these entities \"are\u201d the Iranian government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. Because this Court determines that there is a sufficient basis for subject matter jurisdiction based on the FSIA, it need not reach the other asserted bases for such jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
