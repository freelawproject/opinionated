He asked them to send sacks by the Pan Handle Railroad, and he would be at the station and meet them; he directed them to be marked \u201c Martin Dinsmore, Burgettstown Station.\u201d On Saturday he came with O\u2019Brien, the drayman, with a load of wool; after examining the wool, the defendants expressed dissatisfaction with its quality, but they finally arranged to take it at 40 cents per pound, and paid him $3050 in cash for 7625 pounds; he left about 3-ijr o\u2019clock on Saturday afternoon. On Monday about 10 o\u2019clock the plaintiff came to defendants\u2019 store, and asking for Mr. Barker, was referred to that member of the firm ; plaintiff said he was not the Barker who had been to his place and bought the wool, and who said he was a cousin of William Barker, who was lying sick of typhoid fever, and had heard plaintiff had a lot of wool, and plaintiff had sold it(to him for 50 cents per pound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-12\">The defendants gave other evidence, which in some of its details was contradictory of plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-13\">The following were plaintiff\u2019s points and their answers-:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-14\">1. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff agreed with a party, representing himself to be a member of the firm of Wm. Barker, Jr., &amp; Co., to sell his wool to said firm, and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>representation was false and fraudulent, and made without the knowledge or authority of said firm, no title to the wool passed to said William Barker, Jr., &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">Answer: \u201c This point is affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">4. Even if the man calling himself Martin Dinsmore did not represent to the defendants, or either of them, that he was the son of John Dinsmore, and the wool was his father\u2019s, but claimed to be the owner of the wool himself, and the railway company delivered the wool to the drayman, T. O\u2019Brien, as the agent of the pretended Martin Dinsmore, or to the man Martin Dinsmore himself, his possession of the wool thus acquired being without right or color of right, he could not vest a title in the defendants by a sale to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\">Answer: \u201c As we have said in our general charge, if this pretended Martin Dinsmore, or Barker, acquired no title to this avooI by his alleged purchase from the plaintiff, he could convey no title to the defendants, no matter how he obtained the possession from the railroad company, it could give him no title, because it had no title to convey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\">The following are points of the defendants and their answers:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">2. If the jury find, from the evidence, that the plaintiff, John Dinsmore, sold the wool in controversy to a person represented by the name of \u201cBarker\u201d or \u201cDinsmore,\u201d and delivered the wool according to and in pursuance of the terms of the contract of sale, the property vested in the purchaser in so far as to enable him to make a good and valid sale of the wool to any bonfi fide purchaser, who had no notice or knowledge of the fraud practised by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-11\">Answer: \u201c This point is sufficiently answered in the general charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-12\">3. If the plaintiff sold the avooI in controversy to Martin Dins-more, alias Barker, believing him to be a member of the firm of Wm. Barker, Jr., &amp; Co.,defendants, and in pursuance of the contract of sale delivered the wool at Dinsmore station to be delivered by the railroad to Barker &amp; Co., and the avooI was delivered to Dinsmore, alias Barker, at Pittsburg, and he sold it to the defendants at a fair market price, without knoAvledge or notice of the alleged fraud, they have a good title to the avooI, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-13\">Answer: \u201c The court decline to affirm this point in the terms in which it is stated, but refer to our general charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-14\">4. If, from all the evidence in the case, the jury believe that the defendants purchased the wool in controversy from Martin Dins-more, alias Barker, after he had received it from the railroad company, at a fair market price, without knoAvledge or notice of any fraudulent acts or pretences, they have a good title to the wool, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Answer: \u201c This point is refused in the shape it is presented. If he (Martin Dinsmore) acquired no title to this wool by his alleged purchase from John Dinsmore, he could convey none to the defendants. See our general charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">5. This action of replevin cannot be maintained by the plaintiff against the defendants if the jury find from the testimony that the defendants are bond, fide purchasers from plaintiff\u2019s vendee, for a valuable consideration, in the usual course of trade, and without notice of the alleged fraud by which said vendee obtained the delivery and possession of the wool from plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">6. If the jury find, from the evidence, that the man from whom defendants purchased the wool obtained possession of it writh the consent of plaintiff, and with the intention, on plaintiff\u2019s part, to change the property, and that defendants purchased it from said first-named party for a valuable consideration, without notice of frudulent intentions or misrepresentations on his part, they are bond, fide purchasers, and entitled to the property as against plaintiff, and the verdict of the jury should be in favor of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">7. If the jury find, from the evidence, that the man representing himself to be Martin Dinsmore obtained possession of the wool in controversy from plaintiff, with his consent, and with the intention on his (plaintiff\u2019s) part to change the -property, under a contract by which plaintiff sold said wool to the said Martin Dinsmore at fifty cents per pound, to be delivered in Pittsburg, and to be paid for by said vendee after delivery, the plaintiff paying freight thereon from Dinsmore's station, Washington county, to Pittsburg, and that said vendee, under said contract, received the wool at Pitts-burg, and there sold and delivered the same to defendants for a fair and valuable consideration, paid in cash on delivery, without notice of any fraud or misrepresentation in the premises, then defendants thereby acquired a good title to the wool, and the jury should find for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">Answer: \u201c These points are sufficiently answered in the general charge, where we have said substantially, that if Martin Dinsmore, alias Barker, acquired title to this wool by his alleged purchase from plaintiff, he could convey that title to the defendants; but if he did not, then he had no title to convey to them, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">The court amongst other things charged :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-11\">\u201c * * * [The plaintiff, as we have stated, took the bill of lading in his own name, as consignor, with the name of the defendants\u2019 firm as consignees. Thus far, at least, it would seem the title to this wool, as well as the right of possession, remained in the plaintiff, and he might, at any time, have stopped it <em>in transitu, </em>before it reached this city, and down to the time it was delivered to the defendants. There is no evidence going to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>plaintiff ever delivered this wool to this pretended partner, or in any way placed it under his control. That party had nothing to do with the shipping the wool, nor had he any right whatever to touch it, if he was not a member or agent of the firm of William Barker, Jr., &amp; Co., and it is clear from the testimony of the defendants that he was neither. Whatever control, therefore, he undertook to exercise over it, for his own individual interest, was done without the slightest authority from the plaintiff]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\"><em>\u201c </em>A great deal of evidence has been given as to the way this wool was received from the railroad company, and delivered to the defendants, but it is not deemed necessary to state it in detail. Prom the undisputed evidence in the cause, it is manifest that a gross fraud has been perpetrated by this stranger, and the question now to be determined is, on whom shall the loss fall \u2014 on the plaintiff, or defendants ? This is a mixed question of law and fact \u2014 the former is for the court to determine, the latter is for the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\"><em>\u201c </em>[Let us consider, for a few moments, what induced Dinsmore, the plaintiff, to make the alleged sale of his wool, and ship it to Pittsburg. Did he intend ,to sell it to this stranger, as an individual, on his own responsibility, without reference to his connection with the firm of William Barker, Jr. &amp; Co., or was it his understanding, from all the attending circumstances, that he was dealing with a member, or agent of the firm ? If he had known the fact that this man was not authorized by the defendants, to purchase this wool for them, would he have shipped it to Pittsburg, and run the risk of getting his pay from the defendants ?]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">\u201c Now, if you believe, from the evidence in the cause, that this young man, calling himself \u2018 Barker,\u2019 was not a member of the defendants\u2019 firm, nor their agent, and that he falsely represented himself to the plaintiff as a member of that firm, or their agent, and authorized to buy wool for them, and at the same time produced a number of sacks, exhibited them to him, and that they had been given to him by the defendants, bearing the name of the firm thereon \u2014 and by reason of such fraudulent representations and conduct, he induced the plaintiff to part with the actual possession of his wool, and deliver it to the railroad company, to be carried to Pittsburg, to be delivered to the firm of William Barker, Jr., &amp; Co., no title to this wool passed, either to the said pretended <em>\u2018 </em>Barker,\u2019 nor to the firm of William Barker, Jr., &amp; Co., the consignees in the bill of landing, and if the plaintiff did not part with his title, this pretended purchaser acquired no title, and consequently could convey no title to these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">\u201c The law on this subject is too well settled to need the citation of many authorities. No man can be deprived of his title to personal property by fraud. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">\u201c [These authorities show conclusively that if this pretended \u2018 Barker \u2019 had no title to this wool, he could, and did, pass no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>title to the defendants, by his sale to them. You will apply the law as we have now stated it, to the evidence in this case, and if you find that this pretended Barker, in the transaction with the plaintiff, John Dinsmore, acquired no title for himself, individually, he could convey no title to the defendants, and your verdict will be for the plaintiff. But if you find from the evidence, that Dins-more sold the wool to this Barker, as an individual, on his own responsibility, without reference to the fact of his being either a partner with the defendants, or their agent; and if that was the intention of the parties at the time, then the plaintiff will not be entitled to recover, and your verdict will be for the defendants.]\u201d* *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $3121.71.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">The defendants took out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\">They assigned for error the answers to the points, and the parts of the charge included in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-9\"><em>A.

Nor was the wool delivered to him by the plaintiff. It was delivered to the railroad company, to be carried to Pittsburg, and there delivered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defendants, to whom it was consigned by the plaintiff. Under the contract of shipment the company had no right to deliver the wool to any person except the consignees; and their delivery of it to the defendants\u2019 vendor vested in him no property or right of possession as against the plaintiff. The principle which underlies this case, and by which the rights of the parties are to be determined, is this: The sale of goods by one who has tortiously obtained their possession without the owner\u2019s consent, vests in the purchaser no title to them as against the owner. As a general rule no man can be divested of his property without his own consent and voluntary act. It is true that there are exceptions to the rule, as clearly defined and as well settled as the rule itself, but this case' does not come within any of them. Here the defendants\u2019 vendor, as we have seen, acquired no right or title to the wool under his contract with the plaintiff, and he did not obtain from him its actual possession. The railroad company had no authority, as the plaintiff\u2019s agent, to deliver the wool to him, and their delivery gave him no right or title to it whatever. Nor had he any apparent or implied authority from the plaintiff to sell or dispose of it. It is clear, then, that he could convey no title by its sale; and if so, the defendants could acquire no title by its purchase, though they purchased it for a fair and valuable consideration, in the usual course of trade, without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s ownership, or of any suspicious circumstances calculated to awaken inquiry or put them on their guard. The case is a hard one in any aspect of it. One of two innocent parties must suffer by the fraud and knavery of a swindler, who had no authority to act for either. But the law is well settled that the owner cannot be divested of his property without his own consent, unless he has placed it in the possession or custody of another and given him an apparent or implied right to dispose of it. The case was tried on this principle, and as there is no error apparent in the record, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
