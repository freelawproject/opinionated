On the 27th of July 1871, William died intestate and without issue, leaving unpaid the legacy of $300 bequeathed to his sister Nancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">\u201c That this legacy was a personal charge upon William, for which his estate is liable, there can be no doubt;. but if he did not leave personal assets sufficient to pay the legacy, the question is, was it made a charge upon the land, so that if William\u2019s estate therein has become extinct, the land is still subject to its payment in the hands of John, the surviving devisee ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-10\">. \u201c In Wright\u2019s Appeal, taken up from this county, and reported in 2 Jones 257, the devise was to testator\u2019s son Thomas. If he chose to accept, he -was <em>to pay </em>$1700 to legatees. In deciding the legaey not to be a charge upon the land, the Supreme Court reiterated the rule laid down in Montgomery <em>v. </em>McElroy, 3 W. &amp; S. 371, that \u2018 to make a' legacy a charge upon land devised, it is necessary it should be declared so by express words, or that it may be inferred from the whole will that such was the intention of the testator.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\">\u201c Tower\u2019s Appropriation, 9 W. &amp; S. 103, was a devise of all the testator\u2019s real and personal estate, the devisee \u2018 paying the several legacies hereinafter mentioned.\u2019 The design to charge the land was held to arise from the blending of the real and personal estate, the legal inference being that the devisee was to have nothing till the legacies were paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-12\">\u201cThe latest casein the hooks is that of Hamilton <em>v. </em>Porter and Wife, 13 P. F. Smith 332, where the language used was : He \u2018 is to take the within-mentioned \u2018land\u2019 at my death, and pay $700,\u2019 &amp;c. There is no appreciable difference between the expression here employed and that we are considering. In both cases the devisee was to pay a specified sum, for which, upon his acceptance, he was personally liable. There is no expressed intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>create a lien upon the land for the benefit of the legatee, nor can it be inferred from the tenor of the whole will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">\u201c The devise to William Buchanan of the Pennsylvania lands vested in him an estate in fee simple under the ninth section of the Act of 1838. What, then, is the effect of the qualifying words of the codicil upon the absolute estate thus given to him by the will ? It is claimed on behalf of his brother Walter and sister Nancy that the design of the codicil was to provide merely for the contingency of the death of William or John without issue in the testator\u2019s lifetime, and that William, having survived his father, took an indefeasible estate in fee simple. The presumption is that the testator did not expect to outlive the sons between whom he divided the inheritance, and therefore this construction could be resorted to only on the ground of necessity, and to carry into effect the manifest intention of the will. The provision in the codicil that, upon the death of William or John without issue, his portion of the land should pass to the survivor, and in that event the survivor should pay legacies to Walter, Nancy and Jane <em>in one and two years thereafter, </em>indicates an intent adverse to such construction, and shows conclusively that the contingency must be referred to a period subsequent to the testator\u2019s death; otherwise the time fixed for the payment of the legacies might arrive in the testator\u2019s lifetime, and before the devise to the sons, or the survivor of them, could take effect. Moreover, the $300 legacy bequeathed by the will to Nancy, which William was to pay, would fail for want of any provision for its payment, in the event of his dying without issue in his father\u2019s lifetime. We are of opinion that William Buchanan did not take an absolute and indefeasible estate in fee simple in the Pennsylvania land at the death of his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">\u201c It matters not what we call the estates given by the will to William and John \u2014 Avhether estates tail, with vested cross-remainders in fee in favor of the survivor, or fee simple estates, upon condition that the son first dying should leave issue, and failing to do so, his estate should pass to the survivor as an executory devise. The codicil providing that the survivor should pay the legacies within a <em>prescribed time </em>to persons <em>in esse, </em>the testator could not have contemplated an indefinite failure of issue, but a failure of issue at the death of William or John, whichever of them should first die. The estate given to William, therefore, might be regarded as a conditional fee, with executory devise over to John; but whatever his estate might be, it became extinct upon his death without issue, and by the limitation of the will the land passed to John as the survivor: 5 Casey 490; 12 Harris 249; 13 P.
