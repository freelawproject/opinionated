Because the endorsement by defendant Noble upon the certified order of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (as appears by the record above recited) did not give jurisdiction to said court over the person of Noble so as to render effectual and of 'force in this state the judgment rendered against him by said court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-18\">\u201c 2. That the record shows that the court in which suit was brought did not have jurisdiction over the person of defendant so as to make the judgment valid and effectual against him in this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-19\">\u201c These two reasons involve the same questions, viz.: Does this record show such a state of facts as to sustain an action in Pennsylvania against defendant Noble upon the judgment of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ? In other words, does this record show the court had jurisdiction over Noble, the defendant, so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>to render the judgment obtained against him valid and effectual beyond the limit of the state of Massachusetts ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">\u201c It seems to be settled beyond controversy that a judgment obtained against a person without notice, in a state where he has no residence, and in which he has no property during the pend-ency of the action, has no extra-territorial vitality \u2014 but that is not the precise case in hand. Here Noble not only had notice of the pendency of the suit, but actually accepted service of the same, in ample time before judgment, to have made defence if he had so wished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">\u201c The question now is, did this give the Supreme Court of Massachusetts such jurisdiction over the person of Noble as makes this judgment valid as the foundation of an action in Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">\u201c If the original summons, or what we may consider the same thing, this notice, had been served by the proper officer of the court of Massachusetts upon Noble in Pennsylvania, would that have given jurisdiction ?

Laws; Rogers <em>v. </em>Burns, 8 Casey 527.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The same doctrine is fully established by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts itself, in Hall <em>v. </em>Williams, 6 Pick. 240; Mills <em>v. </em>Duryee, 7 Cranch 481; Price <em>v. </em>Hickock, 89 Yt. 292. Is the case altered by reason of the acceptance of service by Noble of the notice directed to be served upon him by the court ? I think not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">\u201c The acceptance of service of a writ or notice I take to be nothing more than an assent to the service, which waives irregularities as to time and manner, but which amounts to nothing more than a proper and legal service would. It is not ever considered as equivalent to an appearance. But even assuming that the effect of the acceptance of service of the notice was substantially an agreement by Noble that the court should have jurisdiction, and so far as he was concerned, might proceed and dispose of the case without his appearance by perscin or attorney, I do not think this would help the matter. Even when a party is within the control of the court, consent will not give jurisdiction, nor will it give effect to a nullity. Here it is sought not only to give jurisdiction to a court by a mere inferential agreement by a party to a suit, but actually to confer upon the court of Massachusetts a right to exercise authority over a citizen of Pennsylvania, when within the jurisdiction of his own state. It is clear that this would be entirely inconsistent with the sovereignty of Pennsylvania, and therefore does not fall within the power of any individual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-11\">\u201c This disposes of the whole ease, and renders the examination of the other questions unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201c Let judgment be entered for defendant <em>non obstante </em>veredicto, upon payment of the verdict fee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">Judgment was accordingly entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">The plaintiff having removed the case to the Supreme Court, assigned the entering of this judgment for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>J).

Scott, of the same place, dated November 18th 1842, payable one day after date\u00a1 On this note Martin B. Scott commenced suit in the Court of Common Pleas in Boston, Massachusetts. The writ was directed to the sheriff, who was commanded to attach goods or estate of defendants, and for want thereof to take the bodies of said Graftan and Noble, and have them before the justices of the said court. The sheriff returned that he had attached a chip as the property of Graftan, and left a summons for him at his last and usual place of abode in Boston, to appear in court, and September 17th 1844, he returned that Theodore Noble was not a resident of his precinct, and had no known agent, and could not he served. Upon the affidavit of Graftan, this action was removed to the Supreme' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Judicial Court at Boston. Graftan appeared, and in March Term 1845, on motion of the plaintiff Scott, it appearing by inspection of the record, that defendant Noble was not an inhabitant of the Commonwealth nor resident therein at the time of the service of the writ, and had no place of abode or agent therein, and that no personal service of the writ has been made upon him, the court ordered the plaintiff to give notice to defendant Noble of the pendency of the action, by serving him with a true and attested copy of the order that'he might appear and show cause why judgment should not be rendered against him in this action. On an attested copy appears this endorsement: \u201c I accept service of the within writ, Theodore Noble,\u201d he then living in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On the 12th May 1846, judgment was entered against Joseph Graftan and Theodore Noble, in default of an appearance, for $6363.26 damages and costs of suit, &amp;c. The present suit is upon this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">It was a valid judgment against Graftan, but not against Noble, who was not a citizen or inhabitant of Massachusetts; had no estate or property therein, nor was at any time before or during the pendency of the suit within the state. In Reel <em>v. </em>Elder, 12 P. F. Smith 315, my brother Sharswood says: <em>\u201c </em>Nor did the evidence given of the notice of the pendency of the proceeding, admitting that it was served on the plaintiff, make any difference; for in the language of the opinion (by Justice Agnew) in Colvin <em>v. </em>Reed, 5 P. F. Smith 375, \u2018 back of it lies the want of power of the distant state to subject her to its jurisdiction\u2019 \u2014 clearly when it is once determined that a court has no jurisdiction. Notice, or even process duly served, cannot give vitality to the judgment it may pronounce. It is null and void, at least as to any extra-territorial effect.\u201d In addition to the authorities cited by the learned judge in the court below, Judge Eletcher said in Phelps <em>v. </em>Brewer, 9 Cushing 395 : \u201c It is a matter too well settled to admit of discussion, that when a party is not within the jurisdiction, and is not served with process, and does not voluntarily appear to answer to the suit, by himself or his attorney, the judgment cannot be enforced against him out of the local jurisdiction. This point has been fully and repeatedly decided by this court, and since the institution of this suit has been directly adjudged by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d In Bischoff <em>v. </em>Wethered, 9 Wall. 312, in a count on 'a judgment in the Court of Common Pleas at Westminster Hall, in England, the evidence was an exemplified copy of a judgment recovered against the defendant in the said Common Pleas, without any service of process on him, or any notice of the suit, other than a personal notice served in the city of Baltimore, Mr. Justice Bradley said, \u201c as to the first point raised, to wit, the effect of the proceeding in the Common Pleas, Westminster Hall, it is enough to say that it was wholly without jurisdiction of the person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and whatever validity it may have in England, <em>by </em>virtue of statute law against the property of the defendant there situate, it can have no validity here even of a prim\u00e1. facie character. It is simply null.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
