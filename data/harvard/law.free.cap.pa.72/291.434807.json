On the 19th of October 1856 the plaintiffs in this bill sued out in the District Court of Allegheny county a foreign attachment against Lewis Broad, in which the <em>railroad </em>company were made garnishees. On the 15th of April 1863 the plaintiffs recovered judgment in that attachment against Broad for $56847.73. A scire facias was issued against the <em>railroad </em>company as garnishees, and on the 14th of January 1864 there was recovered against them a judgment, finding that there were in their hands at the service of the writ certain notes belonging to Broad, and at that day the garnishees owed Broad $19,633.09;. and that the plaintiff should have execution against the garnishees, to be levied of the notes of Broad in their hands to the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment, and if the garnishees should refuse to deliver the notes or pay the amount of the judgment, that it should be levied of the garnishees\u2019 own goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-9\">5.

On the 19th of Octobep 1858, G. W. Cass was president, John P. Henderson was treasurer, and T. D. Messier comptroller or auditor of the <em>railroad </em>company.

The plaintiffs \u201c seek to discover what became of the freight-warrants, notes, &amp;c.,\u201d belonging to Broad, and whosoever, whether the <em>railway </em>company or Cass, Henderson or Messier, \u201c may be found chargeable with the possession of the said warrants, \u201d &amp;c., shall be ordered to produce and surrender the warrants, &amp;c., for the use of the plaintiffs, or account for their value to the extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-12\">The prayers of the bill were for a decree: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-13\">1.

Admitting the incorporation of the <em>railroad </em>company, denied that they were ever known by that name or that the two corporations were identical.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">2. They had no corporate existence on the 19th of October 1858, having been incorporated long afterwards by the legislatures of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and all the matters charged in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 in the bill, took place before their incorporation, and defendants had no knowledge of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\">3. They have no knowledge of the matters in the 5th paragraph of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">4. They have no knowledge of the notes mentioned in the 6th paragraph of the bill, or whether they were embraced in any mortgage of the <em>railroad </em>company, but if such notes existed they were a debt of the <em>railroad </em>company and were cut off, if not before paid, by the sale of the property and franchises of the <em>railroad </em>company under the mortgages of that company, by virtue of the decree of foreclosure before mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\">5. They admit the proceedings mentioned in the 7th paragraph of the bill, and that the property and franchises of the <em>railroad </em>company were sold under decrees of foreclosure of the mortgage, to certain gentlemen for $2,000,000; that afterwards the <em>railway </em>company was incorporated by the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and became the purchaser of the property, and has since owned it. They denied that the notes of freight-warrants of Broad ever came into the possession or control of the <em>railway </em>company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-10\">6. To the 8th paragraph of the bill. They deny that the franchises, &amp;c. of the <em>railroad company were </em>not covered and conveyed by the mortgages (admitting that the stock was not covered), they aver that the mortgages were a first lien on franchises and property of the <em>railroad </em>company, and the sale passed to the purchaser a clear title and free from all claims of creditors of the <em>railroad </em>company, but by an arrangement afterwards made, the stockholders of the <em>railroad </em>company were upon certain conditions allowed to convert their stock into the stock of the <em>railway </em>company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-11\">7.

They deny the liability to plaintiffs on account of their judgment by reason of their receipts of the freight-warrants, and that the warrants were ever in their possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-13\">9. They deny upon information, &amp;c. that on the 19th of October 1858, the <em>railroad </em>company were indebted to Broad, or held any freight-warrants or other securities belonging to him, but on the 9th of July 1858, and before the attachment, Broad assigned to S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>A. Taylor and N. Gleason, all his claims, &amp;c., against the <em>railroad </em>company, including the freight-warrants, and the <em>railroad company </em>was before October 19th 1858 notified of the assignments. Taylor and Gleason brought suit in the Circuit Court of the United States for Illinois, against the <em>railroad </em>company, to recover their indebtedness to Broad, and recovered judgment against the <em>railroad </em>company for $41,468.18, which was the whole amount due to Broad, and which by1 agreement with Broad was to have been paid in bonds and freight-warrants. This was all the <em>railroad </em>company owed Broad. Soon after the judgment, it was compromised by payment of the <em>railroad </em>company to Taylor and Gleason for $17,500 in freight-warrants, which were delivered to Taylor and Gleason before the <em>railway </em>company existed. There were no freight-warrants of the <em>railroad </em>company in favor of Broad when the plaintiff\u2019s suit was commenced, nor at the time of the judgment ; the freight-warrants were payable to bearer in freight on the railroad, and were sold by Taylor and Gleason to other parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">Messier and Cass answered:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">1.

There were not amongst those articles any freight-warrants, or notes belonging to Broad, nor were such articles ever in their possession: the facts in relation to them are before set forth in paragraph 9th of the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">8. Cass, Messier and Henderson, hold the same positions in the <em>railway </em>company, which they held in the <em>railroad </em>company, except that the title of Comptroller was substituted for that of Auditor. On the 30th of April 1864, Messier ceased to be comptroller and became assistant-president; the other two continued in their offices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">A replication was filed and an examiner appointed. Afterwards B. F. Lucas was appointed master to take further testimony, &amp;e., and report the facts together with the form of a decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-12\">The master found the allegations of the 2d, 3d and 4th para-' graphs of the bill to be true; and that the three notes to Broad, mentioned in the 6th paragraph, were not embraced in any mortgage of the <em>railroad </em>company, were the property of Broad, and were unaffected by the sale of <em>railroad </em>company\u2019s property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-13\">Referring to the Act of March 31st 1860, he said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-14\">\u201c The purpose and object of this act are, in the opinion of the master, clearly indicated by its title. It was not for the purpose of creating a new, separate and independent corporation, but to <em>re-organize </em>one already in existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-15\">\u201c Although the title to an act of the legislature was no part of the act itself, prior to the amendment to the Constitution of 1864, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>yet it may well serve to shed light upon the true intent of the act. Besides, the object of the act as indicated in the title, seems to be as clearly indicated in the fourth section of the act itself. It is there denominated a re-organization of the Pittsburg, Port Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company. Similar legislation was procured in the states of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThe mortgages against the railroad companies having been foreclosed on the 24th of October 1861, the trustees sold the road, property and franchises of the <em>railroad </em>company to James E. D. Lanier, John Edgar Thomson, Samuel J. Tilden, Samuel Hanna and Louis H. Meyer, as trustees for various persons whose names do not appear upon the record. This sale was confirmed\u2019 by the Circuit Courts of the United States, in the several states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and on the 18th of February 1862, the trustees executed a deed to the purchasers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">\u201c On the 26th day of February 1862, a meeting was held in the city of Pittsburg, at the office of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company, for the purpose of organizing, or rather of reorganizing, under the Acts of Assembly herein before mentioned. That re-organization was then effected, directors elected, and the name of the company changed from \u2018The Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company,\u2019 to \u2018The Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company.\u2019 The board of directors then met and proceeded with the transaction of the business pertaining to their office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">\u201c On the 2d day of March 1862, John F.

Thus considered, we have the following summary of the facts:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201cThe Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company became largely indebted, some of its indebtedness was secured by bonds and mortgages, while other portions of it were not so secured. Of the latter class of indebtedness was a debt of about $41,000 to Lewis Broad. Lewis Broad was indebted to the present complainants in a sum exceeding $6000. He being a non-resident of the state, the present complainants brought a suit in this court, which was commenced by writ of foreign attachment, in which the said company was made a garnishee, and the debt due by them was attached in their hands. A judgment was subsequently recovered by these complainants, first against Lewis Broad, the debtor, and afterwards against the said company garnishee. The company, acting through its officers, when the proper execution was issued, and the proper demand made by the sheriff, in the language of the law, <em>\u2018 </em>neglected and refused \u2019 to deliver up the securities which had been admitted by them and adjudged by the court to be in their hands, and to belong to the defendant Lewis Broad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">\u201c In the meantime proceedings were commenced and prosecuted in the Circuit Courts of the United States of the various districts through which the road passed, to foreclose the mortgages given by said company as well as those given by other companies for the payment of which the said company was liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">\u201c Pending these proceedings the said company applied to the legislature of Pennsylvania, and subsequently to the legislatures of the states of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, for the passage of acts to provide for the re-organization of the said company, which acts were passed by the respective legislatures named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201c The proceedings to foreclose the said mortgages were prosecuted, no defence of any kind having been made by the said company, and were finally consummated by a decree of foreclosure, an order of sale and a sale made to five parties, in trust for some person or persons, but who the <em>cestui que trust </em>was is not disclosed except by what was subsequently done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">\u201c After the said sale had been made to the said five trustees, and a conveyance made to them, an organization or re-organization of the company took place, and a conveyance was made by the said five trustees to the company re-organized under the name of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-9\">\u201c In this re-organization the stockholders of the. company under the.old organization became stockholders without purchasing any new stock, and the officers of the old organization had charge of the company and its affairs through and during all these proceedings, and were elected and continued to be such officers under the new arrangement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\">\u201cFrom all these facts taken together the master is .of opinion, and so finds, that the present company is but a re-organization of the former one, and not a new and independent corporation ; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>all this machinery was used but as a device to avoid the payment of the debts of that company, and that therefore the said company is liable for the amount of complainants\u2019 judgment and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">\u201c But even if this were otherwise, still if the securities for the indebtedness of the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company to Lewis Broad, which were attached in the hands of the said company, went into the possession of the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company by its recognised officers or agents; and if the latter company was a new creation, a new corporation created and existing separate from and independent of the former company, the latter company held the said securities in trust for the present complainants, and if the said securities were permitted to go out of their hands and out of the jurisdiction of the court so that they could not be reached by the attaching creditors, or made available for the purpose of satisfying complainants\u2019 judgment, then the said company is liable to the complainants for the amount of their judgment and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">\u201c This then brings us to the consideration of the second question raised by the allegations contained in the seventh paragraph of complainants\u2019 bill, and the denial thereof as contained in the fifth paragraph of defendants\u2019 answer; and that question is, whether the said securities ever did go into the custody, control and possession of the'Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">\u201c Upon this question the master finds record evidence of the fact that these securities did go into the custody, possession and control of the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">\u201c The answer of Thomas D. Messier to the interrogatories filed in No. 365, of April Term 1863, Stewart, Mulconnery &amp; Co. against the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company, admits the custody and possession of the notes or freight-warrants attached by complainants. This answer was sworn to by Mr. Messier on the 21st day of November 1863, and was filed in the cause and became a part of the record, and upon that answer the court rendered judgment in favor of the present complainants against the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-10\">\u201cThomas D. Messier'was, at the time of the swearing to and filing of that answer, the comptroller of the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company, and, as he proves in his testimony taken in this case, the custodian of the securities in the possession of the said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-11\">\u201cBut if the theory of the defendants in this case be the correct one, if the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company be a new and independent corporation and not a re-organization of the former company, then Mr. Messier did not hold the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>securities as an officer of the former company, for that was dissolved. He could therefore hold the securities only as an officer of the company then in existence, as he himself proves that he held them in his official character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">\u201c From the evidence in the cause as before referred to and the testimony of John P. Henderson, the treasurer of the company and one of the present defendants, the master is of opinion, and so finds, that the notes or freight-warrants which belonged to Lewis Broad, and which were attached by the present complainants in the hands of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company, did come into the control, custody and possession of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company, and that the latter company did hold them in trust for the said complainants, as under all the circumstances disclosed in this case the law would imply such a trust, although none was expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">\u201c But there is another view of this case which, in the opinion of the master, would render the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company liable to the present complainants for the amount of their judgment against the Pittsburg, Fort - Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">\u201cThe stockholders of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company were entitled to nothing from their stock, upon the sale and transfer of the road, property and franchises of the company, either as dividends or otherwise, until the general creditors of the company were paid.

Immediately after the execution of Broad\u2019s freight-warrants, they were sent, by order of the president, under the advice of their attorney in Chicago, to be deposited with the clerk of the Superior Court at Chicago, in pursuance of an order of that court. These warrants were executed early in 1861, in the form of a drafijj. drawn by the auditor, accepted by the treasurer, and payable in money due the company for the transportation of freight, and amounted to between $17,000 and $18,000. The land bonds were secured by mortgage on special real estate of the company not covered by the general mortgage; $19,000 of those bonds were sent to Chicago in the latter part of 1860, through the president; they had been previously in J.

Cass, T. D. Messier and John P. Henderson, the president, auditor and treasurer of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad! Company, and afterwards the president, comptroller and treasurer of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Rail <em>wag </em>Company, were in no \"way liable to the plaintiffs as attaching creditors. The attachment was not- served on them and no judgment was had against them as garnishees. Nor were they trustees of or for the debts attached or the securities representing these debts. So far as they were connected with these' debts, or in possession of the securities, they were acting as officers and agents of the rail <em>road </em>company and not of the <em>railway </em>company, and all they did was in their official capacity and in subordination to the railroad company. Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>position and acts were those of the railroad company, and were not individual either in their own right or their own wrong. No negligence is charged to make them individually responsible ; and if any were, the liability would be to their own principal, and not to the plaintiffs, with whom they were in no privity, and who have not charged them by attachment. The liability for the debts and securities attached was, therefore, wholly upon the rail <em>road </em>company. It is not denied that the railroad company is liable. The liability was fixed by the judgment in the attachment, and the return to the execution which followed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The liability of the other defendant, the rail <em>way </em>company, is attempted to he founded upon its alleged privity with its predecessor, the <em>railroad </em>company; and its possession of the assets of the railroad company as trustees for the stockholders of the latter. Neither position is sustained. The Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Rail <em>way </em>Company is a new, original and distinct corporation, deriving its existence and franchises under and pursuant to the Act of the 31st March 1860, Pamph. L. 498, and was by the terms of the act dependent for its existence upon the sale in law or equity of the railroad of the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company. It was upon this contingency involving the extinction of the <em>railroad </em>company that the law itself placed the incorporation of the rail <em>way </em>company. The term \u201creorganization\u201d in the title of the act, which was passed before the adoption of the constitutional amendment of 1864, cannot overcome the very facts of the case, and the language and intent of the law. Nor could the organization of the company precede the contingency of sale, made by the act the basis of the organization of the new company. Nor is the position sustained by the facts in evidence that the new company is the trustee for the stockholders of the old company of any of its assets, and consequently it is not trustee for the creditors, whose equity, in case of assets, would be superior to that of the stockholders. It is not proved as charged in the bill that the re-organization, as it is termed, was in pursuance of certain private agreements between the mortgage bondholders and the stockholders whereby the new company became possessed of assets or property belonging to the old company. On the contrary the proof is that the road, property and franchises of the old company were sold under judicial proceedings to every appearance' adversary; and the sum bid, two millions, paid to a receiver before the sale was confirmed, and the deed ordered to be made, vesting the title and franchises of the old company in the individual purchasers, through whom the new company derives its title. In this connection it is to be noticed that there is no charge of collusion or fraud alleged in the bill to subvert the judicial proceedings under which the property and franchises of the old company passed to the purchasers and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>them to the new company. The whole case of the plaintiffs, in this branch of it, is rested on the fact that the new company came into possession of the assets and property of the old company under such a voluntary arrangement with the stockholders of the old company as would leave the property liable to the creditors of the old company. This liability is expressly denied in the seventh paragraph of the answer, while in the sixth paragraph, not only is it alleged that the sale and foreclosure under the mortgages passed a free and unencumbered title to the new company, but it also alleged that the rights of the old stockholders were acquired under an arrangement <em>subsequently </em>made ; and this accords with the power conferred upon the new company by the third section of the Act of March 31st 1860. Taking all the facts and evidence found properly in the record, we discover no proof of a preliminary agreement, or such an arrangement with the stockholders of the old company, or such admissions of liability, as would charge the new company with a trust of any of the assets for the creditors of the old company. This is the difference between the present case and that cited from 7 Wallace 392: Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Howard. There not only was there a preliminary agreement to sell the property of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company to the Chicago and Rock Island Company, and to make the proceeding to foreclose the mortgage and sell the roads of the former, ancillary to the agreement; but after all this had been done, and the property vested in the latter company, the latter admitted the possession of sixteen per cent, of the fund in hand to belong to the stockholders of the former company, and the real question was whether the stockholders or the <em>creditors </em>of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company should be entitled to this surplus fund ? It was held of course that the equity of the creditors was superior to that of the stockholders. Finding no error in the decree dismissing the bill with costs, it is affirmed, and the appellants are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
