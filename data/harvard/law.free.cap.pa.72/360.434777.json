The plaintiffs entered a rule of reference, and the cause was arbitrated under the Compulsory Arbitration Law. On the 24th of August 1871, the arbitrators made an award for the defendant. On the same day the plaintiffs filed an affidavit, and entered an appeal without paying the costs or entering into recognisance, &amp;c. On the 19th of September the plaintiffs ruled the defendant to plead. November 6th the defendant pleaded. November the 13th, the defendant moved the court to quash the appeal for want of the payment of costs. On the 19th of Maroh 1872, the court (Acheson, P. J.) quashed the appeal on the ground that the plaintiffs had not entered into recognisance nor paid the costs, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-14\">The plaintiffs took out a writ of error, and assigned for error the order quashing the appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-15\">' Sice, <em>Wilson \u00a7 </em>Moore, for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amd\">cited Acts of June 16th 1836, sect. 27, 31, Pamph.

The 3'lst section of the Act of the 16th of June 1836, relating to arbitration, provided' \u201c that in all cases in which executors, administrators or other persons suing or being sued in a representative character, or minors, shall be the party appellant from an award, the appeal shall be good without the payment of costs or entering into recognisance as aforesaid, if such appellant shall not have taken out the rule of reference.\u201d The question is whether the qualification that the appellant had not taken out the rule of reference still exists in view of the subsequent legislation in regard to executors and administrators. The abolishment of imprisonment for debt, carried with it the bail known as special bail, conditioned for the surrender of the body, and led to the passage of the Act of the 20th of March 1845, Pamph. L. 188, the first section of which enacted that, \u201c In lieu of the bail heretofore required by law in the cases herein mentioned, the bail in cases of appeal from the judgments of aldermen and justices of the peace, and from the award of arbitrators, shall be bail absolute, in double the probable amount of costs accrued and likely to accrue in such cases with one or more sufficient sureties conditioned for the payment of all costs accrued, or that may be legally recovered in such cases against the appellants Brightly 57, pl. 41. The words \u201c costs accrued and likely to accrue,\u201d led to the impression that no costs were to be paid under the general Act of 1836, as a condition of obtaining an appeal. It was decided differently, however, in Merritt <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Barr 161, and the legislature, with a view to a remedy, passed the Act of the 13th of April 1846, Pamph. L. 303, validating appeals made without the payment of costs, and declaring in the second section that \u201c the first section of the act entitled \u2018 An Act concerning Bail and Attachments,\u2019 shall be sc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>construed as to require the payment by the appellant <em>to the </em>prothonotary, of all costs which have previously accrued, whenever an appeal is entered from an award of arbitrators, excepting where executors, administrators, guardians or trustees are appellants.\u201d It will be noticed that the exception as to executors, &amp;c., fails to repeat the qualification of the Act of 1836, \u00a7 31, \u201c if such appellant shall not have taken out the rule of reference.\u201d This act was followed by the 12th section of the Act of the 25th of April 1850, Pamph. L. 571, which declared that \u201cso much of the 1st section of the act passed on the 20th day of March 1845, entitled \u2018 An Act concerning Bail and Attachments,\u2019 as pertaius to appeals from the awards of arbitrators, shall from henceforth be construed to extend to all such appeals whether made by persons natural Or artificial.\u201d This section was evidently intended to embrace corporations, but the generality of its expression, natural as well as artificial, led in its turn to the passage of the Act of the 3d of May 1852, \u00a7 1, Pamph. L. 541, in order to prevent its taking effect upon persons suing or being sued in a representative capacity. It provided that \u201c the 12th section of the Act of the 25th of April 1850, relating to appeals from the awards of arbitrators, shall not be construed so as to embrace executors, administrators or other natural persons suing or being sued in a representative character. Here again the legislature omitted the before-stated qualification contained in the 31st section of the Act of the 16th of June 1836. This double failure to re-enact the qualification cannot go for nothing. We must presume that the legislature was aware that the Act of 1836 excepted from the 31st section the case of an appellant taking out the rule of reference, and consequently intended to abolish the exception. Such is the plain effect of the Acts of 1846 and 1852. These laws were intended to preserve to executors and others suing or being sued in a representative capacity, the benefit of the Act of 1836, of appealing without payment of costs and giving a recognisance, and if they intended to preserve the exception as to taking out the rule, of reference, it was move natural they should have stated it. The intention to omit the exception accords also with the views of this court in the case of the Penna. Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Hewes, 5 Binney 508, and the practice under the Arbitration Act of 1810, as to executors and administrators. The impolicy of compelling them to pay costs which may come out of their own pocket, is there strongly asserted by Tilghman, C. J. It is in consonance also with the decision in Musser <em>et al. v. </em>Good, 11 S. &amp; R. 247, that an executor is not liable for costs <em>de bonis propriis, </em>except when some fault is personally imputable to him. The liability of an executor or administrator for costs was again examined very elaborately in Callender\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>v. </em>The Keystone Ins. Co., 11 Harris 471, and his non-liability reasserted, except where he is defeated in a wanton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>or vexatious suit. The same distinction is again maintained in Pennypacker\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 114. In view of the legislation since 1836, and the current of decisions upon the non-liability of executors and administrators <em>personally </em>for costs, we are of opinion that the legislature did not intend to revive the qualification as to the party taking out the rule of reference, in the 31st section of the Act of 1836. An opposite intention would often compel the executor or administrator to pay the costs out of his own pocket, or else to sacrifice the interests of his trust by refusing to appeal. The order of the court below quashing the appeal is therefore reversed, the appeal ordered to be restored, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
