The proceedings were commenced September 3d 1869, before Joseph S. Waream, Esq., a justice of the peace of Mifflin county, upon the following information:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">\u201cBefore me, &amp;c., came Charles Stratford, of the township of Derry, in said county, yeoman, and being duly affirmed, did depose and say, that upon the third day of September, instant, he found upon his lands, situate in the township aforesaid, three shoats without rings in their noses and yokes or bows about their necks, and one shoat without a ring in its nose but having a bow about its neck, said shoats having been running at large, and the same being then and there found, did drive and carry away,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">The justice thereupon issued an order of appraisement, &amp;c., to \u201ctwo indifferent persons of the neighborhood,\u201d who on the same day returned that they had appraised the hogs at $24. On the same day Stratford paid to the justice $12, the one-half of the appraisement, and the justice issued a notice, reciting the foregoing proceedings, that one-half the value of the hogs was forfeited to the owner of the land where they were found, and that the remainder, after deducting costs, was in his hands ready to be paid to the owner of the hogs, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-10\">At the instance of Shaw, the owner of the hogs, a certiorari was issued to the justice from the Court of Common Pleas of Mifflin county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-11\">The court (Woods, P.

It was there held that the act, under which these proceedings were instituted, applies only where the swine are voluntarily suffered to go at large, not where they escape from the owner without his default; and if the proceedings do not show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>this they will he </em>quashed. <em>It </em>does not appear from the record in this case that the swine were suffered to run at large by the owner. The phrase \u201chaving been running at large,\u201d cannot be regarded as tantamount to an averment that they were \u201csuffered to run at large.\u201d They may have been running at large when found by the seizer, without any default of the owner; and if so, they were not subject to forfeiture. If they were not suffered to run at large, the magistrate had no jurisdiction of the ease, and for want of this essential averment the court below should have quashed the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Judgment reversed and proceedings quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
