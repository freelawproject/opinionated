STEIN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b251-26\">Plaintiffs, shareholders of Citigroup, Inc., allege in this consolidated derivative action that defendants \u2014 current and former Citigroup officers and directors \u2014 are liable for wrongdoing in connection with the company\u2019s issuance of, and investments in, mortgage-backed assets. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Court dismissed the prior complaint in this matter on the ground that it failed to demonstrate that plaintiffs were excused from their obligation to make a demand on Citigroup\u2019s board of directors prior to bringing this suit. Plaintiffs have submitted an amended complaint that defendants maintain suffers from the same defect. Defendants have now moved pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 23.1 to dismiss the complaint on that basis. Because plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not give rise to a reasonable doubt that a majority of the Citigroup board \u2014 as it existed in September 2009 when the amended complaint was filed \u2014 would not objectively assess a demand, the Court grants defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">A. <em>The Consolidated Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYh\">Citigroup announced on November 4, 2007 an $8 to $11 billion write-down on mortgage-backed assets. (First Am. Consolidated Derivative Action Compl. (\u201cAm. Compl.\u201d) \u00b6 139.) That prompted a flurry of litigation, including this consolidated shareholder derivative action brought on behalf of Citigroup. Plaintiffs\u2019 initial consolidated complaint alleged that various Citigroup officers and directors harmed the company by breaching their fiduciary duties of care and loyalty by allowing Citigroup to invest in risky mortgage-backed assets; breaching their fiduciary duty of disclosure by concealing Citigroup\u2019s exposure to these assets; wasting corporate assets on the repurchase of Citigroup stock at inflated prices in 2007; committing securities fraud via misleading statements regarding Citigroup\u2019s mortgage-backed assets; engaging in insider trading; and unjustly enriching themselves. (Verified Consolidated Derivative Action Compl. (\u201cCons. Compl.\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 129-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">It is uncontested that plaintiffs did not demand of Citigroup\u2019s board of directors that Citigroup itself pursue these claims against defendants before plaintiffs filed this action. As a result, plaintiffs are required to show that \u201cdemand [upon the board of directors] is excused because the directors [were] incapable of making an impartial decision regarding whether to institute such litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorp. v. Ritter, </em>911 A.2d 362, 367 (Del.2006). This Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint because plaintiffs failed to plead particularized facts demonstrating that the board \u201cas it existed in November 2007 was incapable ... of objectively evaluating a demand.\u201d <em>In re Citigroup Inc. S\u2019holder Derivative Litig. (Citigroup Derivative), </em>No. 07 Civ. 9841, 2009 WL 2610746, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2009) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). In that opinion \u2014 the reader\u2019s knowledge of which is presumed \u2014 the Court permitted plaintiffs to seek leave to file an amended complaint. <em>Id. </em>at *13.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">B. <em>The Amended Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Three weeks after the Court\u2019s opinion was issued, plaintiffs moved for leave to file an amended complaint and submitted a proposed First Amended Consolidated Derivative Action Complaint (\u201cAmended Complaint\u201d). The Court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The Amended Complaint repeats essentially the whole of its predecessor pleading, with two main additions. Drawing heavily from the complaint filed in <em>In re Citigroup Bondholders Litigation, </em>No. 08 Civ. 9522\u2014a document specifically incorporated by reference into the Amended Complaint, (Am. Compl. \u00b6 265)\u2014plaintiffs now allege that defendants were responsible for misleading statements and omissions in certain Citigroup registration statements. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 1, <em>see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 78-92, 108-35, 141-72.) These allegations form the basis of claims arising under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 300-08.) Plaintiffs also claim that the board of directors wasted corporate assets in the retirement package the board gave Charles Prince, Citigroup\u2019s departing CEO, on November 4, 2007. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 223-28, 294-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In resolving a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court considers the complaint as well as \u201cany written instrument attached to the complaint, statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, legally required public disclosure documents filed with the SEC, and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir.2007). A court accepts the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Id. </em>But that acceptance need not extend to allegations \u201ccontradicted by documents deemed to be part of the complaint, or materials amenable to judicial notice.\u201d <em>In re Yukos Oil Co. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 04 Civ. 5243, 2006 WL 3026024, at * 12 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2006); <em>see Hirsch v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>72 F.3d 1085, 1095 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">A. <em>Plaintiffs must plead demand futility as to the September 2009 Citigroup board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Demand futility is assessed with the respect to the board of directors extant \u201cas of the time the complaint was filed.\u201d <em>Braddock v. Zimmerman, </em>906 A.2d 776, 785 (Del.2006). For the initial consolidated complaint, that meant evaluating demand as against the November 2007 Citigroup board. <em>Citigroup Derivative, </em>2009 WL 2610746 at *4 &amp; n. 7. But where, as here, \u201ca complaint is amended with permission following a dismissal without prejudice ... the [ ] demand inquiry must be assessed by reference to the board in place <em>at the time when the amended complaint is filed.\u201d Braddock, </em>906 A.2d at 786 (emphasis added). The Court therefore evaluates whether a demand on the board would be futile with respect to the Citigroup board of directors as it existed in September 2009, when plaintiffs submitted the Amended Complaint as part of their motion for leave to amend the initial consolidated complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Plaintiffs agree that the subject of the demand inquiry is the September 2009 board. (Pis.\u2019 Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss (\u201cPis.\u2019 Opp.\u201d) at 10.) Yet plaintiffs do not correctly identify the members of that board, an easily verifiable fact. Defendants repeatedly point this out. <em>(See </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 4 n. 7; Exs. 2, 3 to Decl. of Richard Rosen (\u201cRosen Decl.\u201d) dated Nov. 22, 2010; Defs.\u2019 Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 2-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Citigroup\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>changes in board membership between November 2007 and September 2009. By September 2009, the board had seventeen directors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nine of them had joined since November 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And five who were directors in November 2007 \u2014 George David, Kenneth T. Derr, Roberto Hernandez Ramirez, Robert E. Rubin and Franklin A. Thomas \u2014 had left the board by September 2009.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court takes judicial notice of the specifics of this evolution in the membership of Citigroup\u2019s board as set forth in Citigroup\u2019s SEC filings. <em>See, e.g., Sears v. Magnolia Plumbing, Inc., </em>778 F.Supp.2d 80, 84 &amp; n. 6, No. 10 Civ. 02313, 2011 WL 1518631, at *2 &amp; n. 6 (D.D.C. Apr. 21, 2011) (relying on regulatory filings to take judicial notice of composition of board of directors); <em>In re Computer Sciences Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>244 F.R.D. 580, 587 n. 8 (C.D.Cal.2007) (same); <em>see also Fink v. Weill, </em>No. 02 Civ. 10250, 2005 WL 2298224, at *5 n. 9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 2005) (\u201cBecause the composition of Citigroup\u2019s board of directors is public information not subject to reasonable dispute, the Court takes judicial notice of the individuals elected to the 2003 board of directors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Plaintiffs do not directly respond to defendants\u2019 repeated emphasis on both the board turnover that occurred between November 2007 and September 2009 and the actual composition of the September 2009 board. They only shift their position on the size and membership of the board. The Amended Complaint submitted in September 2009 specifically names fourteen individuals as the members of the \u201ccurrent Board of Citigroup.\u201d (Am. Compl. \u00b6 233). In their memorandum opposing dismissal, plaintiffs do not claim that the Amended Complaint correctly identifies the September 2009 board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>stead, they assert (incorrectly and without any citation) that the Citigroup board contained thirteen members, five of whom are not even named. (Pis.\u2019 Opp. at 10.) The Court does not credit plaintiffs\u2019 inconsistent and incorrect assertions. <em>See Hirsch, </em>72 F.3d at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">As set forth above, to avoid dismissal of the Amended Complaint, plaintiffs must show that it would have been futile to have made a demand of the seventeen member board of directors that existed in September 2009, when plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint and submitted the Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">B. <em>Plaintiffs have not adequately pled demand futility as to the September 2009 Citigroup board</em></p>\n<p id=\"Akv\">In this case the governing standard for demand futility is that set forth by the Supreme Court of Delaware in <em>Rales v. Blasband, </em>which requires plaintiffs to plead \u201cparticularized factual allegations\u201d that \u201ccreate a reasonable doubt that ... the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.\u201d 634 A.2d 927, 934 (Del.1993). <em>Rales </em>applies, inter alia, \u201c(1) where a business decision was made by the board of a company, but a majority of the directors making the decision have been replaced; [or] (2) where the subject of the derivative suit is not a business decision of the board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Most of plaintiffs\u2019 claims fall into the second category; the fiduciary duty, securities law, unjust enrichment and insider trading counts do not concern specific business decisions of the Citigroup board. <em>See Citigroup Derivative, </em>2009 WL 2610746 at *4, *12. The remaining corporate waste claims fall into the first <em>Rales </em>category. Though they concern specific board actions, namely the approval of the repurchase of Citigroup stock in January and April 2007, (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 219-21), and the retirement package granted departing CEO Prince on November 4, 2007, <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 223), the September 2009 Citigroup had a nine member majority that had joined the board since those approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">To satisfy the <em>Rales </em>test, the complaint must contain particularized allegations that \u201cgive rise to a reasonable doubt that <em>a majority of the board </em>can exercise \u2018its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conrad v. Blank, </em>940 A.2d 28, 37 (Del.Ch. 2007) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 933); <em>see In re infoUSA, Inc. S\u2019holders Litig., </em>953 A.2d 963, 989-90 (Del. Ch.2007) (\u201cPlaintiffs must show that a majority ... of the board was incapable of considering demand.\u201d). Plaintiffs argue that demand is futile because eight members of the September 2009 board face a substantial likelihood of liability for alleged misstatements contained in certain registration statements. Were the point valid \u2014 and the Court expresses no opinion on that issue \u2014 it cannot overcome a simple, irrefutable arithmetic fact: the eight directors who plaintiffs claim are not impartial do not constitute a majority of the seventeen-person board. The Amended Complaint does not even identify the nine members of the September 2009 board that joined it after November 2007, let alone contain particularized factual allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tions concerning their capacity to assess objectively a pre-suit demand. Plaintiffs, therefore, have not met their burden of alleging with particularity that a reasonable doubt exists that the majority of the September 2009 board could not have exercised independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand. The Amended Complaint must be dismissed on that basis. <em>See In re Citigroup Inc. S\u2019holder Derivative Litig., </em>964 A.2d 106, 121 n. 36 (Del.Ch.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered that defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the First Amended Consolidated Derivative Action complaint is granted and the amended complaint is dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\">. Because Citigroup is a Delaware corporation, that state\u2019s law controls this issue. <em>In re Citigroup Inc.

Fund Asset Mgmt., L.P. </em>380 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe substantive law which determines whether demand is, in fact, futile is provided by the state of incorporation of the entity on whose behalf the plaintiff is seeking relief.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"><em>. </em>They also form the basis of claims arising under Section 12 of the Securities Act, (Am.
