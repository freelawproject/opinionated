We hold that the federal law preempts a claim against an employer for intentional tort based upon substantial certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Joseph Talik worked as a longshoreman for appellant Federal Marine Terminal, Inc., at the port of Cleveland. On September 10, 2004, when Talik and a coworker were assigned to load pipe from Dock 26 onto trucks, Talik was injured by a collapsing stack of pipes that fell on his right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">{\u00b6 3} As a longshoreman, a maritime worker who worked on land adjoining navigable waters, Talik was covered by the LHWCA. As a worker in the \u201ctwilight zone,\u201d he had the option of obtaining benefits under the LHWCA or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>state workers\u2019 compensation act because his employer was required to pay into the state system, R.C. 4123.35, and to secure insurance pursuant to the LHWCA. Section 932(a), Title 33, U.S.Code. Talik received his benefits from the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">{\u00b6 4} Talik also filed a common-law cause of action in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, alleging that his employer had committed a \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d intentional tort. Federal Marine filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Section 905(a), Title 33, U.S.Code preempted this claim. Federal Marine also relied on federal common law to argue that if its immunity was not complete, a showing of Federal Marine\u2019s deliberate, specific intent to injure Talik was required before it could be held liable. The trial court granted summary judgment to Federal Marine, and Talik appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 5} On appeal, the Eighth District Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that because the LHWCA is a typical workers\u2019 compensation program and because an injured employee in Ohio is not precluded from maintaining both a workers\u2019 compensation claim and an intentional-tort claim, Talik\u2019s intentional-tort claim was not preempted by the federal statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Talik v. Fed. Marine Terminals, </em>8th Dist. No. 87073, 172 Ohio App.3d 704, 2006-Ohio-3979, 876 N.E.2d 1246, \u00b6 16. The court of appeals also determined that Ohio law governs because Talik did not sue Federal Marine under the LHWCA. Id. at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 6} We accepted this discretionary appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine whether the LHWCA, by providing employer immunity from certain claims, preempts an employee\u2019s state common-law claim for an intentional tort based on substantial certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 7} Our discussion will first examine the federal statute and then Ohio\u2019s intentional tort law before determining the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">II. The Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 8} The Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Section 901 et seq., Title 33, U.S.Code, entitles certain workers such as longshoremen injured in the course of their employment to compensation from their employer, regardless of whether the employer\u2019s negligence caused the injuries. Thus, the LHWCA is a typical workers\u2019 compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The LHWCA was enacted by Congress in 1927 in response to decisions by the United States Supreme Court limiting the authority of the states to apply their workers\u2019 compensation laws to injured maritime employees. <em>Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, U.S. Dept. of Labor </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 624, 640, 103 S.Ct. 2045, 76 L.Ed.2d 194 (Marshall, J., dissenting). The act originally provided compensation for injuries \u201coccurring upon the navigable waters of the United States * * * if recovery * * * through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\u201d Former Section 903, Title 33, U.S.Code, 44 Stat. 1426.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 10} Although it was clear that maritime workers who sustained injuries \u201cupon the navigable waters\u201d were within the LHWCA\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, the same could not be said for maritime workers who were injured while working on land. Questions began to arise over jurisdiction and the exact point at which state remedies gave way to federal remedies. <em>Davis v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Industries of Washington </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 249, 253-254, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246. To protect longshoremen from the consequences of filing in the wrong jurisdiction, the United States Supreme Court held that those workers in the \u201ctwilight zone,\u201d i.e., \u201cthat shadowy area within which, at some undefined and undefinable point, state laws can validly provide compensation,\u201d may file in either the federal court under the LHWCA or in the state court under the state workers\u2019 compensation laws. Id. at 252 and 258, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 11} Thirty years later, Congress amended the LHWCA to extend its coverage inland. The term \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d was broadened to include \u201cany adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel.\u201d Section 903(a), Title 33, U.S.Code. Employers also agreed to more than double the maximum weekly benefits for permanent total disability in exchange for the elimination of seaworthiness warranty claims. See 9A Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (2007), Section 145.02[8][c],</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 12} In analyzing these 1972 amendments, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the LHWCA remained concurrent with state workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 715, 719-720, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458. Accordingly, a longshoreman such as Talik, injured while working on land in a location that falls within the expanded 1972 definition of \u201cnavigable waters\u201d is inside the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d and may apply for benefits under a state workers\u2019 compensation scheme, the LHWCA, or both. However, \u201cany amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed under [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>law * * * shall be credited against any liability imposed by this chapter.\u201d Section 903(e), Title 33, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, although Talik applied for and has already received benefits from Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation fund, he now seeks to recover common-law damages against Federal Marine for an intentional tort under Ohio law. A firm understanding of what constitutes an employer intentional tort is necessary to determine whether the LHWCA preempts such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">III. Ohio Claims Against Employers for Intentional Tort</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Payne v. Vance </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 59, 133 N.E. 85, this court held that an intentional or willful tort involved the element of intent or purpose. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. In so doing, the court distinguished an intentional tort, which requires a specific mental state, from negligence, whether slight, ordinary, or gross. Id. \u201cWanton misconduct is such conduct as manifests a disposition to perversity, and it must be under such surrounding circumstances and existing conditions that the party doing the act or failing to act must be conscious, from his knowledge of such surrounding circumstances and existing conditions, that his conduct will in all common probability result in injury.\u201d <em>Universal Concrete Pipe Co. v. Bassett </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 567, 5 O.O. 214, 200 N.E. 843, paragraph two of the syllabus. By contrast, an intentional or willful tort involves an intent to injure. <em>Reserve Trucking Co. v. Fairchild </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 519, 191 N.E. 745, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 15} Not until almost 50 years later were claims for intentional torts against employers recognized as an exception to Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. The <em>Blankenship </em>court reasoned that an employee\u2019s injury neither arises out of nor is received in the course of employment within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act if it is sustained as a result of an employer\u2019s intentional conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. at 613, 23 O.O.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>504, 433 N.E.2d 572. The definition of \u201cintentional tort\u201d was expanded in <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046, to mean \u201can act committed with the intent to injure another, or committed with the belief that such injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. An employee was allowed to pursue a common-law claim for an intentional tort against an employer even though the employee had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the same injury. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 16} The standard of \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d in the intentional-tort arena caused confusion. See <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 109, 522 N.E.2d 489; <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 116-117, 570 N.E.2d 1108 <em>(Jones </em>\u201ccreated a confusing status of the law\u201d and engendered \u201ccontradicting interpretations\u201d of the intentional-tort standard). A three-part test was established for determining an employer\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d in an action by an employee asserting an intentional tort. The employee must demonstrate \u201c(1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition within its business operation; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.\u201d <em>Fyffe, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 17} The General Assembly modified the common-law definition of an employer intentional tort by enacting R.C. 2745.01, effective April 7, 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute provides that in an action for intentional tort, an employee must prove that \u201cthe employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.\u201d A belief that injury is substantially certain to occur exists when the employer \u201cacts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u201d R.C. 2745.01(B). The new statute, therefore, rejects the notion that acting with a belief that injury is substantially certain to occur is analogous to wanton misconduct as defined in <em>Universal Concrete, </em>130 Ohio St. 567, 5 O.O. 214, 200 N.E. 843, paragraph two of the syllabus. Because the accident in this case predated enactment of R.C. 2745.01, however, the <em>Fyffe </em>standard still applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Federal Marine contends that regardless of Ohio\u2019s recognition of a claim for employer intentional tort as an exception to Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, the LHWCA, as a federal law, preempts the state\u2019s intentional-tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">IV. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 19} The federal law issue before this court is whether Ohio\u2019s common-law tort based on substantial certainty is expressly preempted by the exclusivity provision of the LHWCA, conflicts with the LHWCA scheme of compensation, or stands as an obstacle to the purposes of the LHWCA to provide uniform compensation to longshore workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">A. Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 20} We most recently considered the issue of federal preemption in a Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act case. <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919. There we acknowledged, \u201cThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that \u2018the Laws of the United States * * * shall be the supreme Law of the Land; * * * any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u2019 Clause 2, Article VI, United States Constitution. The clause grants Congress the power to preempt state laws. See <em>Jenkins v. James B. Day &amp; Co. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 541, 544, 634 N.E.2d 998, citing <em>In re Miamisburg Train Derailment Litigation </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 255, 259, 626 N.E.2d 85.\u201d <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co., </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 21} Preemption can occur in any one of three ways: by express preemption, by preemption of the field, and by preemption due to conflict. Id. at \u00b6 7. Express preemption occurs when Congress declares outright that an enactment preempts state law. <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 85, 95-98, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490. When Congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language, the court\u2019s task is an easy one, for preemption fundamentally is a question of congressional intent. <em>English v. Gen. Elec. Co. </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 72, 78-79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 22} In the absence of explicit statutory language, Congress preempts the field to the exclusion of state law when it enacts a \u201c \u2018scheme of federal regulation * * * so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,\u2019 or where an Act of Congress \u2018touch[es] a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\u2019 \u201d (Ellipsis and brackets sic.) <em>English, </em>496 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65, quoting <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947), 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447. The United States Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201c \u2018[w]here * * * the field which Congress is said to have pre-empted\u2019 includes areas that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>have \u2018been traditionally occupied by the States,\u2019 congressional intent to supersede state laws must be \u2018 \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ellipsis sic.) <em>English, </em>496 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65, quoting <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604, quoting <em>Rice, </em>331 U.S. at 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, preemption of state law occurs when the state law actually conflicts with federal law. Preemption due to conflict exists when compliance with both state and federal requirements is impossible, see, e. g., <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 132, 142-143, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248, or where state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Hines v. Davidowitz </em>(1941), 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581. See <em>English, </em>496 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65. The United States Supreme Court has expressed a reluctance to infer preemption in ambiguous cases \u201cin light of the presumption against the pre-emption of state police power regulations.\u201d <em>Cipol-lone v. Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 504, 518, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 24} Federal Marine argues that Talik\u2019s claim is expressly preempted or, in the alternative, is preempted as impeding Congress\u2019s goals within the LHWCA. We will now examine whether either of those two methods of preemption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">B. Express Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 25} Federal Marine contends that the LHWCA expressly preempts Talik\u2019s common-law claim. \u201cIf the statute contains an express pre-emption clause, the task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\u2019 pre-emptive intent.\u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 658, 664, 113 S.Ct. 1732, 123 L.Ed.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 26} The exclusivity clause within the LHWCA that Federal Marine relies upon, Section 905(a), Title 33, U.S.Code, provides: \u201cThe liability of an employer prescribed in [Section 904, Title 33, U.S.Code] shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee * * * entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee * * * may elect to claim compensation under the chapter, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">{\u00b6 27} In other words, for \u201csuch injury\u201d suffered by longshoremen, employer liability is limited to the damages recoverable under the LHWCA. Talik argues that because the LHWCA fails to include an injury caused by employer intentional conduct within the ambit of \u201csuch injury\u201d in Section 905(a), there can be no finding of express preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The LHWCA defines \u201cinjury\u201d in Section 902(2), Title 33, U.S.Code as \u201caccidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment, and such occupational disease or infection as arises naturally out of such employment or as naturally or unavoidably results from such accidental injury, and includes an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment.\u201d Although the federal statute covers an intentional tort by third parties against an employee, the definition does not include an intentional tort by an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">{\u00b6 29} Thus, courts have held that because Congress did not explicitly include an employer intentional tort in the exclusive-remedy provision of Section 905(a), an employee may pursue an intentional-tort action against the employer. See <em>Taylor v. Transocean Terminal Operators, Inc. </em>(La.App.2001), 785 So.2d 860; <em>Austin v. Johns-Manville Sales Co. </em>(D.Me.1981), 508 F.Supp. 313, 316. We therefore cannot say that Congress has expressly preempted the intentional tort standard that Ohio uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">C. Conflict Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 30} The Eighth Appellate District determined that because a claim for intentional tort is not specifically mentioned as a possible claim within the LHWCA, the claim is not preempted by the LHWCA; however, the court\u2019s approach is incomplete. Although Talik\u2019s claim for a substantial-certainty intentional tort is not expressly preempted by the LHWCA, it may still be preempted if it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. State legislation is declared to be invalid only when it \u201cworks material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.\u201d <em>S. Pacific Co. v. Jensen </em>(1917), 244 U.S. 205, 216, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 31} Talik urges that we should look only to Ohio law to determine whether a substantial-certainty tort is excluded from the scope of the LHWCA. However, in determining the scope of the federal statute, we must apply federal law. See <em>Gravatt v. New York City </em>(C.A.2, 2000), 226 F.3d 108, 118 (\u201cthe 905(b) action [under the LHWCA] was to be developed as a matter of uniform federal maritime law, not by incorporating the tort law of the particular state in which the action arose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 32} Ohio is one of only eight states<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that have judicially adopted a \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d standard for employer intentional torts. 6 Larson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, supra, at 103-10, Section 103.04[1]. Most courts that have found an intentional-tort exception to the LHWCA\u2019s exclusivity provision, however, limit that exception to \u201cspecific intent\u201d employer intentional torts. See <em>Houston v. Bechtel Assoc. Professional Corp., D.C. </em>(D.D.C.1981), 522 F.Supp. 1094, 1096 (\u201cNothing short of a specific intent to injure the employee falls outside the scope of \u00a7 905(a). Absent such specific intent, the employee is foreclosed from maintaining a tort action against his employer\u201d); <em>Roy v. Bethlehem Steel Corp. </em>(E.D.Tex.1993), 838 F.Supp. 312, 316 (evidence that the conditions of the shipyards were so dangerous that the employer must have been \u201csubstantially certain\u201d that injuries or fatalities would occur was not sufficient to establish a specific intent by the employer to injure the employee); <em>Austin, </em>508 F.Supp. at 316, quoting 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1976) 13-5, Section 68.13 (\u201cthe overwhelming weight of authority is that \u2018the common-law liability of the employer cannot be stretched to include accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, breach of statute, or other misconduct of the employer short of genuine intentional injury\u2019 \u201d). Thus it appears that an \u201caccidental injury,\u201d as defined by Section 902(2), Title 33, U.S.Code and covered by the LWHCA, includes an injury sustained as a result of the employer\u2019s negligence, gross negligence, recklessness, or wanton conduct. Only a specific, deliberate intent by the employer to injure an employee falls outside the provisions of the LWHCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 33} The United States Supreme Court has warned that the LHWCA is \u201cnot a simple remedial statute intended for the benefit of the workers. Rather, it was designed to strike a balance between the concerns of the longshoremen and harbor workers on the one hand, and their employers on the other. Employers relinquished their defenses to tort actions in exchange for limited and predictable liability. Employees accept the limited recovery because they receive prompt relief without the expense, uncertainty, and delay that tort actions entail.\u201d <em>Morrison-Knudsen, </em>461 U.S. at 635-636, 103 S.Ct. 2045, 76 L.Ed.2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 34} Compensation benefits secured by the employer constitute the exclusive employee remedy \u201cin place of all other liability\u201d of the employer \u201cat law or in admiralty.\u201d Section 905(a), Title 33, U.S.Code. The legislative history of the 1972 amendments also reveals that \u201cCongress intended that compensation, not tort damages, [was] to be the primary source of relief for workplace injuries for longshoremen against their employers.\u201d <em>Peter v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. </em>(C.A.3, 1990), 903 F.2d 935, 952. We would upset the balance achieved by the LHWCA if we stretched the language of the federal statute to permit an exception from its exclusive coverage for \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 35} Furthermore, applying Ohio\u2019s standard for employer intentional torts would be inconsistent with the central purpose underlying the LHWCA to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201c \u2018a uniform compensation system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, U.S. Dept. of Labor v. Perini N. River Assoc. </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 297, 318, 103 S.Ct. 634, 74 L.Ed.2d 465, fn. 26, quoting 1972 Senate Report No. 92-1125 at 13. See also <em>Hill v. Knapp </em>(2007), 396 Md. 700, 716-717, 914 A.2d 1193. We would create an inequitable situation if we permitted land-based maritime workers to maintain claims for \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d intentional torts while the same maritime workers injured in another jurisdiction or upon the navigable waters would be limited to \u201cspecific intent\u201d claims for intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, we hold that the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Section 901 et seq., Title 33, U.S.Code, preempts a claim under Ohio law alleging that the claimant\u2019s employer caused an injury through an intentional act committed with the belief that injury was \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 37} Because a claim for \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d intentional tort acts as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress in enacting the LHWCA, such a claim is preempted by Section 905(a), Title 33, U.S.Code.

The current version of R.C. 4123.74, which is substantially similar to the version in effect at the time that <em>Blankenship </em>was decided, provides: \u201cEmployers who comply with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for any injury, or occupational disease, or bodily condition, received or contracted by any employee in the course of or arising out of his employment, or for any death resulting from such injury, occupational disease, or bodily condition occurring during the period covered by such premium so paid into the state insurance fund, or during the interval the employer is a self-insuring employer, whether or not such injury, occupational disease, bodily condition, or death is compensable under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">.

The majority opinion concludes that intentional-tort claims may be brought against an employer because the LHWCA does not preempt all intentional torts. I concur with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">{\u00b6 39} The majority opinion further concludes that because Ohio applies a \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d standard to intentional torts against an employer, and not one of specific, deliberate intent, injured longshoremen may not pursue an intentional-tort claim in Ohio against their employers. The majority reaches this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>conclusion because applying a different standard in Ohio than in other states \u201cwould be inconsistent with the central purpose underlying the LHWCA to create \u2018 \u201ca uniform compensation system.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 35, quoting <em>Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp.

But this central purpose is already undermined by the federal law itself, because as the majority opinion states, certain injured workers \u201cmay apply for benefits under a state workers\u2019 compensation scheme, the LHWCA, or both.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ag2z\">McDonald Hopkins, L.L.C., Jerome W.

Accordingly, it will not offend the LHWCA if a substantial-certainty intentional-tort standard, which according to the majority opinion, at \u00b6 32, has been adopted by at least seven other states, is used in Ohio to determine whether an employer committed an intentional tort. I would hold that the LHWCA does not preempt a claim for an employer intentional tort in Ohio.</p>\n<judges id=\"b602-6\">Vukovich, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
