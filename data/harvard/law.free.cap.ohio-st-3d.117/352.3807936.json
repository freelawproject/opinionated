That contract contained an arbitration provision. Unsatisfied with Taylor\u2019s work, the Benfields refused to make further payments to Taylor under the contract and demanded a refund of the money they had already paid. Taylor responded by suing the Benfields to enforce its liens on the property and moving to stay the case pending arbitration. The dispute here concerns the enforceability of the arbitration provision and, particularly, the standard of review for a motion to stay judicial proceedings pending arbitration when the underlying issue is whether that provision is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>{\u00b6 2} We hold that the proper standard of review of a determination whether an arbitration agreement is enforceable in light of a claim of unconseionability is de novo, but any factual findings of the trial court must be accorded appropriate deference. Because we conclude on de novo review that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable under Ohio law, we reverse in part the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 3} The Benfields contracted with Taylor, a Kentucky corporation, to build a house on the Benfields\u2019 property in Clermont County, Ohio. The contract included handwritten specifications for the particular features of the home to be constructed for the Benfields and contained an arbitration agreement. In March 2003, Taylor began construction and completed the foundation, framing, roof, and brick exterior of the house. Taylor alleges that in July 2003, the Benfields refused to make further payments on the house and issued a stop-work order, prohibiting Taylor from completing the house. The Benfields allege that the Clermont County building inspector discovered numerous building-code violations and ordered all work to cease until code violations were corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 4} Taylor then filed this case in the Clermont County common pleas court seeking damages for breach of contract, recovery for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit, and foreclosure of Taylor\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on the property. The Benfields answered, denying that they were in breach of the contract, and asserted counterclaims for rescission and damages for violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.01 et seq., breach of contract, negligent construction, and fraud. The Benfields also alleged that the contract was unconscionable and unenforceable. (Taylor did not file a pleading in response to the counterclaim.) When Taylor filed the complaint, Taylor also filed a motion under R.C. 2711.02(B) to stay the litigation in favor of mediation and arbitration pursuant to the parties\u2019 contract. The Benfields opposed the motion, contending that the mediation and arbitration clauses in the agreement were unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 5} The mediation and arbitration clauses in the contract provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c15. (a) <em>Mediation </em>\u2014 That in the event of any dispute between First Party [Taylor] and Second Party [the Benfields] as to the quality of construction, quality of materials, contract disputes or similar disputes as to the construction, the parties shall endeavor to settle the dispute in an amicable manner by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its construction industry mediation rules. Notices of the demand for mediation shall be filed with a copy of this Construction Agreement with the American Arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Association and to the other party to this agreement. The site for the mediation shall be Louisville, Kentucky (Jefferson County).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(b) <em>Arbitration </em>\u2014 In the event the issues cannot be resolved by mediation, then any claims or disputes arising out of this Construction Agreement or the alleged breach thereunder shall be settled by mandatory and binding arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association unless both parties mutually agree otherwise. (This position shall not affect First Party\u2019s right to secure a mechanic\u2019s lien and to pursue those remedies described in Section 6 and 9 [of this Agreement].) Notices of the demand for arbitration shall be filed with a copy of this Construction Agreement with the American Arbitration Association and the other party to this Agreement. The site for the arbitration proceeding shall be Louisville, Kentucky (Jefferson County).\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 8} The Benfields initialed this provision of the contract. The agreement also contained a broad severability clause, which provided, \u201cThe invalidity or unenforceability of any terms or provisions herein, or any clause or portion thereof, of this Agreement, shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court held a hearing on Taylor\u2019s motion to stay and granted that motion in part. The trial court concluded that the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act does not preclude arbitration clauses in consumer sales contracts. The trial court also rejected the Benfields\u2019 argument that Taylor waived arbitration by seeking to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien. The Benfields did not appeal those rulings to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">(\u00b6 10} The trial court rejected the Benfields\u2019 argument that the contract was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. Regarding the Benfields\u2019 challenges to particular contract provisions, the court first found that \u201cthe loss of the right to a jury trial is an obvious consequence\u201d of an arbitration agreement and therefore did not render the provision unconscionable. Additionally, the trial court rejected the argument that paragraph seven of the contract, which would require the Benfields to pay Taylor\u2019s reasonable legal costs to enforce its rights under the contract, is unconscionable. The trial court concluded that the parties need not have the same obligations for there to be consideration for a contract. Additionally, the trial court noted that the contract does not limit the causes of action that would otherwise be available to the Benfields. The trial court further opined that only if the Benfields took possession of the real estate without paying Taylor for the home would the Benfields have to pay Taylor\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The trial court held that the provision in the arbitration agreement requiring the arbitration to be held in Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky was unenforceable because it was in violation of R.C. 4113.62. Because the trial court found that the arbitration agreement as a whole was reasonable, the court limited the application of the venue provision. Thus, the trial court required the mediation and any arbitration to be held in Clermont County, Ohio, where the improvement to real estate at issue is located, in accordance with R.C. 4113.62(D)(2). Taylor did not cross-appeal this ruling to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court found that the remaining provisions of the arbitration agreement were not one-sided and that \u201cthere is no evidence of a substantial fee required as a condition precedent to arbitration.\u201d Similarly, the trial court found \u201cno evidence that the arbitration costs and fees are prohibitive, unreasonable, and unfair as applied to the [Benfields].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 13} Rejecting the Benfields\u2019 claim of procedural unconscionability, the trial court found that Taylor did not present this contract to the Benfields on a take-it- or-leave-it basis. The court noted that there are \u201ca multitude of homebuilders in the local area,\u201d so the Benfields did not have to enter into this contract with Taylor to build their house. The trial court found that the provisions of the contract were in standard, not fine, print, and there was no evidence that the Benfields had been rushed through the signing process. The trial court found that the record did not show that the Benfields were unaware of the effect of the arbitration clause and in fact showed that they had assented to it by initialing it. The trial court found that Taylor\u2019s salesperson\u2019s statement to the effect that there would be no need for arbitration because Taylor builds quality homes to be a statement of opinion that did not constitute a misrepresentation of fact. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that this was not a contract of adhesion and that the arbitration agreement was not procedurally unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 14} On appeal, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate court concluded that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and unenforceable. <em>Taylor Bldg. Corp. of Am. v. Benfield, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 13. The court of appeals determined that the issue whether a contract provision is unconscionable is a question of law, reviewable de novo. Id. at \u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">{\u00b6 15} On de novo review, the appellate court concluded that the arbitration provision was unconscionable. Id. at \u00b6 23. The appellate court held the arbitration clause procedurally unconscionable even though the Benfields could have had their house built by other homebuilders in the area. Id. at \u00b6 26-27. The court opined that the Taylor salesman\u2019s representation that the arbitration clause was not important because Taylor had never had any disputes over their product\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>quality, his statement that the company would not enter into a contract without the arbitration clause, and the fact that Taylor had prepared the preprinted form contract made the clause procedurally unconscionable. Id. at \u00b6 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 16} The appellate court also concluded that the contract as a whole was substantively unconscionable based on a number of provisions that the court found unfair. Id. at \u00b6 29. In addition to the arbitration clause, the provisions that the appellate court viewed as unconscionable included (1) the statement that the Benfields had no right of possession of the real estate and improvements until full and final payment had been made to Taylor, (2) a $950 liquidated-damage provision (with $60 each day of continued violation), (3) the requirement that the Benfields pay Taylor\u2019s legal costs, including attorney fees, for enforcement of Taylor\u2019s rights, (4) Taylor\u2019s entitlement to enforce its liens on the property as an additional remedy, and (5) the provision prohibiting the Benfields from interrupting construction. See id., \u00b6 30-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 17} The court found these clauses \u201cheavily skewed in favor of [Taylor].\u201d Id. at \u00b6 38. For example, the appellate court noted that the clauses barring the Benfields from halting construction and possessing their property prevented them from mitigating their damages in the event of a breach and stopped them from trying to correct building-code violations. Id. at \u00b6 38. The appellate court also was troubled by the clause requiring the Benfields to pay Taylor\u2019s attorney fees and other legal costs, as the court of appeals concluded that Taylor was not similarly burdened. Id. at \u00b6 39. Additionally, the appellate court noted that the agreement did not disclose the costs of arbitration or mediation, which the court concluded were likely to be significant. Id. at \u00b6 41. The court also held that the provisions of the contract requiring litigation or arbitration to be held in Kentucky are void under R.C. 4113.62(D). Id. at \u00b6 43-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 18} In addition to holding that all of those clauses caused the agreement to be substantively unconscionable, id. at \u00b6 42-46, the appellate court opined that the clause requiring litigation to take place in Kentucky if the arbitration and mediation clauses were held to be unenforceable deprived any arbitration award of finality. The court concluded that under <em>Schaefer v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 708, 716, 590 N.E.2d 1242, and <em>Miller v. Gunckle, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 359, 2002-Ohio-4932, 775 N.E.2d 475, \u00b6 10, the arbitration provision in Taylor\u2019s contract was not a \u201ctrue arbitration\u201d clause, so the entire clause was unenforceable. <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 19} Based on its assessment of the arbitration clause and other contract provisions, the appellate court held the parties\u2019 contract void and unenforceable. Id. at \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b620} Taylor appealed, and the court of appeals certified its decision as in conflict with those of other courts of appeals in this state. The question the appellate court certified for our review is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cShould an appellate court apply a de novo or abuse of discretion standard of review when reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to compel arbitration where it is alleged that the arbitration clause is unconscionable?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 22} We accepted review of the certified conflict question and Taylor\u2019s first proposition of law in its discretionary appeal, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe proper standard of review for a Court of Appeals reviewing a decision of a trial court granting or denying a motion to compel arbitration under O.R.C. Section 2711.02 where the party opposing the motion alleges unconsciona-bility of the arbitration clause is \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b624} Although the certified question and proposition of law accepted for review are phrased in terms of a motion to compel arbitration, see R.C. 2711.03(A), we note that this case involves an order to stay judicial proceedings pending arbitration, see R.C. 2711.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 25} The Ohio General Assembly in R.C. Chapter 2711 has expressed a strong policy favoring arbitration of disputes. R.C. 2711.01(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA provision in any written contract * * * to settle by arbitration a controversy that subsequently arises out of the contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part of the contract, or any agreement in writing between two or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to submit, or arising after the agreement to submit, * * * shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d {\u00b6 27} Indeed, the Ohio courts recognize a \u201cpresumption favoring arbitration\u201d that arises \u201cwhen the claim in dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision.\u201d <em>Williams v. Aetna Fin. Co. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 464, 471, 700 N.E.2d 859; see also <em>Ignazio v. Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 276, 2007-Ohio-1947, 865 N.E.2d 18, \u00b6 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Ohio law directs trial courts to grant a stay of litigation in favor of arbitration pursuant to a written arbitration agreement on application of one of the parties, in accordance with R.C. 2711.02(B). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cIf any action is brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in which the action is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration of the issue has been had in accordance with the agreement, provided the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 30} Ohio law authorizes appellate review of such orders. R.C. 2711.02(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[A]n order under division (B) of this section that grants or denies a stay of a trial of any action pending arbitration * * * is a final order and may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed on appeal pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 32} In the case before us, the narrow issue is whether the standard of appellate review of an R.C. 2711.02(B) stay order is de novo or abuse of discretion when the underlying issue is whether the arbitration clause is unenforceable because of alleged unconscionability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">(\u00b6 33} Arbitration agreements are \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d R.C. 2711.01(A). Unconscionability is a ground for revocation of a contract. See, e.g., <em>Williams, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 471, 700 N.E.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 34} Unconscionability includes both \u201c \u2018an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 376, 383, 613 N.E.2d 183, quoting <em>Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co. </em>(C.A.D.C.1965), 350 F.2d 445, 449; see also <em>Collins v. Click Camera &amp; Video, Inc. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 826, 834, 621 N.E.2d 1294. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>party asserting unconscionability of a contract bears the burden of proving that the agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. See generally <em>Ball v. Ohio State Home Servs., Inc., </em>168 Ohio App.3d 622, 2006-Ohio-4464, 861 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 6; see also <em>Click Camera, </em>86 Ohio App.3d at 834, 621 N.E.2d 1294, citing White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (1988) 219, Section 4-7 (\u201cOne must allege and prove a \u2018quantum\u2019 of both prongs in order to establish that a particular contract is unconscionable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 35} A determination of whether a written contract is unconscionable is an issue of law. See Ins. Co. <em>of N. Am. v. Automatic Sprinkler Corp. of Am. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 91, 98, 21 O.O.3d 58, 423 N.E.2d 151; see also <em>Bolton v. Crockett Homes, Inc., </em>5th Dist. No. 2004CA00051, 2004-Ohio-7318, 2004 WL 3251302, \u00b6 8 (unconscionability of arbitration clause in home-construction agreement is a question of law). Courts review questions of law de novo. See, e.g., <em>Ignazio, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 276, 2007-Ohio-1947, 865 N.E.2d 18, \u00b6 19 (contract interpretation is a matter of law reviewable de novo); <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Human Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684 (same). Federal courts in cases brought under the Federal Arbitration Act have applied de novo review to issues of contract interpretation and enforceability of an arbitration clause alleged to be unconscionable. See, e.g., <em>Edwards v. HOVENSA L.L.C. </em>(C.A.3, 2007), 497 F.3d 355, 362-363 (plenary review applied to determine enforceability of arbitration agreement alleged to be substantively unconscionable); <em>Faber v. Menard, Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 2004), 367 F.3d 1048, 1051 (de novo review of determination of arbitrability based on contract interpretation); <em>Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Servicing Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 2001), 252 F.3d 302, 304-305 (de novo review of denial of motion to compel arbitration where arbitration clause asserted to be unconscionable).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 36} Taylor argues that appellate courts should review a trial court\u2019s decision to stay litigation in the face of an allegedly unconscionable arbitration clause only for abuse of discretion. Taylor argues that the strong state policy in favor of arbitration counsels in favor of a deferential standard of review of the decision to stay litigation in favor of arbitration. See R.C. 2711.01(A); <em>ABM Farms, Inc. v. Woods </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 498, 500, 692 N.E.2d 574 (noting that Ohio and federal courts and the Ohio General Assembly encourage arbitration to settle disputes).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 37} We are not persuaded that the issue whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable should be reviewed by a standard different from other legal issues involving contract interpretation. Accordingly, we agree with the Ohio and federal courts that have applied a de novo standard of review to a determination whether an arbitration agreement alleged to be unconscionable is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 38} When a trial court makes factual findings, however, supporting its determination that a contract is or is not unconscionable, such as any findings regarding the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, those factual findings should be reviewed with great deference. See, e.g., <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 108, 652 N.E.2d 684 (contract interpretation, a question of law, is reviewed de novo, \u201c[u]nlike determinations of fact which are given great deference\u201d); <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614, 614 N.E.2d 742 (\u201cwhere the decision in a case turns upon credibility of testimony, and where there exists competent and credible evidence supporting the findings and conclusions of the trial court, deference to such findings and conclusions must be given by the reviewing court\u201d), citing <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273; and <em>Cohen v. Lamko, Inc. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 167, 10 OBR 500, 462 N.E.2d 407. See also Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981), Section 208, Comment/(\u201cIncidental findings of fact are made by the court rather than by a jury, but are accorded the usual weight given to such findings of fact in appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 39} The court of appeals correctly identified de novo as the standard of review for a determination of whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable and is therefore unenforceable. However, it incorrectly applied that standard in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 40} We address first the preliminary question whether the appellate court properly considered the issue of unconscionability regarding the entire contract rather than just the arbitration provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 arbitration clause is broad, providing that \u201cany claims or disputes arising out of this Construction Agreement or the alleged breach thereunder shall be settled by mandatory and binding arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association unless both parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d (Boldface sic.) The intent of the parties is determined from the language used in their contract. <em>Ignazio, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 276, 2007-Ohio-1947, 865 N.E.2d 18, \u00b6 12. Here, such a broad arbitration clause remits \u201cany claims or disputes arising out of\u2019 the underlying contract or a breach of that contract to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 41} As we explained in <em>ABM Farms, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 501-502, 692 N.E.2d 574, R.C. 2711.01, like its federal counterpart, \u201cacknowledges that an arbitration clause is, in effect, a contract within a contract, subject to revocation on its own merits.\u201d The court reasoned, \u201cBecause the arbitration clause is a separate entity, it only follows that an alleged failure of the contract in which it is contained does not affect the provision itself.\u201d Id. at 502, 692 N.E.2d 574. Thus, in <em>ABM Farms, </em>we held that to defeat a motion under R.C. 2711.02 for a stay of litigation in favor of arbitration, \u201ca party must demonstrate that the arbitration provision itself in the contract at issue, and not merely the contract in general, was fraudulently induced.\u201d Id., citing <em>Krafcik v. USA Energy Consultants, Inc. </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 59, 63, 667 N.E.2d 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 42} Similarly, when a party challenges an arbitration provision as unconscionable pursuant to R.C. 2711.01(A), the party must show that the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable. If the court determines that the arbitration clause is enforceable, claims of unconscionability that relate to the contract generally, rather than the arbitration clause specifically, are properly left to the arbitrator in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 43} The appellate court in this case incorrectly determined that the entire contract was unconscionable based in part on that court\u2019s view that several provisions in addition to the arbitration clause were unfair. The appellate court found the contract \u201cvoid and unenforceable in its entirety.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 50. See also id. at \u00b6 40 (referring to \u201cmultiple examples of the substantive unfairness of <em>the terms </em>in this contract\u201d [emphasis added]); id. at \u00b6 50 (referring to \u201c[t]he unconscionability of the mediation/arbitration clauses <em>and other unduly oppressive clauses\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). Among the provisions the court of appeals deemed \u201cnotably unfair\u201d for the purpose of its substantive unconscionability analysis were paragraph six, which provides for liquidated damages and certain equitable remedies in the event of a breach of the contract; paragraph nine, which provides for Taylor\u2019s enforcement of its mechanic\u2019s lien rights on the property; and paragraph ten, which pertains to an additional fee for loans insured by certain organizations. See id. at \u00b6 29-34, 42. These provisions do not appear in the arbitration clause (which is found at paragraph 15) and do not refer to arbitration proceedings. The court of appeals erred in determining the issue of the unconscionability of the contract as a whole rather than limiting its initial review to whether the arbitration clause was unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 44} The trial court concluded that the arbitration clause is not procedurally unconscionable. Procedural unconscionability considers the circumstances surrounding the contracting parties\u2019 bargaining, such as the parties\u2019 \u201c \u2018age, edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>cation, intelligence, business acumen and experience, * * * who drafted the contract, * * * whether alterations in the printed terms were possible, [and] whether there were alternative sources of supply for the goods in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Click Camera, </em>86 Ohio App.3d at 834, 621 N.E.2d 1294, quoting <em>Johnson v. Mobil Oil Corp. </em>(E.D.Mich.1976), 415 F.Supp. 264, 268. \u201cFactors which may contribute to a finding of unconscionability in the bargaining process [i.e., procedural unconscionability] include the following: belief by the stronger party that there is no reasonable probability that the weaker party will fully perform the contract; knowledge of the stronger party that the weaker party will be unable to receive substantial benefits from the contract; knowledge of the stronger party that the weaker party is unable reasonably to protect his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy or inability to understand the language of the agreement, or similar factors.\u201d Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981), Section 208, Comment <em>d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 45} The trial court noted that the Benfields did not have to buy a home from Taylor, because \u201c[t]here are a multitude of homebuilders in the local area.\u201d The parties do not dispute this point. Based on this fact, the trial court reasoned, \u201cIt is not possible to state that there is inherently unequal bargaining power between these two parties.\u201d In any event, inequality of bargaining power alone is insufficient to invalidate an otherwise enforceable arbitration contract. See, e.g., <em>Vanyo v. Clear Channel Worldwide, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 706, 2004-Ohio-1793, 808 N.E.2d 482, \u00b6 19, citing <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 20, 33, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (upholding agreement to arbitrate federal statutory claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 46} As the trial court observed, simply showing that a contract is preprinted and that the arbitration clause is a required term, without more, fails to demonstrate the unconscionability of the arbitration clause. The arbitration clause in this case appeared in standard, rather than fine, print and was not hidden. The Benfields initialed the arbitration clause and signed the contract as a whole. The trial court also found that \u201cthere is no evidence that the [Benfields] were hurried through [the] signature process.\u201d Thus, while the record does not indicate that the Benfields consulted an attorney before they signed the contract, the circumstances do not show that they were prevented from consulting with an attorney if they wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 47} The Benfields allege that Taylor\u2019s salesperson told them that invoking the arbitration clause would not be necessary because Taylor \u201cnever had any disputes over the quality of [its] product and workmanship,\u201d and Taylor was \u201cconcerned about keeping [its] customers happy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The latter statement (that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the arbitration clause would not be necessary because Taylor was concerned about keeping its customers happy) was merely the salesman\u2019s opinion and did not amount to a misrepresentation. Cf. <em>Robbins v. Country Club Retirement Ctr. IV, Inc., </em>7th Dist. No. 04BE43, 2005-Ohio-1338, 2005 WL 678765, at \u00b6 33 (statement to employee that arbitration agreement was \u201croutine\u201d to induce her to sign was not a misrepresentation and did not render the agreement proeedurally unconscionable). To the extent that the statement that arbitration would not be necessary because Taylor had never had any disputes over the quality of its product and workmanship was more than an opinion, which we do not decide, the record does not show that it was a false statement of fact when made. Thus, we disagree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion, in determining whether the arbitration agreement was proeedurally unconscionable, that the statement of the Taylor representative weakened the significance of the undisputed fact that there were other homebuilders available to build the Benfields\u2019 home. Without more, the Taylor representative\u2019s statements do not make the arbitration agreement proeedurally unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 48} The trial court determined that \u201cnothing in the record\u201d allowed it to conclude that the Benfields \u201cwere unaware of the impact of the arbitration clause or that they were otherwise limited in understanding its impact.\u201d That determination does not appear to be clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 49} The trial court determined that this was not a \u201ccontract of adhesion\u201d\u2014 that is, a standardized form contract prepared by one party, and offered to the weaker party, usually a consumer, who has no realistic choice as to the contract terms. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 342. But the court of appeals noted that Mrs. Benfield\u2019s affidavit asserted that Taylor\u2019s agent had told the Benfields that Taylor \u201c \u2018would not sign a contract without the arbitration/mediation clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 24. The stronger party\u2019s refusal to negotiate a key term is a common feature of adhesion contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 50} To be sure, an arbitration clause in a consumer contract with some characteristics of an adhesion contract \u201cnecessarily engenders more reservations than an arbitration clause in a different setting,\u201d such as a collective-bargaining agreement or a commercial contract between two businesses. <em>Williams v. Aetna Fin. Co., </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 472, 700 N.E.2d 859. However, even a contract of adhesion is not in all instances unconscionable per se. As the Seventh Circuit recently observed in rejecting a claim that an arbitration clause was unconscionable, \u201cfew consumer contracts are negotiated one clause at a time.\u201d <em>Carbajal v. H </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>&amp; R Block Tax Servs., Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 2004), 372 F.3d 903, 906. Indeed, so-called \u201cform contracts\u201d can provide advantages to consumers. \u201cForms reduce transactions costs and benefit consumers because, in competition, reductions in the cost of doing business show up as lower prices * * *.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 51} Even assuming that the parties\u2019 bargaining power was not equal, this is not a case like <em>Williams, </em>in which the defendant finance company was found to have conspired to defraud the plaintiff. See <em>Williams, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 476, 700 N.E.2d 859 (\u201cthe jury reasonably determined on the sum total of the evidence presented that employees of ITT conspired with Blair to defraud Williams, with resulting damages to her\u201d). This court in <em>Williams </em>accordingly determined-that \u201cany presumption in favor of arbitration was overcome <em>based on the entire record </em>\u201d in that case. (Emphasis added.) Id. at 473, 700 N.E.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 52} The factual record in this case is more limited than that in <em>Williams, </em>and the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the arbitration clause is not procedurally unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 53} The conclusion that the arbitration clause here is not procedurally unconscionable defeats the Benfields\u2019 contention that the arbitration clause is unenforceable due to unconscionability. As noted above, the party challenging a contract as unconscionable must prove \u201ca quantum\u201d of both procedural and substantive unconscionability. See, e.g., <em>Ball v. Ohio State Home Servs., Inc., </em>168 Ohio App.3d 622, 2006-Ohio-4464, 861 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 6; <em>Click Camera, </em>86 Ohio App.3d at 834, 621 N.E.2d 1294. However, we address briefly the appellate court\u2019s analysis of substantive unconscionability in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 54} As noted above, the appellate court held the arbitration clause and other provisions in the contract to be so unfair as to be substantively unconscionable. See <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, at \u00b6 50. For the reasons discussed above, we address whether the mediation and arbitration provision, as opposed to the contract as a whole, is substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 55} The Benfields complain that the arbitration clause does not warn them that they are giving up their right to a jury trial. But as other courts have concluded, waiver of one\u2019s jury-trial rights is a necessary consequence of agreeing to have an arbitrator decide a dispute. See, e.g., <em>Pierson v. Dean, Witter, Reynolds, Inc. </em>(C.A.7,1984), 742 F.2d 334, 339 (\u201closs of the right to a jury trial is a necessary and fairly obvious consequence of an agreement to arbitrate\u201d). This aspect of the arbitration clause is not substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 56} The Benfields assert, and the court of appeals held, that the \u201ccosts of alternative dispute resolution * * * are often substantially higher than the costs associated with court proceedings.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 41. The appellate court was troubled by the fact that the agreement does not disclose the cost of arbitration. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 57} In determining that the arbitration and mediation clauses \u201cimpose significant undisclosed costs\u201d on the Benfields, id. at \u00b6 41, the court of appeals did not give appropriate deference to the trial court\u2019s contrary determination that the Benfields \u201cpresented no evidence that the arbitration costs and fees are prohibitive, unreasonable, and unfair\u201d as applied to them and to the trial court\u2019s specific finding that the Benfields had shown \u201cno evidence of a substantial fee required as a condition precedent to arbitration.\u201d The Benfields attached to their brief in the court of appeals information regarding costs and fees in certain American Arbitration Association cases, but the trial court had no opportunity to consider that information. Accordingly, we do not consider it here. The lack of evidence before the trial court of excessively high arbitration costs undercuts the Ben-fields\u2019 claim that arbitration costs would be prohibitively expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph </em>(2000), 531 U.S. 79, 90-91,121 S.Ct. 513,148 L.Ed.2d 373, the United States Supreme Court held that an arbitration agreement that does not mention costs and fees is not per se unenforceable on the theory that it fails to protect a party from potentially high arbitration costs, because the mere risk that a plaintiff would be forced to pay exorbitant costs is too speculative to justify invalidation of the arbitration agreement. Instead, the court imposed upon the party challenging the arbitration agreement the burden of proving the likelihood of incurring prohibitive costs. Id. at 92,121 S.Ct. 513,148 L.Ed.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 59} <em>Green Tree </em>arose in the different context of whether an agreement to arbitrate federal statutory causes of action may be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act, and thus, it does not directly apply to the state-law claims here. However, we believe that the same general principle obtains here \u2014 that an arbitration clause will not be held unenforceable based on unsupported allegations of prohibitive costs. The record before the trial court also failed to show that mediation or arbitration costs would be prohibitively high for the Benfields. Cf. <em>Faber v. Menard, Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 2004), 367 F.3d 1048, 1054 (requiring party claiming that arbitration is cost-prohibitive to \u201cpresent specific evidence of likely arbitrators\u2019 fees and its financial inability to pay those fees,\u201d including the claimant\u2019s \u201cparticular financial situation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 60} In light of the dearth of evidence before the trial court on the cost of mediation and arbitration and whether such costs would have been prohibitive to the Benfields, we need not, and therefore do not, decide as a matter of Ohio law whether or at what point arbitration costs can become prohibitive so as to render an arbitration agreement, or its provision allocating arbitration costs, to be substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 61} Like the trial court, the court of appeals concluded that the contract\u2019s requirement that the arbitration take place in Louisville, Kentucky was unenforceable under Ohio law. In that regard, R.C. 4113.62(D)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cAny provision of a construction contract, agreement, understanding, specification, or other document or documentation that is made a part of a construction contract, subcontract, agreement, or understanding for an improvement, or portion thereof, to real estate in this state that requires any litigation, arbitration, or other dispute resolution process provided for in the construction contract, subcontract, agreement, or understanding to occur in another state is void and unenforceable as against public policy. Any litigation, arbitration, or other dispute resolution process provided for in the construction contract, subcontract, agreement, or understanding shall take place in the county or counties in which the improvement to real estate is located or at another location within this state mutually agreed upon by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 63} The trial court severed the Kentucky-venue provision in paragraph 15 of the agreement as void under R.C. 4113.62(D) and ordered the arbitration to be held in Clermont County, Ohio, the county where the Benfields\u2019 house was to have been built. Taylor did not challenge that ruling on appeal. Accordingly, that issue is not before us. We note, however, that given the broad severability clause at paragraph 18 of this contract, a court will not lightly conclude that the invalidity of a particular contract term requires invalidation of the entire agreement. Cf. <em>Ignazio, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 276, 2007-Ohio-1947, 865 N.E.2d 18, \u00b6 17 (upholding severability of judicial-review provision in arbitration agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 64} The court of appeals also found unconscionable and unenforceable under R.C. 4113.62(D)(2) the provision in paragraph 16 requiring all litigation to take place in Louisville, Kentucky if the arbitration clause or any portion of it was held invalid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 42, 46. R.C. 4113.62(D) by its terms renders invalid a contract clause imposing an out-of-state forum selection for litigation of claims arising out of a contract to build a residence in Ohio. Taylor filed this case against the Benfields in the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Common Pleas of Clermont County, Ohio. Accordingly, it does not appear that Taylor seeks to enforce the Kentucky-venue provision in paragraph 16. Thus, we need not, and therefore do not, determine whether the Kentucky-venue provision in paragraph 16 affects the enforceability of the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">(\u00b6 65} We also note that, contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 view, paragraph 16 does not deprive any arbitration decision of finality. Cf. id. at \u00b6 48. The appellate court\u2019s concern was that paragraph 16 \u201cprovides for judicial review in the event that the mediation and/or arbitration clauses are declared unenforceable.\u201d Id. Because the arbitration clause is enforceable, we have no occasion to address paragraph 16\u2019s provision for a bench trial rather than a jury trial in the event arbitration is held unenforceable. And to the extent that an arbitrator might find any other provision of the parties\u2019 construction agreement unenforceable, paragraph 16 does not purport to alter the standards for judicial review of arbitration awards set forth in Ohio statutes. See R.C. 2711.10, 2711.11, and 2711.13. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the arbitration provision here fails to provide for final and binding arbitration. Cf. <em>Miller v. Gunckle, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 359, 2002-Ohio-4932, 775 N.E.2d 475, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 66} Finally, the Benfields also complain that paragraph seven of the contract requires them to pay Taylor\u2019s \u201creasonable legal costs\u201d of enforcing its rights under the contract, including attorney fees, court costs, and fees and expenses. The court of appeals concluded that this provision was one-sided because the agreement did not require Taylor to pay the Benfields\u2019 legal costs. <em>Taylor, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 517, 2006-Ohio-4428, 860 N.E.2d 1058, \u00b6 39, 42. As the court below recognized, the obligations of the parties to a contract need not be exactly the same if the contract is supported by consideration. Id. at \u00b6 40, citing <em>Country Club Retirement Ctr., </em>2005-Ohio-1338, 2005 WL 678765, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 67} We do not decide whether paragraph seven is substantively unconscionable. As noted above, paragraph seven is not part of the arbitration clause. Additionally, we do not believe that this clause necessarily has the effect that the court of appeals attributed to it. First, while the contract does not specify that the Benfields also may obtain their \u201creasonable legal costs\u201d from Taylor, the agreement does not limit the causes of action that the Benfields may pursue or the remedies that they may obtain in arbitration. Thus, it is possible that the Benfields, if they prevailed in the arbitration, could be awarded their reasonable attorney fees on their claim under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act pursuant to R.C. 1345.09(F)(2). Second, paragraph seven may be read to preclude any payment of Taylor\u2019s \u201creasonable legal costs\u201d if Taylor does not prevail on its claims. The trial court offered another reading of paragraph seven, opining that Taylor \u201cis only entitled to recover its attorney fees under the limited circumstance where the defendants enter into possession of the real estate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>violation of this provision without making full payment.\u201d On that basis, the trial court found that provision reasonable, given that \u201csubstantial detriment may be caused to [Taylor] by the [Benfields\u2019] taking possession without making payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 68} We need not decide whether the trial court\u2019s reading of this provision was the correct one. Ohio law in some circumstances permits contractual provisions requiring the losing party in litigation to pay the prevailing party\u2019s attorney fees. See <em>Nottingdale Homeowners\u2019 Assn., Inc. v. Darby </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 32, 514 N.E.2d 702, syllabus. At the least, paragraph seven of the contract may be read so as not to grant Taylor a right to have the Benfields pay its attorney fees if Taylor does not prevail on its claims. In fight of the uncertainty of paragraph seven\u2019s meaning, we cannot find that paragraph seven\u2019s provision for Taylor\u2019s attorney fees is so oppressive and one-sided as to \u201ctaint\u201d the arbitration clause in paragraph 15 and render it unenforceable. Because the arbitration clause itself is enforceable, the question of the meaning of paragraph seven and its enforceability under Ohio law, like that of other contract terms, will be for the arbitrator in the first instance. Cf., e.g., <em>Hawkins v. Aid Assn. for Lutherans </em>(C.A.7, 2003), 338 F.3d 801, 807 (claim that arbitration clause was unconscionable because it limited remedies available to plaintiffs was for arbitrator in the first instance, as the adequacy of arbitration remedies \u201chas nothing to do with whether the parties agreed to arbitrate\u201d). Accordingly, we express no view on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 69} For all of these reasons, we hold that a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion pursuant to R.C. 2711.02 to stay litigation in favor of arbitration must be reviewed de novo when the issue to be decided is whether the arbitration agreement or clause is unconscionable as a matter of law. The court of appeals erred by determining the issue of unconscionability regarding the parties\u2019 entire contract, rather than just the arbitration clause. For the reasons discussed above, we conclude, unlike the court of appeals, that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 70} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Acn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Santen &amp; Hughes, J.

Accordingly, we do not consider whether any of the claims at issue are beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement. Additionally, because the contract here pertained to construction of a single-family home for the Benfields, it was not a \u201ccommercial construction contract\u201d within the scope of R.C. 2711.02(A) and so was not subject to R.C. 2711.02(D) (addressing arbitration clauses in commercial contracts).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\">.

The site for the aforementioned action shall be Louisville, Kentucky (Jefferson County). Nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to limit or prevent First Party from pursuing and perfecting any mechanic\u2019s lien upon the Real Estate and Improvements for sums unpaid under this Agreement. The provisions in this paragraph are a material inducement for First Party to enter into this Construction Agreement.\u201d (Underlining sic.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b465-6\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4t\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 71} The majority opinion states that \u201c[i]n the case before us, the narrow issue is whether the standard of appellate review of an R.C. 2711.02(B) stay order is de novo or for abuse of discretion when the underlying issue is whether the arbitration clause is unenforceable because of alleged unconscionability.\u201d \u00b6 31. I concur with the conclusion in the majority opinion that \u201c[t]he court of appeals correctly identified de novo as the standard of review for a determination of whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable and is therefore unenforceable.\u201d I dissent, however, from the majority opinion\u2019s subsequent conclusion that the trial court \u201cincorrectly applied that standard in this case.\u201d \u00b6 38. I believe that only the narrow legal issue is before us and that we should not reach beyond that issue to make a factual determination. Because the court of appeals applied the proper standard, I would affirm its decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
