Specifically, the commission\u2019s approval allows AEP to collect approximately $24 million for research and development of the generating facility from its customers and further contemplates that AEP will be permitted to recover the construction and maintenance costs of the facility from its distribution customers upon completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">{\u00b6 2} Appellants contend that because Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IY, 7962 (\u201cS.B. 3\u201d), separated electric generation, which is an unregulated competitive service, from electric distribution, which is a regulated noncompetitive service, the commission\u2019s order permitting AEP, an electric-distribution utility, to build a generation plant should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">{\u00b6 3} AEP contends, however, that because R.C. 4928.14 permits an electric-distribution utility to be involved in building an electric-generating facility to satisfy the utility\u2019s provider-of-last-resort (\u201cPOLR\u201d) and standard-service-offer obligations, it therefore may recover the cost of designing and constructing such a facility from its distribution customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">{\u00b6 4} We agree that provisions of S.B. 3 prevent an electric-distribution utility from using revenues from noncompetitive distribution service to subsidize the cost of providing a competitive generation-service component; however, there may be merit to the commission\u2019s regulation of the design, construction, and operation of the proposed generation facility as a distribution-ancillary service related to AEP\u2019s POLR obligation, but this record is not fully developed in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>regard. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the commission for further findings. Because the matter is being remanded for further development of the record and because the commission has already issued a conditional refund order that remains in effect, we decline to rule at this time upon IEU\u2019s request for a refund of costs already collected from AEP\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">HISTORY OF DEREGULATION</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 5} S.B. 3 restructured Ohio\u2019s electric-utility industry to foster retail competition in the generation component of electric service. As we have repeatedly recognized, S.B. 3 altered the traditional rate-based regulation of electric utilities by requiring the three components of electric service \u2014 generation, transmission, and distribution \u2014 to be separated. See, e.g., <em>Migden-Ostrander v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 451, 2004-Ohio-3924, 812 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 6} Pursuant to R.C. 4928.03 and 4928.05, electric generation is an unregulated, competitive retail electric service, while electric distribution remains a regulated, noncompetitive service pursuant to R.C. 4928.15(A). R.C. 4928.02(G) provides that it is the state\u2019s policy to \u201c[e]nsure effective competition in the provision of retail electric service by avoiding anticompetitive subsidies flowing from a noncompetitive retail electric service to a competitive retail electric service or to a product or service other than retail electric service, and vice versa.\u201d This provision \u201cprohibits public utilities from using revenues from competitive generation-service components to subsidize the cost of providing noncompetitive distribution service, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Elyria Foundry Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 305, 2007-Ohio-4164, 871 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 50. In the context of S.B. 3 electric-utility deregulation, each service component must stand on its own. Id., citing <em>Migden-Ostrander </em>at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">AEP APPLICATION AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 7} On March 18, 2005, AEP filed an application with the commission for approval of a mechanism to recover the expected expenditures for the design, construction, and operation of a 629-megawatt integrated-gasification-combined-cycle (\u201cIGCC\u201d) electric-generation facility in Meigs County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b6 8} On April 10, 2006, the commission issued its opinion and order approving the application. In its order, the commission determined that it had the authority to regulate the design, construction, and operation of the proposed generation facility because it was a distribution-ancillary service related to AEP\u2019s statutory POLR obligation. Accordingly, the commission\u2019s order permitted AEP to charge its customers an estimated $23.7 million to fund AEP\u2019s preliminary research for the proposed construction of the IGCC electric-generation facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Additionally, the commission declared that it has the authority to approve a plan that would permit AEP to recover the construction and operation costs of the generating plant from distribution customers. In its application, AEP estimated that the cost of the project could reach $1.27 billion. However, at oral argument, the parties represented that the overall cost could exceed $2 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 9} On June 28, 2006, the commission issued an entry, following a motion for a rehearing, in which it reiterated its authority to establish a charge related to the overall construction and operation of a generating plant as proposed in AEP\u2019s application. However, because the commission also determined that elements of the design and engineering might be transferable to other facilities in other states, it ordered AEP to be prepared to refund the charges collected from its customers for all transferable research if AEP has not commenced a continuous course of construction of the proposed IGCC plant by June 28, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 10} FirstEnergy Solutions, IEU, OCC, and the Ohio Energy Group all appealed the commission\u2019s order to this court, contending, inter alia, that the order was contrary to law because it improperly regulated competitive electric-generation service in violation of R.C. Chapter 4928 and it authorized an increase in electric-distribution rates without complying with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 4909. Further, Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy filed an amicus brief on behalf of the appellants. AEP intervened as an appellee, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 972, Ironworkers Local 787, Parkersburg-Marietta Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO, and Murray Energy Corporation filed amicus briefs on behalf of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 11} The issues presented to this court are whether the commission properly designated an unregulated competitive generation service as a regulated distribution-ancillary service in order to exercise regulatory jurisdiction, whether the commission properly determined that AEP\u2019s POLR obligation justifies a rate-based recovery to build and operate a generation facility, and whether the commission properly denied the requested refund of $24 million in generation-plant research-and-development costs that AEP has collected from its customers pursuant to the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cR.C. 4903.13 provides that a PUCO order shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds the order to be unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 50. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>We will not reverse or modify a commission decision as to questions of fact when the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show that the commission\u2019s decision was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and was not so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>Monongahela Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 571, 2004-Ohio-6896, 820 N.E.2d 921, \u00b6 29. The appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the commission\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence or is clearly unsupported by the record. Id. We will not reverse a commission order absent a showing by the appellant that it has been or will be harmed or prejudiced by the order. <em>Myers v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 299, 302, 595 N.E.2d 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 13} Although we have \u201ccomplete and independent power of review as to all questions of law\u201d in appeals from the commission, <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922, we may rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where \u201chighly specialized issues\u201d are involved and \u201cwhere agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 12 O.O.3d 115, 388 N.E.2d 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">DISTRIBUTION-ANCILLARY SERVICE</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 14} IEU and the other appellants argue that the commission has approved an effort by AEP to ignore the current statutory process and to recover from its distribution customers the costs of planning, building, and maintaining a competitive generation facility. FirstEnergy Solutions points out that the commission acknowledged in its order that retail electric-generation service is competitive under R.C. 4928.03 and therefore it is not subject to commission regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 15} The commission contends that its current order regulates only noncompetitive electric retail \u201cancillary services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4928.01(A)(1) defines \u201cancillary service\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAny function necessary to the provision of electric transmission or distribution service to a retail customer and includes, but is not limited to, scheduling, system control, and dispatch services; reactive supply from generation resources and voltage control service; reactive supply from transmission resources service; regulation service; frequency response service; energy imbalance service; operating reserve-spinning reserve service; operation reserve-supplemental reserve service; load following; back-up supply service; real-power loss replacement service; dynamic scheduling; system black start capability; and network stability service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The commission found that most of the ancillary services enumerated in the statutory definition require a generating plant. Therefore, the commission concluded that S.B. 3 contemplates that an electric-distribution utility will provide ancillary service from a generating plant, making the recovery of costs associated with that generating plant a distribution-ancillary service subject to the commission\u2019s regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 19} Appellants dispute the commission\u2019s analysis, asserting that the construction and maintenance of an electric-generating facility is fundamental to the generation of electric service. The Ohio Energy Group opposes the commission\u2019s determination that it is able to regulate the proposed electric-generating facility by classifying the service as a regulated distribution-ancillary service rather than what it really is \u2014 a competitive electric-generation service. The Ohio Energy Group further contends that the commission is permitting AEP to recover and earn a return on its investment in a power plant, which was previously guaranteed by regulating the electric utility prior to deregulation. It notes that, since the enactment of S.B. 3, utilities no longer have any guarantee that they will either recover costs or earn a return on their power-plant investments through cost-based rates. OCC contends that the commission\u2019s findings move the state closer to re-regulation and that, left undisturbed, the commission\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over generation, under the guise of distribution-ancillary services, could circumvent R.C. Chapter 4928 by permitting the commission to exercise jurisdiction over all generation functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 20} It is well settled that the generation component of electric service is not subject to commission regulation. In <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 2, we stated that S.B. 3 \u201cprovided for restructuring Ohio\u2019s electric-utility industry to achieve retail competition with respect to the generation component of electric service.\u201d R.C. 4928.03 specifies that retail electric-generation service is competitive and therefore not subject to commission regulation, and R.C. 4928.05 expressly removes competitive retail electric services from commission regulation. Moreover, R.C. 4928.14(A) requires an electric-distribution utility to provide a market-based standard service offer of all competitive retail electric services, including electric-generation service.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 21} Thus, the issue presented here is whether the commission properly identified the subject matter of AEP\u2019s application as a distribution-ancillary service subject to its regulatory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 22} The statutory definition of ancillary service, set forth in R.C. 4928.01(A)(1), contains examples of services that involve the control and regulation of the flow of electricity, not the planning and construction of generation facilities. Because R.C. 4928.03 explicitly declares electric generation to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>competitive retail electric service and R.C. 4928.05 expressly provides that electric generation is no longer subject to the commission\u2019s regulation, the classification of AEP\u2019s proposed electric-generation facility as a distribution-ancillary service is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 23} The commission\u2019s holding blurs the legislative distinctions between electric transmission, generation, and distribution. Adoption of its rationale may result in these three functions all being subject to commission regulation, which would negate the legislature\u2019s deregulation of the electric-utility industry. While we appreciate the commission\u2019s concern with respect to the future reliability of the electric-generation market as Ohio\u2019s market-development period comes to an end, a laudable and practical concern for all Ohio utility consumers, we have previously stated that a concern for the future of the competitive market does not empower the commission to create remedies beyond the parameters of the law. <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 328, 2006-Ohio-2110, 847 N.E.2d 1184, \u00b6 38. The existing legislation sufficiently segregates generation of electricity from distribution, and in order to permit the commission to regulate generation services, additional legislative authority is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s finding, which approved, as a distribution-ancillary service, AEP\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">POLR \u2014 STANDARD-SERVICE OFFER</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 25} The commission further found that, as an electric distributor, AEP has a duty under R.C. 4928.14 to provide retail electric service to consumers as a POLR, and that this duty provides additional justification for rate-based recovery to build and operate a generation facility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> AEP contends that our decision in <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 39-40, supports its position that it is permitted to recover costs associated with fulfilling its POLR responsibility. While the statute imposes a duty on an electric-distribution utility to become a POLR, it fails to specify the manner in which such a distribution utility is to ensure the availability of energy. In this regard, AEP contends that the commission may authorize the recovery of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>costs from its distribution customers in order to fulfill its statutory POLR responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">{\u00b6 26} FirstEnergy Solutions argues that AEP and the commission overextend the electric-distribution utility\u2019s POLR obligation and standard-service offerings. It acknowledges that R.C. 4928.14 requires AEP to provide generation service as a POLR, but it contends that there is a distinction between securing electric service from the competitive market and the planning, building, and maintaining of a facility to produce generation service. FirstEnergy Solutions points to the testimony of AEP\u2019s own witness, Bruce Braine, to demonstrate that a distribution utility is not required to build the plant that provides the electricity necessary to satisfy its POLR obligation. IEU and OCC argue that in order for the commission to approve AEP\u2019s application as a POLR charge, it needs to establish the rates in accordance with its traditional ratemaking authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 4928.14 does require an electric-distribution utility to be prepared to provide retail electric service to consumers through a standard-service offer. Regardless of how the service is provided, the electric-distribution utility will incur noncompetitive costs associated with the fulfillment of its POLR obligation. We have previously stressed the importance of distinguishing between the regulated and unregulated costs associated with the POLR obligation, stating that \u201cthe commission should carefully consider what costs it is attributing as costs incurred as part of an electric-distribution utility\u2019s POLR obligations.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 26. Pursuant to R.C. 4928.15, all noncompetitive retail electric-distribution-service rates and charges shall be established in accordance with the procedures set forth in R.C. Chapters 4905 and 4909.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. Chapter 4905 governs the commission\u2019s general power to regulate public utilities, while R.C. Chapter 4909 governs the commission\u2019s power to set utility rates and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 29} Notably, R.C. 4909.15 provides that any property sought to be included in the calculation of utility rates must be used and useful in rendering the public-utility service or it must be at least 75 percent complete. We have previously refused to include in a utility ratebase property that was not yet used and useful for service to consumers, noting, \u201cIncorporated in this statutory language is the generally accepted principle that a utility is not entitled to include in the valuation of its rate base property not actually used or useful in providing its public service, no matter how useful the property may have been in the past or may yet be in the future.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 449, 453, 12 O.O.3d 378, 391 N.E.2d 311 (refusing to permit a nuclear plant that was still in the testing stages to be included in the valuation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>a public utility\u2019s ratebase because the plant was not useful or used in supplying service to ratepayers).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">{\u00b6 30} We also have held that \u201c[i]n order to meet the requirements of R.C. 4903.09, * * * the PUCO\u2019s order must show, in sufficient detail, the facts in the record upon which the order is based, and the reasoning followed by the PUCO in reaching its conclusion.\u201d <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 306, 312, 513 N.E.2d 337. Although strict compliance with the terms of R.C. 4903.09, which requires the commission to file a written opinion setting forth its reasons for its decision, is not required, \u201c \u2018[a] legion of cases establish that the commission abuses its discretion if it renders an opinion on an issue without record support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tongren v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 87, 90, 706 N.E.2d 1255, quoting <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 163,166, 666 N.E.2d 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 31} While the commission may allow recovery of an electric-distribution utility\u2019s noncompetitive costs that are associated with its effort to secure competitive retail electric service in furtherance of its statutory POLR obligation, the commission\u2019s approval must be given in accordance with R.C. Chapters 4905 and 4909.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 32} The evidence does not support the order permitting AEP to recover the costs associated with the research and development of the proposed generation facility. To warrant its conclusions regarding AEP\u2019s POLR obligation, the commission may supplement the record with evidence to support its order and must verify that AEP has complied with the application requirements under R.C. 4909.18. Also, because AEP has not yet begun construction of the generation facility, compliance with the 75 percent used-and-useful standard should also be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 33} Additionally, we note that while the commission details potential problems with the fleet of existing generation facilities, it fails to make any findings regarding the amount of generation that AEP needs to guarantee its Ohio distribution responsibilities. Nor does the record demonstrate what portion of the facility\u2019s costs should be attributed to AEP\u2019s POLR obligation versus what costs should be recovered through competitive rates when the facility begins generating electricity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the record before us is incomplete in these respects and the commission is instructed to make additional findings in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of its conclusions in this regard. We remand the case to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 34} IEU and OCC seek an order to refund the $24 million in IGCC plant research-and-development costs that AEP has already recovered from its customers. IEU acknowledges this court\u2019s holding in <em>Keco Industries, Inc. v. Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co. </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 254, 2 O.O.2d 85, 141 N.E.2d 465, paragraph two of the syllabus: \u201cWhere the charges collected by a public utility are based upon rates which have been established by an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, the fact that such order is subsequently found to be unreasonable or unlawful on appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, in the absence of a statute providing therefor, affords no right of action for restitution of the increase in charges collected during the pendency of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 35} The commission argues that we should deny the request because IEU had an opportunity to request a stay of the commission\u2019s order but failed to do so, and it notes that it ordered AEP to refund all charges collected for expenditures that are transferable to other projects if AEP has not commenced a continuous course of construction of the plant within five years of its entry on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 36} In view of our remand of this matter to the commission, we need not reach the matter of refund. Therefore, we decline to deviate from <em>Keco </em>to create an exception based on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">{\u00b6 37} The provisions of S.B. 3 prevent an electric-distribution utility from using noncompetitive distribution revenues to subsidize the cost of providing competitive generation-service components. However, on a properly supported record, the commission may, in accordance with R.C. Chapters 4905 and 4909, approve recovery of an electric-distribution utility\u2019s noncompetitive costs associated with its effort to secure competitive retail service in furtherance of its POLR obligation. Here, the record does not demonstrate the extent to which recovery should be permitted in this case or whether the appropriate statutory procedures for obtaining such recovery were followed. Accordingly, we remand this case to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Because we remand this case to the commission, and because the commission\u2019s conditional refund order remains in effect, we need not reach the issue of a refund, and we decline to create an exception to our precedent of denying claims for refund from approved orders of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Order affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"At6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>McNees Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Nurick, L.L.C., Samuel C.
