Paskalik was injured at work in 1998 and was awarded temporary total disability compensation from February 17, 2004, through July 26, 2005. The compensation was to be continued upon medical proof. His self-insured employer, appellant Airborne Freight Corporation, is before us seeking to vacate that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 2} Paskalik\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was originally recognized for \u201clumbar disc.\u201d In late 2002, a letter from Airborne\u2019s third-party administrator indicated that Airborne \u201cagreed to reopen the claim for Degenerative Disc Disease L4-S1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 3} On June 8, 2004, appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio, through a staff hearing officer, issued an order that terminated temporary total disability as of January 20, 2004, based on reports from Dr. Elizabeth Mease. Significantly, the only allowed condition listed on that order was \u201clumbar disc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 4} Five months later, Paskalik\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was additionally allowed for \u201cL4-5 disc protrusion\u201d and \u201cright L4-5 foraminal stenosis.\u201d This determination was followed by a series of C-84 physician\u2019s reports from Dr. Juan M. Hernandez that attributed temporary total disability to these two conditions and \u201cdegenerative disc disease L4-S1.\u201d These C-84s prompted Paskalik\u2019s motion for renewed temporary total disability in December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b6 5} A district hearing officer granted Paskalik\u2019s motion. A staff hearing officer, on September 9, 2005, vacated the district hearing officer\u2019s order but nevertheless granted temporary total disability compensation from February 17, 2004, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cStaff Hearing Officer grants injured worker\u2019s request to award temporary total disability compensation * * *. Staff Hearing Officer finds that the disability is caused by the allowed conditions in this claim. Staff Hearing Officer further finds that injured worker has new and changed circumstances to justify the payment of temporary total disability compensation. This portion of the order is based on the C-84s of Dr. Hernandez * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">{\u00b6 7} At the conclusion of administrative proceedings, Airborne turned to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court of appeals found that the commission\u2019s order was supported by evidence, prompting Airborne\u2019s appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Airborne initially challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, focusing primarily on the question of maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d). The commission\u2019s award was based on Dr. Hernandez\u2019s C-84s, which attributed Paskalik\u2019s temporary total disability to three conditions: \u201cL4-5 disc protrusion,\u201d \u201cright foraminal stenosis L4-5,\u201d and \u201cdegenerative disc disease L4-S1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 9} Airborne claims that the commission has determined that the third condition has reached MMI, and thus that Hernandez\u2019s C-84s are invalidated. Its argument derives from its belief that Dr. Mease\u2019s reports found both \u201clumbar disc\u201d and \u201cdegenerative disc disease L4-5\u201d to have reached MMI. Because the commission, in turn, relied on these reports in making its MMI declaration, Airborne maintains that the commission\u2019s declaration covered both conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 10} This argument fails. Contrary to Airborne\u2019s representation, the only condition that the commission declared to have reached MMI was \u201clumbar disc.\u201d The sole condition listed on the MMI order is \u201clumbar disc.\u201d Because the commission speaks exclusively through its orders, <em>State ex rel. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 139, 142, 642 N.E.2d 378, we cannot assume that degenerative disc disease was also included in that declaration, even though it was an allowed condition at the time. Hernandez\u2019s reference to degenerative disc disease is not, therefore, fatal to temporary total disability eligibility because it is not yet a permanent condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 11} Airborne\u2019s remaining challenges to the evidence are uniformly unpersuasive. The company suggests that Hernandez backdated the disability certification over a period that he did not treat Paskalik. Hernandez\u2019s treatment notes rebut this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 12} In a similar vein, Airborne accuses Paskalik of unreasonable delay by submitting a November C-84 that retroactively certified his disability to February. This assertion, too, lacks merit. Until \u201cL4-5 disc protrusion\u201d and \u201cright foraminal stenosis L4-5\u201d were allowed in the claim, it was pointless to seek disability compensation based on those conditions. That allowance did not occur until November 3, 2004, and just three weeks later, Hernandez had certified Paskalik as disabled by those newly recognized conditions, and Paskalik moved for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 13} Airborne last alleges that the C-84s are inconsistent with Hernandez\u2019s office notes and thus are fatally flawed. This assertion is untrue. Nothing in the office notes contradicts Hernandez\u2019s certification of a temporary disability, nor is there any indication that nonallowed or MMI conditions are contributing to Paskalik\u2019s inability to return to his former position of employment. Accordingly, we conclude that Hernandez\u2019s C-84s are evidence supporting the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AnI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Schottenstein, Zox &amp; Dunn Co., L.P.A., Robert M.

The company contends that even if Dr. Hernandez did not include an MMI condition in his disability assessment, the staff hearing officer did when she attributed Paskalik\u2019s disability to the claim\u2019s \u201callowed conditions.\u201d Airborne maintains that because \u201callowed conditions\u201d include the clearly MMI \u201clumbar disc,\u201d the commission, by necessity, has attributed Paskalik\u2019s disability in part to a permanent condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">{\u00b6 15} We disagree. The medical evidence on which the commission relied did not attribute temporary total disability to \u201clumbar disc.\u201d Dr. Hernandez attributed Paskalik\u2019s disability to \u201cL4-5 disc protrusion,\u201d \u201cright foraminal stenosis L4-5,\u201d and \u201cdegenerative disc disease L4-S1,\u201d all of which are allowed conditions. Thus, in relying on these conditions attributed by Hernandez, the commission accurately identified them as \u201callowed conditions.\u201d Given the evidence in this case, it is inappropriate to assume that in referring to the source of disability as the \u201callowed conditions,\u201d the staff hearing officer was referring to <em>all </em>allowed conditions, including \u201clumbar disc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, Airborne states that the commission\u2019s order did not satisfy <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 205, 567 N.E.2d 245, which requires the commission to briefly explain the basis for its decision. Airborne argues that when the commission found new and changed circumstances sufficient to reinstate temporary total disability without identifying those circumstances, the commission failed to meet <em>Noll. </em>This point is moot. New and changed circumstances are relevant in this context only if temporary total disability is being sought for a condition that has been previously declared MMI. See <em>State ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 575 N.E.2d 177. Because that is not the case here, lack of identification is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 17} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
