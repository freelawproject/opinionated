(\u201cLapp\u201d). Carter alleged that he suffered an industrial injury. On September 24, 2002, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation allowed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The order additionally awarded temporary total disability compensation and set Carter\u2019s full weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 2} Two days later, the bureau issued another order, vacating the September 24, 2002 order in its entirety \u201cfor the following reason: The full weekly wage (FWW) and/or average weekly wage (AWW) previously set in the claim is being modified.\u201d The new order then reallowed the claim for the same conditions as before and again awarded temporary total disability compensation for the same period. The full weekly wage was increased, and the average weekly wage, which had not previously been calculated, was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">{\u00b6 3} On October 8, 2002, Lapp wrote to the bureau \u201cobject[ing] to the BWC tentative order dated September 24, 2002 in the above captioned claim.\u201d The letter also requested that the matter be set for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">{\u00b6 4} At the Industrial Commission of Ohio district hearing that followed, Lapp\u2019s appeal was denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[T]he employer appealed the administrator\u2019s order of 9/24/02 which was vacated by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation on 9/26/02. The Hearing Officer finds that the employer did not appeal the 9/26/02 order, therefore, there is no issue to be heard at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-15\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThis order is based on the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation order dated 9/26/02 which vacated their 9/24/02 order and the fact that the employer only appealed the 9/24/02 order on 10/8/02 after it was vacated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>{\u00b6 7} That order was administratively affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 8} Lapp filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in denying its appeal. Lapp argued that it had substantially complied with the notice requirements of R.C. 4123.511(F) despite what it termed the mistaken reference to the September 24 rather than September 26 order. A majority of the court agreed:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[RJelator\u2019s October 8, 2002 notice of appeal letter contained sufficient information to place the claimant on notice that relator had filed an appeal from the bureau\u2019s September 26, 2002 order notwithstanding the fact that relator incorrectly identified the bureau\u2019s September 24, 2002 order in the letter. As previously noted, the September 26, 2002 order vacated the September 24, 2002 order. Relator would have no reason to appeal an adverse order that had already been vacated. Moreover, as even the claimant acknowledges, the September 24, 2002 order could not have been appealed because it was vacated. At the time relator submitted its notice of appeal letter on October 8, 2002, there was only one remaining order in the claim \u2014 the September 26, 2002 order. Relator\u2019s letter of appeal correctly identified the claimant and the relevant claim number. Therefore, even though the letter of appeal mistakenly referenced the September 24, 2002 order, the commission and the claimant had sufficient information to know that relator was appealing the September 26, 2002 order.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lapp Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co., Inc. v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-950, 2007-Ohio-933, 2007 WL 660426, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 10} Carter now appeals as of right to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 11} Two principles must be balanced in this litigation. The first stems from the \u201cimportant function\u201d served by rules of procedure in maintaining the \u201cprompt, orderly and effective administration of justice.\u201d <em>Natl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Papenhagen </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 14, 16, 30 OBR 21, 505 N.E.2d 980. That goal is thwarted when a party is \u201csurprised, misled or unfairly prejudiced\u201d by an opponent\u2019s application of a given rule. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 133, 137, 601 N.E.2d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 12} The second principle is \u201cthe fundamental tenet of judicial review in Ohio that courts should decide cases on their merits.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 8, 11, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975. That end is \u201cultimately best served by an attitude of judicial tolerance toward minor errors, made in good faith, which pose no danger of prejudice to the opposing party or to the court\u2019s essential functions.\u201d <em>Papenhagen, </em>30 Ohio St.3d at 16, 30 OBR 21, 505 N.E.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 13} The rule currently at issue is R.C. 4123.511, which governs administrative appeals. It requires that every notice of appeal state (1) claimant and employer names, (2) claim number, (3) the date of the decision appealed from, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and (4) the fact that appellant appeals therefrom. R.C. 4123.511(F). The third element has been the subject of most of the relevant litigation before this court and is again at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 14} The parties agree that absolute compliance is not demanded, only \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d <em>Mullins v. Whiteway Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 18, 20-21, 15 OBR 15, 471 N.E.2d 1383; <em>Kaiser v. Ameritemps, Inc. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 411, 413, 704 N.E.2d 1212 (specifically applying \u201csubstantive compliance\u201d standard to R.C. 4123.511(F)). \u201cSubstantial compliance\u201d occurs \u201cwhen a timely notice of appeal * * * includes sufficient information, in intelligible form, to place on notice all parties to a proceeding that an appeal has been filed from an identifiable final order which has determined the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>30 Ohio St.3d 8, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Mullins, </em>the claimant sought to appeal a commission decision to common pleas court pursuant to former R.C. 4123.519, now 4123.512. Like the provision currently at bar, R.C. 4123.519 required the notice of appeal to state the date of the challenged decision. The claimant, however, had omitted the date, prompting appellees to move for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 16} We upheld the sufficiency of the notice. Citing R.C. 4123.95, which requires liberal statutory construction in favor of employees, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[C]ertain mitigating factors are to be considered when examining the sufficiency of a notice of appeal. These factors include whether appellant has substantially complied with the statutory appeal provisions and whether the purpose of the unsatisfied provision is sufficiently important to require compliance for jurisdictional purposes. This flexibility comports with R.C. 4123.95 * * <em>Mullins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 21, 15 OBR 15, 471 N.E.2d 1383.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 18} We also stressed that appellant\u2019s notice of appeal complied with all the other requirements of R.C. 4123.519 (which were the same as those currently at bar). We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[T]he purpose of the date provision is not sufficiently important to require dismissal for the failure to include it; in fact, appellees offer no argument as to the purpose of the date provision. The notice of appeal in this case gives sufficient notice and information to all concerned parties.\u201d Id. at 20, 15 OBR 15, 471 N.E.2d 1383.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">{\u00b6 20} A majority reached the same result in <em>Fisher. </em>In that case, an R.C. 4123.519 notice of appeal misstated the date of the order sought to be appealed. The common pleas court dismissed the case, and the court of appeals affirmed that action. We reversed, citing the principle that cases should be decided on their merits. We went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201cBy correctly designating the parties to the action, and the case number, all concerned parties had sufficient information from which they could determine that a particular claim or action was forthcoming. No party has alleged, and no party can now demonstrate, surprise or unfair prejudice to its interests.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>30 Ohio St.3d at 11, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 22} Carter argues that <em>Fisher </em>is distinguishable from the present case in a crucial respect. In this case, there were two orders. In <em>Fisher, </em>there was only one. Carter asserts that the misstatement, or even omission, of the date in that earlier case was inconsequential from a practical standpoint because there was only one order that could have been on appeal, and all the parties knew it. Carter argues that in this case, proper identification was crucial because there were both September 24 and September 26 orders. Here, Carter asserts, it is not clear which order was being appealed, rendering the notice insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 23} We find <em>State ex rel. Jones, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 133, 601 N.E.2d 36, instructive on this point. The underlying issue in that case was the amount of compensation overpaid to the claimant. In May 1987, a district hearing officer had declared an overpayment and had referred the matter to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for calculation. Jones had appealed. While the appeal was pending, the bureau set the overpayment figure at approximately $20,000. On November 25, 1987, the Toledo Regional Board of Review modified the May order and set the amount at approximately $6,000. No timely appeal followed. In January 1988, the Toledo Board of Review issued a \u201cCorrected Order\u201d that changed the dates in the May 1987 order as to when the overpayments had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 24} In February 1988, the bureau moved the commission for R.C. 4123.522 relief, claiming that it had not received the regional board\u2019s November 1987 order, having learned of it only after receiving the corrected order. On March 18, 1988, the commission granted the bureau\u2019s motion and reinstated its appeal rights. The language of the bureau\u2019s April 22, 1988 notice of appeal, however, suggested that the bureau was appealing the March 18, 1988 order, not the one issued on November 25,1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">{\u00b6 25} On reinstated merit appeal, the regional board\u2019s order was vacated. This order prompted claimant\u2019s petition in mandamus in which he alleged that the bureau\u2019s April 22, 1988 notice of appeal was defective because it referred to the wrong order on appeal. The court of appeals agreed and issued the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">{\u00b6 26} We unanimously reversed. Citing <em>Fisher </em>and the principle of substantial compliance, we reasoned that once relief was granted based on the bureau\u2019s failure to receive the November 25, 1987 regional board order, the claimant by necessity knew that the November 25, 1987 order was going to be appealed. That rationale was obviously why the bureau had sought R.C. 4123.522 remedial action in the first place. Further, we deemed it \u201cillogical\u201d to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>challenged notice as indeed intending to appeal the March 18, 1988 order listed thereon because \u201c[t]hat order granted the administrator his requested relief. The administrator had no reason to appeal such a favorable order.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 137, 601 N.E.2d 36. Ultimately, we held that in light of these circumstances, the claimant \u201c[could] not credibly demonstrate that he was surprised, misled or unfairly prejudiced by the April 22, 1988 notice of appeal.\u201d Id.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeW\">Reminger &amp; Reminger Co., L.P.A., and Shelby McMillan, for appellee Lapp Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co., Inc.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AAr\">Horenstein, Nicholson &amp; Blumenthal, L.P.A., and L. Frederick Sommer III, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 27} Jones\u2019s reference to an illogical interpretation resonates here. Under these facts, it is illogical to interpret Lapp\u2019s notice as appealing an order that had been vacated. Equally compelling is the fact that the contents of the September 24, 2002 order were incorporated fully into the September 26, 2002 order. Consequently, reference to either order would have put Carter on notice that Lapp was contesting the claim\u2019s allowance. The fact that the September 24 order was cited instead of the September 26 order could not have misled, surprised, or prejudiced Carter. Accordingly, we conclude that the defect is insufficient to warrant a finding that Lapp did not substantially comply with R.C. 4123.511(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 28} Carter also raises a laches defense, criticizing Lapp\u2019s two-and-a-half-year delay in commencing its mandamus action. To prevail, Carter must show that the delay was unreasonable and caused him material prejudice. <em>Smith v. Smith </em>(1959), 168 Ohio St. 447, 7 O.O.2d 276, 156 N.E.2d 113, paragraph three of the syllabus. Carter essentially incorporates the first element into the second, arguing that he was materially prejudiced, and the prejudice rendered the delay unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 29} He argues that to revisit the allowance of his claim will generate large overpayments of compensation and medical benefits if the claim is ultimately disallowed. We view this allegation with skepticism, given the overpayment provisions of R.C. 4123.511(J), and reject his assertion of material prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 30} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
