We conclude that in this case, the issue of liability for these costs has been addressed and resolved by the Public Utilities Commission in a tariff, over which the commission has exclusive original jurisdiction. We therefore grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Commission-Approved Tariff</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Columbus Southern Power Company, is a public utility under R.C. 4905.02. See also R.C. 4905.03(A)(4). The Public Utilities Commission approved a tariff for Columbus Southern Power that requires municipalities and other public authorities to pay the cost of requiring public utilities to relocate overhead lines to the underground:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe Company shall not be required to construct general distribution lines underground unless the cost of such special construction for general distribution lines and/or the cost of any change of existing overhead general distribution lines to underground which is required or specified by a municipality or other public authority (to the extent that such cost exceeds the cost of construction of the Company\u2019s standard facilities) shall be paid for by that municipality or public authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">{\u00b6 4} This provision is listed under a general heading of \u201cTerms and Conditions of Service\u201d and a more specific subheading of \u201cTemporary and Special Service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">{\u00b6 5} The commission originally approved the tariff in 1992 as part of the Columbus Southern rate case, <em>In the Matter of the Application of Columbus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Southern Power Company for Authority to Amend its Filed Tariffs to Increase the Rates and Charges for Electric Service, </em>PUCO No. 91-418-EL-AIR, 1992 WL 281188. In that case, a witness for Columbus Southern testified that unless the municipality that required the installation of underground electrical service paid the additional cost of that construction, all of the company\u2019s customers\u2014 including those living outside the municipality \u2014 would be paying the increased cost:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe Company has added language [to the proposed tariff] that will require a municipality that requires the installation of underground electric service to pay the additional cost of such construction. Underground construction is considerably more costly than overhead construction. When a customer requests that service lines be installed underground, the customer is required to pay the cost difference. If a municipality requires the Company to install the general distribution lines underground, the cost difference needs to be paid by the municipality. Otherwise, all of the Company\u2019s customers, including those outside the municipality, will have to pay more because of this increased cost. * * * This could mean that a customer in one city would be paying more because some other city requires underground construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 7} The commission\u2019s staff agreed with Columbus Southern\u2019s proposed revision because \u201cthe additional cost to provide underground service to one municipality should not be borne by ratepayers in another municipality.\u201d The commission approved the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Reynoldsburg: Ordinance, Relocation Order, and Payment of Relocation Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 8} On May 9, 2005, the Reynoldsburg City Council enacted a \u201cComprehensive Right of Way Management Policy Ordinance\u201d that authorized the city\u2019s public-service director to designate portions of its rights of way as being suitable for underground utility facilities and to require a permittee to relocate its facilities underground at the permittee\u2019s \u201csole cost.\u201d Reynoldsburg City Code 907.06(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 9} In July 2005, Reynoldsburg Safety/Service Director Sharon L. Reichard notified Columbus Southern that it would be ordered to relocate its facilities \u201cwithin the public right of way of the [Reynoldsburg Major Commercial Corridor] Project into the underground duct bank.\u201d The city declared that the portion of the public right of way within the construction project \u201cshall accommodate only utility facilities located underground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 10} In November 2005, Reynoldsburg agreed to pay in advance the estimated cost of Columbus Southern\u2019s facility relocation \u2014 in an amount not to exceed $1,185,535.30 \u2014 and the parties agreed that the dispute over the ordinance\u2019s \u201csole cost\u201d provision would be resolved in an appropriate forum.</p>\n<p id=\"AbF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Declaratory-Judgment Case</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 11} In July 2006, Reynoldsburg filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Reynoldsburg requested a declaration that Columbus Southern had a legal obligation to relocate its facilities at its own cost and that the city is entitled to reimbursement of the cost incurred under the parties\u2019 agreement. Columbus Southern filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, contending that the Public Utilities Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent, Judge David W. Fais, denied Columbus Southern\u2019s motion. Judge Fais determined that although the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to rates, services, and public-way fees, the relocation costs were not such rates, services, or fees. Judge Fais concluded that \u201c[bjecause this Court does not find that the portion of [Columbus Southern's tariff that addresses the relocation costs is a \u2018rate\u2019 or \u2018charge,\u2019 the Court finds that the dispute in the instant case over which entity is responsible for the relocation charges is properly before the Court and within its basic jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Prohibition Case</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 13} In July 2007, Columbus Southern filed this action for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Fais from further proceeding in the declaratory-judgment action. Judge Fais filed a motion to dismiss. Reynoldsburg filed a motion to intervene, an answer, and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Columbus Southern filed a memorandum in opposition. On October 24, we granted an alternative writ. The parties responded with evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 14} This cause is now before the court for our S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Prohibition Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">{\u00b6 15} To be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition, Columbus Southern must establish that (1) Judge Fais is about to exercise judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denial of the writ will cause injury for which no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law exists. <em>State ex rel. Westlake v. Corrigan, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 463, 2007-Ohio-375, 860 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 12. Judge Fais has exercised and continues to exercise judicial authority by proceeding in the declaratory-judgment case filed by Reynoldsburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">{\u00b6 16} For the remaining requirements, \u201c[i]f a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12; see also <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>ex rel. Russo v. McDonnell, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 144, 2006-Ohio-3459, 852 N.E.2d 145, \u00b6 22. \u201cIn cases of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, the requirement of a lack of an adequate remedy of law need not be proven because the availability of alternate remedies like appeal would be immaterial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. State v. Lewis, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 97, 2003-Ohio-2476, 789 N.E.2d 195, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 17} For the following reasons, Columbus Southern has established that Judge Fais patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in the declaratory-judgment case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe General Assembly has created a broad and comprehensive statutory scheme for regulating the business activities of public utilities. R.C. Title 49 sets forth a detailed statutory framework for the regulation of utility service and the fixation of rates charged by public utilities to their customers. As part of that scheme, the legislature created the Public Utilities Commission and empowered it with broad authority to administer and enforce the provisions of Title 49. The commission may fix, amend, alter or suspend rates charged by public utilities to their customers. R.C. 4909.15 and 4909.16. Every public utility in Ohio is required to file, for commission review and approval, tariff schedules that detail rates, charges and classifications for every service offered. R.C. 4905.30. And a utility must charge rates that are in accordance with tariffs approved by, and on file with, the commission. R.C. 4905.22.\u201d <em>Kazmaier Supermarket, Inc. v. Toledo Edison Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 573 N.E.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, \u201c \u2018[t]he commission has exclusive jurisdiction over various matters involving public utilities, such as rates and charges, classifications, and service, effectively denying to all Ohio courts (except this court) any jurisdiction over such matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 447, 450, 727 N.E.2d 900. The commission\u2019s jurisdiction comes from statutory authorization. See <em>Time Warner AxS v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 229, 234, 661 N.E.2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 20} Judge Fais found incorrectly that the issue of the payment of the costs to relocate overhead electrical lines in a Reynoldsburg right of way to the underground did not involve rates, charges, or any service. These costs are included in the rates and charges for services broadly defined in the pertinent statutes that are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission. R.C. 4905.22 provides, \u201cAll charges made or demanded for any service rendered, or to be rendered, shall be just, reasonable, and not more than the charges allowed by law or by order of the public utilities commission, and no unjust or unreasonable charge shall be made or demanded for, or in connection with, any service, or in excess of that allowed by law or by order of the commission.\u201d R.C. 4905.26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>allows \u201cany person, firm, or corporation\u201d to file a complaint with the commission against any public utility for any \u201crate\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d that \u201cis in any respect unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unjustly preferential, or in violation of law.\u201d R.C. 4905.22 and 4905.26 vest the commission with exclusive initial jurisdiction over the matters specified therein. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 16; <em>Illum. Co., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 18; <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 450-451, 727 N.E.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn construing these statutes, \u2018our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Heffelfinger v. Brunner, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-5838, 876 N.E.2d 1231, \u00b6 35, quoting <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. \u201cDetermining this intent requires us to read words and phrases in context and construe them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 11. A \u201ccharge\u201d is a \u201c[p]rice, cost, or expense\u201d and a \u201crate\u201d is \u201c[a]n amount paid or charged for a good or service.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 248 and 1289. A \u201cservice\u201d is \u201c[a]n intangible commodity in the form of human effort, such as labor, skill, or advice.\u201d Id. at 1399.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 22} Applying rules of grammar and common usage to R.C. 4905.22 and 4905.26, we conclude that Columbus Southern\u2019s compliance with the commission-approved tariff and its refusal to adhere to the conflicting Reynoldsburg ordinance and directive to pay the costs associated with the ordered relocation of its facilities resulted in a charge or rate to Reynoldsburg for the service of relocating the facilities. The tariff specifies an at-cost price to be charged to any municipality requiring that Columbus Southern use its labor and skill to relocate existing overhead general distribution lines underground.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 23} The city, which is a municipal corporation, claims, in effect, that Columbus Southern\u2019s charge is \u201cin excess of that allowed by law,\u201d i.e., the city\u2019s right-of-way ordinance. Because the city claims a violation of R.C. 4905.22, it should raise that claim by way of a complaint to the commission in accordance with R.C. 4905.26. Even if Columbus Southern had paid these relocation costs, the commission would have had exclusive, initial jurisdiction over any application by the utility to recover these costs. R.C. 4939.07(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 24} These relocation costs will affect the rates of either all Columbus Southern customers (if the utility is ordered to pay the costs) or those customers living in Reynoldsburg (if the city cannot recover its payment of the costs). In fact, the commission-approved tariff that Columbus Southern relies upon to claim that Reynoldsburg is liable for the relocation costs emanated from a commission <em>rate case, </em>and the relocation provision at issue is listed in the section in the tariff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>entitled \u201cTemporary and Special <em>Service.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Because the plain, unambiguous language of these statutes encompasses this dispute, we must apply the statutes as written. <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 25} Furthermore, in its declaratory-judgment action, Reynoldsburg, in effect, requests the common pleas court to declare invalid the commission-approved tariff absolving Columbus Southern from liability for the increased costs of relocating electrical lines underground as required by a municipality or other public authority. But only this court is authorized to review the commission\u2019s order approving the challenged provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cNo court other than the supreme court shall have the power to review, suspend, or delay any order made by the public utilities commission, or enjoin, restrain, or interfere with the commission or any public utilities commissioner in the performance of official duties. A writ of mandamus shall not be issued against the commission or any commissioner by any court other than the supreme court.\u201d R.C. 4903.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 27} As we held in <em>State ex rel. N. Ohio Tel. Co. v. Winter </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 6, 9-10, 52 O.O.2d 29, 260 N.E.2d 827, \u201c[o]nly [the Supreme Court of Ohio] has the power to review, suspend, delay, or restrain orders of the commission.\u201d Consequently, \u201c[a]n injunction issued by a Court of Common Pleas, which enjoins a public utility from following tariffs filed with and approved by the Public Utilities Commission, amounts to a review, suspension and delay of orders of the commission, and is a usurpation of authority.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c \u2018[I]t is readily apparent that <em>the General Assembly has provided for commission oversight of filed tariffs, </em>including the right to adjudicate complaints involving customer rates and services.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hull v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, </em>110 Ohio. St.3d 96, 2006-Ohio-3666, 850 N.E.2d 1190, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Kazmaier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 151, 573 N.E.2d 655. \u201cPublic utility tariffs are books or compilations of printed materials filed by public utilities with, and approved by, the commission that contain schedules of rates and charges, rules and regulations, and standards for service.\u201d <em>Migden-Ostrander v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 451, 2004-Ohio-3924, 812 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 8, fn. 5. Because Reynolds-burg\u2019s ordinance is in direct contravention of a previously existing, duly adopted tariff, which was approved by the commission following notice, hearing, and the intervention of other municipalities, the commission has the exclusive, initial jurisdiction over the city\u2019s claim, and we have jurisdiction over any appeal from the commission\u2019s final order. <em>Hull, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 96, 2006-Ohio-3666, 850 N.E.2d 1190, \u00b6 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Judge Fais\u2019s reliance on <em>Ashland v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(July 24, 1984), Ashland App. No. CA-811, 1984 WL 4970, and <em>Dayton Communications Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 302, 18 O.O.3d 478, 414 N.E.2d 1051, does not alter this conclusion. Ashland involved a pure contract issue, and <em>Dayton Communications </em>addressed a property-ownership issue. This case involves neither a contractual nor a property-ownership issue. Cf. <em>New Bremen v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 23, 30-31, 132 N.E. 162 (the Public Utilities Commission \u201chas no power to * * * adjudicate controversies between parties as to contract rights or property rights\u201d). Instead, this case involves whether Columbus Southern\u2019s attempted charge of relocation costs to Reynoldsburg, which was in accordance with the duly adopted commission tariff, is unlawful. Further, in <em>Dayton Communications, </em>it was the <em>commission </em>that exercised initial jurisdiction to determine whether it had jurisdiction over the competing claims of property ownership, one of which was based on a tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 30} The city erroneously cites <em>State ex rel. Columbus S. Power Co. v. Sheward </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 78, 585 N.E.2d 380, to claim that any constitutional challenge to the right-of-way ordinance can be raised by a declaratory-judgment action in common pleas court. In that case, the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that a public-utilities statute was unconstitutional. We emphasized that the plaintiffs were not attempting to \u201cinterfere with the commission\u2019s ratemaking authority\u201d and that a finding that the statute was unconstitutional \u201cwould impair no order or other authority of the commission.\u201d Id. at 80, 585 N.E.2d 380. By contrast, a finding that the Reynoldsburg ordinance here prevails over the tariff <em>would </em>impair the commission\u2019s order approving the tariff provision, which the commission made as part of a service provision in the context of a rate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, we have recognized that municipal home-rule issues may be resolved by this court in an appeal from an order of the commission. See, e.g., <em>Reading v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 193, 2006-Ohio-2181, 846 N.E.2d 840; <em>Maumee v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-7, 800 N.E.2d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 32} Based on the foregoing, the common pleas court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the utility\u2019s commission-approved tariff. The commission has the exclusive, original jurisdiction over this matter, subject to the ultimate review of this court. Therefore, we grant a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Fais from proceeding in the underlying declaratory-judgment case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b442-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would deny the writ and dismiss the cause.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AM4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Steven T.
