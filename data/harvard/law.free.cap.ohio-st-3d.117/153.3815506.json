Schlee was convicted of aggravated murder in 1993 and was sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 20 years. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed Schlee\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Schlee </em>(Dec. 23, 1994), Lake App. No. 93-L-082, 1994 WL 738452. We declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal. (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 1518, 649 N.E.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">{\u00b6 2} Schlee then filed two postconviction-relief petitions, both of which the trial court denied. Schlee appealed, and the court of appeals, after remanding the first petition for further findings, eventually affirmed the denial of both petitions. <em>State v. Schlee </em>(Dec. 17, 1999), Lake App. No. 98-L-187, 1999 WL 1313651; <em>State v. Schlee </em>(Sept. 22, 2000), Lake App. No. 99-L-112, 2000 WL 1387985. We declined to accept jurisdiction of either appeal. (2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1481, 727 N.E.2d 131; (2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 1428, 741 N.E.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">{\u00b6 3} Having exhausted all appeals and postconviction-relief proceedings, Schlee filed a motion for a new trial, which was granted. After a new trial in March 2004, Schlee was again convicted of aggravated murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 15 years. Schlee appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court. <em>State v. Schlee, </em>Lake App. No. 2004-L-070, 2005-Ohio-5117, 2005 WL 2372763. We declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal. 108 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2006-Ohio-665, 842 N.E.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">{\u00b6 4} On March 16, 2005, Schlee filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). Schlee alleged prosecutorial misconduct in both of his trials. He also alleged that he had been unconstitutionally subjected to double jeopardy. He requested reversal of his conviction and dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court treated Schlee\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion as a petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21 and dismissed the petition as untimely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>State v. Schlee, </em>Lake App. No. 2005-L-105, 2006-Ohio-3208, 2006 WL 1725869. We declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal, 111 Ohio St.3d 1432, 2006-Ohio-5351, 855 N.E.2d 497, but the Lake County Court of Appeals certified this case as being in conflict with the decision of the Hamilton County Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Lehrfeld, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030390, 2004-Ohio-2277, 2004 WL 1043795. We determined that a conflict existed. Ill Ohio St.3d 1429, 2006-Ohio-5351, 855 N.E.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 6} Accordingly, we now consider the following certified question: \u201cWhether the trial court can recast [appellant\u2019s Motion For Relief From Judgment as a petition for postconviction relief when it has been unambiguously presented as a Civil Rule 60(B) [motion].\u201d For the reasons that follow, we answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 7} Crim.R. 57(B) states, \u201cIf no procedure is specifically prescribed by rule, the court may proceed in any lawful manner not inconsistent with these rules of criminal procedure, and shall look to the rules of civil procedure and to the applicable law if no rule of criminal procedure exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 8} Civ.R. 60(B) allows relief from a judgment or order based on \u201cfraud * * *, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party,\u201d or \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the judgment.\u201d Civ.R. 60(B)(3) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 9} When a defendant in a criminal case files a Civ.R. 60(B) motion requesting relief from a judgment, how is a trial court to proceed? The courts of appeals in Ohio have crossed the intersection of Civ.R. 60(B) and Crim.R. 57(B) in both directions. See, e.g., <em>State v. Israfil </em>(Nov. 15, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 15572, 1996 WL 665006, *1 (\u201cCiv.R. 60(B) has no application to judgments in criminal cases\u201d); <em>State v. Johnson </em>(Jan. 17, 2002), Richland App. No. 01-CA-88, 2002 WL 110571, *1 (\u201cthe Civil Rules do not apply in criminal cases\u201d); <em>State v. Plassman, </em>Fulton App. No. F-03-017, 2004-Ohio-279, 2004 WL 103016, \u00b6 7 (\u201cCiv.R. 60(B) is available in criminal cases for certain procedures that were not anticipated by the criminal rules\u201d); <em>State v. Wooden, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-473, 2002-Ohio-7363, 2002 WL 31894921, \u00b6 8 (\u201cCrim.R. 57(B) permits a court to look to the rules of civil procedure if no applicable rule of criminal procedure exists\u201d). This split of authority is puzzling given the plain language of Crim.R. 57(B) that courts \u201cshall look to the rules of civil procedure * * * if no rule of criminal procedure exists.\u201d We would have thought that the clarity of that command would be impossible to miss if we had not made the same mistake ourselves. See <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Lake Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 104, 108, 556 N.E.2d 1120 (\u201cthis order was issued in a criminal case, and hence Civ.R. 65 does not apply\u201d). But see id. at 117, 556 N.E.2d 1120 (Douglas, J., concurring) (the majority\u2019s statement that Civ.R. 65 does not apply \u201cignores Crim.R. 57(B)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>{\u00b6 10} We had previously acknowledged that Crim.R. 57(B) allows courts to apply the Civil Rules in criminal proceedings. <em>State v. Lilliock </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 23, 25, 24 O.O.3d 64, 434 N.E.2d 723 (Crim.R. 57(B) \u201cdirects courts to the Civil Rules when no procedure is specifically prescribed by Criminal Rule\u201d); see also <em>State v. McGettrick </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 138, 141, 31 OBR 296, 509 N.E.2d 378, fn. 5 (Crim.R. 57(B) permits use of Civ.R. 25(A) for substitution of parties). Today we hold that the plain language of Crim.R. 57(B) permits a trial court in a criminal case to look to the Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance when no applicable Rule of Criminal Procedure exists. We therefore overrule <em>Natl. Broadcasting Co., </em>52 Ohio St.3d 104, 556 N.E.2d 1120, to the extent that it stands for a contrary proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 11} We must now consider whether Schlee properly resorted to Civ.R. 60(B) in this case, that is, whether the absence of an applicable Criminal Rule justified invoking a Civil Rule in its place. The state contends, and we agree, that Crim.R. 35, which sets forth the procedure by which criminal defendants can file petitions for postconviction relief, was available to Schlee and serves the same purpose as the Civ.R. 60(B) motion he filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 12} Schlee\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion was labeled a \u201cMotion For Relief From Judgment.\u201d Courts may recast irregular motions into whatever category necessary to identify and establish the criteria by which the motion should be judged. <em>State v. Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, citing <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 679 N.E.2d 1131. In <em>Reynolds, </em>we concluded that a motion styled \u201cMotion to Correct or Vacate Sentence\u201d met the definition of a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(1), because it was \u201c(1) filed subsequent to [the defendant\u2019s] direct appeal, (2) claimed a denial of constitutional rights, (3) sought to render the judgment void, and (4) asked for vacation of the judgment and sentence.\u201d Id. at 160, 679 N.E.2d 1131. The Civ.R. 60(B) motion filed by Schlee was filed subsequent to his direct appeal, claimed a denial of constitutional rights, and sought reversal of the judgment rendered against him. We conclude, therefore, that the Civ.R. 60(B) motion filed by Schlee could have been filed as a petition for postconviction relief. Thus, it is not necessary to look to the Civil Rules or other applicable law for guidance in the way Crim.R. 57(B) intends, because a procedure \u201cspecifically prescribed by rule\u201d exists, i.e., Crim.R. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 13} We recognize that some motions may not be recast by a trial court. In <em>Bush, </em>for example, the trial court treated the defendant\u2019s Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea as a petition for postconviction relief and denied it. <em>Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d at 236, 773 N.E.2d 522. The court of appeals affirmed, but we reversed, holding that \u201cR.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do not govern a Crim.R. 32.1 postsentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Postsentence motions to with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>draw guilty or no contest pleas and postconviction relief petitions exist independently.\u201d Id. at 239, 773 N.E.2d 522. The Civ.R. 60(B) motion filed in this case does not exist \u201cindependently\u201d from a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Crim.R. 35 and R.C. 2953.21.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AiQ\">Charles E. Coulson, Lake County Prosecuting Attorney, and Craig A. Swen-son, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A76Q\">Jones Day, Douglas R. Cole, Gene Crawford, and Erik J. Clark, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 14} We conclude that the trial court in this case did not err when it considered Schlee\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion as if it were a petition for postconviction relief. Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-8\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b253-9\">Lundberg Stratton and Cupp, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b253-10\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAd\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 15} I concur in the judgment of the court. I agree that the Civ.R. 60(B) motion filed by Schlee ought to have been filed as a petition for postconviction relief because Crim.R. 35 prescribes the attendant procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 16} However, I do not believe that trial courts \u2014 and specifically the trial court in this case \u2014 should \u201crecast\u201d motions that are clearly labeled. The motion filed by Schlee was not an \u201cirregular \u2018no-name\u2019 \u201d motion requiring the court to categorize it. <em>State v. Bush, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, \u00b6 10. Rather, it was specifically delineated as a Civ.R. 60(B) motion. In such situations, the proper course for a trial court, in my view, is to simply deny the motion as improper under the rules, with, if appropriate, an explanation for the denial. Such a practice would allow the filing party to refile the motion under the proper procedural rule and is more consistent with our disposition in <em>Bush.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">{\u00b6 17} Moreover, there may be some unintended, unwanted consequences resulting from a trial court\u2019s recasting of a motion. As appellant asserts, the trial court\u2019s actions may abridge due process protections or adversely affect federal habeas corpus proceedings. For these reasons, I would answer the certified question in the negative, but I would nonetheless affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-14\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ao8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>David H.
