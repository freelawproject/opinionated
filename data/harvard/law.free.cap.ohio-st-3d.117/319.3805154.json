Fulmer, was indicted on one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) and two counts of assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A). After trial to a jury, he was convicted on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">{\u00b6 2} In his ensuing appeal, the court of appeals concluded that the trial court \u201coverstepped the boundaries of its role by removing uncontested, relevant and probative evidence [about Fulmer\u2019s alleged medical condition] from the jury\u2019s consideration.\u201d <em>State v. Fulmer, </em>Lake App. No. 2005-L-137, 2006-Ohio-7015, 2006 WL 3833870, \u00b6 30. It reversed the convictions and remanded the cause for a new trial. Id. at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">{\u00b6 3} We accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal, <em>State v. Fulmer, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1512, 2007-Ohio-2208, 866 N.E.2d 511, which asserts a single proposition of law: \u201cWhen [defense] counsel elicits medical testimony regarding defendant\u2019s state of mind and makes a diminished capacity argument, the trial court is correct to instruct the jury that [it is] not to consider any evidence as to medical condition in determining that the defendant possesses the requisite mental state.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we agree with the state\u2019s proposition. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 4} On October 23, 2004, police responded to a 9-1-1 call from Fulmer\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e. She reported that after she ended her relationship with Fulmer, he told her he had taken \u201ca bottle of pills\u201d and that it \u201c[d]oesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d Notably, although Fulmer initially said that he had taken \u201ca bottle of pills,\u201d he also told her that he \u201cthrew up the pills.\u201d Thus, at the outset, there is a significant question whether Fulmer actually digested and metabolized any \u201cpills\u201d that he may have swallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 5} To the extent that there was any evidence of actual ingestion of a drug, the evidence at trial established only that Fulmer had taken three aspirin for proper therapeutic purposes. Indeed, he specifically denied being suicidal or taking any other medication and told emergency medical personnel that \u201call he took all day was three aspirin\u201d for preexisting back pain unrelated to his assault on the police or his ensuing arrest. There is no evidence in the record that warrants an inference, let alone a conclusion, that Fulmer took a bottle of aspirin or an overdose of any drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">{\u00b6 6} The evidence at trial was uncontroverted that when police arrived to assist Fulmer, they did not find a man who appeared physically injured or weakened. Nor did they find a man who was lethargic or withdrawn. Rather, they were confronted by a man who was belligerent and uncooperative, displayed \u201ca cocky demeanor,\u201d and used an \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cauthoritative\u201d voice to demand that they leave the premises. When the police properly refused to accede to his demands due to their concerns for his well-being and the safety of the public, Fulmer attempted to leave the scene and forcefully pushed an officer to make his escape. A melee ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 7} During the melee, Fulmer, who at the time of the incident was 39 years old, six feet, three inches tall, and weighed 250 pounds, punched one officer in the face, attempted to strike two others, and managed to secure an officer\u2019s flashlight and then strike him in the back of the head with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">{\u00b6 8} Police used pepper spray in an attempt to subdue Fulmer, but Fulmer continued his efforts to strike at officers with his closed fists. Even after Fulmer was taken to the ground by the police, he kicked one of the officers in the chest and shoulders. Ultimately, all three officers sustained injuries during the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">{\u00b6 9} The evidence also established that prior to and during the incident, Fulmer spoke at length on a cellular phone with his ex-fianc\u00e9e and that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>coherent and could understand the officers\u2019 commands. There is no suggestion that his hearing was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 10} After his arrest, Fulmer did not complain of any symptom indicative of an aspirin overdose, such as acidosis or stomach pain, to emergency medical technicians or at the emergency department at the hospital where he was evaluated and treated. His medical reports reveal that his physical examination was negative for headache, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, \u201cproblems urinating,\u201d and visual disturbances, and toxicology results did not show elevated levels of acetaminophen or aspirin in his bloodstream.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 11} In addition to the foregoing evidence, the jury heard the testimony of the state\u2019s expert witness, Dr. William Bligh-Glover. Dr. Bligh-Glover, a forensic pathologist, was called to establish the potential lethality of a blunt-force blow by a flashlight to the head. On both cross-examination and redirect examination, however, Dr. Bligh-Glover also testified about the effects of an aspirin overdose. Because of the importance of that testimony to the legal questions posed by this appeal, it is necessary to set it forth in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cQ. [COUNSEL FOR FULMER] Okay. Doctor, now I don\u2019t know if you know a little about his case, but you have done autopsies on suicide persons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cA. [DR. BLIGH-GLOVER] Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cQ. You know things, a lot of people you hear take aspirin, whatever, to kill themselves. Aspirin is capable of killing someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ. If taken in large enough doses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ. I think you noted, when we spoke earlier, you indicated a variety of things that manifests themselves as a result of aspirin overdose I guess it would be called?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. One of those thingfs] would be kidneys shutting off as a result of overdosing of some sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Kidney is one of the main problems that you have with misuse or overdose. You can [have] necrosis of the tips of the renal papillary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. Okay. What is the tips of the renal papillary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-17\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c * * * [Explanation by Dr. Bligh-Glover]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ. I think you did mention hyponatremia[ ] is something that may result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. Well, that\u2019s one thing. Another thing that can result from aspirin overdose is a change in the body\u2019s PH. Aspirin, the scientific name is acetylsali-cylic acid, aspirin is an acid drug and it can cause, I believe, metabolic derangement which forms metabolic acidosis which means the body\u2019s PH which should be neutral, goes too far in the acid range and that can cause difficulty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ. You mentioned hyponatremia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. Hyponatremia was brought up, I mentioned in terms of water intoxation [sic],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. Hyponatremia\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. Not involving the aspirin overdose, okay. I think I did mention hyponatremia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. Hyponatremia is something nobody wants. You would not want? When we spoke earlier you said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. I don\u2019t think anybody wants any metabolic derangement. So no I said you wouldn\u2019t want\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. The statement to me at least at the time, makes your brain cuckoo; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. Most metabolic derangement the brain looks like \u2014 for a proper brain to function, the brain should be fairly, essentially tight control, physiological state. With a derangement, what it means to me, be it a high temperature, be it too low a temperature; metabolic acidosis says the blood PH gets too low or too high and the brain doesn\u2019t work right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. I think [you] indicated sometimes breathing will be difficult with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. That\u2019s one of the things that is the brain isn\u2019t working right. It doesn\u2019t control breathing \u2014 versus heart beat, versus blood pressure, the consciousness, level of the consciousness as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-15\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. These are all things that you as a toxicologist \u2014 hyponatremia can be a serious medical condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-17\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. One of them that can make your brain go cuckoo I think is the way you put it in laymen\u2019s terms earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">{\u00b6 40} On redirect examination of Dr. Bligh-Glover, the state then elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-20\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. Now, you were asked a series of questions about consumption of aspirin. What was that condition that you called it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. We talked about many things. If you take too much aspirin you can \u2014 there is several medical conditions that can relate, A, would be metabolic acidosis, where the blood PH gets too acidic which would be too low. You can get kidney problems, other things can cause problems with aspirin, can lose hearing because it affects the eighth cranial nerve which lets you hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. Let\u2019s talk about those collectively. You mentioned acidosis, kidney problems, hearing problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. Do you have an opinion as to whether the consumption of three aspirin tablets over-the-counter source, taken by a man that weighs approximately 250 pounds, would result in the conditions that you just described to this jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. From an over-the-counter source, would that be the standard 325 milligrams of aspirin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ. Let\u2019s take the high one, 500?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. Aspirin isn\u2019t a large over-the-counter dosage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ. So what my question is: Do you have an opinion as to whether a 250-pound man, takes three aspirin tablets of 500 milligrams of aspirin, whether any of those conditions would result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. Yes. I have [an] opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ. Is that opinion to a reasonable level of scientific certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. What is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. <em>Those toxic conditions would not result actually for a person of 250 pounds taking three aspirin tablets, even extra strength. That\u2019s probably a good therapeutic dose.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cQ. What would your expectation be of a grown man of 250 pounds taken three aspirin, would you expect any of the conditions that you just outlined for this jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-17\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA. <em>I wouldn\u2019t, no. I would expect his headache to go away. Other than that, I don\u2019t expect any harm to come to him whatsoever.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">{\u00b6 57} No other medical or expert testimony was presented at trial regarding \u201cmetabolic derangement\u201d or the alleged effects of aspirin on the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-19\">{\u00b6 58} After the parties rested, but before closing arguments, the judge ruled that he would not instruct the jury on a diminished-capacity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-20\">{\u00b6 59} During summation, Fulmer\u2019s counsel stressed to the jury that, in order to convict, the jury must find that Fulmer acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d See R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>2903.11(A)(2) and 2903.13(A). Defense counsel may take some liberties in attacking the state\u2019s evidence during closing statements, see, e.g., <em>Pang v. Minch </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 194, 559 N.E.2d 1313, and it was not improper for Fulmer\u2019s counsel to argue that the state was required to establish that Fulmer had acted knowingly in order to prove the assault and felonious-assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 60} Here, however, counsel went over the line when he argued that the jury should consider the testimony of the physician in determining whether Fulmer knew what he was doing during the assaults and whether he had the right state of mind. Despite his protestations to the contrary, counsel was asserting a diminished-capacity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 61} The trial judge then properly instructed the jury, \u201c[t]he Defendant has not raised the defense of not guilty by reason of insanity, and as the State of Ohio does not recognize the partial defense of diminished capacity, you are not to consider any evidence as to low intelligence or the Defendant\u2019s medical condition in determining whether the Defendant possessed the requisite mental state, i.e., knowingly, during the commission of the alleged offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 62} The jury subsequently returned guilty verdicts. In light of the evidence here, and the law of Ohio, those verdicts should have been respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 63} The court of appeals, however, reversed. It held that the trial court had improperly instructed the jury that it could not consider any evidence relating to Fulmer\u2019s medical condition. In so doing, it overstated the evidence that was before the jury: \u201c[T]he evidence relating to appellant\u2019s alleged medical condition was relevant to his defense and probative of whether he could formulate the requisite intent to \u2018knowingly\u2019 assault the officers in question. Further, to the extent the state failed to object to its introduction, we see no basis for excluding it from the jury\u2019s deliberations. * * * On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony from Dr. Bligh-Glover that aspirin (i.e., the pills allegedly consumed by appellant), when taken in large enough doses, could impair if not kill an individual. Dr. Bligh-Glover testified that an aspirin overdose could change the body\u2019s PH level thereby causing a \u2018metabolic derangement.\u2019 Dr. Bligh-Glover stated that when one is under the stress of metabolic derangement, one\u2019s brain \u2018doesn\u2019t work right.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fulmer, </em>Lake App. No. 2005-L-137, 2006-Ohio-7015, 2006 WL 3833870, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 64} The court of appeals went on to conclude that the trial court \u201coverstepped the boundaries of its role by removing uncontested, relevant and probative evidence from the jury\u2019s consideration. Testimony indicated that as a result of consuming too much aspirin, appellant may have been biochemically imbalanced, i.e., in the parlance of Dr. Bligh-Glover, appellant may have been \u2018metabolically deranged.\u2019 This evidence is certainly relevant to whether appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>was capable of formulating the requisite intent to commit the crimes at issue.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">{\u00b6 65} The court of appeals is patently wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 66} Our jurisprudence definitively states that the partial defense of diminished capacity is not recognized in Ohio. <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 206, 61 O.O.2d 433, 291 N.E.2d 432; <em>State v. Wilcox </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 24 O.O.3d 284, 436 N.E.2d 523, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>State v. Wilcox, </em>we set forth our reasons for not adopting the diminished-capacity defense. We stated that \u201cthe diminished capacity theory forcefully challenges conventional concepts of culpability and \u2018involve[s] a fundamental change in the common law theory of responsibility.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 198, 24 O.O.3d 284, 436 N.E.2d 523, quoting <em>Fisher v. United States </em>(1946), 328 U.S. 463, 476, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382. Thus, when a defendant does not assert an insanity defense, it is well settled that he may not offer expert testimony in an effort to show that he lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime. <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 26, 544 N.E.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 68} Despite the clarity of our law, the court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the evidence of metabolic derangement from the jury\u2019s consideration. It erroneously held that the evidence was relevant and probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 69} Dr. Bligh-Glover\u2019s testimony was not relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration, because, as the trial court and the dissenting judge on the court of appeals correctly recognized, Ohio law does not permit the jury to consider a defendant\u2019s alleged diminished capacity. Here, Fulmer\u2019s counsel suggested \u201ca functional equivalent\u201d of a diminished-capacity defense. <em>State v. Fulmer, </em>Lake App. No. 2005-L-137, 2006-Ohio-7015, 2006 WL 3833870, \u00b6 42 (Westcott Rice, J., dissenting). It was not proper to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">{\u00b6 70} In cases in which a defendant asserts the functional equivalent of a diminished-capacity defense, the trial court should instruct the jury to disregard the evidence used to support that defense unless the defendant can demonstrate that the evidence is relevant and probative for purposes other than a diminished-capacity defense. Here, there was no such showing, and the trial court properly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">{\u00b6 71} Even if the diminished-capacity defense were viable in Ohio, the evidence before this jury could not support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">{\u00b6 72} In <em>State v. Melchior </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 15, 20, 10 O.O.3d 8, 381 N.E.2d 195, we held that in order for a defendant to properly raise an affirmative defense, \u201c \u2018evidence of a nature and quality sufficient to raise the issue must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>introduced, from whatever source the evidence may come.\u2019 Evidence is sufficient where a reasonable doubt of guilt has arisen based upon a claim of the defense.\u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 103, 111-112, 1 O.O.3d 61, 351 N.E.2d 88. We expressly cautioned, however, that \u201c[i]f the evidence generates only a mere speculation or possible doubt, such evidence is insufficient to raise the affirmative defense, and submission of the issue to the jury will be unwarranted.\u201d Id. Moreover, the trial judge is in the best position to gauge the evidence before the jury and is provided the discretion to determine whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to require an instruction. <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 73} Although metabolic derangement is a real condition with real consequences, the evidence did not demonstrate that it occurred here. Thus, the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Bligh-Glover\u2019s general testimony on that condition was \u201crelevant, probative evidence\u201d in this case is also in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 74} Fulmer asserts that the evidence was relevant and probative because \u201c[d]efense counsel was trying to convey to the jury that Mr. Fulmer suffered from a temporary medical condition and because of that medical condition he could not act \u2018knowingly.\u2019 \u201d But Fulmer offered nothing to establish what relevance the alleged \u201ctemporary medical condition\u201d would have in the case given that Ohio law does not recognize diminished-capacity defenses and that he did not assert an insanity defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 75} To be probative, the evidence of metabolic derangement had to be linked to Fulmer at the time of his assaults on the officers. No such connection was established at trial. At best, there was only mere possibility, speculation, and surmise that Fulmer may have been suffering from that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 76} The only witness qualified to render an opinion that Fulmer was afflicted with metabolic derangement was Dr. Bligh-Glover.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His testimony on cross-examination provided nothing to the jury other than his acknowledgement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that metabolic derangement can occur in cases in which a human takes an overdose of aspirin. The only fair interpretation of Dr. Bligh-Glover\u2019s testimony \u2014 the <em>sole </em>evidence upon which the appellate court relied in reversing the verdicts \u2014 was that his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was that Fulmer did <em>not </em>suffer from metabolic derangement.

Thus, Dr. Bligh-Glover did not support Fulmer\u2019s theory of metabolic derangement, and the judge properly instructed the jury not to consider that evidence in determining whether Fulmer had acted knowingly during his assault on the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">{\u00b6 77} Notably, there is not a scintilla of other evidence to support a finding that Fulmer was metabolically deranged at the time of his assault on the officers. His ability to engage three police officers in battle for several minutes, and to cause injury to them, is not consistent with a man who was suffering from acidosis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> kidney problems, or any other physical impairment. He did not suggest to the emergency medical personnel or medical staff at the hospital that he was suffering from any symptom indicative of acidosis or kidney dysfunction, nor do his medical records provide any evidence of those afflictions. He was clearly able to hear the officers\u2019 commands and to converse, at length, over the phone with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, and there is no indication in his medical records that his hearing was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 78} Upon review of the evidence presented at trial, reasonable minds could only conclude that Fulmer did not establish that he was metabolically deranged or otherwise unable to act \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 79} The court of appeals\u2019 decision misconstrued the law of Ohio and its application to the facts of this case. The decision below unfortunately injected doubt into an area of law where there should be none. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 decision and remand this cause to that court to consider Fulmer\u2019s remaining claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-8\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b423-9\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent and would dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ArJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Charles E.

The trial court found \u2014 and Fulmer does not suggest otherwise here \u2014 that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a \u201cblackout\u201d instruction to the jury or that his level of cognitive functioning-precluded him from acting \u201cknowingly.\u201d Nor is there an assertion before us that Fulmer\u2019s use of aspirin was the equivalent of a voluntary-intoxication defense that Ohio law sometimes permits. See <em>State v. Fox </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 53, 22 O.O.3d 259, 428 N.E.2d 410, at syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\">. In fn. 3 in its opinion, the court of appeals cited dicta from <em>Wilcox </em>in which we noted, \u201c \u2018Unlike the notion of partial or relative insanity, conditions such as intoxication, medication, epilepsy, infancy, or senility are, in varying degrees, susceptible to quantification or objective demonstration, and to lay understanding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilcox, 70 </em>Ohio St.2d at 194, 24 O.O.3d 284, 436 N.E.2d 523, quoting <em>Bethea v.

Although the average juror is likely well aware of the typical effects of aspirin on the body, it is not clear that the average juror \u2014 or judge\u2014 understands the effects of an overdose of aspirin or metabolic derangement without the aid of a medical or scientific expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">.
