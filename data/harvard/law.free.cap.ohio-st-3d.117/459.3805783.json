R.C. 1343.03(A) states that the interest rate on a book account shall be the statutory rate set forth in R.C. 5703.47 \u201cunless a written contract provides a different rate of interest.\u201d Today we hold that notations on invoices and account statements setting forth an interest rate do not constitute a \u201cwritten contract\u201d for purposes of R.C. 1343.03(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The Meyer Case</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee and cross-appellant, Minster Farmers Cooperative Exchange Company, Inc. (\u201cMinster Farmers\u201d), is in the business of selling agricultural supplies. Appellant and cross-appellee, Roger Meyer, maintained a commercial account with Minster Farmers beginning in 1988, purchasing primarily feed, fertilizer, and miscellaneous farm supplies. From the beginning, Minster Farmers assessed a finance charge on Meyer\u2019s account. It claims that in January 1998, it informed customers by letter that it was increasing its finance charge from 1.5 percent to two percent per month, 24 percent annually. Meyer denies receiving that letter. However, on subsequent invoices, language such as the following appeared: \u201cNet due last day of the month. 2% finance charge per month after 30 days.\u201d None of the invoices contain Meyer\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 3} Meyer complained to Minster Farmers employees Brian Heitkamp and Neal Wiedeman in 2001 about the interest Minster Farmers was charging on his invoices. He also wrote a letter to Minster Farmers\u2019 attorney on May 12, 2003, in which he stated that the amount Minster Farmers claimed that he owed was not correct \u201cbecause they charged me as high as 30% interest, which I brought to their attention but Brian Heitkamp and Neal didn\u2019t want to do anything about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 4} In February 2005, Minster Farmers filed a complaint against Meyer seeking $51,374.89 for the unpaid balance on his account. Meyer asserted that Minster Farmers was limited to recovering interest from Meyer at the statutory prejudgment interest rate set forth in R.C. 1343.03, not the 24 percent annual rate it charged him. Meyer also asserted that even if the 24 percent rate were acceptable, Minster Farmers incorrectly compounded the interest on a monthly basis, resulting in each monthly interest charge being added to the principal balance, giving Minster Farmers interest upon interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 5} Minster Farmers moved for summary judgment. On October 13, 2005, the trial court granted summary judgment to Minster Farmers, finding that R.C. 1302.10, which provides that a written confirmation operates as an acceptance even though it states additional or different terms, controlled the case. The trial court found that Meyer\u2019s reliance on R.C. 1343.03(A)(1) was \u201cmisplaced because the instant transaction was between merchants governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, who have bargained for this finance charge provision.\u201d The trial court found that \u201cthere was a contract between [Meyer] and [Minster Farmers] regarding the finance charges to which [Meyer] is legally bound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 6} Meyer filed a motion for reconsideration on October 28, 2005, only as to the compounding issue, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Meyer appealed. On April 17, 2006, the Third District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision in part, holding that the terms of the invoice established a written contract and that the trial court did not err in applying an interest rate above the statutory rate provided in R.C. 5703.47. Meyer appeals that aspect of the appellate court\u2019s ruling. The court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the compounding of interest. Minster Farmers cross-appeals that aspect of the appellate court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 8} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The Dues Case</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant and cross-appellee, Robert Dues, maintained a commercial account with Minster Farmers, purchasing primarily fuel, dairy-cattle feed, and miscellaneous farm supplies. Minster Farmers always assessed a finance charge to Dues\u2019s account; at some point after January 1998, Minster Farmers\u2019 invoices and delivery tickets noted that interest would be charged at the rate of two percent per month, 24 percent annually. The parties stipulated at trial that Dues never signed any of the invoices for feed setting forth that interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 10} Minster Farmers sued Dues for $37,837.58, the unpaid amount remaining on his account. Dues did not dispute that he had purchased the various items stated on the account, but did dispute that Minster Farmers could charge his account the interest as set forth in the itemized account. On October 14, 2005, the trial court ruled in favor of Minster Farmers, for the same reasons as it had in the <em>Meyer </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 11} Dues appealed. On April 17, 2006, the Third District Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part on the same basis on which it had decided the <em>Meyer </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">{\u00b6 12} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 1343.03(A) sets a maximum rate of interest that may be charged on a book account:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIn cases other than those provided for in sections 1343.01 and 1343.02 of the Revised Code, when money becomes due and payable upon * * * any book account, * * * the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate per annum determined pursuant to section 5703.47 of the Revised Code, unless a written contract provides a different rate of interest in relation to the money that becomes due and payable, in which case the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate provided in that contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>{\u00b6 15} (During some of the relevant time period, former R.C. 1343.03(A) itself declared a limit of ten percent instead of referring to R.C. 5703.47. 139 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2034.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 16} No party disputes that the accounts at issue in these cases are book accounts. \u201cAn open book account is a detailed statement that constitutes the principal record of the transactions between the creditor and debtor arising out of a contract or fiduciary relationship. The statement details the debits and credits in connection with the debtor/creditor relationship.\u201d <em>Cusano v. Klein </em>(C.A.9, 2001), 264 F.3d 936, 942, fn. 2. A book account \u201c \u2018begins with a balance, preferably at zero, or with a sum recited that can qualify as an account stated, but at least the balance should be a provable sum. Following the balance, the item or items, dated and identifiable by number or otherwise, representing charges, or debits, and credits, should appear. Summarization is necessary showing a running or developing balance or an arrangement which permits the calculation of the balance claimed to be due.\u2019 \u201d <em>Asset Acceptance Corp. v. Proctor, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 60, 2004-Ohio-623, 804 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Brown v. Columbus Stamping &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(1967), 9 Ohio App.2d 123, 126, 38 O.O.2d 143, 223 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 17} The accounts at issue meet the definition and requirements of book accounts, and thus R.C. 1343.03(A) applies. R.C. 1343.03(A) is a specific statute addressing the maximum rate of interest that may be charged on a book account absent a written contract establishing a different interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 18} Minster Farmers urges that R.C. 1302.10, not R.C. 1343.03(A), controls this case. R.C. 1302.10, which codifies a portion of the Uniform Commercial Code, provides that a written confirmation of an agreement between merchants sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states additional or different terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(A) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation that is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">(\u00b6 20} \u201c(B) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants, the terms become part of the contract unless one of the following applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(1) The offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(2) They materially alter it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(3) Notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>{124} Minster Farmers argues that the finance charges set forth on delivery slips and invoices constituted additional terms that Meyer and Dues accepted\u2014 through failure to object to them within a reasonable time \u2014 and became terms of the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 25} When statutes conflict, the more specific provision controls over the more general provision. R.C. 1.51. R.C. 1302.10 addresses generally how provisions may be added to a contract. R.C. 1343.03(A) specifically establishes how parties can agree to an interest rate higher than the maximum allowed under R.C. 5703.47. R.C. 1343.03(A) requires a written contract, not simply an additional term added to an invoice and met without resistance by another party, to establish an interest rate greater than that set forth in R.C. 5703.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 26} Thus, R.C. 1343.03(A) is the statute that Minster Farmers must satisfy. That is, it could not collect from Meyer and Dues the interest rate it claims is due unless that rate had been set forth in a \u201cwritten contract.\u201d The appellate court held that the terms of the invoices established a written contract sufficient to satisfy R.C. 1343.03(A). The court based its decision on an earlier holding from the Third District Court of Appeals in <em>Champaign Landmark, Inc. v. McCullough </em>(Nov. 27, 1990), 3d Dist. No. 6-89-17, 1990 WL 188002. In <em>Champaign Landmark, </em>the court\u2019s decision was based largely on the fact that the defendant had established that he was aware of the credit policy in place; the trial court had found \u201cmost enlightening\u201d a letter written by the defendant to the plaintiffs credit manager, which the court said \u201cin effect admitted the existence and validity of the credit policy and did not dispute either the validity of the claim or the amount claimed.\u201d The trial court found that in the letter in question, the \u201cdefendant arbitrarily reduced the amount of interest to 14% due to \u2018drought and resulting low yields\u2019 and the fact that he could not afford to pay.\u201d There is no such letter in evidence \u201cadmitting] the existence and validity of the credit policy\u201d in either of the cases before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 27} Regardless, we agree with the view put forth by the clear majority of Ohio appellate courts that have addressed the question whether invoices can serve as the written contract required by R.C. 1343.03(A). Those courts have written that \u201cin order for a written contract to exist for purposes of R.C. 1343.03(A), there must be a writing to which both parties have assented. * * * An invoice or monthly statement does not constitute such a writing.\u201d <em>WC Milling, L.L.C. v. Grooms, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 45, 2005-Ohio-5420, 841 N.E.2d 324, \u00b6 20, citing <em>Yager Materials, Inc. v. Marietta Indus. Ents., Inc. </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 233, 235-236, 687 N.E.2d 505; see also <em>Hobart Bros. Co. v. Welding Supply Serv., Inc. </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 142, 144, 21 OBR 152, 486 N.E.2d 1229; <em>Olander &amp; Brophy v. Northeastern Pools </em>(Jan. 7, 1991), Stark App. No. CA-8219, 1991 WL 6268; <em>Kut Kwick Corp. v. N. Dixie Parts &amp; Servs., Inc. </em>(Apr. 21, 1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Montgomery App. No. CA10678, 1988 WL 38130; <em>Bunnell Elec., Inc. v. Ameriwash, </em>Warren App. No. CA2004-01-009, 2005-Ohio-2502, 2005 WL 1201563; <em>Yuhanick v. Cooper </em>(Mar. 14, 2001), Columbiana App. No. 99 CO 37, 2001 WL 274545. In <em>Scotts Co. v. Cent. Garden &amp; Pet Co. </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 403 F.3d 781, 791, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, too, held that invoices setting forth an interest rate \u201cdid not meet the written-contract requirement of [R.C.] 1343.03(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 28} We agree that an invoice or account statement unilaterally stating interest terms does not meet R.C. 1343.03\u2019s requirement of a written contract. \u201cAn invoice, as such, is no contract. An invoice is a mere detailed statement of the nature, quantity and the cost or price of the things invoiced.\u201d <em>Tanenbaum Textile Co., Inc. v. Schlanger </em>(1942), 287 N.Y. 400, 404, 40 N.E.2d 225, citing <em>Sturm v. Boker </em>(1893), 150 U.S. 312, 328, 14 S.Ct. 99, 37 L.Ed. 1093. By stating interest terms on invoices or account statements, Minster Farmers made no attempt to condition the acceptance of orders on Meyer\u2019s or Dues\u2019s agreement to Minster Farmers\u2019 interest rate terms; instead, it tried to unilaterally impose those terms after the fact. \u201c \u2018A contract is generally defined as a promise, or a set of promises, actionable upon breach. Essential elements of a contract include an offer, acceptance, contractual capacity, consideration (the bargained for legal benefit and/or detriment), a manifestation of mutual assent and legality of object and of consideration.\u2019 <em>Perlmuter Printing Co. v. Strome, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1976), 436 F.Supp. 409, 414. A meeting of the minds as to the essential terms of the contract is a requirement to enforcing the contract. <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 366, 369, 575 N.E.2d 134.\u201d <em>Kostelnik v. Helper, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-2985, 770 N.E.2d 58, \u00b6 16. Minster Farmers\u2019 placement of an interest rate on invoices constituted no promise by Meyer or Dues and demonstrated no meeting of the minds between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 29} Since the interest rate Minster Farmers seeks to impose was not a term of a written contract, Minster Farmers was limited by R.C. 1343.03(A) to charging the amount of interest set forth in R.C. 5703.47. Minster Farmers\u2019 claim to interest charged above that rate is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 30} We limit the effect of our decision to these cases and to transactions arising in the future. As recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Great N. Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co. </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 358, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360, state courts have broad authority to determine whether then-decisions shall operate prospectively only. <em>OAMCO v. Lindley </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 1, 29 OBR 122, 503 N.E.2d 1388, syllabus. \u201cConsistent with what has been termed the <em>Sunburst </em>Doctrine, state courts have * * * recognized and used prospective application of a decision as a means of avoiding injustice in cases dealing with questions having widespread ramifications for persons not parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the action.\u201d <em>Hoover v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 1, 9, 19 OBR 1, 482 N.E.2d 575 (Douglas, J., concurring). We do not intend for this decision to create shock waves throughout the many sectors of Ohio\u2019s economy that rely on book accounts to do business, nor do we wish to encourage a propagation of pleadings regarding past practices. This decision establishes the proper method for implementing interest rates exceeding the statutory maximum on a book account pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(A) in these two cases and for transactions occurring after the date of this decision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AR7\">Michael A.
