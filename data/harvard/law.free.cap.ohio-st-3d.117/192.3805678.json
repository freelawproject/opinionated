For the reasons that follow, we answer the certified questions by holding that R.C. 4123.93, 4123.931, 2305.10(C), and former 2305.10(F) (now (G)) are all facially constitutional on the challenges to those statutes asserted in this case. However, we determine that Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution (the ban on retroactive laws) prevents R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) from applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to the specific facts of this case. We therefore uphold an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to those statutes and invalidate former R.C. 2305.10(F) in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">A. The Certification Order and the Questions to Be Answered</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 2} The federal district court\u2019s initial certification order reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThere are issues of Ohio law that may be determinative of the present case and for which there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Therefore, this Court finds it appropriate to certify questions of Ohio law to the Supreme Court of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">\u201cA. NAME OF THE CASE AND NAMES OF ALL PARTIES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe name of this case is <em>Douglas Groch, et al. v. General Motors Corporation, et al. </em>case number 3:06-CV-1604. The parties in this case are: Plaintiffs Douglas Groch and Chloe Groch versus Defendants General Motors Corporation, Kard Corporation and Racine Federated, Inc. The Attorney General of Ohio is a party for purposes of defending the constitutionality of the Ohio statutes at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">\u201cB. BRIEF STATEMENT OF FACTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Amended Complaint alleges the following: Plaintiff Douglas Groch (\u2018Groch\u2019) was injured on March 3, 2005 when the trim press he was operating came down on his right arm and wrist. At the time of his injury Plaintiff Douglas Groch was acting in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant General Motors Corporation. The trim press that he was using was manufactured by Defendants Kard Corporation and Racine Federated, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cGroch brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Lucas County, Ohio seeking damages from Defendant General Motors Corporation (\u2018GM\u2019) based on a theory of employer intentional tort and from Defendants Kard Corporation and Racine Federated, Inc. (respectively, \u2018Kard\u2019 and \u2018Racine\u2019) based on a theory of product liability. Plaintiff Chloe Groch (\u2018Chloe\u2019) sought damages for loss of consortium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe action was removed to federal court by GM. Federal jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. 1332 because there is diversity between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-15\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cGM has asserted a subrogation interest in Groch\u2019s recovery for its payment to him of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Groch asserts that the Ohio statutes granting GM subrogation interests \u2014 R.C. 4123.93 and R.C. 4123.931\u2014 are unconstitutional. To fully adjudicate this matter and determine the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and liabilities of each party, this Court needs a determination by the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of the statutes under the Ohio Constitution. The Supreme Court of Ohio has not yet had opportunity to issue a decision on the constitutionality of R.C. 4123.93 and R.C. 4123.931, passed as Senate Bill 227 and made effective in April 2003. Therefore, this Court certifies questions 1 through 3 to the Supreme Court of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cKard and Racine assert that they are immune from liability based on the statute of repose for products liability claims provided at R.C. 2305.10. To fully adjudicate this matter and fully determine the rights and liabilities of each party, this Court needs a determination by the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of the statutes under the Ohio Constitution. The Supreme Court of Ohio has not yet had opportunity to issue a decision on the constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10, passed as Senate Bill 80, and made effective in April, 2005. Therefore this Court certifies [an additional five questions] to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 10} Shortly after issuing that order, the district court issued an amended order that certified an additional ninth question regarding the constitutionality of 2004 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 11} This court reviewed the parties\u2019 preliminary memoranda and determined that it would answer all nine certified questions, numbering them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c1. Do the statutes allowing subrogation for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931, violate the takings clause, Article I, Section 19, of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 13} <em>\u201c2. </em>Do R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 violate the due process and remedies clause, Article I, Section 16, of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c3. Do R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 violate the equal protection clause, Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c4. Do R.C. 2305.10(C) and (F) violate the open courts provision of Article I, Section 16, of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c5. Do R.C. 2305.10(C) and (F) violate the takings clause, Article I, Section 19, of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c6. Do R.C. 2305.10(C) and (F) violate the due process and remedies clause, Article I, Section 16, of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c7. Do R.C. 2305.10(C) and (F) violate the equal protection clause, Article I, Section 2, of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c8. Do R.C. 2305.10(C) and (F) violate the ban on retroactive laws, Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201c9. Does Senate Bill 80 violate the one-subject rule, Article II, Section 15, of the Ohio Constitution?\u201d 112 Ohio St.3d 1416, 2006-Ohio-6712, 859 N.E.2d 556.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 21} Plaintiffs Douglas and Chloe Groch are the petitioners in this matter. The respondents are defendants General Motors Corporation, Kard Corporation, and Racine Federated, Inc., and the state of Ohio, represented by the attorney general. A number of amicus curiae briefs ably support their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">B. Introduction of Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 22} The first three questions focus on whether the General Assembly\u2019s statutory response to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111, which held the previous workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute unconstitutional, complies with several cited provisions of the Ohio Constitution. These questions are answered in Part II of this opinion. The next five questions focus on the constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10, the statute of repose for products-liability actions, enacted as part of the tort-reform legislation of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 80 of the 125th General Assembly (\u201cS.B. 80\u201d), effective April 7, 2005. These five questions, along with the ninth question concerning whether S.B. 80 violates the one-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution, are answered in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 23} This court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, is useful in setting the stage. <em>Arbino </em>provides extensive background and establishes some important concepts that play a significant role in resolving the final six questions. Therefore, a brief review of <em>Arbino </em>is in order at this point, with more extensive consideration in Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 24} <em>Arbino, </em>like the present case, was before this court on certified questions from a federal district court. In <em>Arbino, </em>we resolved questions on the constitutionality of two tort-reform statutes enacted by S.B. 80 \u2014 R.C. 2315.18, limiting noneconomic damages in tort actions, and R.C. 2315.21, limiting punitive damages in tort actions. Before analyzing the facial constitutional challenges, this court reiterated the well-established standard of review, stating at \u00b6 25:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIt is difficult to prove that a statute is unconstitutional. All statutes have a strong presumption of constitutionality. See <em>Sorrell [v. Thevenir </em>(1994) ], 69 Ohio St.3d [415] at 418-419, 633 N.E.2d 504. Before a court may declare unconstitutional an enactment of the legislative branch, \u2018it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">{\u00b6 26} In addition, a party raising a facial challenge must demonstrate that there is no set of circumstances in which the statute would be valid. <em>Arbino </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u00b6 26, citing <em>Harrold v. Collier, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 44, 2005-Ohio-5334, 836 N.E.2d 1165, \u00b6 37, and <em>United States v. Salerno </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697. \u201c \u2018The fact that a statute might operate unconstitutionally under some plausible set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Harrold </em>at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b627} These considerations apply to most of the certified questions in this case. However, petitioners also raise an \u201cas applied\u201d constitutional challenge in one of the certified questions, which is governed by a different standard, and which we will address in Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Constitutionality of R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111, this court held that former R.C. 4123.931, a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute enacted in 1995, was unconstitutional on a number of grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After our decision in <em>Holeton, </em>the General Assembly repealed the 1995 statutes and enacted the subrogation statutes at issue in this case in 2002 Sub.S.B. No. 227. 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3716. The statutes became effective on April 9, 2003. See <em>Modzelewski v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 192, 2004-Ohio-2365, 808 N.E.2d 381, \u00b6 7, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">{\u00b6 29} Five days after S.B. 227\u2019s effective date, a mandamus action challenging the constitutionality of the subrogation statutes at issue here was filed in the Tenth District Court of Appeals. In <em>State ex rel. United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., 108 </em>Ohio St.3d 432, 2006-Ohio-1327, 844 N.E.2d 335, we affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing the complaint in mandamus because the relator had adequate remedies by way of declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction. Id. at \u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>United Auto., </em>this court discussed the statute held unconstitutional in <em>Holeton </em>and summarized that decision at \u00b6 2-13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cUnder R.C. 4123.931(A), the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u2018creates a right of recovery in favor of a statutory subrogee against a third party, and the statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party.\u2019 The \u2018statutory subrogee\u2019 is \u2018the administrator of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation, a self-insuring employer, or an employer that contracts for the direct payment of medical services.\u2019 R.C. 4123.93(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cFormer R.C. 4123.931(A) specified: \u2018A statutory subrogee\u2019s subrogation interest includes * * * estimated future values of compensation and medical benefits arising out of an injury to or disability or disease of a claimant.\u2019 See 1995 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 278,146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3596.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cFormer R.C. 4123.931(D) further provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c \u2018The entire amount of any settlement or compromise of an action or claim is subject to the subrogation right of a statutory subrogee, regardless of the manner in which the settlement or compromise is characterized. Any settlement or compromise that excludes the amount of compensation or medical benefits shall not preclude a statutory subrogee from enforcing its rights under this section. The entire amount of any award or judgment is presumed to represent compensation and medical benefits and future estimated values of compensation and medical benefits that are subject to a statutory subrogee\u2019s subrogation rights unless the claimant obtains a special verdict or jury interrogatories indicating that the award or judgment represents different types of damages.\u2019 Id. at 3596-3597.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cIn June 2001, in <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 135, 748 N.E.2d 1111, we held that former R.C. 4128.931 [sic, 4123.931] violated Sections 2, 16, and 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cMore specifically, we held: \u2018By giving the subrogee a current collectible interest in estimated future expenditures, [former] R.C. 4123.931(A) creates the conditions under which a prohibited taking may occur. This would happen in those situations where the amount of reimbursement for \u201cestimated future values of compensation and medical benefits\u201d proves to be substantially greater than the subrogee\u2019s eventual compensation outlay. In other words, [former] R.C. 4123.931(A) requires the claimant to reimburse the bureau or self-insuring employer for future benefits that the claimant may never receive. In that event, the statute operates not to prevent the claimant from keeping a double recovery but to provide the statutory subrogee with a windfall at the expense of the claimant\u2019s tort recovery.\u2019 Id. at 123, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cIn addition, we held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c \u2018[Former] R.C. 4123.931(D) establishes a procedural framework under which an unconstitutional taking of the claimant\u2019s property or a denial of remedy by due course of law can occur. This framework distinguishes between third-party claims that are tried and third-party claims that are settled. In the case where an award or judgment is rendered in the third-party action, [former] R.C. 4123.931(D) allows the claimant to obtain jury interrogatories segregating dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ages that do not represent workers\u2019 compensation or medical benefits and, therefore, are not subject to the reimbursement right of the statutory subrogee. In contrast, the entire amount of any settlement or compromise is deemed subject to the reimbursement right of the statutory subrogee, and the claimant is precluded, under any circumstances, from showing that his or her settlement or portions thereof do not represent or duplicate workers\u2019 compensation or medical benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c \u2018 * * * [Former] R.C. 4123.931(D) operates unconstitutionally * * * because it allows for reimbursement from proceeds that do not constitute a double recovery.\u2019 Id., 92 Ohio St.3d at 125-126, 748 N.E.2d 1111; see, also, <em>Modzelewski v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 192, 2004-Ohio-2365, 808 N.E.2d 381, holding former R.C. 4123.93 unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cIn <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 135, 748 N.E.2d 1111, despite holding the statute unconstitutional, we expressly noted that workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statutes are not per se unconstitutional and that we were addressing only the specific provisions in former R.C. 4123.931:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c \u2018We hold * * * that [former] R.C. 4123.931 does violate Sections 2, 16, and 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. In so holding, we do not accept the proposition that a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional, and nothing in this opinion shall be construed to prevent the General Assembly from ever enacting such a statute. We hold only that [former] R.C. 4123.931, in its present form, is unconstitutional.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cWe also recognized that \u2018virtually every jurisdiction provides some statutory mechanism enabling the employer or fund to recover its workers\u2019 compensation outlay from a third-party tortfeasor.\u2019 Id. at 120, 748 N.E.2d 1111.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">{If 43} <em>United Auto., 108 </em>Ohio St.3d 432, 2006-Ohio-1327, 844 N.E.2d 335, at \u00b6 14-17, also cogently summarized current R.C. 4123.931:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cFollowing <em>Holeton, </em>the General Assembly enacted 2002 Sub.S.B.

The statutory subrogee would receive \u2018an amount equal to the subrogation interest divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered.\u2019 Id.

The other statute at issue, R.C. 4123.93, defines terms appearing in R.C. 4123.931.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">A. The Takings Clause and the Due Process and Remedies Clauses (Section 19, Article I, and Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 49} The first certified question is whether the subrogation statutes violate Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, which provides, \u201cPrivate property shall ever be held inviolate, but subservient to the public welfare. * * * [Wjhere private property shall be taken for public use, a compensation therefor shall first be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 50} Section 19 requires that \u201c \u2018legislation must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must confer upon the public a benefit commensurate with its burdens upon private property.\u2019\u201d <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 121, 748 N.E.2d 1111, quoting <em>Direct Plumbing Supply Co. v.

VerMeulen </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 47, 512 N.E.2d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">{\u00b6 53} This court has recognized the \u201cdue course of law\u201d aspect of Section 16, Article I as the equivalent of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 54} The <em>Holeton </em>court determined that the former subrogation statute violated Section 19, Article I and that an improper taking had occurred, because the \u201cestimated future values\u201d provision of the statute too often gave the statutory subrogee a windfall. Id., 92 Ohio St.3d at 123, 748 N.E.2d 1111. The <em>Holeton </em>court reviewed several scenarios in which the statute required the claimant to reimburse the subrogee for future benefits that would never be received. Id. at 123-124, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 55} The <em>Holeton </em>court additionally held that the former subrogation statute violated the takings, right-to-a-remedy, and due-process provisions by forcing the claimant to fully reimburse the subrogee in many situations in which the claimant had not been made whole. For instance, the statute required full reimbursement when the claimant settled with a tortfeasor for the limits of an insurance policy and thus was not made whole even when workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the settlement amount were combined, and even when the settlement included damages that should not have been reimbursable. Id. at 126, 748 N.E.2d 1111. In reaching this conclusion, the court considered that while the former statute allowed a successful plaintiff to submit jury interrogatories to reduce the subro-gee\u2019s right to reimbursement, the plaintiff who settled with the tortfeasor was required to fully reimburse the subrogee with no opportunity to show that full reimbursement was unwarranted. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">1. Subrogation Recovery of Estimated Future Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 56} As mentioned above, after <em>Holeton </em>determined that the former subrogation statute unconstitutionally allowed a statutory subrogee to take a claimant\u2019s estimated future benefits, the General Assembly responded by allowing the claimant to establish an interest-bearing trust account. R.C. 4123.931(E)(1). Using this trust account, the claimant reimburses the subrogee periodically for amounts paid upon the claimant\u2019s behalf. R.C. 4123.931(E)(3). R.C. 4123.931(E)(1) provides that once the statutory subrogee\u2019s duty to pay ends and full reimbursement has occurred, any money remaining in the account shall be \u201cpaid to the claimant or the claimant\u2019s estate.\u201d If the claimant chooses not to establish such an account, the claimant must pay the statutory subrogee \u201cthe full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>amount of the subrogation interest that represents estimated future payments.\u201d R.C. 4123.931(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 57} Petitioners argue that the current subrogation statutes still authorize an unconstitutional taking because such an account is \u201cunrealistic\u201d (fees and expenses will deplete the principal in most cases), and thus the account\u2019s benefits are \u201cillusory.\u201d They further argue that a claimant who does not establish a trust account must fully reimburse the subrogee for the estimated future payments, just like under the former statute struck down in <em>Holeton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 58} We disagree with petitioners\u2019 argument. The trust option affords the claimant an opportunity to avoid the consequences of overestimating future benefit values. The claimant who invokes the trust option is no longer required to reimburse the subrogee up front for estimated future payments that may never materialize. Whereas the former statute allowed the subrogee to retain any overpayment, the current trust option ensures the return to the claimant of all funds remaining after the \u201cfinal reimbursement\u201d of the subrogee. R.C. 4123.931(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 59} This court in <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 124, 748 N.E.2d 1111, discussed with approval a Minnesota statute that \u201cdoes not give the employer or the fund any immediate right of subrogation or reimbursement with regard to future payable compensation or medical benefits. Instead, the Minnesota statute provides a formula under which the employer or fund can obtain reimbursement for compensation paid and then provides that certain remaining tort proceeds <em>shall be paid to the employee </em>and constitute a <em>credit </em>to the subrogee against future compensation payments.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) See Minn.Stat. 176.061(6). Athough R.C. 4123.931(E) differs from the Minnesota statute, the Ohio statute implements some of the same features approved by the <em>Holeton </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 60} Furthermore, the Ohio subrogation statute in <em>Holeton </em>required immediate reimbursement to the subrogee of the entire amount of the estimated future benefits, subject to certain exceptions, such as the claimant\u2019s attorney fees and expenses. See former R.C. 4123.931(A), (D), and (E), set forth in <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 117, 748 N.E.2d 1111. The current statutes contain the same exceptions. See R.C. 4123.93(E). However, the current statutes (as will be discussed in the next part of this opinion) contain a new formula for calculating estimated future benefits that significantly reduces the imbalances condemned in <em>Holeton. </em>See R.C. 4123.931(B) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 61} We find petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding the practical difficulties and supposedly prohibitive costs of a trust account to be too speculative. For one thing, current R.C. 4123.931(E)(2) allows the claimant to use interest from the trust account to pay for expenses. For another, the statute does not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>claimant to establish a fully managed trust account with a highly compensated trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">{\u00b6 62} Although the General Assembly could have responded differently to the deficiencies identified in <em>Holeton, </em>the current statutes governing estimated future benefits are reasonable and do not, on their face, effect an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">2. The Statutory Formula for Allocating the Net Amount Recovered Between the Claimant and the Statutory Subrogee</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 63} As mentioned above, this court in <em>Holeton </em>determined that the subrogation statute in that case violated the takings, right-to-a-remedy, and due-process provisions by failing to adequately correlate the subrogee\u2019s reimbursement amount to any amount recovered by the claimant that can be characterized as duplicative or double when the claimant settled with the tortfeasor. The General Assembly responded by enacting a new formula for dividing between the claimant and the subrogee the \u201cnet amount recovered\u201d by the claimant from a third party. The formula is the same for claimants who settle with the tortfeasor (see R.C. 4123.931(B)) and for claimants who recover damages after a trial (see R.C. 4123.931(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 64} Under those statutes, a claimant receives \u201can amount equal to the uncompensated damages divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered,\u201d and the statutory subrogee receives \u201can amount equal to the subrogation interest divided by the sum of the subrogation interest plus the uncompensated damages, multiplied by the net amount recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 65} Under R.C. 4123.93(D), the \u201csubrogation interest\u201d includes only \u201cpast, present, and estimated future payments of compensation, medical benefits, rehabilitation costs, or death benefits, and any other costs or expenses paid to or on behalf of the claimant by the statutory subrogee.\u201d Furthermore, under R.C. 4123.93(E), the \u201cnet amount recovered\u201d by the claimant against a third party excludes from the formula \u201cattorney\u2019s fees, costs, and other expenses incurred by the claimant in securing\u201d the recovery, as well as punitive damages. Finally, under R.C. 4123.93(F), \u201cuncompensated damages\u201d are the \u201cdemonstrated or proven damages minus the statutory subrogee\u2019s subrogation interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 66} A hypothetical example taken from the Legislative Service Commission Bill Analysis of 2002 S.B. 227 illustrates how the formula works:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cThe required calculations * * * can be expressed in formulas as follows, where \u2018NAR\u2019 means the \u2018net amount recovered,\u2019 \u2018UD\u2019 means the \u2018uncompensated damages,\u2019 and \u2018SI\u2019 means the \u2018subrogation interest\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c\u2022 The claimant receives an amount equal to: UD/(SI + UD) x NAR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 69} \u201c\u2022 The statutory subrogee receives an amount equal to: SI/(SI + UD) x NAR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe following is a hypothetical example of this formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cIf the net amount recovered = $70k; the subrogation interest = $60k; and the uncompensated damages = $50k, the claimant would receive $31,818,18. This is calculated as follows: 50hA60k + 50k) x 70k. The statutory subrogee would receive $38,181.82, which is calculated as follows: 60k/(60k + 50k) x 70k. The claimant\u2019s and statutory subrogee\u2019s amounts total $70k, which is the net amount recovered. These formulas apply both to settlements (R.C. 4123.931(B)) and * * * also to cases that proceed to trial (R.C. 4123.931(D)).\u201d Id. at 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 72} As a practical matter, the formula divides the \u201cnet amount recovered\u201d by the claimant from a third party in such a way that the subrogee receives a proportionate share based on its \u201csubrogation interest\u201d and the claimant receives an amount proportionate to his \u201cuncompensated damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 73} Petitioners argue that under the current statutes, the statutory subro-gee may still take a portion of nonduplicative damages, so that the current statutes remain unconstitutional. Petitioners\u2019 arguments, however, overlook a key provision of the statutory formula, which we will explain using the same figures as the hypothetical discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 74} Because R.C. 4123.93(F) defines \u201cuncompensated damages\u201d as \u201cthe claimant\u2019s demonstrated or proven damages minus the statutory subrogee\u2019s subrogation interest,\u201d it necessarily follows that in the hypothetical, the claimant\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated or proven damages\u201d are $110,000 (a UD of $50,000 plus an SI of $60,000). The formula allows the claimant to retain the subrogation benefits (in the hypothetical, the subrogation benefits are $60,000). In addition to the subrogation benefits, the claimant also receives a portion of the NAR when it is divided in accordance with the formula (in the hypothetical, the claimant\u2019s portion of the NAR is $31,818.18). Therefore, in the hypothetical, the claimant receives a total of $91,818.18 toward his $110,000 proven damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 75} From the NAR, the subrogee recovers $38,181.82 of the $60,000 it paid in benefits. Under the former statutory scheme held unconstitutional in <em>Holeton, </em>the subrogee might have recovered the full $60,000 even when the claimant was undercompensated. On the other hand, if there were no subrogation at all, the claimant would have received a total of $130,000 (an SI of $60,000 plus an NAR of $70,000), and of course the subrogee would have received nothing. It must also be remembered that under R.C. 4123.93(E), the subrogee does not recoup any portion of the claimant\u2019s attorney fees, costs, expenses, or punitive damages, because the formula excludes those amounts from the \u201cnet amount recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>{\u00b6 76} From the above, we observe that a key part of the formula\u2019s operation is that it allows the claimant to keep the benefits received from the subrogee. Petitioners\u2019 arguments fail to account for that very important fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 77} We recognize that under the current statutes, claimants may have to reimburse the subrogee out of recovered damages that are not duplicative and may have to prove that they have not received a double recovery. However, for the reasons that follow, we are convinced that the procedure is facially constitutional and does not constitute an impermissible taking or a violation of due process. Our decision on this point is further supported by the discussion in Part II B below.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 78} In those situations in which a claimant is not fully compensated, the statutory formula is applied, and the claimant and subrogee share in a pro rata division of the net amount recovered. The claimant and subrogee share the burden of the undercompensation, but that undercompensation is caused by extrinsic factors (e.g., the tortfeasor may be underinsured) beyond the control of either party and not by any of the statutory deficiencies identified in <em>Holeton. </em>Although both the claimant and the subrogee obviously would prefer to be made whole, that is not possible when the third party is unable to fully compensate the claimant. Rather than forcing either the claimant or the subrogee to shoulder the full burden of the undercompensation, the General Assembly chose to have them share the burden equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 79} Under the pro rata formula, in some cases, the subrogee will not be able to recover all of the proceeds that are actually duplicative, while in other cases, a claimant may have to yield some proceeds that are not duplicative. Although the <em>Holeton </em>court focused on the claimant\u2019s perspective, the subrogee\u2019s perspective should also be considered. It is not inequitable for the subrogee to obtain some level of reimbursement, and the formula significantly reduces the excessive reimbursement that occurred too often under the previous legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">{\u00b6 80} Again, while the General Assembly could have structured the subrogation statutes in a different way, the formula enacted in R.C. 4123.931(B) and (D) is a reasonable approach that withstands constitutional scrutiny on its face under Sections 16 and 19, Article I. To the extent that this court in <em>Holeton </em>was concerned that the prior statute was fundamentally unfair in too many situations, that unfairness has been addressed and the imbalances adjusted to such a degree that the constitutional infirmity has been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">B. Equal Protection (Section 2, Article I, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">{\u00b6 81} The third certified question is whether the subrogation statutes violate the Equal Protection Clause, Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>provides, \u201cAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for them equal protection and benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">{\u00b6 82} No fundamental right or suspect class is involved in this case, and therefore, we review the subrogation statutes under the rational-basis test. See <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 131, 748 N.E.2d 1111. Under this test, a challenged statute will be upheld if the classifications it creates bear a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest or are grounded on a reasonable justification, even if the classifications are not precise. Id. See, also, <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 83} This court in <em>Holeton </em>held that the former subrogation statute violated equal protection by distinguishing between claimants who go to trial and claimants who settle. This court reasoned that the former statute \u201cessentially create[d] a presumption that a double recovery occurs whenever a claimant is permitted to retain workers\u2019 compensation and tort recovery. Claimants who try their tort claims are permitted to rebut this presumption, while claimants who settle their tort claims are not. Such disparate treatment of claimants who settle their tort claims is irrational and arbitrary because, as demonstrated in [the part of the opinion discussing Sections 16 and 19, Article I], there are situations where claimants\u2019 tort recovery is necessarily limited to amounts that if retained along with workers\u2019 compensation cannot possibly result in a double recovery.\u201d <em>Hole-ton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 132, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b6 84} As we extensively discussed in Part II A above, the General Assembly responded to Holeton\u2019s concerns by enacting a formula for dividing the claimant\u2019s \u201cnet amount recovered\u201d that applies to both classes of claimants. See R.C. 4123.931(B) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">(\u00b6 85} When a claimant settles with a tortfeasor, current R.C. 4123.931(B) allows the claimant and subrogee several options: they may use the formula to determine the division of the \u201cnet amount recovered,\u201d agree to divide that amount \u201con a more fair and reasonable basis,\u201d request a conference with the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation (see, also, R.C. 4123.931(C)), or resort to an \u201calternative dispute resolution process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">{\u00b6 86} When a claimant recovers from a tortfeasor at a trial, R.C. 4123.931(D) specifies that a judge in a nonjury action shall make findings of fact, and the jury in a jury action shall answer interrogatories, that specify the total amount of compensatory damages and then divide that amount into damages representing economic loss and those representing noneconomic loss. Petitioners argue that because the statutory formula for dividing the net amount recovered does not specifically take into account those findings of fact or answers to interrogatories for claimants who recover at trial, the current statutes violate equal protection by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>treating claimants who settle differently from claimants who prevail at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we disagree with petitioners\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">{\u00b6 87} First and foremost, the current statutory formula for dividing the \u201cnet amount recovered\u201d applies both to claimants who settle and to claimants who recover at trial. As mentioned above, this new formula has satisfactorily addressed the <em>Holeton </em>court\u2019s concern that the disparate treatment of these two types of claimants offended Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. For the same reasons, the formula also rectifies the Section 2, Article I violation identified in <em>Holeton </em>stemming from this same disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 88} We determine that the statutory formula for dividing the net amount recovered itself provides the rational basis required to pass equal-protection scrutiny. In light of the formula, further concerns about a claimant\u2019s ability to retain any nonduplicative damages have lost their force. Therefore, even though R.C. 4123.931(B) and 4123.931(D) do not treat the two classes of claimants identically, that differing treatment is not grounded upon an unreasonable justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 89} Furthermore, claimants may have alternatives beyond those specifically recognized in R.C. 4123.931 for demonstrating that a recovered amount is not entirely duplicative, as recognized in decisions of other courts that have considered this issue. For example, in <em>Fry v. Surf City, Inc., </em>137 Ohio Misc.2d 6, 2006-Ohio-3092, 851 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 24, the court stated that a claimant may bring a separate declaratory judgment action, through which the claimant who settled with a tortfeasor may show that not all of the recovery from the tortfeasor was a double recovery. The court in <em>Fry </em>also stated: \u201cIn a trial, evidence may be presented and jury interrogatories may be submitted, under Civ.R. 49, to determine what parts of the damages represent} ] workers\u2019 compensation benefits and what parts represent the claimant\u2019s unreimbursed interests.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25. See, also, <em>McKinley v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 161, 2006-Ohio-5271, 866 N.E.2d 527, \u00b6 26 and 36, which also recognized the possibility of a declaratory judgment action for settling claimants, and of findings of fact (in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>nonjury trial) or interrogatories beyond those expressly mentioned in R.C. 4123.931(D) (in a jury trial) to establish the possible duplicative nature of a claimant\u2019s award from a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">{\u00b6 90} Because we have already determined that the subrogation statutes do not on their face violate the Equal Protection Clause, there is no need for us to review <em>Fry </em>and <em>McKinley, </em>and we decline to rely on the availability of declaratory judgment as an additional reason to uphold the statutes. Those considerations are more appropriate in an as-applied challenge and so are beyond the scope of our analysis here, which involves a facial challenge only.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">C. Conclusion of Part II</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 91} The brief of respondent state of Ohio states that the General Assembly, in responding to <em>Holeton, </em>enacted the current subrogation statutes as a compromise between business interests and plaintiffs\u2019 interests. That brief also states that the General Assembly took into account the negotiations between those factions, along with input from the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and other interested parties, when it drafted the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">{\u00b6 92} The current subrogation statutes do bear all the earmarks of compromise legislation that attempts to balance the legitimate, competing interests of claimants and statutory subrogees. See <em>United Auto., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 432, 2006-Ohio-1327, 844 N.E.2d 335, \u00b6 17 (\u201cThe manifest objective of the General Assembly in enacting S.B. 227 was to comply with our holding in <em>Holeton </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 93} Based on the foregoing, we hold that R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 do not violate the Takings Clause (Section 19, Article I), the Due Process and Remedies Clauses (Section 16, Article I), or the Equal Protection Clause (Section 2, Article I) of the Ohio Constitution and are therefore facially constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10(C) and Former 2305.10(F)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">{\u00b6 94} R.C. 2305.10(C)(1), the products-liability statute of repose, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) of this section or in section 2305.19 of the Revised Code, no cause of action based on a product liability claim shall accrue against the manufacturer or supplier of a product later than ten years from the date that the product was delivered to its first purchaser or first lessee who was not engaged in a business in which the product was used as a component in the production, construction, creation, assembly, or rebuilding of another product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">{\u00b6 96} R.C. 2305.10(C)(2) through (7) lists six exceptions to the operation of that statute, none of which apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>{\u00b6 97} Former R.C. 2305.10(F) (now 2305.10(G)) applies to this case.

Another central fact is that petitioners filed suit \u201cafter the effective date of this amendment\u201d for purposes of former R.C. 2305.10(F). Therefore, if R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) are constitutional, those statutes prevent petitioners from recovering from Kard Corporation and Racine Federated.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 100} Petitioners\u2019 arguments that R.C. 2305.10 is unconstitutional are largely based on past decisions of this court holding other statutes of repose unconstitutional. That this court has struck down statutes of repose in the past, however, does not necessarily mean that the products-liability statute of repose in this case must meet the same fate. Indeed, in <em>Arbino, </em>we upheld as constitutional other tort-reform measures that were, like the provisions of R.C. 2305.10 we review today, contained in S.B. 80, which became effective April 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 101} In <em>Arbino, </em>we provided context for discussion of the constitutional challenges posed in that case by examining the recent history of major tort-reform laws and by summarizing a number of cases in which this court declared unconstitutional former statutes that were \u201csimilar in language and purpose to those at issue\u201d in <em>Arbino. </em>See 116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 10. Parts of that discussion are very pertinent to our analysis today.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 102} The first key point from <em>Arbino </em>is that the legislative branch of government is \u201c \u2018the ultimate arbiter of public policy,\u2019 \u201d and in fulfilling that role, the legislature continually refines Ohio\u2019s tort law to meet the needs of our citizens. Id. at \u00b6 21, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Information Network v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">{\u00b6 103} The second key point is that \u201ceven considering the numerous opinions by this court on this issue, the basic constitutionality of tort-reform statutes is hardly settled law. Our prior review has focused on certain unconstitutional facets of the prior tort-reform laws that can be addressed to create constitutionally valid legislation. We have not dismissed all tort reform as an unconstitutional concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>{\u00b6 104} \u201cWhile stare decisis applies to the rulings rendered in regard to specific statutes, it is limited to circumstances \u2018where the facts of a subsequent case are substantially the same as a former case.\u2019 <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 539 N.E.2d 103. We will not apply stare decisis to strike down legislation enacted by the General Assembly merely because it is similar to previous enactments that we have deemed unconstitutional. To be covered by the blanket of stare decisis, the legislation must be phrased in language that is substantially the same as that which we have previously invalidated.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 105} Because the ultimate conclusion reached in this portion of <em>Arbino </em>is of critical importance, and applies with equal force, to the issues we address in this case, we reiterate it here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cA careful review of the statutes at issue * * * reveals that they are more than a rehashing of unconstitutional statutes. In its continued pursuit of reform, the General Assembly has made progress in tailoring its legislation to address the constitutional defects identified by the various majorities of this court. The statutes before us * * * are sufficiently different from the previous enactments to avoid the blanket application of stare decisis and to warrant a fresh review of their individual merits.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 107} With the stare decisis doctrine and Arbino\u2019s principles in mind, we turn to petitioners\u2019 several challenges to the constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">A. Open Courts and Right to a Remedy (Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 108} Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides, \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d This provision contains two distinct guarantees. First, legislative enactments may restrict individual rights only \u201cby due course of law,\u201d a guarantee equivalent to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 193, 199, 551 N.E.2d 938. That aspect of Section 16 will be addressed later in this opinion, in Part III B.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">{\u00b6 109} The second guarantee in Section 16 is that \u201call courts shall be open to every person with a right to a remedy for injury to his person, property or reputation, with the opportunity for such remedy being granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 193, 551 N.E.2d 938. It is this second guarantee that we address at this point. In considering this aspect of Section 16, it is necessary to discuss our prior decisions in two cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that are significant here, <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>and <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">1. <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 110} In <em>Sedar, </em>the plaintiff, Michael Sedar, a Kent State University student, was severely injured when he passed his hand and arm through a panel of wire-reinforced glass in a door in his dormitory in 1985. Construction of the dormitory had been completed in 1966. Sedar sued the architectural engineers who had designed the building and the general contractor who had built it. The trial court granted summary judgment to the defendants based on former R.C. 2305.131, a ten-year statute of repose covering architects and builders, and the court of appeals affirmed, upholding the constitutionality of that statute. <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 194, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 111} This court in <em>Sedar, </em>in a thorough and concise opinion, upheld the constitutionality of former R.C. 2305.131 in the face of a challenge based on the open-courts and right-to-a-remedy guarantees of Section 16, Article I, as well as on other grounds. This court stated the overall issue as \u201cwhether R.C. 2305.131 may constitutionally prevent the accrual of actions sounding in tort against architects, construction contractors and others who perform services related to the design and construction of improvements to real property, where such action arises more than ten years following the completion of such services.\u201d Id. at 194, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 112} In opening the analysis in <em>Sedar, </em>the court explained the key difference between a statute of repose and a statute of limitations. \u201cUnlike a true statute of limitations, which limits the time in which a plaintiff may bring suit <em>after </em>the cause of action accrues, a statute of repose * * * potentially bars a plaintiffs suit <em>before </em>the cause of action arises.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., 49 Ohio St.3d at 195, 551 N.E.2d 938. The court then discussed the history of construction statutes of repose, noting that they were first enacted in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a response to the expansion of common-law liability of architects and builders who historically had not been subject to suit by third parties who lacked privity of contract. Id. Under the privity doctrine, once a contractor\u2019s work was completed and accepted by the owner of the property, the responsibility for maintaining the building and protecting third parties from harm shifted to the owner, so that liability was limited to those who were in actual control or possession of the premises. With the demise of the privity doctrine, architects and builders were increasingly subjected to suits brought by third parties long after work on a building had been completed. Id. at 195-196, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 113} The court in <em>Sedar </em>noted that former R.C. 2305.131, by its terms, did not apply to persons in actual possession and control of premises when a third party allegedly was injured, did not apply to suppliers of construction materials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>and did not apply to actions on a contract. Id., 49 Ohio St.3d at 196-197, 551 N.E.2d 938. We then explained the governing standards, applied them to the particulars of the statute, and held that former R.C. 2305.131 did not violate due process. Id. at 199-201, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 114} Then, in considering the argument that former R.C. 2305.131 violated the open-courts and right-to-a-remedy provisions of Section 16, Article I, the court in <em>Sedar </em>first distinguished previous decisions of this court striking down a statute of repose for medical-malpractice actions:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 115} \u201c[T]he situation presented in the medical malpractice cases, particularly in <em>Hardy [v. VerMeulen </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 512 N.E.2d 626], is clearly distinguishable from the situation presented by the operation of R.C. 2305.131. Operation of the medical malpractice repose statute takes away an existing, actionable negligence claim before the injured person discovers it. Thus, \u2018it denies legal remedy to one who has suffered bodily injury, * * * \u2019 in violation of the right-to-a-remedy guarantee. <em>Hardy, supra, </em>at 48, 512 N.E.2d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cIn contrast, R.C. 2305.131 does not take away an existing cause of action, as applied in this case. \u2018 * * * [I]ts effect, rather, is to prevent what might otherwise be a cause of action, from ever arising. Thus injury occurring more than ten years after the negligent act allegedly responsible for the harm, forms no basis for recovering. The injured party literally has <em>no </em>cause of action. * * * \u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.) Rosenberg v. North Bergen </em>(1972), 61 N.J. 190, 199, 293 A.2d 662, 667.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 201-202, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 117} In <em>Hardy v. VerMeulen </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 49, 512 N.E.2d 626, this court rejected the notion that \u201ccauses of action as they existed at common law or the rules that govern such causes are immune from legislative attention.\u201d In <em>Sedar, </em>we reiterated that position and noted further that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[n]o one has a vested right in rules of the common law. * * * The great office of statutes is to remedy defects in the common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to new circumstances.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 202, 551 N.E.2d 938, quoting <em>Fassig v. State ex rel. Turner </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 232, 248, 116 N.E. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 118} We also observed that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]his court would encroach upon the Legislature\u2019s ability to guide the development of the law if we invalidated legislation simply because the rule enacted by the Legislature rejects some cause of action currently preferred by the courts. * * * Such a result would offend our notion of the checks and balances between the various branches of government, and the flexibility required for the healthy growth of the law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 202, 551 N.E.2d 938, quoting <em>Klein v. Catalano </em>(1982), 386 Mass. 701, 712-713, 437 N.E.2d 514, and <em>Freezer Storage, Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co. </em>(1978), 476 Pa. 270, 280-281, 382 A.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>{\u00b6 119} <em>Sedar </em>ultimately concluded: \u201cThe right-to-a-remedy provision of Section 16, Article I applies only to existing, vested rights, and it is state law which determines what injuries are recognized and what remedies are available. * * * R.C. 2305.131, as applied to bar the claims of appellant here, whose injury occurred over eight years after the expiration of the statute of repose, does not violate Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 202, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 120} The <em>Sedar </em>court then thoroughly analyzed whether former R.C. 2305.131 violated equal-protection principles, noting that \u201cthe vast majority of states have upheld similar architect-builder statutes of repose, holding the legislative classifications therein were based on valid distinctions\u201d and finding that authority persuasive. Id. at 203, 551 N.E.2d 938. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cOwners, tenants and others actually in possession of improvements to real property, who are expressly excluded from operation of the statute, have continuing control of the premises and are responsible for their repair and maintenance. In contrast, architects and builders have no control over the premises once they are turned over to the owner, after which time\u201d the possibilities of neglect, abuse, poor maintenance, mishandling, improper modification, or unskilled repair of an improvement can arise. Id., 49 Ohio St.3d at 203-204, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">2. <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">{\u00b6 122} In <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 639 N.E.2d 425, this court entertained a constitutional challenge to the same statute, former R.C. 2305.131, that we upheld in <em>Sedar. Brennaman </em>involved a defendant, Bechtel Corporation, that had performed engineering and construction services related to the construction of a facility in which sodium was unloaded from railroad cars and piped to storage tanks. Bechtel\u2019s work on the project was completed in 1958. Id. at 461, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">{\u00b6 123} The injuries at issue in <em>Brennaman </em>occurred in 1986 when workers at the plant were replacing a leaking valve in the piping system. A stream of molten sodium escaped from the system, splashed the workers, and ignited, killing two employees and seriously injuring another. Id. at 461^162, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">{\u00b6 124} Among the claims raised by the employees and their families were claims against Bechtel for the design and construction of the sodium-handling system. The trial court granted summary judgment to Bechtel. Id., 70 Ohio St.3d at 462, 639 N.E.2d 425. In affirming, the court of appeals primarily followed <em>Sedar </em>to hold that the claims against Bechtel were barred by former R.C. 2305.131, because Bechtel\u2019s work had been completed more than ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>prior to the injuries and the statute had recently been upheld as constitutional in <em>Sedar. </em>See <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(Dec. 11, 1992), Ashtabula App. Nos. 92-A-1689 and 92-A-1690, 1992 WL 366982. This court agreed to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 125} In doing so, we first resolved a preliminary issue, determining that the sodium-handling area qualified as \u201can improvement to real property\u201d so that former R.C. 2305.131 applied to the claims against Bechtel. <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 463-466, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 126} The court then addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that former R.C. 2305.131 was unconstitutional. After acknowledging that <em>Sedar </em>had recently upheld the constitutionality of that statute, the court stated, \u201cWe revisit our conclusion in <em>Sedar.\u201d Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 466, 639 N.E.2d 425. In an abbreviated discussion devoid of any in-depth analysis, a majority of this court simply set forth the text of Section 16, Article I; cited one case, <em>Burgess v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 609 N.E.2d 140, for the proposition that the General Assembly is constitutionally precluded from depriving a claimant of a right to a remedy before the claimant knew or should have known of the injury; and summarily declared that the statute, because it was a statute of repose, deprived the plaintiffs of the right to sue those who had negligently designed or constructed improvements to real property once ten years had elapsed after the negligent service, and was thus unconstitutional. <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 466, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 127} The <em>Brennaman </em>court then stated that a plaintiff must have a reasonable period of time to see to seek compensation after an accident under Section 16, Article I and that former R.C. 2305.131 conflicted with this right. Id. The court quoted the dissent in <em>Sedar </em>to make the point: \u201c \u2018R.C. 2305.131 effectively closes the courthouse to [Brennaman] and individuals like [her] in contravention of the express language of Section 16, Article I, thereby violating constitutionally protected rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 466, 639 N.E.2d 425, quoting <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 205, 551 N.E.2d 938 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 128} The court completed its discussion of the issue by stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cToday we reopen the courthouse doors by declaring that R.C. 2305.131, a statute of repose, violates the right to a remedy guaranteed by Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and is, thus, unconstitutional. We overrule <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 193, 551 N.E.2d 938.\u201d <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 466-467, 639 N.E.2d 425. See, also, paragraph two of the syllabus. The court concluded in <em>Brennaman </em>that the plaintiffs had filed their complaints within one year after their causes of action arose and that this had been within a reasonable time, and reversed the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of the court of appeals and remanded the cause for trial. Id. at 466-467, 639 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">{\u00b6 130} The preceding summary of <em>Brennaman </em>is essentially the court\u2019s full opinion regarding the unconstitutionality of former R.C. 2305.131. Brennaman\u2019s entire discussion of this issue, which culminated in the holding that the statute violated Section 16, Article I and which overruled <em>Sedar, </em>spans one page of the Ohio Official Reports. The analytical portion of the court\u2019s opinion is a mere four paragraphs long.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">3. Application of <em>Sedar </em>and <em>Brennaman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 131} Petitioners\u2019 principal argument that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) are unconstitutional on open-courts and right-to-a-remedy grounds is based on <em>Brennaman. </em>Their argument relies in large part on Brennaman\u2019s broad implication that all statutes of repose violate Section 16, Article I and on the stare decisis value of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 132} Respondents Kard Corporation and Racine Federated assert that <em>Sedar </em>properly analyzed and upheld the constitutionality of the statute of repose at issue in that case and propose that \u201c[t]o the extent this court finds <em>Brennaman </em>and <em>Sedar </em>in irreconcilable conflict, <em>Brennaman </em>should be overruled consistent with the required presumptions of constitutionality and the holdings of a clear majority of sister state courts.\u201d Kard Corporation and Racine Federated further contend that the factors set forth in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 48, lead to the conclusion that <em>Brenna-man </em>should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 133} In <em>Galatis, </em>we explained when the principle of stare decisis must yield: \u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis is designed to provide continuity and predictability in our legal system. We adhere to stare decisis as a means of thwarting the arbitrary administration of justice as well as providing a clear rule of law by which the citizenry can organize their affairs. * * * However, a supreme court not only has the right, but is entrusted with the duty to examine its former decisions and, when reconciliation is impossible, to discard its former errors.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 134} Given the importance of the doctrine of stare decisis, we set forth in <em>Galatis </em>a tripartite test for considering whether a previous decision of this court should be overruled: \u201cA prior decision of the Supreme Court may be overruled where (1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 135} The explicit purpose of the <em>Galatis </em>test, which was developed after <em>Brennaman </em>was decided, is to provide a \u201cwell-structured method of ensuring a disciplined approach to deciding whether to abandon a precedent.\u201d Id., 100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 47. <em>Brennaman </em>illustrates the pitfalls of a court\u2019s application of an unstructured approach to overruling a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 136} Although <em>Sedar </em>was a thorough and concise opinion that fully sustained each of its specific conclusions with extensive reasoning, <em>Brennaman </em>is the classic example of the \u201carbitrary administration of justice\u201d that <em>Galatis </em>cautions against.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 137} <em>Brennaman </em>cavalierly overruled <em>Sedar </em>with virtually no analysis. In the process, <em>Brennaman </em>failed to accord proper respect to the principle of stare decisis. See 70 Ohio St.3d at 468, 639 N.E.2d 425 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cA mere four years ago this court affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2305.131 in <em>Sedar * * </em>*. However, * * * the majority ignores the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>and the policy of consistency underlying it, to strike down a valid exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s power\u201d). <em>Brennaman </em>illustrates why it is imperative that the <em>Galatis </em>factors be applied. Otherwise, the principles of predictability and stability are sacrificed for the sake of personal judicial whims.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 138} The problem with <em>Brennaman </em>is not that it overruled <em>Sedar, </em>but rather, the way in which it did so. <em>Sedar </em>presented a measured and reasoned analysis of why the particular statute of repose at issue in that case differed from some other statutes of repose, demonstrating that the constitutionality of any specific statute of repose should turn on the particular features of the statute at issue, and that such a statute should be evaluated narrowly within its specific context. In contrast, <em>Brennaman </em>gave scant justification to support any of the court\u2019s reasoning. Brennaman\u2019s imprecise analysis not only overruled <em>Sedar, </em>but also led to a sweeping repudiation by implication of not just the specific statute of repose before it, but of all statutes of repose in general, including presumably those enacted after <em>Brennaman </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 139} This case involves a different statute of repose than was at issue in <em>Sedar </em>and <em>Brennaman </em>and thus stands in its own light before this court. The constitutionality of the statutes at issue here certainly is not governed by the broad but hollow <em>Brennaman </em>analysis. Indeed, Brennaman\u2019s lack of any meaningful analysis makes it impossible for us to consider even the first <em>Galatis </em>factor (whether a previous decision was wrongly decided) in evaluating <em>Brenna-man\u2019s </em>treatment of <em>Sedar. </em>Instead of a targeted approach that systematically explained the flaws in <em>Sedar, Brennaman </em>reached its conclusion without deigning to explain why <em>Sedar </em>was wrongly decided, other than to employ a short quote from the <em>Sedar </em>dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>{\u00b6 140} The deficiencies underlying Brennaman\u2019s overruling of <em>Sedar </em>are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 141} Any constitutional analysis must begin with the presumption of constitutionality enjoyed by all legislation, and the understanding that it is not this court\u2019s duty to assess the wisdom of a particular statute. See <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 468, 639 N.E.2d 425 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). <em>Brennaman </em>did not even mention in passing the presumption of constitutionality, and it accorded no deference to the General Assembly\u2019s determination of public policy as expressed in the statute under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 142} In addition, <em>Brennaman </em>did not consider the critical distinction between statutes of repose and statutes of limitations. The <em>Brennaman </em>dissent, on the other hand, explained why the distinction is critical: \u201c \u2018Unlike a true statute of limitations, which limits the time in which a plaintiff may bring suit <em>after </em>the cause of action accrues, a statute of repose * ......potentially bars a plaintiffs suit <em>before </em>the cause of action arises.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.) Sedar, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 195, 551 N.E.2d at 941. A statute of repose does not deny a remedy for a vested cause of action but, rather, bars the action before it ever arises. Id. at 201, 551 N.E.2d at 946. Therefore, no right of action ever accrued to appellants in which their constitutional rights to damages or jury determination arose.\u201d <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 468, 639 N.E.2d 425 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The <em>Brennaman </em>court made no attempt to explain why Sedar\u2019s conclusion on the very important point emphasized in the <em>Brennaman </em>dissent was wrongly determined. Rather, the <em>Brennaman </em>court sidestepped this question entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 143} As the dissent in <em>Brennaman </em>also observed, the statute at issue in that case did not necessarily deprive a plaintiff of a right to a remedy, because injured parties potentially had recourse through other avenues, such as through workers\u2019 compensation (if the plaintiff was an employee), an intentional-tort suit against an employer, or possibly under a premises-liability theory (if the plaintiff was not an employee). Id. The majority in <em>Brennaman </em>did not explain why the plaintiffs\u2019 right to a remedy was violated even though additional avenues of recovery were potentially available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 144} Moreover, as the dissent in <em>Brennaman </em>noted, at common law, the actions of the plaintiffs in that case would have been barred by the privity doctrine. The statute of repose at issue struck a rational balance between the rights of injured parties and the rights of architects and engineers and guarded against the risk of stale litigation. Id., 70 Ohio St.3d at 469, 639 N.E.2d 425 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The majority in <em>Brennaman </em>did not address these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 145} The majority\u2019s decision in <em>Brennaman </em>also ignored the predicament of builders, who have no legal right to enter an owner\u2019s property to correct a defect that is discovered after the builder\u2019s work is completed and turned over to the owner, but who may be subject to suit even though they had no ability to correct a problem that arose subsequent to their work and without their knowledge. Id. (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The <em>Brennaman </em>majority failed to address the concern that a builder who is subject to suit has no ability to correct a problem that arises later.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 146} Given all of the deficiencies in <em>Brennaman, </em>and the context in which it arose, <em>Brennaman </em>cannot control here. Because <em>Brennaman </em>did not involve a challenge to a products-liability statute of repose, as the instant case does, that decision is not directly on point and can arguably apply only because of its overexpansive language. We confine <em>Brennaman </em>to its particular holding that former R.C. 2305.131, the prior statute of repose for improvements to real property, was unconstitutional. It is entitled to nothing more. To the extent that <em>Brennaman </em>stands for the proposition that all statutes of repose are repugnant to Section 16, Article I, we expressly reject that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 147} In so doing, we find that the fundamental weaknesses of <em>Brennaman </em>limit its value. For that reason, we do not overrule <em>Brennaman-, </em>we simply decline to follow its unreasoned rule in contexts in which it is not directly controlling. We find that the statutes at issue in this case \u201care sufficiently different from the previous enactments to avoid the blanket application of stare decisis and to warrant a fresh review of their individual merits.\u201d See <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948,\u2019 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 24. We therefore decline respondents\u2019 invitation to overrule <em>Brennaman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 148} We find that the interpretation of the open-courts and right-to-a-remedy provisions by this court in <em>Sedar </em>is more fully developed and appropriate than that set forth in <em>Brennaman. </em>We specifically adopt <em>Sedar </em>s rationale here, finding that its holding is based on proper construction of the requirements of Section 16, Article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 149} Although R.C. 2305.10(C) is different from the statute of repose at issue in <em>Sedar </em>and <em>Brennaman, </em>it is similar in a key respect. As with the statute of repose at issue in those cases, R.C. 2305.10(C) operates to potentially bar a plaintiffs suit before a cause of action arises. Thus, the statute can prevent claims from ever vesting if the product that allegedly caused an injury was delivered to an end user more than ten years before the injury occurred. This feature of the statute triggers the portion of Cedar\u2019s fundamental analysis concerning Section 16, Article I that is dispositive of our inquiry here. Because such an injured party\u2019s cause of action never accrues against the manufacturer or supplier of the product, it never becomes a vested right.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 150} As this court stated in <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 202, 551 N.E.2d 938: \u201cThe right-to-a-remedy provision of Section 16, Article I applies only to existing, vested rights, and it is state law which determines what injuries are recognized and what remedies are available.\u201d Here, the General Assembly has established through the enactment of R.C. 2305.10(C) the injuries that are recognized and the remedies that are available. As in <em>Sedar, </em>the statute at issue here does not violate Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 151} We emphasize a distinct practical concern that was discussed by the <em>Sedar </em>court when it held the statute in that case constitutional. A plaintiffs right to a remedy is not necessarily extinguished when a particular statute of repose might apply to foreclose suits by that plaintiff against certain defendants. In <em>Sedar, </em>the construction statute of repose at issue expressly did not cover those in control of the property such as owners and tenants, so that an owner or tenant could be held liable for using the premises for a purpose it was not designed for, or for making defective alterations. Id., 49 Ohio St.3d at 203-204, 551 N.E.2d 938. See, also, <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 468, 639 N.E.2d 425 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (former R.C. 2305.131 did not violate Section 16, Article I because plaintiffs had recourse through other avenues of redress).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 152} Although R.C. 2305.10(C) may prevent some suits against product manufacturers, in many situations, an injured party may be able to seek recovery against other parties. For example, if an employer modifies a machine after it is acquired, the employer could be liable for the consequences of a negligent alteration. As will be discussed in Part III B below, the General Assembly specifically recognized in Sections 3(C)(3) and (4) of S.B. 80 that after a product is delivered, a manufacturer or supplier lacks control over the product, over its uses, and over the conditions of its use and concluded that it is more appropriate for the party that controls the product to be responsible for any harm caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 153} Petitioners also cite three cases from 1986 and 1987 in which this court struck down different aspects of a medical-malpractice statute of repose on various grounds and as applied to various factual <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 Mominee <em>v. Scherbarth </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 270, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717; <em>Hardy, </em>supra, 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 512 N.E.2d 626; and <em>Gaines, </em>supra, 33 Ohio St.3d 54, 514 N.E.2d 709. However, as explained in <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 202, 551 N.E.2d 938, those cases are distinguishable because the medical-malpractice statute of repose interpreted in them took away an existing, actionable negligence claim before the injured person discovered the injury (when the injury had already occurred) or gave the injured person too little time to file suit, and therefore denied the injured party\u2019s right to a remedy for those reasons. The three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>medical-malpractice cases petitioners rely on therefore do not support a contrary result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 154} For all the foregoing reasons, we hold that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) do not on their face violate the open-courts and right-to-a-remedy guarantees of Section 16, Article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">B. Due Process and Equal Protection (Section 16, Article I and Section 2, Article I, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">{\u00b6 155} Petitioners assert that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) violate the \u201cdue course of law\u201d guarantee of Section 16, Article I. Petitioners urge this court to apply strict scrutiny in evaluating the statutes because they restrict fundamental rights. Under such an analysis, a statute restricting fundamental rights \u201cwill be considered unconstitutional unless it is shown to be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 423, 633 N.E.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 156} As we did in <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 49, however, we reject a strict-scrutiny approach to the due-process challenge raised in this case. R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) do not impinge upon fundamental rights. See Part III A, above.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">{\u00b6 157} We will instead employ a rational-basis review, under which the statute will be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and is not unreasonable or arbitrary. <em>Mominee, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 274, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717. In conducting this review, we must consider whether the General Assembly\u2019s purposes in enacting the legislation at issue provide adequate support to justify the statute\u2019s effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">{\u00b6 158} Petitioners also assert that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) violate the \u201cequal protection and benefit\u201d provision of Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Petitioners propose that \u201cR.C. 2305.10 arbitrarily and capriciously differentiates between plaintiffs injured by a defective product ten years or more after it was sold to an end-user, and plaintiffs sustaining comparable injuries less than ten years after the sale to an end-user.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">{\u00b6 159} We apply a rational-basis review here also, for the statutes involve neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">{\u00b6 160} Because the due-process and equal-protection challenges both require us to review legislative purpose, we will address that issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">{\u00b6 161} In Section 3 of S.B. 80, the General Assembly made a \u201cstatement of findings and intent\u201d explaining certain provisions of the bill. We will concentrate here on those findings relating to the products-liability statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">{\u00b6 162} Section 3(C) of S.B. 80 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 163} \u201cIn enacting division (D)(2) of section 2125.02 and division (C) of section 2305.10 of the Revised Code in this act, it is the intent of the General Assembly to do all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 164} \u201c(1) To declare that the ten-year statute of repose prescribed by division (D)(2) of section 2125.02 and division (C) of section 2305.10 of the Revised Code, as enacted by this act, are specific provisions intended to promote a greater interest than the interest underlying the general four-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 2305.09 of the Revised Code, the general two-year statutes of limitations prescribed by sections 2125.02 and 2305.10 of the Revised Code, and other general statutes of limitations prescribed by the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 165} \u201c(2) To declare that, subject to the two-year exceptions prescribed in division (D)(2)(d) of section 2125.02 and in division (C)(4) of section 2305.10 of the Revised Code, the ten-year statutes of repose shall serve as a limitation upon the commencement of a civil action in accordance with an otherwise applicable statute of limitations prescribed by the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">{\u00b6 166} \u201c(3) To recognize that subsequent to the delivery of a product, the manufacturer or supplier lacks control over the product, over the uses made of the product, and over the conditions under which the product is used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">{\u00b6 167} \u201c(4) To recognize that under the circumstances described in division (C)(3) of this section, it is more appropriate for the party or parties who have had control over the product during the intervening time period to be responsible for any harm caused by the product;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 168} \u201c(5) To recognize that, more than ten years after a product has been delivered, it is very difficult for a manufacturer or supplier to locate reliable evidence and witnesses regarding the design, production, or marketing of the product, thus severely disadvantaging manufacturers or suppliers in their efforts to defend actions based on a product liability claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">{\u00b6 169} \u201c(6) To recognize the inappropriateness of applying current legal and technological standards to products manufactured many years prior to the commencement of an action based on a product liability claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">{\u00b6 170} \u201c(7) To recognize that a statute of repose for product liability claims would enhance the competitiveness of Ohio manufacturers by reducing their exposure to disruptive and protracted liability with respect to products long out of their control, by increasing finality in commercial transactions, and by allowing manufacturers to conduct their affairs with increased certainty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">{\u00b6 171} \u201c(8) To declare that division (D)(2) of section 2125.02 and division (C) of section 2305.10 of the Revised Code, as enacted by this act, strike a rational balance between the rights of prospective claimants and the rights of product manufacturers and suppliers and to declare that the ten-year statutes of repose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>prescribed in those sections are rational periods of repose intended to preclude the problems of stale litigation but not to affect civil actions against those in actual control and possession of a product at the time that the product causes an injury to real or personal property, bodily injury, or -wrongful death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">{\u00b6 172} For purposes of both due process and equal protection, we determine that the above findings adequately demonstrate that the statutes bear a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public and are not unreasonable or arbitrary. \u201c[A]n intensive reexamination\u201d of the General Assembly\u2019s findings \u201cis beyond the scope of our review. * * * [W]e noted in <em>State v. Williams </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 513, 531, 728 N.E.2d 342, that \u2018we are to grant substantial deference to the predictive judgment of the General Assembly\u2019 under a rational-basis review. Further, as the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u2018it is not the function of the courts to substitute their evaluation of legislative facts for that of the legislature.\u2019 <em>Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co. </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 456, 470, 101 S.Ct. 715, 66 L.Ed.2d 659.\u201d <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 173} In <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 199-201, 551 N.E.2d 938, this court upheld former R.C. 2305.131, a ten-year statute of repose, in the face of a due-process challenge, finding that legislative objectives similar to those enumerated in Section 3(C) of S.B. 80 were sufficient to satisfy due-process concerns. The same conclusion applied to the equal-protection challenge. Id. at 202-205, 551 N.E.2d 938. For the reasons set forth in <em>Sedar, </em>we uphold the statutes challenged in this case as not unreasonable or arbitrary. Although some of the legislative findings may be open to debate, we will not second-guess their validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 174} Petitioners\u2019 equal-protection argument further charges that the legislature has acted irrationally in choosing a ten-year period of repose. Although the <em>Sedar </em>court discussed the reasonableness of a ten-year period only in its due-process discussion, that analysis is equally relevant to equal protection. The <em>Sedar </em>court, 49 Ohio St.3d at 200, 551 N.E.2d 938, concluded that \u201c[t]he legislature\u2019s choice of ten years to achieve its valid goal of limiting liability here was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. * * * Indeed, a substantial majority of states have found no due process violations in similar statutes, some of which afford periods as brief as four years.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 175} In light of the above, we determine that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) do not violate principles of due process or equal protection and are constitutional on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">C. The Takings Clause (Section 19, Article I, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">(\u00b6 176} Basing their argument in large part on the discussion of the Takings Clause in <em>Holeton, </em>supra, 92 Ohio St.3d at 121-130, 748 N.E.2d 1111, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>reviewed extensively in Part II of this opinion, petitioners argue that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) constitute an improper taking under Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Petitioners propose that a person who has sustained bodily injury through the fault of another has a property interest in a claim for relief and that R.C. 2305.10 materially interferes with that property interest, so that a taking occurs when an injured party is \u201cdivested of his cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 177} We reject this argument. <em>Holeton </em>is readily distinguishable. An existing, identifiable property interest was at stake in that case \u2014 a claimant\u2019s tort recovery from a third party through a trial or through a settlement. In contrast, as discussed in Part III A above, the statute of repose at issue in this case involves a cause of action that never accrues and thus is prevented from vesting once the ten-year repose period has passed. Because there is no property right, there can be no taking. Consequently, we determine that R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) are constitutional on their face under Section 19, Article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">D. The Retroactivity Clause (Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 178} Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides, \u201cThe general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 179} Petitioners assert that former R.C. 2305.10(F) is unconstitutional as applied to them because it retroactively extinguishes a substantive right in violation of Section 28, Article II. Petitioner Douglas Groch was injured on March 3, 2005. The effective date of the S.B. 80 amendments to R.C. 2305.10 was April 7, 2005, after the injury. Pursuant to former R.C. 2305.10(F), R.C. 2305.10(C) applies to all actions \u201ccommenced on or after\u201d April 7, 2005. For their suit to be timely, and to avoid the bar of R.C. 2305.10(C), petitioners had to commence their suit prior to April 7, 2005. Petitioners filed their complaint after that date. Therefore, if former R.C. 2305.10(F) and current 2305.10(C) are valid, they combine to prevent petitioners from recovering on their accrued cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 180} Petitioners\u2019 argument, because it is based on the specific facts of this case, is an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to the constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10, rather than a facial challenge. Therefore, the standard here is different from the standard governing the other certified questions presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">{\u00b6 181} \u201c[Wjhere statutes are challenged on the ground that they are unconstitutional as applied to a particular set of facts, the party making the challenge bears the burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence of a presently existing set of facts that make the statutes unconstitutional and void when applied to those facts.\u201d <em>Harrold v.

Conversely, remedial laws are those affecting only the remedy provided, and include laws that merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right. Id. at 107, 522 N.E.2d at 497. A purely remedial statute does not violate Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, even if applied retroactively. See <em>id. </em>at 107, 522 N.E.2d at 496.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 187} The General Assembly expressly states its intent in former R.C. 2305.10(F) that \u201cthis section shall be considered to be purely remedial in operation.\u201d However, whether the statute is remedial depends upon its operation and not upon a label placed upon it by the General Assembly. Furthermore, the statute may be remedial in some contexts but not in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">{\u00b6 188} As discussed above, R.C. 2305.10(C) prevents a cause of action from accruing if the product that caused an injury was delivered to an end user more than ten years before the injury occurred. Because the injured party\u2019s cause of action never accrues, it never becomes a vested right. For that reason, for most plaintiffs, there is no \u201csubstantive right\u201d affected by R.C. 2305.10(C), and that statute on its face does not violate Section 28, Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 189} Petitioners\u2019 situation, however, is different. Pursuant to former R.C. 2305.10(F) (now (G)), R.C. 2305.10(C) does not apply \u201cto any civil action pending prior to the effective date of this amendment [April 7, 2005].\u201d Thus, a cause of action based on an injury that occurred prior to April 7, 2005, does \u201caccrue,\u201d and petitioners\u2019 cause of action did vest for purposes of Section 28, Article II. For plaintiffs in petitioners\u2019 situation, former R.C. 2305.10(F) operates as a true statute of limitations that restricts the time for filing a cause of action that has validly accrued. See <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 195, 551 N.E.2d 938. As with any statute of limitations, R.C. 2305.10(F) prevents a plaintiff from recovering on a cause of action if the limitations period expires and if the defendant interposes the statute of limitations as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 190} Douglas Groch\u2019s injury occurred on March 3, 2005. By operation of former R.C. 2305.10(F), petitioners had only 34 days to commence their suit before the effective date of R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) (April 7, 2005), or their cause of action was barred by R.C. 2305.10(C)(1). Petitioners did not commence their suit until June 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 191} Respondents Kard Corporation and Racine Federated argue that petitioners do not have a vested right that is being impaired by R.C. 2305.10(C) for purposes of retroactivity analysis. However, respondents cannot have it both ways. If, as we have said, the principal grounds for upholding R.C. 2305.10(C) is that it prevents a products-liability cause of action from accruing once ten years have passed since the product\u2019s delivery to an end user, it cannot also bar a cause of action that accrued \u2014 and therefore <em>vested </em>\u2014 prior to the statute\u2019s effective date. Once vested, such a cause of action clearly becomes a substantive right for purposes of Section 28, Article II. See <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 107, 522 N.E.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 192} Respondents Kard Corporation and Racine Federated additionally assert that even if petitioners\u2019 cause of action vested when Douglas Groch was injured, former R.C. 2305.10(F) provided \u201ca reasonable window of time\u201d for filing suit. But we cannot agree that 34 days is \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 193} To determine what is a reasonable time, we note that R.C. 2305.10(C)(4) provides a two-year limitations period for commencing a suit for injuries occurring before the expiration of the ten-year repose period of R.C. 2305.10(C)(1), \u201cbut less than two years prior to the expiration of that period.\u201d For example, under R.C. 2305.10(C)(4), if the product was delivered to the end user nine years prior to the injury, the injured plaintiff would still have two years in which to file suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">{\u00b6 194} Similarly, R.C. 2305.10(C)(5) provides that \u201c[i]f a cause of action relative to a product liability claim accrues during the ten-year period described in division (C)(1) of this section and the claimant cannot commence an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>during that period due to a disability described in section 2305.16 of the Revised Code [i.e., minority or unsound mind], an action based on the product liability claim may be commenced within two years after the disability is removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 195} Both R.C. 2305.10(C)(4) and (C)(5) recognize that once a products-liability cause of action accrues, a plaintiff should have no fewer than two years in which to commence a suit. This recognition is consistent with R.C. 2305.10(A), the general products-liability statute of limitations, which states that, subject to certain exceptions (including those in R.C. 2305.10(C)), such a claim \u201cshall be brought within two years after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 196} In <em>Gaines, </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 60, 514 N.E.2d 709, this court stated: \u201c[A] legislative enactment may lawfully shorten the period of time in which the remedy may be realized \u2018as long as the claimant is still afforded a reasonable time in which to enforce his right.\u2019 <em>Adams v. Sherk </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 37, 39, 4 OBR 82, 84, 446 N.E.2d 165, 167. A \u2018reasonable time\u2019 in which to bring a medical malpractice claim was defined in <em>Adams </em>as \u2018one year after the discovery of the malpractice.\u2019 Id. at 40, 4 OBR at 85, 446 N.E.2d at 168. In the instant cause, appellant had approximately six and one-half months in which to pursue her claim * * *_ * -1= * Thus, [the statute at issue] cannot lawfully be applied to appellant and others similarly situated, since it affords them less than a reasonable time in which to bring a claim, <em>Adams, supra </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 197} This court determined that one year is a reasonable time to bring a medical-malpractice action because the general medical-malpractice statute of limitations provides one year. See R.C. 2305.113(A), formerly 2305.11(A). See <em>Adams, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 38-39, 4 OBR 82, 446 N.E.2d 165. See, also, <em>Baird v. Loeffler </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 533, 535-536, 23 O.O.3d 458, 433 N.E.2d 194 (\u201cthe statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions * * * provided appellee a reasonable time of one year in which to bring his suit\u201d), overruled on other grounds in <em>Mominee, </em>28 Ohio St.3d 270, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717, at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 198} We hold that former R.C. 2305.10(F) operates unreasonably as applied to petitioners because it provided them with only 34 days to commence their suit, with the consequence that they lost their cause of action if they did not file suit within 34 days. When we look to the other provisions of R.C. 2305.10 referred to above, we determine that a reasonable time to commence a suit in this situation should have been two years from the date of the injury. See <em>Adams, 4 </em>Ohio St.3d at 38, 4 OBR 82, 446 N.E.2d 165. Under this approach, because petitioners filed their suit within two years of the date of the injury, their suit was timely. To the extent that former R.C. 2305.10(F) mandates a different result, we hold that petitioners have met their burden of demonstrating that the statute as applied to them is unconstitutional under Section 28, Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 199} In light of the foregoing, we hold that to the extent that former R.C. 2305.10(F) (now (G)) affects an accrued substantive right by providing an unreasonably short period of time in which to file suit for certain plaintiffs whose injuries occurred before the S.B. 80 amendments to R.C. 2305.10 became effective, and whose causes of action therefore accrued for purposes of R.C. 2305.10(C), former R.C. 2305.10(F) is unconstitutionally retroactive under Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">E. The One-Subject Rule (Section 15(D), Article II, Ohio Constitution)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 200} Petitioners assert that S.B. 80, which enacted the provisions of R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) at issue in this case, violates the one-subject rule of Section 15(D), Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Section 15(D), Article II provides: \u201cNo bill shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 201} The petitioners in <em>Arbino </em>also attempted to assert a challenge to S.B. 80 based on the one-subject rule. In <em>Arbino, </em>we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 202} Section 15(D) \u201cexists to prevent the General Assembly from engaging in \u2018logrolling.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Dix v. Celeste </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 141, 142, 11 OBR 436, 464 N.E.2d 153. This practice occurs when legislators combine a disharmonious group of proposals in a single bill so that they may consolidate votes and pass provisions that may not have been acceptable to a majority on their own merits. See id. at 142-143, 11 OBR 436, 464 N.E.2d 153. \u2018The one-subject provision attacks logrolling by disallowing unnatural combinations of provisions in acts, <em>ie., </em>those dealing with more than one subject, on the theory that the best explanation for the unnatural combination is a tactical one \u2014 logrolling.\u2019 Id. at 143, 11 OBR 436, 464 N.E.2d 153. Arbino argues that S.B. 80 violates this provision by combining a variety of vastly different subjects under one title, lumping such subjects as Board of Cosmetology membership (R.C. 4713.02) and practice protocols for retired dentists (R.C. 4715.42) with the tort reforms discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 203} \u201cHowever, unlike in <em>[State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v.] Sheward </em>[ (1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062], where we were asked to examine H.B. 350 in its entirety, the review here is limited to three specific statutes within S.B. 80. Because the entire enactment was not made an issue in this case, we cannot determine whether it violates the single-subject rule as a whole, and therefore decline to rule on this issue.\u201d <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 204} Petitioners\u2019 challenge is limited to two specific statutes within S.B. 80\u2014 R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F). Therefore, <em>Arbino </em>applies. However, we now go further and explain in more detail why petitioners\u2019 challenge must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 205} Many of petitioners\u2019 principal arguments regarding the one-subject rule are based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062. In <em>Sheward, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus, this court held that \u201cAm.Sub.H.B. No. 350 violates the one-subject provision of Section 15(D), Article II of the Ohio Constitution, and is unconstitutional <em>in </em>toto.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axv\">{\u00b6 206} In <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 17, we discussed Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, the legislation struck down in <em>Sheward, </em>as part of our review of the recent history of tort-reform efforts in Ohio:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">{\u00b6 207} \u201c[T]he General Assembly passed substantial reforms in 1997 with Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3867 (\u2018H.B. 350\u2019). The legislation amended, enacted, or repealed over 100 sections of the Revised Code contained in 18 titles and 38 chapters. Among other things, it modified the collateral-source rule in tort actions to require the trier of fact to consider but not automatically set off collateral benefits (former R.C. 2317.45), capped punitive damages and allowed the trier of fact to determine damages up to the cap in tort and products-liability claims (former R.C. 2315.21(D)(1)), and capped noneconomic damages at different levels, with higher limits for permanent injuries (former R.C. 2323.54).\u201d {\u00b6 208} In holding H.B. 350 unconstitutional for violating the one-subject rule, this court in <em>Sheward </em>focused on the sheer disunity of its many and diverse subjects to find a \u201cmanifestly gross and fraudulent violation\u201d of Section 15(D), Article II. Id., 86 Ohio St.3d at 498, 715 N.E.2d 1062; see <em>Dix, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 141, 11 OBR 436, 464 N.E.2d 153, at the syllabus (a manifestly gross and fraudulent violation of the one-subject rule will cause an enactment to be invalidated). In addition to the provisions of H.B. 350 cited in <em>Arbino, </em>the <em>Sheward </em>court noted that H.B. 350 \u201cattempts to combine the wearing of seat belts with employment discrimination claims, class actions arising from the sale of securities with limitations on agency liability in actions against a hospital, recall notification with qualified immunity for athletic coaches, actions by a roller skater with supporting affidavits in a medical claim, and so on.\u201d Id., 86 Ohio St.3d at 498, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 209} The <em>Sheward </em>court stated that \u201cany suggestion of unity of subject matter [in H.B. 350] is illusory,\u201d that the various provisions of the act were \u201cblatantly unrelated,\u201d and that the act\u2019s denominated subject of \u201claws pertaining to tort and other civil actions\u201d was \u201ca ruse.\u201d Id. at 498 and 499, 715 N.E.2d 1062. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Furthermore, in holding H.B. 350 unconstitutional in toto, this court in <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 499-501, 715 N.E.2d 1062, declined to follow previous decisions that had severed portions of an act that violated the one-subject rule in order to save the portions that complied with the rule. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Hinkle v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 145, 580 N.E.2d 767 (primary subject of act was state judicial system, so parts of act concerning that subject survived; provision that was not part of that subject was severed); see also <em>In re Nowak, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 466, 2004-Ohio-6777, 820 N.E.2d 335 (bill held to violate one-subject rule by inclusion of statute governing mortgages; mortgage statute severed, remaining provisions saved).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">{\u00b6210} In contrast, although S.B. 80 did contain a considerable number of provisions, the core of the bill, concerning amendments to this state\u2019s tort law, is sufficiently unified to comply with the one-subject rule. The products-liability statute of repose is part of that core subject. Therefore, even were we to agree with petitioners that S.B. 80 contained provisions so unrelated to its primary subject as to violate the one-subject rule, we would sever the unrelated provisions and retain the core provisions intact consistent with our precedents, and R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F) would not be affected. See, e.g., <em>Hinkle </em>and <em>Nowak.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">F. Conclusion of Part III</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 211} In upholding the facial constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10(C) and former 2305.10(F), we join the considerable number of state and federal courts that have upheld the validity of products-liability statutes of repose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We additionally note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>that many courts have also upheld various other types of statutes of repose as constitutional.

Having the jury or judge specify the amounts allows the claimant to determine whether the fact-finder was discounting economic or non-economic parts of the award because of an assumed collateral source such as workers\u2019 compensation or insurance. If the award was so discounted, the claimant\u2019s \u2018demonstrated or proven damages\u2019 can be adjusted accordingly for purposes of the formula. R.C. 4123.931(D)(2).

Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, in light of the manner in which today\u2019s majority addresses, and ultimately disposes of, our decision in <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 639 N.E.2d 425. The majority claims only to limit <em>Brennaman </em>to its facts while leaving the decision intact, instead of forthrightly overruling a bad precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">{\u00b6 220} In <em>Galatis, </em>we set forth a three-part test to serve as a guide for when previous decisions should be overruled. We stated that a decision may be overruled only when \u201c(1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">{\u00b6 221} However, as a result of strict, unwavering adherence to this test, <em>Galatis </em>jurisprudence has itself become unworkable. Over the past year, there have been numerous instances where, rather than relying on <em>Galatis </em>to overrule a prior case, we have instead chosen to limit or otherwise distinguish that case, thereby avoiding a <em>Galatis </em>analysis. See <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420 (distinguishing but not overruling our decision in <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062); <em>State ex rel. Shelly Materials v. Clark Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59 (limiting but not overruling our decision in <em>State ex rel. R.T.G., Inc. v. State, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-6716, 780 N.E.2d 998); and <em>Cleveland Mobile Radio Sales, Inc. v. Verizon Wireless, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 394, 2007-Ohio-2203, 865 N.E.2d 1275 (distinguishing but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>not overruling our decision in <em>Rosette v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">{\u00b6 222} I am now persuaded that we should move away from the rigid rules of <em>Galatis </em>as a \u201chopelessly random and formulaic approach to overruling precedent,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shelly Materials, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 50 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting), and instead adopt a more flexible approach. Currently, decisions to which everyone has adjusted (they do not \u201cdef[y] practical workability\u201d) and on which anyone has relied (their abandonment would not \u201ccreate an undue hardship\u201d) may not be overruled as bad precedent, no matter how wrongly decided. This \u201clegalistic straitjacket,\u201d <em>Gliozzo v. Univ. Urologists of Cleveland, Inc., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 141, 2007-Ohio-3762, 870 N.E.2d 714, \u00b6 19 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting), should yield to a broader system of analysis that would also allow us greater freedom and enable us to be straightforward about overruling wrongly decided cases when it is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 223} In this case, the majority describes in many pages of the opinion the reasons why <em>Brennaman </em>was wrongly decided. Brennaman\u2019s lack of detail in overruling <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 193, 551 N.E.2d 938, is compared to Galatis\u2019s \u201cwell-structured\u201d approach. But given a prime opportunity to apply <em>Galatis </em>and state that <em>Brennaman </em>is overruled, the majority does not actually do so. It seems strange that an opinion that goes to such great lengths to praise <em>Galatis </em>ultimately fails to apply it. If <em>Galatis </em>constrains our decisions so greatly that we cannot acknowledge cases that have clearly been wrongly decided and require overruling, then it is of questionable value itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 224} To serve the need for predictability, consistency, and clarity in the law, we must be forthright about overruling cases when that is our true intent and is the practical effect of a decision. Choosing to draw distinctions in order to avoid the stringent requirements of <em>Galatis </em>does not create stability. Instead, it leads to confusion, leaving parties to struggle to determine what law is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 225} Because I view our decision as effectively overruling <em>Brennaman, </em>I respectfully concur only in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b328-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAT\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 226} I dissent from this court\u2019s holding that R.C. 2305.10 is facially constitutional. I concur with the majority that R.C. 2305.10 is unconstitutional as applied to the appellant and that R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 are facially constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">{\u00b6 227} It is hard to decide what is more offensive about the majority opinion regarding the facial constitutionality of R.C. 2305.10: how it arrives at its decision or what the decision means for Ohioans. How the decision will affect Ohioans is speculative at this point, but how the majority reaches its decision demonstrates a continued disdain for stare decisis and a propensity to engage in legal mumbo jumbo to obscure that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 228} Today, the majority bases its decision on <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 193, 551 N.E.2d 938, a case that has been overruled. It remains overruled. The case that overruled <em>Sedar </em>and declared statutes of repose unconstitutional pursuant to Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 639 N.E.2d 425, remains in effect. Somehow, it does not control this case. This court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062, which reiterated our holding in <em>Brennaman </em>when the General Assembly once again imposed statutes of repose, is ignored. What has changed since this court last overruled statutes of repose in 1994 and 1999? Not the language of the statutes in question and not the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 229} That this court was clear and blunt in <em>Brennaman </em>was no sin. Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution is also clear and blunt: \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 230} As we said in <em>Brennaman, </em>\u201cThis section of the Ohio Constitution protects the right to seek redress in Ohio\u2019s courts when one is injured by another.\u201d 70 Ohio St.3d at 466, 639 N.E.2d 425. <em>Brennaman </em>relied in part upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Burgess v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 59, 609 N.E.2d 140, in which \u201cthis court held that the General Assembly is constitutionally precluded from depriving a claimant of a right to a remedy \u2018before a claimant knew or should have known of her injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 466, 639 N.E.2d 425, quoting <em>Burgess, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 61, 609 N.E.2d 140. <em>Burgess, </em>in turn, relied upon \u201ca line of cases including <em>Mominee v. Scherbarth </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 270, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717, <em>Hardy v. VerMeulen </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 512 N.E.2d 626, and <em>Gaines v. Pretemu-Cleveland, Inc. </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 54, 514 N.E.2d 709, [in which] this court established a threshold point at which government may impose a statute of limitations on a potential claimant. That line of decisions established that a statute of limitations could not begin to run before a claimant knew or should have known of her injury.\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 60-61, 609 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>{\u00b6 231} As recently as two months ago, <em>Brennaman </em>was cited as authority by this court. In <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 44, the majority opinion cited <em>Brennaman </em>as an example of how this court has defined the rights associated with Section 16, Article I. The majority called this court\u2019s interpretation \u201cwell settled\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">(\u00b6 232} \u201cThe definition of these rights is well settled. \u2018When the Constitution speaks of remedy and injury to person, property, or reputation, it requires an opportunity granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 <em>Hardy v. VerMeulen </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 47, 512 N.E.2d 626. We have interpreted this provision to prohibit statutes that effectively prevent individuals from pursuing relief for their injuries. See, e.g., <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 466, 639 N.E.2d 425 (finding a statute of repose unconstitutional because it deprived certain plaintiffs of the right to sue before they were aware of their injuries) * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 233} For good measure, the <em>Arbino </em>majority cited <em>Brennaman </em>yet again later in the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 234} \u201cThis right [to a remedy in an open court] protects against laws that completely foreclose a cause of action for injured plaintiffs or otherwise eliminate the ability to receive a meaningful remedy. See <em>Brennaman, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 466, 639 N.E.2d 425.\u201d <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 96.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 235} The preceding paragraph should have controlled this case. But, in two months, <em>Brennaman </em>has morphed from a case worthy of citation as part of this court\u2019s well-settled jurisprudence regarding Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution to an object of derision by basically the same majority that relied upon it in <em>Arbino.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">{\u00b6 236} The majority states that stare decisis is \u201c \u2018limited to circumstances \u201cwhere the facts of a subsequent case are substantially the same as a former case,\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 539 N.E.2d 103. In considering R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931, the workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statutes at issue in this case, the majority does indeed describe the significant differences between those statutes and the statutes reviewed in <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111. However, the majority makes no attempt to distinguish the statute of repose contained in R.C. 2305.10 from the one at issue in <em>Brennaman </em>\u2014 because there is no significant difference, and because <em>Brennaman </em>so clearly and so inconveniently spells out that statutes of repose are unconstitutional in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">{\u00b6 237} The majority cites <em>Brennaman </em>as an illustration of the kind of \u201cunstructured approach to overruling a precedent\u201d that led to the more \u201cdisciplined\u201d approach set forth in <em>Westfield v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256. That approach necessarily includes an application of the talismanic <em>Galatis </em>factors. But the majority, in its attempted de facto overruling of <em>Brennaman, </em>employs none of the <em>Galatis </em>factors. Instead, it resorts to jurisprudence by insult. The author, who calls for civility in judicial opinions not her own <em>(State ex rel. Ohio Gen. Assembly v. Brunner, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 386, 2007-Ohio-3780, 872 N.E.2d 912, \u00b6 87), calls <em>Brennaman </em>\u201cthe classic example of the \u2018arbitrary administration of justice\u2019 that <em>Galatis </em>cautions against\u201d and claims that \u201cpersonal judicial whims\u201d drove the result. Does the majority really believe that this court decided <em>Brennaman </em>arbitrarily, on a whim? Does the majority really mean to suggest that <em>Brennaman </em>was written on impulse, resulting from a sudden, capricious idea? Or is the majority simply forced to insult this court\u2019s work in <em>Brennaman </em>because it has no basis to overrule it given the \u201cjudicial straitjacket\u201d the majority zipped itself into in <em>Galatisl </em>Does the majority mean to likewise insult the supreme courts of other states that have found statutes of repose unconstitutional? See <em>Heath v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1983), 123 N.H. 512, 464 A.2d 288; <em>Lankford v. Sullivan, Long &amp; Hagerty </em>(Ala.1982), 416 So.2d 996; <em>Hazine v. Montgomery Elevator Co. </em>(1993), 176 Ariz. 340, 861 P.2d 625; <em>Battilla v. Allis Chalmers Mfg. Co. </em>(Fla.1980), 392 So.2d 874; <em>Perkins v. Northeastern Log Homes </em>(Ky.1991), 808 S.W.2d 809; <em>Hanson v. Williams Cty. </em>(N.D.1986), 389 N.W.2d 319; <em>Kennedy v. Cumberland Eng. Co. </em>(R.I.1984), 471 A.2d 195; <em>Berry v. Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>(Utah 1985), 717 P.2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 238} The majority repeats the bromide that \u201cthe legislative branch is \u2018the ultimate arbiter of public policy,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 21. The governor, with his role in setting the public policy agenda and armed with a veto, might dispute that characterization. This court, as the steward of the ever-developing common law, also plays a vital role. But even accepting the majority\u2019s characterization of the legislature\u2019s role, the General Assembly may reach only as far as the Constitution allows. This court is the ultimate arbiter of what is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 239} I do not agree that this court owes all legislation passed by the General Assembly the presumption of constitutionality. This presumption, regrettably employed even by me in a few majority opinions, has no basis in the Constitution. Our role is to determine constitutionality, and we undermine our constitutional role by accepting any impingement on that power by any other branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 240} In <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062, this court held that the General Assembly\u2019s attempt to subvert this court\u2019s decision in <em>Brennaman </em>by again passing statutes of repose was unconstitutional. In 1996 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, the collection of statutes at issue in <em>Sheward, </em>the General Assembly reenacted the statute overturned in <em>Brennaman </em>as a 15-year statute of repose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>with certain exceptions, provided for a 15-year statute of repose for wrongful-death actions involving a products-liability claim, a 15-year statute of repose for products-liability claims, a six-year statute of repose for professional malpractice claims other than medical, and a six-year statute of repose for medical malpractice claims. See <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 476, 715 N.E.2d 1062. This court wrote that \u201c[i]n enacting and/or amending these sections, the General Assembly chose to usurp this court\u2019s constitutional authority by refusing to recognize our holdings in <em>Brennaman, Cyrus [v. Henes </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 640, 640 N.E.2d 810], and <em>Ross [v. Tom Reith, Inc. </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 563, 645 N.E.2d 729].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 241} In rejecting the General Assembly\u2019s attempt to reintroduce statutes of repose, the <em>Sheward </em>court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 242} \u201cThe following language from <em>Bartlett [v. State </em>(1905), 73 Ohio St. 54, 58, 75 N.E. 939], has particular force here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 243} \u201c Tt is sufficient to say that we adhere to [our prior] ruling [declaring acts to be in violation of the constitution]; and that the sections of the statutes now under consideration do not stop short of being a mandate to all of the courts [to accept as legal that which we have declared unconstitutional]. This we regard as wholly beyond the power conferred upon the general assembly by the constitution. The power conferred upon the general assembly is legislative power, and that body is expressly prohibited from exercising any judicial power which is not expressly conferred by the constitution. Article 2, section 32.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 244} \u201c \u2018At this time, the limits of the power invested in the respective coordinate branches of the government [are] so well defined and so generally understood, that we are constrained to believe that, whatever may have been the thought of the persons who drafted them, the enactment of these sections was an inadvertence on the part of the general assembly; for it is well settled that the legislature cannot annul, reverse or modify a judgment of a court already rendered, nor require the courts to treat as valid laws those which are unconstitutional. If this could be permitted the whole power of the government would at once become absorbed and taken into itself by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 477-478, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 245} Sheward\u2019s discussion on statutes of repose concluded with an admonition ignored by the majority in this case: \u201cWhile some members of this court, now and in the past, may disagree with the holding in <em>Brennaman, </em>no member of this court can, consistent with his or her oath of office, find that the General Assembly has operated within the boundaries of its constitutional authority by brushing aside a mandate of this court on constitutional issues as if it were of no consequence. Indeed, the very notion of it threatens the judiciary as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>independent branch of government and tears at the fabric of our Constitution.\u201d <em>Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 478, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 246} And so it goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6247} I would also hold that R.C. 2305.10 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Section 2, Article I guarantees that citizens shall not be denied equal protection of the law. When the legislation at issue creates classifications involving a fundamental right, it becomes the subject of strict judicial scrutiny and will be upheld only upon a showing that it is justified by a compelling state interest. <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 423, 633 N.E.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 248} In R.C. 2305.10(C), the General Assembly allows a person injured nine years after purchasing a product to assert a cause of action against the manufacturer, but bars a person injured ten years after purchasing a product from bringing the same claim. R.C. 2305.10 takes from one class of potential plaintiffs a fundamental right \u2014 the right to a remedy. The General Assembly has failed to assert a compelling state interest to legitimize that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 249} The majority applies a rational-basis review to R.C. 2305.10, finding that the statute does not implicate a fundamental right. Even under that standard of review, R.C. 2305.10 fails. In its \u201cstatement of findings and intent,\u201d found in Section 3(C) of 2004 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 80, the General Assembly unsuccessfully attempts to articulate a rational basis for the statute\u2019s distinctions. The majority seems satisfied that the General Assembly bothered to create a \u201cstatement of findings and intent,\u201d applying no analysis to the statement itself, other than quoting it and essentially saying, \u201cSounds good to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">{\u00b6250} The statement proclaims that subsequent to the delivery of the product, the manufacturer or supplier loses control over the product and that it is more appropriate for the party in control of the product during the intervening time period to be responsible for any harm caused by the product. But that loss of control happens immediately, not at the ten-year mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">{\u00b6 251} The General Assembly attempts to legitimize the ten-year distinction by stating, without any support, that more than ten years after delivery, \u201cit is very difficult for a manufacturer or supplier to locate reliable evidence and witnesses regarding the design, production, or marketing of the product.\u201d S.B. 180, Section 3(C)(5). However, the expiration of the statute of repose is an affirmative defense. Thus, the burden will still be on the manufacturer to produce records showing that the product in question has been out of its hands for a period of more than ten years. In the absence of such a showing, there can be no affirmative defense. Thus, manufacturers will need to continue to maintain records. Second, the absence of records regarding a product is a greater handicap to a plaintiff trying to prove a defect than it is to the manufacturer. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>a products-liability case, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the product in question is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">{\u00b6 252} The General Assembly suggests that the statute of repose will prevent the inappropriate application of current technological standards to older products. S.B. 80, Section 3(C)(6). This is a solution to a problem that does not exist. There is no statutory or case law that requires an older product to conform to current technological standards in a products-liability case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 253} The General Assembly also claims that the statute of repose will \u201cenhance the competitiveness of Ohio manufacturers.\u201d Section 3(C)(7). However, one of the actual effects of the statute of repose in this case is to allow an out-of-state manufacturer to escape liability. Meanwhile, Groch\u2019s Ohio employer, General Motors, remains completely liable and without any way to seek indemnification or contribution from the out-of-state manufacturer of the product that caused Groch\u2019s injuries. Thus, in this case, the statute of repose is actually harming a company manufacturing in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 254} Any serious review of the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cstatement of findings and intent\u201d would show that the statement is devoid of factual findings. Whether the statement is honest about the General Assembly\u2019s real intent is dubious. In any case, it does not set forth a rational basis for discriminating against certain victims of defective products.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 255} We do not know yet the full impact of this case on Ohioans. We only know of its potential. Potentially, R.C. 2305.10 affects anyone who drives a car, crosses a bridge, rides an elevator, flies or rides in an airplane, utilizes a medical device, paints, mows grass, uses tools, or depends at all on any product in his or her daily existence. As an example, we can look to Minnesota and the aftermath of the recent 1-35 bridge collapse. Early indicators are that the bridge\u2019s collapse may have originated with the failure of gusset plates that were sized too thin in the bridge\u2019s original 1960s design, http://www.startribune.com/local/13796646. html. The bridge collapse presents an example of a design that was flawed ab initio; the bridge\u2019s eventual collapse was built into it and was not the result of degrading materials. In Ohio, under the majority\u2019s view, none of the victims of the collapse could recover against the designer of the bridge or the supplier of the gusset plates. In Ohio, if the collapse were due to substandard concrete or steel, those suppliers would escape liability if the bridge had been able to remain standing for merely a decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 256} We can look to the past to the infamous Ford Pinto, which had an alleged design flaw that made the car susceptible to bursting into flames upon a rear-end collision. In reviewing a jury verdict that found Ford liable for injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>suffered in such an accident, the court in <em>Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1981), 119 Cal.App.3d 757, 813, 174 Cal.Rptr. 348, found:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">{\u00b6 257} \u201cThrough the results of the crash tests Ford knew that the Pinto\u2019s fuel tank and rear structure would expose consumers to serious injury or death in a 20- to 30-mile-per-hour collision. There was evidence that Ford could have corrected the hazardous design defects at minimal cost but decided to defer correction of the shortcomings by <em>engaging in a </em>cost-benefit analysis balancing human lives and limbs against corporate profits. Ford\u2019s institutional mentality was shown to be one of callous indifference to public safety. There was substantial evidence that Ford\u2019s conduct constituted \u2018conscious disregard\u2019 of the probability of injury to members of the consuming public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 258} Again, with the Pinto, the injury-causing flaw was part of the original design of the vehicle. It was not Ford\u2019s lack of control over the product that led to the plaintiffs injuries; rather, the accident exposed the flaw that was in the Pinto to begin with. In Ohio, no matter what Ford knew or when it knew it, if the accident occurred after ten years from delivery, a plaintiff could have no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 259} Finally, we can look to the details of R.C. 2305.10, and the exceptions the General Assembly has carved out for certain products. The statute of repose contained in R.C. 2305.10(C) does not apply to certain claims \u2014 where symptoms tied to exposure often arise beyond ten years after exposure \u2014 involving the products described in R.C. 2305.10(B)(1) (hazardous or toxic chemicals, ethical drugs, or ethical medical devices), (B)(2) (chromium), (B)(3) (chemical defoliants or herbicides, including agent orange), and (B)(4) (diethylstilbestrol or other nonsteroidal synthetic estrogens). R.C. 2305.10(C)(7). Presumably, the General Assembly excepted these products because they have been proven to cause injuries years after a potential plaintiff was exposed to them. Products causing delayed injuries exist. Can we assume that the limited list of products in R.C. 2305.10(B) accounts for all such products? We should not. What is the product used by Ohioans today that will fail a decade from now? What is the product used by Ohioans today that is causing damage that will not be revealed until a decade from now? We cannot know. It is a harrowing thought that the products we use today that may be ticking time bombs \u2014 be they food additives, cell phones, automobiles \u2014 after ten years can leave us profoundly injured with no hope of recovery against the tortfeasor. For manufacturers, the bomb stops ticking at ten years. For Ohio\u2019s consumers, once but no longer protected by the Ohio Constitution, the ticking continues.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ayqx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Gallon, Takacs, Boissoneault &amp; Schaffer Co., L.P.A., Kevin J.
