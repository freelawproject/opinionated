Because the court of appeals held otherwise, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">{\u00b6 2} In 1987, Maebelle Osborn established an inter vivos trust for the benefit of herself and her three children, Charlotte Osborn (who has physical and mental disabilities), Loretta Pack, and Arthur Osborn. The trust provided that upon the deaths of Maebelle and Charlotte, the trust would terminate, and the remaining principal and income would be distributed to the surviving children or their heirs. The trust named Maebelle as trustee and Loretta as successor trustee. Maebelle Osborn died in 1992. When the underlying case was filed, the trust assets were valued at approximately $265,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">{\u00b6 3} According to Item 2(a) of the trust, the successor trustee is permitted to make income or principal distributions, in her sole discretion, for the benefit of Maebelle\u2019s children \u201conly for purposes other than providing food, clothing or shelter that is to be used only to meet supplemental needs over and above those met by entitlement benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">{\u00b6 4} On May 7, 2004, Charlotte applied for Medicaid, and the trustee filed this declaratory-judgment action in the trial court, naming Licking County Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cLCDJFS\u201d) a defendant and requesting that the trust assets be declared unavailable and not a countable resource for purposes of determining Charlotte\u2019s eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid. Alternatively, the trustee requested that the trust be reformed to meet the current statutory and regulatory standards for trusts that are noncountable resources.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The trial court magistrate granted summary judgment to LCDJFS, determining that the trust corpus is a countable resource that the trustee can be compelled to invade for Charlotte\u2019s medical care and maintenance. The trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings, noting that the trust did not meet the present guidelines to be a noncountable resource for Medicaid-eligibility purposes. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that eligibility-review guidelines in place at the time the trust was created, rather than those in place at the time the application for benefits is filed, apply when making a Medicaid-eligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 6} Thereafter, the appellate court certified its decision as being in conflict with four cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We determined that a conflict exists regarding whether the Medicaid-eligibility rules to be applied to an applicant who is a beneficiary of an inter vivos trust are those in effect at the time of the creation of the trust or those in effect at the time of the application. <em>Pack v. Osborn, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1407, 2006-Ohio-5083, 854 N.E.2d 1088. We also accepted LCDJFS\u2019s discretionary appeal and consolidated the cases. Ill Ohio St.3d 1410, 2006-Ohio-5083, 854 N.E.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">{\u00b6 7} In general, a \u201ctrust\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018the right, enforceable in equity, to the beneficial enjoyment of property, the legal title to which is in another.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Lombardo </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 600, 603, 716 N.E.2d 189, quoting <em>Ulmer v. Fulton </em>(1935), 129 Ohio St. 323, 339, 2 O.O. 326, 195 N.E. 557. The beneficiary is said to have the equitable interest in the trust, whereas the trustee has the legal interest. Restatement of the Law 2d, Trusts (1959), Section 2, comment f.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">{\u00b6 8} When a court reviews a trust, its primary duty is to ascertain, within the bounds of the law, the intent of the settlor. <em>In re Trust U/W of Brooke </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 553, 557, 697 N.E.2d 191, citing <em>Domo v. McCarthy </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 312, 314, 612 N.E.2d 706. When the instrument is unambiguous, the settlor\u2019s intent can be determined from the trust\u2019s express language. Id. The words in the trust are presumed to be used according to their common, ordinary meaning. Id. When determining the settlor\u2019s intent, an inter vivos trust \u201cspeaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>from the date of its creation \u2014 not the date upon which the assets are distributed.\u201d <em>Ohio Citizens Bank v. Mills </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 153, 156, 543 N.E.2d 1206; <em>First Natl. Bank of Cincinnati v. Tenney </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 513, 518, 60 O.O. 481, 138 N.E.2d 15; 91 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2005) 71, Trusts, Section 42. Thus, a trust is construed according to the law in effect at the time it was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">{\u00b6 9} When a trust beneficiary requests public assistance, the state first determines the nature of the trust in which the applicant has an equitable interest. R.C. 5111.151; Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1. The nature of the trust determines whether its assets are available resources in determining whether the applicant\u2019s resources exceed the maximum limit for Medicaid eligibility. Id.; see also Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">{\u00b6 10} The eligibility-review rules with respect to trust interests have been frequently amended. One reason for the frequent amendments has been to close loopholes in the program so that taxpayers are not forced to accept primary responsibility for the care of persons who have access to resources that would allow them to pay for their own care. See, e.g., <em>Young v. Ohio Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 547, 549 (majority opinion), 552 (Pfeifer, J., concurring), and 552-553 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting), 668 N.E.2d 908. The underlying public-policy principle advanced is that \u201c[t]he primary responsibility for the support of an individual lies with that individual.\u201d Id. at 549, 668 N.E.2d 908. As a result, the eligibility-review rules have become increasingly stringent, and the determination of which rules to apply to an applicant who is also a trust beneficiary has real significance regarding the depletion or preservation of the trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">{\u00b6 11} As the eligibility rules have become more stringent, the General Assembly has also continued to recognize that public assistance does not, and cannot, meet all the needs of persons with disabilities, and therefore, the rules do allow assets in supplemental-services and special-needs trusts to go uncounted. See, e.g., R.C. 5111.151(F)(1) and (4); R.C. 5815.28 (formerly 1339.51); Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-27.1(C)(3)(a), (d). In other words, when a trust meets specific statutory requirements, it can be used to provide financial support to a person with special needs without affecting the person\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">{\u00b6 12} Although a trust is construed according to the law in effect at the time the trust was created, <em>Mills, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 156, 543 N.E.2d 1206, eligibility for public assistance is determined at the time an application for such assistance is made, <em>Young, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 551, 668 N.E.2d 908. The rules regarding eligibility for public assistance are not forever locked into place by the establishment of a trust. See, e.g., Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-27.1(D) (current \u201crule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>supersedes all previous rules governing trusts, and the administrative agency shall apply it prospectively to all determinations and redeterminations of eligibility for all individuals\u201d). It is a long-standing principle that no person has a vested right to the law remaining unchanged. <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 214, 527 N.E.2d 1235 (referring in general to the legislature\u2019s ability to abolish common-law rights of action); <em>Zanesville v. Zanesville Gas-Light Co. </em>(1889), 47 Ohio St. 1, 32, 23 N.E. 55 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">{\u00b6 13} And in the arena of Medicaid, the legislature is within its authority, absent some constitutional limitation, to revise eligibility rules as it balances public resources against public needs. See, e.g., 76 Ohio Report No. 226, Gongwer News Service, Inc. (Nov. 16, 2007) (Medicaid annual budget exceeds $12 billion for the 1.744 million Ohioans receiving benefits); 85 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2004) 90, Statutes, Section 68 (\u201cThere is no question that the General Assembly can make amendments to, or exceptions for, previously enacted legislation\u201d). It is not difficult to foresee that if persons, through the creation of private trusts, were able to, in effect, suspend the legislature\u2019s authority to change the rules of eligibility pertaining to the beneficiaries of those trusts, it would not be long before the state would have very little control over who could receive benefits from this expensive program.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 14} For this reason, we recognize the General Assembly\u2019s authority to change the Medicaid eligibility-review rules. The recently enacted R.C. 5111.151, reflecting the legislature\u2019s adoption of portions of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1, is an example of the exercise of such authority. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 85, 150 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3,065, 3,097, effective March 9, 2004. The General Assembly has established the law applicable to Medicaid-eligibility reviews of applicants who are trust beneficiaries. Therefore, in answer to the issue raised, we hold that when a trust beneficiary makes an application for participation in Medicaid, the Medicaid-eligibility-review rules in effect at the time the application is filed govern the applicant\u2019s eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">{\u00b6 15} Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court of appeals did not determine the nature of the trust in which Charlotte has an equitable interest. Such inquiry, however, is a necessary first step in determining whether the trust assets are countable for purposes of a Medicaid-eligibility determination. Thus, we remand this matter to the court of appeals for such a determination. On remand, the appellate court should consider the following important principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">{\u00b6 16} In a trust established by a settlor for the benefit of another who later applies for Medicaid, the assets are available resources only if the terms of the trust permit \u201cthe trustee to expend principal, corpus, or assets of the trust for the applicant\u2019s * * * medical care, care, comfort, maintenance, health, welfare, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>general well being, or any combination of these purposes.\u201d R.C. 5111.151(G)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-27.1(C)(4)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Provided the trustee has the discretion to make distributions for the above purposes, the assets in the trust remain available notwithstanding a provision in the trust that clearly prohibits a trustee from making a distribution that would affect Medicaid eligibility. R.C. 5111.151(G)(3); Ohio Adm.Code 5101:l-39-27.1(C)(4)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">{\u00b6 17} Trusts that give the trustee the \u201csole and absolute\u201d discretion to make income and principal distributions for a beneficiary\u2019s medical care, care, comfort, maintenance, health, welfare, and general well-being are discretionary trusts, but the trustee must base his or her decisions on the needs of the beneficiary, and his or her discretion can be judged by that standard (\u201csupport standard\u201d). Restatement of the Law 3d, Trusts (2003), Section 50. The common-law interpretation of such trusts is that a trustee may be compelled to make distributions consistent with the trust\u2019s support terms for the benefit of the beneficiary. <em>Bur. of Support in the Dept. of Mental Hygiene &amp; Corr. v. Kreitzer </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 147, 45 O.O.2d 480, 243 N.E.2d 83, paragraph two of the syllabus, superseded by statute, Am.Sub.S.B. No. 124, 144 Ohio Laws, Part I, 590, 687, Section 8, effective April 16, 1993 (Section 8 of S.B. No. 124 refers to R.C. 1339.51, which was renumbered R.C. 5815.28 by 2006 Sub.H.B. No. 416, effective January 1, 2007). See also <em>Martin v. Martin </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 101, 8 O.O.3d 106, 374 N.E.2d 1384, paragraph one of the syllabus (trustees of a discretionary trust subject to a support standard may be required to exercise their discretion to distribute income and principal in accordance with the standard); <em>Metz, </em>145 Ohio App.3d 304, 762 N.E.2d 1032. The foregoing common-law principle has been codified in the statutory and administrative rules of R.C. 5111.151 and Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1, and causes assets in such trusts to be considered available resources of a Medicaid applicant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">{\u00b6 18} In contrast, a trust that allows the trustee the uncontrolled discretion to distribute income and principal as the trustee determines, without a support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>standard, is a pure discretionary trust. <em>In re Estate of Temansky </em>(9th Dist. 1957), 4 O.O.2d 329, 141 N.E.2d 189; <em>Morris v. Daiker </em>(1929), 35 Ohio App. 394, 172 N.E. 540. No court can compel a trustee of a pure discretionary trust to exercise the trustee\u2019s discretion to distribute income or principal, unless the trustee acts in bad faith, dishonestly, or with an improper motive. <em>Culver v. Culver </em>(1960), 112 Ohio App. 100, 105, 16 O.O.2d 38, 169 N.E.2d 486; <em>Temansky, 4 </em>O.O.2d 329, 141 N.E.2d at 192-193. With the enactment of 2006 Sub.H.B. 416, effective January 1, 2007, pure discretionary trusts are now legislatively recognized and sanctioned. R.C. 5801.01(Y) (\u201cwholly discretionary trust\u201d defined).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 19} A significant aspect of a pure discretionary trust is that its assets are not recognized as an available resource in the Medicaid-eligibility review because a pure discretionary trust lacks a mechanism through which a beneficiary may compel a distribution. See R.C. 5111.151(G)(4)(e), (g), and (h); and Ohio Adm. Code 5101:l-39-27.1(C)(4)(c)(v), (vii), and (viii). See also <em>Young, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 551, 668 N.E.2d 908 (concluding that under the applicable Medicaid-eligibility rules, the fact that the discretionary trust did not include a support standard meant that the beneficiary could not compel the trustee to make a distribution, and therefore the beneficiary had no control of the resource, and it should not be counted in assessing the beneficiary\u2019s Medicaid eligibility).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 20} On remand, the court of appeals will need to determine (1) the nature of Charlotte\u2019s interest in the trust, construing the trust according to the law in effect at the time it was created, and (2) whether the trust is an available resource under the Medicaid-eligibility rules in effect at the time of Charlotte\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">{\u00b6 21} As a final matter, the trustee herein sought a declaratory judgment. The trustee sought guidance regarding her duties with respect to the proper administration of the trust, in particular, whether she can be compelled to make distributions to Charlotte.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">{\u00b6 22} The ability of a trustee to invoke the jurisdiction of a court is a matter that has been legislatively addressed. According to statute, a trustee may bring a declaratory-judgment action to determine any question arising in the administration of the trust. R.C. 2721.05(C) and 5802.01(C). Moreover, court involvement with respect to interpretation of a trust\u2019s terms in the Medicaid-eligibility context has been legislatively sanctioned. R.C. 5111.151(G)(4)(e), (g), and (h) (these subsections are comparable to Ohio Adm.Code subsections 5101:1 \u2014 39\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>27.1(C)(4)(e)(v), (vii), and (viii), which recognize that certain court judgments will cause trust assets to be noncountable resources).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AiJ\">Browning &amp; Meyer Co., L.P.A., and William J. Browning; and Isaac, Brant, Ledman &amp; Teetor, L.L.P., Dennis Newman, and Mark H. Troutman, for appellee Loretta Pack.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ALq\">Rachel C. Oktavec, Assistant Licking County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AB\">Marc Dann, Attorney General, Elise Porter, Acting Solicitor General, Stephen P. Carney, Deputy Solicitor, and Ara Mekhjian, Assistant Solicitor, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1_\">Hickman <em>&amp; </em>Lowder Co., L.P.A., Janet L. Lowder, and David A. Myers; Krugliak, Wilkins, Griffiths &amp; Dougherty Co., L.P.A., Richard E. Davis, and Jennifer L. Lile; and Eugene P. Whetzel, Ohio State Bar Association, urging affirmance for amici curiae Ohio State Bar Association, National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, and Down Syndrome Association of Central Ohio.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">{\u00b6 23} In light of the foregoing, it is difficult to accept the Attorney General\u2019s argument in his amicus brief that a trustee\u2019s request for interpretation of a trust\u2019s terms for purposes of Medicaid eligibility amounts to bypassing the Department of Job and Family Services\u2019 administrative Medicaid-eligibility review. Instead, pursuant to such request, the court interprets the trust, and its interpretation must be used in the Medicaid-eligibility-review process. It is through this procedure that the nature of the trust is ascertained \u2014 i.e., whether the trust is a pure discretionary trust or a discretionary trust with a support standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, the trustee\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment was a proper method by which to obtain judicial guidance regarding her duties under the trust.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 25} For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\">. As mentioned above, the same day the trustee filed the declaratory-judgment action, Charlotte applied for Medicaid with LCDJFS. The following month, LCDJFS determined that it would consider the trust assets as a renewable and countable resource in assessing Charlotte\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. LCDJFS then declined eligibility because Charlotte\u2019s assets exceeded the $1,500 limitation. Charlotte\u2019s direct appeal of LCDJFS\u2019s administrative decision is presently stayed, pending the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\">.
