The commission approved an application by intervening appellee, AT &amp; T Ohio (\u201cAT &amp; T\u201d), for alternative regulation of its- basic local exchange telephone service in 136 of AT &amp; T\u2019s telephone exchanges. OCC appealed, arguing that the decision is unlawful due to the inadequacy of the commission\u2019s rules and their improper application.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 2} We hold that the commission appropriately relied on the statutory amendments and created lawful and reasonable tests to effectuate those changes. Likewise, we affirm the commission\u2019s factual determinations in approving AT &amp; T\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">{\u00b6 3} On November 4, 2005, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 218 (\u201cH.B. 218\u201d) took effect, amending certain provisions of the state telecommunications law. Affected statutes include R.C. 4905.04, 4927.02, 4927.03, and 4927.04. This appeal deals with changes to R.C. 4927.02 and 4927.03, which deal with exemption from regulation and alternative regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">{\u00b6 4} The amendments to R.C. 4927.02 set forth the policy in this area of the law, which includes reliance on market forces to maintain just and reasonable rates, consideration of competitive services in determining the scope of the commission\u2019s regulation, and a prohibition against unduly favoring or disadvantaging providers of competing services. R.C. 4927.02(B) directs that the commission use these policy guidelines to carry out the chapter and to reduce or eliminate the regulation of telephone companies under those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">{\u00b6 5} Together with these new policy considerations, the General Assembly expanded the services eligible for alternative regulation in R.C. 4927.03(A)(1) by authorizing the commission to grant alternative regulation of basic local exchange service (\u201cBLES\u201d) offered by incumbent local exchange companies (\u201cILECs\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Previously, the statute allowed alternative regulation for any service other than BLES.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 4927.03(A)(1) allows the commission to exempt phone companies from traditional rate regulation when it is in the public interest and either the utility is \u201csubject to competition\u201d for that service or customers have \u201creasonably available alternatives.\u201d R.C. 4927.03(A)(1)(a) and (b). In addition, the commission must find that there are \u201cno barriers to entry.\u201d R.C. 4927.03(A)(3). R.C. 4927.03(C) allows the commission to abrogate or modify orders awarding alternative regulation if the findings it relied on are no longer valid and if that action is in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 7} In response to H.B. 218, the commission established rules for the alternative regulation of basic local exchange service. See Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-4-01 et seq.; <em>In the Matter of the Implementation of H.B. 218 Concerning Alternative Regulation of Basic Local Exchange Service of Incumbent Local Exchange Telephone Companies </em>(Mar. 7, 2006), PUCO No. 05-1305-TP-ORD, 2006 WL 707476 <em>(\u201c05-1305\u201d). </em>These rules covered everything from the geographic area that would be considered for awarding alternative regulation to the tests an ILEC must meet to be eligible for alternative regulation. The rules became effective on August 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 8} In Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-4-10(0), the commission established four competitive tests to determine eligibility for alternative regulation. An applicant must satisfy at least one of these tests. The most important tests for purposes of this appeal are Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-4-10(0(3) and (4) (\u201cTest 3\u201d and \u201cTest 4\u201d). AT &amp; T relied on Test 3 for 26 of its requested exchanges and on Test 4 for the remaining 119. Certain shared elements of the tests are challenged in this case by OCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 9} Test 3 has three main requirements. First, the applicant must demonstrate in each requested exchange that at least 15 percent of the total residential access lines are provided by unaffiliated competitive local exchange carriers. Second, the applicant must demonstrate the presence of at least two unaffiliated facilities-based competitive local exchange carriers providing basic local exchange service to residential customers. Third, the applicant must demonstrate the presence of at least five alternative providers serving the residential market. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-4-01(B) defines an alternative provider as a provider of competing services to the basic local exchange service offerings, regardless of the technology and facilities used in the delivery of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Test 4 requires that the applicant demonstrate that in each requested exchange area, the applicant has lost at least 15 percent of total residential access lines since 2002. The applicant must also demonstrate the presence of at least five unaffiliated faeilities-based alternative providers serving the residential market.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 11} On December 20, 2006, the commission issued an opinion and order approving AT &amp; T\u2019s application for alternative regulation of its basic local exchange telephone service in 136 of the requested 145 telephone exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 4903.13 provides that a PUCO order shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds the order to be unlawful or unreasonable. Under this statutory standard, this court will not reverse or modify a PUCO decision as to questions of fact when the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show that the PUCO\u2019s determination is not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and is not so clearly unsupported by the record that it shows misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 549, 555, 728 N.E.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 13} This presents a heavy burden for the party challenging an order, because this court has consistently deferred to the commission\u2019s judgment in matters that require the commission to apply its special expertise and discretion to make factual determinations. <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 177, 180, 749 N.E.2d 262; <em>AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 150, 154, 555 N.E.2d 288; <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 105, 108, 75 0.0.2d 172, 346 N.E.2d 778. In <em>Stephens v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 44, 2004-Ohio-1798, 806 N.E.2d 527, the commission found under R.C. 4927.03(A)(1)(a) that a telephone company was \u201csubject to competition\u201d for purposes of eligibility for exemption from traditional regulation. We stated that if \u201ca finding or decision of the commission is supported by sufficient record evidence, as is the case in this appeal, the court will not weigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the commission.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16, citing <em>Time Warner AxS v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 229, 233, 661 N.E.2d 1097. As in the present case, <em>Stephens </em>dealt with a factual determination under R.C. 4927.03(A)(1) that a telephone company was \u201csubject to competition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 14} Although we defer to factual findings and conclusions by the commission, this court has \u201ccomplete and independent power of review as to all questions of law\u201d in appeals from the commission. <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922. Nevertheless, we have explained that we may rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201chighly specialized issues\u201d are involved and \u201cwhere agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110,12 O.O.3d 115, 388 N.E.2d 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"agn-dedup-0\">Stand-Alone Service</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 15} In its first proposition of law, OCC argues that the commission\u2019s analysis of what constitutes a competitive service under the competitive tests is too broad. Specifically, OCC asserts that the commission should not consider bundled-service offerings as \u201ccompetition\u201d for basic service when determining whether an applicant is \u201csubject to competition.\u201d OCC asserts that because alternative treatment was already available for packages that include basic local exchange service, the changes in H.B. 218 apply only to stand-alone service, and only providers of stand-alone service count as \u201ccompetition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 16} The commission found that customers receiving basic local exchange service as part of a package are still considered basic local exchange service customers. Thus, the providers of those bundled services are potential alternative providers. The commission admits that alternative basic local exchange services might not be currently offered under terms and conditions identical to those offered by stand-alone providers, but argues that functionally equivalent or substitute services are readily available at competitive rates, terms, and conditions. The commission contends that R.C. 4927.03(A)(1) does not restrict the field of competitors and reasonably available alternatives to products that are exactly like the applicant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 17} The commission relied on evidence that AT &amp; T had lost local exchange service customers in the presence of alternative providers and concluded that those customers must have found the other providers\u2019 rates, terms, and conditions to be a competitive and reasonable alternative to or substitute for AT &amp; T\u2019s basic service. The commission suggests that it is reasonable to assume that customers would not have switched from AT &amp; T\u2019s basic local exchange service had customers not found competitive rates, terms, and conditions elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 18} In H.B. 218, the General Assembly amended R.C. 4927.02, which sets forth the policy for alternative regulation, in concert with R.C. 4927.03, which sets forth the requirements for eligibility. R.C. 4927.03 requires that the commission rely on market forces and consider the regulatory treatment of competing and functionally equivalent services when determining how and whether to regulate a given service. R.C. 4927.02(A)(2) and (6). The changes also include a preference for reducing or eliminating regulation of telephone companies in these areas. R.C. 4927.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>{\u00b6 19} It is in the framework of these statutory changes that we review the relevant statutory provisions. R.C. 4927.03(A)(1)(a) and (b) require the commission to find either that the applicant is subject to competition for the service or that there are reasonably available alternatives to the service. R.C. 4927.03(A)(2)(c) directs that the commission, in making this finding, shall consider whether alternative providers are able to make \u201cfunctionally equivalent or substitute services\u201d readily available on competitive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 20} The central issue is the scope of the term \u201ccompetition\u201d as used in R.C. 4927.03(A)(l)(a)\u2019s phrase \u201csubject to competition.\u201d If bundled services are providing competition to basic service, then those packages must be a part of the discussion. The question is which services compete with basic service.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 21} OCC\u2019s argument fails to recognize the legislative guidance provided by the changes to the policy section of the chapter in R.C. 4927.02. The General Assembly provided the commission with new standards to consider when determining eligibility for alternative regulation, and those standards included the consideration of the larger environment of voice communication providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 22} The commission established that bundled services provide competition to basic phone service. The commission determined that customers are switching service in the presence of competitors and that those customers find the alternative services to be adequate substitutes for AT <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s services. The court will not reverse or modify a commission decision as to questions of fact in cases in which the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show that the commission\u2019s decision was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and was not so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>Monongahela Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 571, 2004-Ohio-6896, 820 N.E.2d 921, \u00b6 29. OCC has demonstrated that the alternative providers\u2019 services are different and offered at a variety of prices, but that showing does not overcome the commission\u2019s finding that those services are providing reasonable, competitive substitutes for basic local exchange service. We defer to the commission\u2019s expertise on this matter. Accordingly, we reject OCC\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Extent of Market Presence</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 23} In its fifth proposition, OCC challenges the commission\u2019s application of Tests 3 and 4, which award alternative regulation if the applicant shows, inter alia, the presence of a minimum number of qualified alternative providers serving the residential market in each requested exchange area. OCC asserts that the four cable companies AT &amp; T offered as alternative providers under both tests do not serve the entirety of the\u2019exchange areas, and the commission violated statutory requirements when it considered those providers. Failure to serve the entire exchange means that the service is not \u201creadily available\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>meaning of R.C. 4927.03(A)(2)(d). OCC makes similar claims about wireless carriers, arguing that unreliable and varying signal strength means that service may not be available at all times at all locations within an exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 24} The commission argues that there is no requirement that all alternative providers offer ubiquitous service throughout the exchange. In its order, the commission called OCC\u2019s argument a \u201cnarrow interpretation,\u201d contending that OCC\u2019s position would require the relevant market to be reduced from an exchange to an area as small as a city block to ensure that every single customer has access to all alternate providers. The commission stated that OCC\u2019s argument would even require the commission to test cell coverage in individual homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 25} This dispute centers on the geographic area the commission approved to consider alternative regulation. According to R.C. 4927.03(A)(2)(b), the commission is required to consider the \u201cextent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market.\u201d The commission determined in the <em>05-1305 </em>rulemaking proceeding that a telephone exchange was the relevant market it would utilize for this analysis. This term is defined in the commission\u2019s rules as \u201ca geographical service area established by an [incumbent local exchange carrier] and approved by the commission, which usually embraces a city, town, or village and a designated surrounding or adjacent area. There are currently seven hundred thirty-eight exchanges in the state.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-4-01(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 26} We affirm the commission\u2019s finding that alternative providers have services readily available in AT &amp; T\u2019s exchanges. The commission established the exchange area to judge the overall presence in that area, not a subset of that area. The commission found no requirement in the law or in its rules that an alternative provider must serve 100 percent of the relevant market. The commission points out that OCC supported using the telephone exchange as the relevant market in the <em>05-1305 </em>rulemaking case. The area is small enough to share common characteristics while still providing years of historical data. Thus, it is reasonable to accept the commission\u2019s determination to judge the area as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u201cPresence\u201d of Alternative Providers</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 27} OCC\u2019s first proposition questions the legitimacy of Test 4, arguing that by requiring only the \u201cpresence\u201d of alternative providers in the exchange, the test fails to consider the size of those providers or other indicators of market power such as market share or growth, as required by R.C. 4927.03(A)(2). OCC\u2019s concern is that the mere presence in the market of an alternative provider does not show that the provider is able to contribute to a healthy, sustainable competitive market. See R.C. 4927.02(A)(2). OCC suggests that longevity is a better indicator of market power.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The commission disagreed in its order, stating that Test 4 measures the overall state of the competitive market by considering the presence of a significant number of competitive providers in the relevant market in combination with the applicant\u2019s loss of a considerable share of its access lines. The commission found that factors like longevity in the market, while noteworthy, did not have a direct bearing on the state of the competitive market at any given point in time. The commission found that objective criteria, such as the required presence of several facilities-based providers, are more significant in demonstrating a healthy sustainable market, in that the actual presence of facilities-based providers demonstrates a greater commitment by those providers to remain in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 4927.03(A)(2)(d) enumerates factors to be considered by the commission. Those factors include \u201c[ojther indicators of market power, which may include market share, growth in market share, ease of entry, and the affiliation of providers of services.\u201d Ultimately, this is a factual determination. In essence, OCC is attempting to attack a factual determination by the commission. But OCC has failed to show that the commission\u2019s decision is unsupported by sufficient record evidence, and this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the commission. <em>Stephens v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 44, 2004-Ohio-1798, 806 N.E.2d 527, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 30} The commission\u2019s approach to assessing competition recognizes the realities of the market by, for instance, requiring that the unaffiliated alternative providers be facilities-based. A facilities-based provider has a physical presence in the state and has invested in plant and equipment, which demonstrates a long-term commitment to stay in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 31} Understanding of the current market is crucial to the analysis here. We defer to the commission\u2019s expertise in this regard. The commission complied with R.C. 4927.03(A)(2) by designing a test that, in its judgment, measures the extent of competition in the relevant market and made a factual finding based on the record and its expertise. We reject OCC\u2019s challenge to the commission\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Access-Line Loss</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 32} OCC\u2019s second proposition challenges the relevance of the applicant\u2019s access-line losses since 2002 as a prong of Test 4. This line-loss prong requires a showing that the applicant lost at least 15 percent of its residential access lines in each requested exchange since 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 33} OCC questions the relevance of the line-loss provision to the statutory criteria in R.C. 4927.03(A). OCC argues that line loss establishes only that lines were lost, not that they were gained by a competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>{\u00b6 34} The commission discussed in its order the different factors it weighed in fashioning Test 4 and determining that lost lines should be a factor. It concluded that \u201ca minimum 15 percent residential access line loss in a given exchange, considering all the possible causes for such loss, accompanied by the presence of at least five unaffiliated facilities-based alternative providers serving the residential market in that exchange, is sufficient to justify alternative regulation.\u201d Further, \u201c[t]he line loss requirement measures market power, the level of competition that [an applicant] faces from alternative providers, and the availability of competing alternative services\u201d in each exchange. Moreover, the commission found that the line-loss factor is practical and easily implemented, using readily available data. The commission also incorporated OCC\u2019s suggestion to move the time frame to count the lines lost from 1996 to 2002, which takes into account the migration of lines affiliated with the beginning of the unbundled network element platform offerings in Ohio. Finally, the commission concluded that the two factors in Test 4, when combined, \u201cgauge[] the sustainability of competing residential providers in the subject market area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 35} In H.B. 218, the General Assembly required the commission to develop rules to carry out the amendments. R.C. 4927.03(D). Those amendments include a requirement that the commission consider the regulatory treatment of competing and functionally equivalent services in determining the scope of regulation of services subject to commission jurisdiction. R.C. 4927.02(A)(6). The changes also require the commission to refrain from unduly favoring or disadvantaging any provider or any alternate provider of competing and functionally equivalent services. R.C. 4927.02(A)(7). Therefore, the commission had to interpret the statutory criteria and develop a method to evaluate competition beyond its regulatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 36} The commission\u2019s finding that Test 4 adequately judges alternative competition by combining two criteria, the presence of at least five unaffiliated facilities-based competitors and a significant loss of access lines, is reasonable. The test incorporates the market reality that there are some forms of competition that the commission has no power to regulate or formally review. The commission interpreted the intent of the General Assembly and developed a test to determine the level of competition and the availability of alternative providers regardless of regulatory oversight. This court may rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where \u201chighly specialized issues\u201d are involved and \u201cwhere agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 12 O.O.3d 115, 388 N.E.2d 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{If 37} Further, R.C. 4927.03(C) reserves to the commission the right to modify or abrogate an award of alternative regulatory treatment should any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>show that the findings relied upon are no longer valid. OCC can notify the commission if any conditions change.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 38} We affirm the commission\u2019s finding that Test 4 meets statutory requirements and that AT &amp; T satisfied the line-loss portion of that test. Accordingly, we reject OCC\u2019s proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Barriers to Entry</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 39} OCC\u2019s fourth proposition asserts that the commission\u2019s findings in this case and its administrative rules fail to comply with the requirements of R.C. 4927.03(A)(3), which prohibits an award of alternative regulation without a showing of a lack of barriers to entry for competitors offering stand-alone basic service.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 40} The commission established its view on the lack of barriers in the <em>05-1305 </em>rulemaking case. The commission stated that all competitors seeking entry into a new market face difficulties, and the real issue is whether these difficulties can be overcome or whether barriers exist that actually prevent entry or significantly impede it, over and above those risks and costs normally associated with entering a new market.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 41} OCC asserts that the commission\u2019s view of what constitutes a \u201cbarrier\u201d does not comport with the legislature\u2019s objective, as it effectively replaces the statutory phrase \u201cno barriers to entry\u201d with \u201cno significant barriers to entry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 42} The commission found that OCC\u2019s arguments on potential barriers to entry were fatally generic and lacking in any specific focus on any of the exchanges identified by AT &amp; T in this proceeding. Moreover, the commission did not find any evidence in the record of any barriers to entry present in the requested exchanges that might bar providers from entering those markets. The commission found that the barriers pointed out by OCC in the <em>05-1305 </em>rulemak-ing case are minimized by federal and state laws and rules. In addition, the commission found that OCC had failed to identify a single barrier to entry applying specifically to the relevant exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 43} We find that this issue involves another factual determination by the commission. The commission developed an independent test to assist it in making its factual determinations under the statute. The commission\u2019s rule for determining the presence of alternative providers and loss of access lines (i.e., loss of customers) is a reasonable method for establishing that there are no barriers preventing competition in the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">{\u00b6 44} OCC\u2019s interpretation of the lack-of-barriers requirement would make alternative regulation impossible to achieve. No market is completely barrier-free. OCC\u2019s suggested test, which would require a finding that the market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>presents no difficulties or risks for new entrants, would place the alternative regulation contemplated by the legislature virtually out of reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 45} In establishing Tests 3 and 4, the commission identified those factors that it believes are significant in complying with the intent of H.B. 218, while at the same time not making the test so demanding that alternative regulation as contemplated by H.B. 218 would be unattainable. H.B. 218 provided no definition of \u201cbarrier\u201d and no criteria for finding a lack of barriers. We agree with the commission\u2019s conclusion that the legislature\u2019s criteria for granting alternative regulation was not as restrictive as OCC suggests and that \u201cthe ultimate decision-making authority regarding that implementation was left to the Commission.\u201d We are not persuaded that Tests 3 and 4 fail to properly address the absence of barriers to entry, and the commission\u2019s factual finding that AT &amp; T provided sufficient evidence of a lack of barriers will not be disturbed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Public Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 46} OCC argues in its sixth proposition that the commission granted alternative regulation in violation of R.C. 4927.03(A)(1), which requires a showing that such regulation is in the public interest. Prior to the statutory changes adding BLES to the eligible services for alternative regulation, the commission required telephone companies to make certain \u201cpublic interest\u201d commitments in order to receive an award of alternative regulation. OCC requested that AT &amp; T be required to make additional commitments and asserts that the commission erred in failing to require additional commitments in the rules it promulgated under H.B. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 47} The commission responded that in a competitive environment, further commitments are not appropriate, and the pressures imposed by market competition will work to the public\u2019s benefit by encouraging innovation, affordability, diversity of choice, and other consumer benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 48} The commission reiterated its belief in the importance of ensuring that the largest numbers of residents have access to high-quality telephone service regardless of income or geographic location. But it also recognized the legislature\u2019s direction that market forces be allowed to create an environment that will promote competitive pricing, thereby maintaining just and reasonable rates. The commitments required of applicants for alternative regulation, set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4901:1-4-06 et seq., represent the commission\u2019s attempt to strike a balance between regulation and free-market competition. We will not second-guess the commission by requiring it to extract commitments beyond those already imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 49} R.C. 4927.02 requires the commission to consider the regulatory environment for competing services and to reduce the regulation of telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>companies in the presence of increasing competition. The commission established its rules in accordance with the policy set forth in R.C. 4927.02(A) and determined that certain measures, such as annual rate caps, minimum access requirements for low-density areas, and economic assistance to eligible consumers, protected consumers without unduly interfering with the market and without disadvantaging local exchange carriers. The commission\u2019s position gives meaning to the H.B. 218 policy changes in R.C. 4927.02, which identifies the General Assembly\u2019s view of the public interest.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aex\">Janine L. Migden-Ostrander, Consumers\u2019 Counsel, and David C. Bergmann and Terry L.

Kelly and Mary Ryan Fenlon, for intervening appellee, AT <em>&amp; </em>T Ohio.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 50} Moreover, the public-benefit finding is a factual determination made by the commission. Its finding that AT &amp; T met the requirements for a showing of public interest will not be disturbed by this court absent a demonstration that it is clearly unsupported by the record. <em>AT &amp; T, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 555, 728 N.E.2d 371. OCC has made no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 51} Having considered them carefully, we affirm the commission\u2019s finding that AT <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s application is in the public interest and reject OCC\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 52} Ultimately, OCC is appealing the rules that the commission adopted to streamline its review for alternative treatment under the statute. The rules, as applied to the facts in this case, satisfy the statutory factors needed to award alternative treatment. The commission made appropriate factual determinations. OCC\u2019s arguments to the contrary are rejected, and the commission\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">.
