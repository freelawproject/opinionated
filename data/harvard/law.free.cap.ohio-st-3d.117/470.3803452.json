Because the petition fails to state a viable habeas corpus claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">{\u00b6 2} In 1995, Judge Daniel Gaul of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas convicted appellant, Jeffrey C. Keith, upon a jury verdict, of five counts of arson and one count of grand theft of a motor vehicle and sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of 15 to 25 years. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>State v. Keith </em>(Mar. 13, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 69267, 1997 WL 113755.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">{\u00b6 3} In 1997, Judge Joseph E. Cirigliano of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas convicted Keith, upon a jury verdict, of three counts of theft, one count of Medicaid fraud, one count of securing writings by deception, one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>forgery, and one count of uttering a forged instrument and sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of ten and one-half years, to be served consecutively to his prior sentence. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>State v. Keith </em>(Oct. 22, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 72275, 1998 WL 742172.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 4} In 1999, Judge Cirigliano, in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, convicted Keith, upon a jury verdict, of two counts of uttering a forged instrument, one count of attempted aggravated theft, one count of tampering with evidence, one count of grand theft, and one count of forgery and sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of five years. The court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Keith </em>(Aug. 17, 2000), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 76469, 76479, and 76610, 2000 WL 1176886.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 5} In 1998, Keith filed a document in his first criminal case requesting a hearing under Crim.R. 33(B), which the state opposed as a motion for new trial. In 2002, Keith filed a motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, and the state responded with a motion to dismiss. Judge Cirigliano granted the state\u2019s motion and dismissed Keith\u2019s motion for leave. The court of appeals dismissed Keith\u2019s appeal because Judge Cirigliano had not been properly assigned to hear the postconviction motions:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cSince Judge Cirigliano had no authority to enter the order granting the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judgment is void. It necessarily follows that no appeal can be taken from a void judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Keith, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81125, 2002-Ohio-7250, 2002 WL 31875968, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 7} On Keith\u2019s motion, the court later dismissed his appeals from postconviction rulings by Judge Cirigliano in the other two criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 8} In April 2007, Keith filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Portage County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellee, Trumbull Correctional Institution Warden David Bobby, to immediately release him from prison. Keith claimed that his convictions and sentences were void because, based on the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals\u2019 rulings, neither Judge Cirigliano nor Judge Gaul had jurisdiction to convict and sentence him. Keith further claimed that because no judge had been properly assigned to his criminal cases, he lacked an adequate remedy at law to compel rulings on his pending motions in those cases. Keith finally claimed a pattern of corrupt activity, including fraud, by the state in the prosecution of his criminal cases and the use of perjured testimony. Warden Bobby filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">{\u00b6 9} In September 2007, the court of appeals granted the warden\u2019s motion and dismissed Keith\u2019s petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>{\u00b6 10} In his appeal as of right, Keith asserts that the Court of Appeals for Portage County erred in dismissing his petition. Dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is appropriate if, after all factual allegations are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in Keith\u2019s favor, it appears beyond doubt that he could prove no set of facts entitling him to the requested extraordinary relief in habeas corpus. <em>State ex rel. Turner v. Houk, 112 </em>Ohio St.3d 561, 2007-Ohio-814, 862 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6 5. For the following reasons, the court of appeals\u2019 denial of Keith\u2019s habeas corpus petition was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 11} First, as the court of appeals correctly concluded, the appellate judgment in <em>Keith, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81125, 2002-Ohio-7250, 2002 WL 31875968, merely held that Judge Cirigliano\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss Keith\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial in his first criminal case was void; the court of appeals did not hold that Judge Gaul\u2019s sentence of Keith to an aggregate prison term of 15 to 25 years in that criminal case was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 12} Second, because Keith\u2019s initial sentence is not void and has not expired, Keith is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus. \u201c[H]abeas corpus is proper in the criminal context only if the petitioner is entitled to immediate release from prison or some other physical confinement.\u201d <em>Scanlon v. Brunsman, 112 </em>Ohio St.3d 151, 2006-Ohio-6522, 858 N.E.2d 411, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 13} Third, even assuming the invalidity of Keith\u2019s second and third criminal sentences, he is not entitled to the writ, because he is still properly incarcerated on his first sentence. \u201cWhere a petitioner is incarcerated for several crimes, the fact that the sentencing court may have lacked jurisdiction to sentence him on one of the crimes does not warrant his release in habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Swiger v. Seidner </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 685, 687, 660 N.E.2d 1214; see also <em>Haynes v. Voorhies, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 243, 2006-Ohio-4355, 852 N.E.2d 1198, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 14} Fourth, as we held in another writ case involving Keith, \u201che has or had an adequate remedy by appeal from [the trial court\u2019s] rulings to raise his claim that Judge Gaul and Judge Cirigliano were improperly assigned to his criminal cases.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Keith v. McMonagle, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 61, 2005-Ohio-3669, 831 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 7; see also <em>State ex rel. Key v. Spicer </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 469, 746 N.E.2d 1119 (\u201ca claim of improper assignment of a judge can generally be adequately raised by way of appeal\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 30, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225 (mandamus and prohibition are not substitutes for appeal to contest alleged improper assignment of judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 15} Fifth, Keith\u2019s claims of fraud upon the court, prosecutorial misconduct, and perjured testimony are not cognizable in habeas corpus. <em>Williamson v. Williams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 25, 2004-Ohio-4111, 812 N.E.2d 1283, \u00b6 3 (prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>misconduct and perjured testimony); <em>Howard v. Randle, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 281, 2002-Ohio-2122, 767 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 6 (fraud).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGck\">Jeffrey C. Keith, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Adqx\">Marc Dann, Attorney General, and Diane Mallory, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, insofar as Keith requests rulings on various motions, he has either received them, see <em>Keith, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 61, 2005-Ohio-3669, 831 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 6, or should use procedendo to obtain them. See <em>State ex rel. Bd. of State Teachers Retirement Sys. of Ohio v. Davis, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 410, 2007-Ohio-2205, 865 N.E.2d 1289, \u00b6 34 (\u201cprocedendo is the appropriate remedy when a court has either refused to render a. judgment or has unnecessarily delayed proceeding to judgment\u201d). The mere failure to timely rule on postjudgment motions does not entitle Keith to release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 17} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of Keith\u2019s petition because it failed to state a viable habeas corpus claim. This holding renders moot Keith\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the warden\u2019s motions to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b569-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
