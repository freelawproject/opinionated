We hold that such a denial violates the rule of <em>Batson </em>that jurors must be \u201cindifferently chosen\u201d and is therefore in violation of both the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions, US Const, Am Xiy \u00a7 1 and Const 1963 art 1, \u00a7 2, and MCR 2.511(F)(2). Decisions to include, and to exclude, particular jurors must be undertaken without consideration of race. Accordingly, we reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial on the issue of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">I. FACTS and history</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">On April 7, 2003, Anthony Pellegrino and his wife, Shirley, were riding in an airport shuttle van operated by defendant, Ampco System Parking, when the van swerved on ice and hit a concrete barrier. Shirley was killed, and Anthony sustained serious injuries. As per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>sonal representative of Shirley\u2019s estate and individually on his own behalf, Anthony filed a third-party no-fault action against defendant, which conceded liability, leaving for trial only the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Before voir dire, the trial court instructed the attorneys that \u201cit would be a goal of [the court] to have a jury that represented the racial composition of this county.\u201d Subsequently at voir dire, defense counsel sought to peremptorily excuse prospective juror Sylvia Greene, an African-American woman, and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel raised an objection based on <em>Batson, </em>alleging that defense counsel had already peremptorily challenged two prospective jurors on the basis of race. In response, defense counsel argued that he wanted to excuse Greene because she had been widowed two times and was in the process of grieving over the death of her mother. Without making any finding about whether plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had established grounds for denying the peremptory challenge, the trial court denied it, and Greene remained on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">After invoking MCR 2.511(F),* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2defense counsel asserted that he had supplied a legitimate nonracial rationale for his peremptory challenges and argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Batson </em>issue was a \u201cred herring\u201d and unsupported. He then advised the trial court that he intended to file a motion either to remove Greene or for a mistrial, to which the trial court responded: \u201cWe have a jury of eight women. Three are African-American. In my view, it adequately represents the community from which this case arises.\u201d In a unanimous verdict, the six jurors who deliberated eventually awarded $14.9 million to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">Defense counsel again objected to the court\u2019s denial of his peremptory challenge in a posttrial motion and requested a new trial. He argued that the trial court had failed to follow <em>Batson </em>procedures, stating that, although it is an \u201cemulative approach\u201d to want to \u201cequaliz[e] jurors because of the Wayne County problems of amassing enough minority jurors,\u201d it is \u201cnot the law.\u201d Defense counsel also asserted that MCR 2.511(F)(2) superseded the court\u2019s own view of its obligations in the selection of juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In denying the motion, the trial court rejected the notion that an objection based on <em>Batson </em>could only be sustained on a showing of racial considerations, asserting that \u201cthe federal threshold is dreadful and it renders nugatory the Batson challenge.\u201d After indicating further that it did not think defense counsel was \u201cracist\u201d or should be accused of \u201cracism,\u201d the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">... I told you on the record, and this may get me into hot water with [the] Appeals Court, I won\u2019t find it. I will not do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">... I have six African American children of my own. I am not going to indulge in the race baiting that that kind of an opinion or that kind of finding would require of me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Defense counsel then interjected that the whole point of peremptory challenges is to excuse prospective jurors even though they do not meet the legal disqualification standards of MCR 2.511(D), and the trial court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">Well I guess I\u2019m [in] sufficient hot water with the appellate courts to say I\u2019m not going to ... indulge in ... race baiting .... Now if the Supreme Court rules that way, I suspect they would not but if they do, then I\u2019ll have to decide whether I can function as a judge any longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Finally, the trial court stated that it understood that defense counsel was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">focusing upon the intent of the Batson challenge. However, there are competing interests. There is no other county in the state of Michigan with as diverse racial composition as Wayne County....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">... I am until either removed from the bench by the disciplinary committee or ordered to have a new trial, I am going to seek to have this proportional representation on the juries that hear cases in this court. I can\u2019t be clearer. I\u2019m going to do it until I\u2019m ordered not to do it and then when I\u2019m ordered not to do it, then I\u2019ll have to decide what\u2019s next for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Defendant appealed in the Court of Appeals, raising a host of issues, including the trial court\u2019s denial of its peremptory challenge, and that Court affirmed in a split decision. <em>Pellegrino v Ampco Sys Parking, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 27, 2008 (Docket No. 274743). The majority concluded that although the trial court had not followed <em>Batson </em>procedures, no constitutional error occurred because such an error occurs only when a prospective juror is <em>excused </em>on the basis of race, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>included </em>on that basis. Thus, the majority opined, the trial court had merely denied defendant the use of a single peremptory challenge, which was subject to a harmless-error analysis. The majority then concluded that the error was, in fact, harmless because the only issue at trial had been damages and the verdict had been unanimous. Finally, the majority asserted that MCR 2.511(F)(2) had not been violated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-3\">To the extent that the trial court desired a racially balanced jury, such a desire does not run afoul of MCR 2.511(F)(2). MCR 2.115(F)(2) [sic] prohibits \u201c[discrimination during voir dire on the basis of race[,]\u201d and we cannot conceive how the trial court\u2019s desire to have a racially balanced jury could possibly be characterized as \u201cdiscrimination\u201d under MCR 2.115(F)(2) [sic], <em>[Id. </em>at 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Judge O\u2019CONNELL, in partial dissent, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to follow the law was not confined to <em>Batson. </em>During jury selection, defendant\u2019s counsel also brought to the trial court\u2019s attention a Michigan Supreme Court order regarding what ultimately became MCR 2.511(F). Our Supreme Court had already stated in <em>[People </em>v] <em>Knight, </em>[473 Mich 324; 701 NW2d 715 (2005)], that \u201cthe right to a fair and impartial jury does not entail ensuring any particular racial composition of the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id. at 349. The footnote to the statement specifically notes that a \u201cproposed court rule would expressly prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to achieve a racially proportionate jury\u201d and cites the exact language now found in MCR 2.511(F). <em>Id. </em>at 349, n 17. The trial judge not only admitted that he told counsel before jury selection that he \u201cwas interested and it would be a goal of [his] to have a jury that represented the racial composition of this county,\u201d but also stated that he would refuse to adhere to MCR 2.511 unless ordered to do so:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cI am until either removed from the bench by the disciplinary committee or ordered to have a new trial, I am going to seek to have this proportional representation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the juries that hear cases in this court. I can\u2019t be clearer. I\u2019m going to do it until I\u2019m ordered not to do it and then when I\u2019m ordered not to do it, then I\u2019ll have to decide what\u2019s next for me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">For a trial judge to state on the record that he refuses to follow the law and will continue to do so unless removed from office does more than imply prejudice in the proceedings, it admits them. I can think of no ground for reversal more clear than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 5-6 (O\u2019Connell, PJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).]</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Defendant appealed, and this Court granted leave to appeal, \u201climited to the issue whether the defendant is entitled to a new trial based on a violation of MCR 2.511(F)(2).\u201d 483 Mich 999 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">We review constitutional questions de novo. <em>Sidun v Wayne Co Treasurer, </em>481 Mich 503, 508; 751 NW2d 453 (2008). We also review lower courts\u2019 interpretations and applications of court rules de novo. <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>484 Mich 483, 495; 772 NW2d 301 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">III. <em>BATSON v KENTUCKY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">In a civil trial, \u201c[e]ach party may peremptorily challenge three jurors.\u201d MCR 2.511(E)(2). Before 1986, a party was free to peremptorily remove a prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>juror for any reason. But in <em>Batson, </em>476 US at 89, 96-98, the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge to strike a prospective juror may not be exercised on the basis of race because such an action violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later that year, the Court expanded <em>Batson </em>to civil cases. <em>Edmonson v Leesville Concrete Co, Inc, </em>500 US 614; 111 S Ct 2077; 114 L Ed 2d 660 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The United States Supreme Court has reinforced <em>Batson </em>on several occasions. In 1991, the Court held that a defendant could raise a <em>Batson </em>issue even if the excused juror was not the same race as the defendant. <em>Powers v Ohio, </em>499 US 400, 415; 111 S Ct 1364; 113 L Ed 2d 411 (1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Then, in <em>Georgia v McCollum, 505 </em>US 42, 59; 112 S Ct 2348; 120 L Ed 2d 33 (1992), the Court extended <em>Batson </em>to peremptory challenges by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>criminal defendants. Finally, in 1994, the Court expanded <em>Batson </em>to peremptory challenges on the basis of gender. <em>J E B v Alabama, </em>511 US 127, 146; 114 S Ct 1419; 128 L Ed 2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">This Court has also issued opinions addressing <em>Batson, </em>as well as enacting MCR 2.511 (F). In <em>People v Bell, </em>473 Mich 275; 702 NW2d 128 (2005),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court denied defense counsel\u2019s efforts to peremptorily strike two white males after defense counsel had already struck several other white males. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s claim that there was an inference of discrimination in such challenges, defense counsel argued: \u201c \u2018[T]he number of white males on that panel still exceeds the number of the minorities on that panel. Why don\u2019t you talk about the whole racial composition of that panel? There\u2019s still a vast majority of white members on that panel than... black members on that panel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289. This Court concluded that the trial court had properly denied defense counsel\u2019s peremptoiy challenges and added that \u201c|j]ust as a challenger may not exclude a prospective juror on the basis of race, it is equally improper for a challenger to engineer the composition of a jury to reflect the race of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In <em>People v Knight, </em>473 Mich 324; 701 NW2d 715 (2005), decided the same day, defense counsel objected that the prosecutor was using peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans from the jury. After hearing the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for his challenges, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201c[T]wo or three minority jurors [are] left on this panel. So I think we are getting close to a serious issue here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">\u201c... I think we\u2019re getting close to a sensitive issue here on [prospective jurors] Jones and Johnson....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cWith the panel we ended up with, I think that any <em>Batson </em>problems that may have been there have been cured.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 331-334 (emphasis deleted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On appeal in this Court, in the course of explaining that the trial court had never found a <em>Batson </em>violation, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">T]he record is susceptible to the fair inference that the trial judge acted to preserve the presence of minority jurors on the panel, knowing that the jury pool, as a matter of chance, was largely Caucasian. Protecting a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury does not entail ensuring any particular racial composition of the jury....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">[T]he [judge\u2019s] comments demonstrate that her true motivation was to ensure some modicum of racial balance in the jury panel. Use of peremptory challenges, however, to ensure racial proportionality in the jury is prohibited by <em>Batson </em>and will be prohibited by proposed MCR 6.412(F)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] if adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">The trial judge failed to recognize that a defendant is not entitled to a jury of a particular racial composition as long as no racial group is systematically and intentionally excluded. <em>[Id. </em>at 348-351.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Justice CAVANAGH, joined by then Justice KELLY and then Chief Justice TAYLOR, concurred in part and dissented in part. Although Justice CAVANAGH concluded that the trial court had found a <em>Batson </em>violation, as relevant here, he stated: \u201cI tend to agree with the majority and suspect that some of the trial court\u2019s statements arguably stemmed from its desire to ensure a racially mixed jury and that such a desire is prohibited by <em>Batson </em>and its progeny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361 (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In the end, all seven justices agreed that <em>Batson </em>prohibited a trial court from acting to preserve the presence of minority jurors on a jury panel because of a desire to ensure a racially mixed jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defendant to exercise a peremptory challenge of prospective juror Greene was consistent with the constitution and court rules because the trial court was merely seeking to ensure that the jury represented a \u201cfair cross-section of the community.\u201d We reject this argument because the trial court\u2019s actions violated the race-neutral requirements of both the constitution and MCR 2.511(F)(2). Greene\u2019s retention on the jury was predicated on her race, as well as the races of other jurors; each of these racial considerations was paramount in the decision of the trial court to reject defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge. As MCR 2.511(F)(2) makes explicit, a court\u2019s desire to achieve a \u201cbalanced, proportionate, or representative jury\u201d does not justify taking race into consideration in selecting a jury. Notwithstanding this express prohibition, the trial court premised its jury-selection decisions on its determination to secure \u201cproportional representation\u201d based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the racial composition of the county in which the trial occurred. In denying defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge, the court expressly took Greene\u2019s race into account and expressly evaluated her race in light of the race of every other juror on the panel. It is hard to conceive of a more flagrant and unambiguous violation of the court rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">Moreover, the prohibition found in MCR 2.511(F)(2) is altogether consistent with, and indeed premised on, our federal and state constitutions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as United States Supreme Court and Michigan Supreme Court precedents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These demonstrate that a purpose or motive of attaining a racially balanced jury does not provide the trial court with the authority to deprive a party of a proper peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In <em>Taylor v Louisiana, </em>419 US 522, 538; 95 S Ct 692; 42 L Ed 2d 690 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that defendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition: \u201c[I]n holding that petit [trial] juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community we impose no requirement that petit juries actually chosen must mirror the community and reflect the various distinctive groups in the population.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And in <em>Lockhart v McCree, </em>476 US 162, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>173; 106 S Ct 1758; 90 L Ed 2d 137 (1986), the United States Supreme Court observed: \u201cWe have never invoked the fair-cross-section principle to invalidate the use of either for-cause or peremptory challenges to prospective jurors, or to require petit juries, as opposed to jury panels or venires, to reflect the composition of the community at large.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Subsequently, in <em>Holland v Illinois, </em>493 US 474, 480; 110 S Ct 803; 107 L Ed 2d 905 (1990), the Court held that the fair-cross-section requirement cannot be interpreted as prohibiting peremptory challenges, stating: \u201c[The] Sixth Amendment requirement of a fair cross section [of the community] on the venire is a means of assuring, not a <em>representative </em>jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an <em>impartial </em>one (which it does).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Thus, given that the trial court did not determine that defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge was racially motivated, the court\u2019s stated desire to have the racial composition of the jury be \u201crepresentative of the community\u201d did not justify or authorize the court\u2019s denial of that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Even more fundamentally, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge violated the constitutional principles set forth in <em>Batson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>[T]he defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-3\">. . . Those on the venire must be \u201cindifferently chosen\u201d to secure the defendant\u2019s right under the Fourteenth Amendment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">The harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community. <em>[Batson, </em>476 US at 85-87.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defendant to strike prospective juror Greene without finding any <em>Batson </em>violation led to at least one member of the jury having been selected, not pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria, but precisely on the basis of race. Greene\u2019s presence on the jury was thus the result not of being \u201cindifferently chosen,\u201d as required by <em>Batson, </em>but of having been chosen specifically on the basis of race. As asserted in <em>Batson, </em>this inflicts harm on defendant, on the prospective juror who was excluded because of Greene\u2019s retention, and indeed on the \u201centire community.\u201d The trial court\u2019s process transformed the jury from a group of mere citizens into a group in which a person\u2019s racial background became defining, and it transformed the selection process from one that was neutral in terms of race into one that was predicated on race. While this may be the process preferred by the trial court, it is not the process set forth by the federal or state constitutions or by federal or state law. As stated in <em>Powers, </em>499 US at 415: \u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s mandate that race discrimination be eliminated from all official acts and proceedings of the State is most compelling in the judicial system.\u201d Quite simply, in the absence of a <em>Batson </em>violation, the trial court had no right to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Greene\u2019s or any other prospective juror\u2019s race into account in denying defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge. When it did so, the selection of the jury ceased to be indifferent to race, but instead became preoccupied with race.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The Court of Appeals concluded that no <em>Batson </em>error occurred because a <em>Batson </em>error occurs only when a prospective juror is actually <em>dismissed </em>on account of race. We respectfully disagree. While <em>Batson </em>violations have typically involved the exclusion of a prospective juror on the basis of race, the constitutional principles articulated in <em>Batson </em>are not so limited. <em>Batson </em>and its progeny generally speak in terms of the prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d involving prospective jurors, not merely the <em>exclusion </em>of prospective jurors on the basis of race. See, e.g., <em>Powers, </em>499 US at 404 (\u201cAlthough a defendant has no right to a \u2018petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of [the defendant\u2019s] own race,\u2019 he or she does have the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected by nondiscriminatory criteria.\u201d) (citation omitted). Furthermore, in stressing that no person should intentionally be excluded on account of race, these cases support the conclusion that the purposeful <em>inclusion </em>of a particular juror on account of race \u2014 which by its logic necessarily implies the <em>exclusion </em>of another individual in the \u201czero sum\u201d process that characterizes jury selection \u2014 also offends the constitution. See, e.g., <em>Knight, </em>473 Mich at 349 (\u201cThe goal of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny is to promote racial neutrality in the selection of a jury and to avoid the systematic and intentional exclusion of <em>any </em>racial group.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The United States Supreme Court has effectively adopted a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach toward racial considerations affecting the choosing of a jury. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>approach is implicated when a prospective juror has been excluded on account of race, and it is similarly violated when a proper peremptory challenge has been denied because of the prospective juror\u2019s race or the races of the other prospective jurors. See, e.g., <em>Cassell v Texas, </em>339 US 282, 287; 70 S Ct 629; 94 L Ed 839 (1950), in which the lead opinion stated: \u201cProportional racial limitation is therefore forbidden. An accused is entitled to have charges against him considered by a jury in the selection of which there has been <em>neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) And, as the lead opinion stated in <em>Bell, </em>\u201cit is ... improper ... to engineer the composition of a jury to reflect the race\u201d of a party. <em>Bell, </em>473 Mich at 290 (opinion by CORRIGAN, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">As previously indicated, all seven justices of this Court agreed in <em>Knight </em>that <em>Batson </em>prohibits a trial court from acting to preserve the presence of minority jurors on a jury panel because of a desire to ensure a racially balanced jury. Here, however, the trial court expressly acknowledged that it was attempting to engineer the composition of the jury to reflect the \u201cdiverse racial composition\u201d of the community. The trial court was not free to do this under the law and constitution and, by doing so, violated the constitutional right of defendant to a jury that, with regard to race, had been \u201cindifferently chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In sum, we find that the wrongful <em>inclusion </em>of a juror on account of race should be treated the same as the wrongful <em>exclusion </em>of a prospective juror on account of race. Each situation violates the constitutional command that jurors be selected pursuant to criteria that do not take race into account, each deprives a defendant of a jury that has been \u201cindifferently chosen\u201d in terms of race, and each involves the exercise of judicial power in support of a process in which race becomes disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tive in terms of who can serve on a jury. Finally, each situation violates the plain language of MCR 2.511(F)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">V REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Court of Appeals majority concluded, and plaintiffs argue, that any error here was harmless. We again respectfully disagree. In <em>Batson, </em>476 US at 86-87, the Court held, without determining that the jury as composed was biased in any way, that the unlawful exclusion of a prospective juror on the basis of race requires reversal because it \u201cviolates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection,\u201d \u201cunconstitutionally discriminate[s] against the excluded juror,\u201d and \u201cundermine[s] public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\u201d The Court likewise reversed convictions or judgments outright, without assessing the harmlessness of the <em>Batson </em>violations, in <em>Powers, </em>499 US at 416; <em>Edmonson, </em>500 US at 631; and <em>J E B, </em>511 US at 146. Here, the trial court\u2019s efforts to balance the composition of a jury violated <em>Batson </em>because these efforts entailed taking race into account \u2014 including, and necessarily excluding, with regard to jury duty, persons on the basis of their pigmentation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We believe that the automatic reversal rule of <em>Batson </em>should also apply when there has been an unlawful inclusion of a juror as the result of a <em>Batson </em>violation by the trial court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such a rule vindicates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>equal protection guarantees of the United States Constitution, Am XIY( \u00a7 1 and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2, while ensuring that jury selection is not infected in any way by racial considerations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that, even if the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge, any error was not of a federal constitutional dimension, citing <em>Rivera v Illinois, </em>556 US 148; 129 S Ct 1446; 173 L Ed 2d 320 (2009). In <em>Rivera, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">If a defendant is tried before a qualified jury composed of individuals not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory challenge due to a state court\u2019s good-faith error is not a matter of federal constitutional concern. Rather, it is a matter for the State to address under its own laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>[T]he mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, without more, violate the Federal Constitution....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">... [T]here is no suggestion here that the trial judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted in an arbitrary or irrational manner. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">' The automatic reversal precedents Rivera cites are inapposite. One set of cases involves <em>constitutional </em>errors concerning the qualification of the jury or judge. In <em>Batson, </em>for example, we held that the unlawful exclusion of jurors based on race requires reversal because it \u201cviolates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection,\u201d \u201cunconstitutionally discriminate[s] against the excluded juror,\u201d and \u201cundermine [s] public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">. .. Nothing in these decisions suggests that federal law renders state-court judgments void whenever there is a state-law defect in a tribunal\u2019s composition. Absent a federal constitutional violation, States retain the prerogative to decide whether such errors deprive a tribunal of its lawful authority and thus require automatic reversal. States are free to decide, as a matter of state law, that a trial court\u2019s mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error per <em>se. [Id. </em>at 157-162.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\"><em>Rivera </em>is inapplicable. In <em>Rivera, </em>the Court held that a state court\u2019s \u201cone-time, good-faith\u201d error in disallowing a peremptory challenge did not \u201cwithout more\u201d require reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 158-160; 129 S Ct at 1454-1455. The Court contrasted a judge\u2019s good-faith mistake with one arising because the judge deliberately misapplied the law or because the judge had acted in an arbitrary or irrational manner. In the case at bar, we can conclude neither that the trial court\u2019s error was made in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>faith nor that a good-faith error occurred \u201cwithout more.\u201d Rather, the trial court deliberately refused to follow the three-step process required under <em>Batson </em>because it thought that process required the court to \u201cindulge\u201d in \u201crace baiting.\u201d And unlike the trial court in <em>Rivera, </em>which merely erred in good faith by finding a <em>Batson </em>error, the trial court in the instant case, despite never finding such an error in the first place, nonetheless arbitrarily proceeded as if it had. Furthermore, the court purposely rejected a court rule that incorporated established federal and state constitutional principles, and that rejection occurred in furtherance of the trial court\u2019s stated determination to take race explicitly into consideration in the jury selection process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABd\">VI. JUDICIAL OBLIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In this case, the trial judge (a) indicated that he was determined to attain a racially \u201crepresentative\u201d jury and \u201cproportional representation\u201d on the basis of race, notwithstanding explicit prohibitions in the law concerning discrimination in pursuit of a racially representative jury or proportional representation on the basis of race; (b) indicated that he would not engage in the sort of \u201crace baiting\u201d he believed was compelled by the law even thought this might get him in \u201chot water\u201d with the appellate courts; (c) indicated that he viewed as \u201cdreadful\u201d <em>Batson\u2019s </em>threshold requirement of a judicial finding of racial bias motivating a peremptory challenge in the course of dispensing with that require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ment and denying a peremptory challenge to which defendant was otherwise entitled by law; (d) indicated that if his view of the law did not prevail \u2014 a view that he recognized as being contrary to the law of this state and that he proceeded to apply in this case \u2014 he would \u201chave to decide whether [he] can function as a judge any longer;\u201d (e) indicated that he would continue to apply his own personal view of the law, rather than the law of this state, until \u201ceither removed from the bench by the disciplinary committee or ordered to have a new trial;\u201d and (f) indicated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">until either removed from the bench by the disciplinary committee or ordered to have a new trial, I am going to seek to have this proportional representation on the juries that hear cases in this court. I can\u2019t be clearer. I\u2019m going to do it until I\u2019m ordered not to do it and then when I\u2019m ordered not to do it, then I\u2019ll have to decide what\u2019s next for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">These comments, and the trial judge\u2019s attendant actions taken in conformity in denying defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge, establish a basis for concluding that this- is the unusual case in which retrial should occur before a different judge. Moreover, we believe that these same comments and actions could supply a basis for the Judicial Tenure Commission to investigate whether judicial misconduct has occurred should it choose to do so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Michigan has a hierarchical judicial system, and trial courts are required to follow appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>cable rules, orders, and caselaw established by appellate courts, including the United States Supreme Court. This structure is essential to the orderly, uniform, and equal administration of justice. A trial court is not free to disregard rules, orders, and caselaw with which it disagrees or to become a law unto itself. Although a trial court is not required to agree with appellate rules, orders, and caselaw, as with litigants and all other citizens seeking to comply with the law, the court is required in good faith to follow those rules, orders, and caselaw.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Judges, like all other persons, are required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>to act <em>within </em>the law. This is the essence of the rule of law, and this is the essence of the equal rule of the law. These are obligations that apply equally to this Court with regard to the federal decisions of the United States Supreme Court and to our Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A trial court may not deny a party a proper peremptory challenge \u201cfor the purpose of achieving what the court believes to be a balanced, proportionate, or. representative jury . . . .\u201d MCR 2.511(F)(2). Rather, jurors must be selected pursuant to criteria that do not take race into consideration, with each juror being chosen indifferently with respect to race. Whether for the purpose of including or excluding a particular juror, taking race into account violates the equal protection guarantees of both the federal and state constitutions, US Const, Am XTV( \u00a7 1 and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2, and MCR 2.511(F)(2). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and this case is remanded for a new trial on damages only before a different judge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> MCR 2.511(F) forbids taking race into account during voir dire for the purpose of achieving what the court believes to be a balanced, proportionate, or representative jury and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">(1) No person shall be subjected to discrimination during voir dire on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">(2) Discrimination during voir dire on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex for the purpose of achieving what the court believes to be a balanced, proportionate, or representative jury in terms of these characteristics shall not constitute an excuse or justification for a violation of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">MCR 2.511(F) became effective January 1,2006, and therefore applied in the instant trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> This statement is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that \u201c[r]ace cannot be a proxy for determining juror bias or competence.\u201d <em>Powers v Ohio, </em>499 US 400, 410; 111 S Ct 1364; 113 L Ed 2d 411 (1991).

Finally, the trial court must decide whether the opponent of the challenge has proved purposeful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 98. If so, the peremptory challenge will not be allowed.

The court justified its actions by reference to a desire for a racially and religiously balanced jury. <em>Id. </em>In response, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated: \u201c[Although the motives behind the district courts race- and religion-based jury selection procedures were undoubtedly meant to be tolerant and inclusive rather than bigoted and exclusionary, that fact cannot justify the district court\u2019s race-conscious actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\"> MCR 2.511(E)(1) states: \u201cA juror peremptorily challenged <em>is excused </em>without cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cis excused\u201d is mandatory language, not discretionary or permissive language. Thus, absent a <em>Batson </em>violation, a trial court has no discretion to deny a party the exercise of one of its peremptory challenges and thereby to deny that party the right to have seated on his or her jury the person who stands next in the jury queue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> <em>Bell </em>discussed whether the improper denial of a peremptory challenge is subject to harmless-error analysis.

Justice Kelly argued in her dissent that automatic reversal should occur for the wrongful denial of a peremptory challenge, even if it does not constitute a <em>Batson </em>error. <em>Id. </em>at 312-313 (Kelly, J., dissenting). Justice Cavanagh dissented on similar grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 322 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). This debate need not be further addressed today because here the wrongful denial was, in fact, based on race.
