The trial court ruled that the rules were \u201cillegal, invalid, and unenforceable\u201d and permanently enjoined defendant from enforcing them. The Court of Appeals issued three separate opinions, which vacated the circuit court\u2019s order but did not agree on a rationale. We hold that the Commissioner exceeded her authority by promulgating the OFIS rules because they are contrary to the Insurance Code. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">As explained in a 2002 report from then-OFIS Commissioner Frank Fitzgerald, \u201cinsurance scoring\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cinsurance credit scoring\u201d is \u201cthe use of select credit information to help insurance companies establish automobile and homeowners premiums.\u201d Frank Fitzgerald, The Use of Credit Scoring in Automobile and Homeowners Insurance (2002) (Fitzgerald Report),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> p 5. An individual\u2019s credit score is calculated by applying a standard formula to information from the individual\u2019s credit history. These formulas are developed either by the insurance companies themselves or by credit scoring companies. <em>Id. </em>Insurance companies that use insurance scoring offer discounts to individuals with good insurance scores. Not all insurance companies use insurance scoring. Of those that do, their practices vary concerning the extent of the discounts offered and how the insurance scores are calculated. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">In 1997, the Legislature enacted MCL 500.2110a, which allows insurers to establish and maintain a premium discount plan without prior approval by the Legislature or the insurance commissioner. As a result, insurance companies in Michigan began using insurance scoring. Fitzgerald Report, <em>supra </em>at 9. In 2002, Commissioner Fitzgerald undertook a statewide study of this practice in order \u201cto gather information on the use of insurance credit scoring in personal automobile and homeowners insurance policies and to take testimony concerning its effect on Michigan citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. In December 2002, OFIS issued the Fitzgerald Report, which concluded that \u201cMichigan law permits a discount based on insurance credit scoring\u201d but that \u201csignificant and legitimate concerns\u201d identified during the course of the study \u201cmust be addressed to adequately protect the rights of Michigan consumers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>under the Insurance Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. To address these concerns, the report included several \u201cAdministrative Recommendations,\u201d or \u201c\u00e1ction[s] that [are] available to the commissioner under current law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The report concluded that \u201c[o]ther concerns are beyond the statutory authority of the commissioner to remedy and will require action by the Michigan Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The report thus \u201crespectfully submitted\u201d several \u201cLegislative Recommendations\u201d \u201cfor the consideration of legislators in their policy deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>None of the legislative recommendations totally prohibited the use of insurance scoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On February 14, 2003, Commissioner Fitzgerald issued a bulletin setting forth several directives taken from the December 2002 report. <em>In the Matter of Conforming Insurance Credit Scoring Practices With Insurance Code Requirements, </em>OFIS Bulletin 2003-01-INS (February 14, 2003).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the same date, he issued an order directing OFIS staff to monitor insurance companies\u2019 compliance with the directives and to initiate compliance actions as appropriate. <em>Order to Monitor Insurer Practices and To Initiate Compliance Actions as Appropriate, </em>OFIS Order No. 03-005-M (February 14, 2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bulletin directed insurance companies using insurance scoring to file with OFIS such information as \u201cthe formula used to apply the discount,\u201d \u201cthe specific credit classification factors used to calculate the insurance credit score,\u201d and an annual \u201cactuarial certification justifying the discount levels and discount tiers offered by the company.\u201d OFIS Bulletin, <em>supra. </em>The bulletin also directed insurance companies to \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>calculate and then apply an insured\u2019s insurance credit score at least once annually\u201d and to \u201cannually inform . .. policyholders or applicants of the credit score used to apply an insurance credit scoring discount. . . <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">On May 13, 2003, then-OFIS Commissioner Linda A. Watters<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> issued an \u201cupdate\u201d to her predecessor\u2019s February 14, 2003 bulletin. <em>In the Matter of Insurance Credit Scoring Practices </em>\u2014 Update <em>to Bulletin 2003-01-INS, </em>OFIS Bulletin 2003-02-INS (May 13, 2003) (Watters Bulletin).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The bulletin began by stating that \u201c[insurance scoring is problematic at best. Perhaps no other widespread practice of insurers presents so many technical and social issues.\u201d After providing several examples, the bulletin continued: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The bulletin also reiterated that insurers must inform policyholders or applicants of the credit score used to apply a discount and revised the directive requiring annual recalculation of insurance scores to require recalculation only upon the request of the insured. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Such considerations led Governor Granholm to call for a ban on the use of insurance credit scoring altogether. In February, two bills were introduced that would ban the use of insurance credit scoring in the rating of automobile and home insurance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">If a ban cannot be achieved, at least significant reform legislation is imperative to protect the interests of consumers on such an important matter as the amount they pay for automobile and home insurance. This agency will be fully supportive of the Governor in these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">In the meantime, it is incumbent upon the Commissioner to make the most of current law in addressing the concerns above. Bulletin 2003-01-INS was designed to conform insurance credit scoring practices to Insurance Code requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In July 2004, after neither of the above-mentioned bills was enacted into law, OFIS developed proposed administrative rules prohibiting the use of insurance scoring. It held four public hearings \u2014 in Lansing, Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Flint \u2014 \u201cto receive public comments on proposed rules clarifying a reasonable classification system under the Insurance Code, by requiring insurers to adjust base rates and by prohibiting the use as a rating factor after January 1, 2005, of a credit-based insurance score.\u201d See OFIS Notice of Public Hearing on Proposed Rules to Reduce Insurance Base Rates and To Ban the Use of Credit Scoring.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">After submission to and approval by the Office of Regulatory Reform,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Commissioner formally adopted the rules. See MCL 24.245. On February 17, 2005, the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> issued a notice of objection to the proposed rules. See MCL 24.245a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> JCAR determined that \u201c[t]he agency is exceeding the statutory scope of its rule-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>making authority\u201d and that \u201c[t]he rule is in conflict with state law, the Insurance Code of 1956,\u201d and \u201cis arbitrary or capricious.\u201d JCAR Revised Notice of Objection, # 05-3 (February 17, 2005). Bills to rescind the OFIS rules upon their effective date were introduced in both the House and Senate on February 22, 2005. SB 233; HB 4374. See MCL 24.245a(3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After Governor Granholm indicated her intention to veto these bills, however, Senator Mike Bishop stated during a March 9, 2005 session of the Senate that \u201cit would be futile for us to take up these bills and pointless to pursue passage of Senate Bill No. 233.\u201d Statement of Senator Bishop, Journal of the Senate, March 9, 2005, pp 247-248. No legislative action ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Under MCL 24.245a(5),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> ORR filed the rules with the Secretary of State on March 25, 2005. On March 29, 2005, plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, and the Michigan Insurance Coalition and Citizens Insurance Company of America filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>complaint and a motion to intervene as plaintiffs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiffs and proposed intervening plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction. The parties subsequently stipulated to the intervention of the proposed intervening plaintiffs as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Defendant moved for. a change of venue and also argued that plaintiffs were not permitted to bring an original action in the circuit court, but were limited to filing a petition for judicial review under MCL 500.244(1). On April 15, 2005, the trial court heard arguments on both defendant\u2019s motion and on the merits of the case. It denied defendant\u2019s motion for a change of venue. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on the merits, defense counsel declined to present any additional testimony or evidence, stating the defense position that review should be limited to the administrative record.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court then stated it would \u201cconsolidate this hearing with the final trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>In its opinion and order issued April 25, 2005, the trial court concluded that the OFIS rules were \u201cillegal, invalid, and unenforceable,\u201d and permanently enjoined the Commissioner from enforcing them. The court \u201cdecline[d] to review the record of the public hearings for the reason that it consists largely of position statements and opinions which may not be admissible under the rules of evidence, and more importantly because the [c]ourt [found] it unnecessary to address whether the rules are arbitrary and capricious ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Rather, it viewed the dispositive issue as \u201cthe legality of the Defendant\u2019s rules, given the Commissioner\u2019s rule-making authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It concluded that the Commissioner had exceeded her authority in promulgating the rules by ordering an industry-wide reduction in rates rather than challenging rates on an individual basis through the contested case hearing process set forth in the Insurance Code. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The court also concluded that the rules\u2019 \u201cblanket prohibition\u201d on rating plans using insurance scoring violated the Insurance Code because the evidence established a correlation between insurance scores and risk of loss, and the Commissioner lacks the authority to ban rating plans that meet the requirements of the Code. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Defendant appealed. On August 21, 2008, the Court of Appeals issued three separate opinions. <em>Ins Institute of Mich v Comm\u2019r of the Office of Fin &amp; Ins Servs, </em>280 Mich App 333; 761 NW2d 184 (2008). Judge WHITE voted to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment in part because the court had erred by failing to base its review on the administrative record, by accepting additional evidence, and in part on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 343-365. Judge K. F. KELLY also thought that the trial court\u2019s order should be vacated, but for a different reason: namely, because the court had erred by permitting plaintiffs to maintain an original action. <em>Id. </em>at 379-382. Judge ZAHRA dissented from the decision to vacate the trial court\u2019s order. He concluded that the court had properly allowed plaintiffs to bring an original action. <em>Id. </em>at 366-372. Although he agreed with Judge WHITE that the court had erred by failing to base its review on the administrative record, he concluded that the error was harmless \u201cbecause the issue resolved by the lower court was a purely legal question[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. Judge ZAHRA agreed with the trial court that the rules were illegal and invalid because the Commissioner exceeded her authority in promulgating them. <em>Id. </em>at 373-379.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In February 2009, despite pending applications for leave to appeal in this Court, defendant began issuing notices that disapproved new rate filings. At least some of the notices acknowledged the trial court\u2019s order enjoining enforcement of the OFIS rules, but they stated that the Commissioner\u2019s disapproval of the particular rate filing was \u201cbased on the conclusion that insurance scoring is directly prohibited by the Insurance Code because rates based on insurance scoring are unfairly discriminatory and not in reliance on the enjoined administrative rules.\u201d As a result of the Commissioner\u2019s issuance of these notices, plaintiffs moved in the trial court to enforce the court\u2019s April 25, 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>order. On April 10, 2009, the court issued an order granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion and precluding defendant from \u201cchallenging or denying rate filings on the basis that the rate filing uses insurance scores as a rating factor.\u201d The order further provided that defendant\u2019s notices were \u201cVOID and RESCINDED as violative of this Court\u2019s prior injunction\u201d and ordered the Commissioner to \u201cREFRAIN from taking further action based on a blanket prohibition on the use of insurance scores.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Both parties filed applications for leave to appeal. By order of May 7, 2009, we granted leave to resolve the various procedural and substantive issues in this case. <em>Ins Institute of Mich v Comm\u2019r Fin &amp; Ins Servs, </em>483 Mich 1000 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">II. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The first set of issues before us concerns defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by permitting plaintiffs to maintain an original declaratory judgment action. Defendant argues that, under \u00a7 64 of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), MCL 24.201 <em>et seq., </em>plaintiffs were not permitted to bring an original declaratory judgment action in the trial court without having first requested a declaratory ruling from the OFIS. Defendant also argues that MCL 500.244(1) provides the exclusive means of seeking judicial review of rules promulgated by the Commissioner and that, under that provision, as well as this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mich Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Economic Growth Dir, </em>481 Mich 496; 750 NW2d 593 (2008), judicial review of administrative rules is limited to the \u201cadministrative record,\u201d i.e., the record compiled during the rulemaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>We decline to reach these issues because it is unnecessary for us to do so. Defendant has expressly waived any error concerning the procedural issues by arguing that a remand to the trial court is unnecessary and asking this Court to reach the substantive issues in this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the trial court erred by not limiting its review to the administrative record, the error was harmless because there is ample evidence in that record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that insurance scoring is permissible under the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">III. VALIDITY OF THE RULES UNDER THE INSURANCE CODE</p>\n<p id=\"AVn\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">This case presents the legal question of the validity of the OFIS rules under the Insurance Code. In <em>Luttrell v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>421 Mich 93, 100; 365 NW2d 74 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(1984), we adopted the test for judicial review of agency rules articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R Co v Pub Serv Comm, </em>59 Mich App 88, 98-99; 228 NW2d 843 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">\u201cWhere an agency is empowered to make rules, courts employ a three-fold test to determine the validity of the rules it promulgates: (1) whether the rule is within the matter covered by the enabling statute; (2) if so, whether it complies with the underlying legislative intent; and (3) if it meets the first two requirements, when <em>[sic] </em>it is neither arbitrary nor capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">An agency\u2019s construction of a statute \u201cis entitled to respectful consideration and, if persuasive, should not be overruled without cogent reasons,\u201d but \u201cthe court\u2019s ultimate concern is a proper construction of the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>In re Complaint of Rovas Against SBC Mich, </em>482 Mich 90, 108; 754 NW2d 259 (2008). \u201c[T]he agency\u2019s interpretation cannot conflict with the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">As discussed in part III(D) of this opinion, we conclude that the Commissioner exceeded her authority in promulgating the OFIS rules. The rules purport to prohibit a practice \u2014 insurance scoring \u2014 that is permissible under the Insurance Code. Accordingly, the OFIS rules are not \u201cwithin the matter covered by the enabling statute.\u201d <em>Luttrell, </em>421 Mich at 100 (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>B. THE INSURANCE CODE</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The OFIS rules apply to \u201cpersonal insurance,\u201d which they define as \u201cprivate passenger automobile, homeowners, motorcycle, boat, personal watercraft, snowmobile, recreational vehicle, mobile-homeowners and noncommercial dwelling fire insurance policies\u201d that are \u201cunderwritten on an individual or group basis for personal, family, or household use.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 500.2151(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Accordingly, three chapters of the Insurance Code are relevant here: Chapter 21, which applies to individual automobile and home insurance; Chapter 24, which applies to group automobile and home insurance as well as personal lines covering mobile homes, rental properties, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, and boats; and Chapter 26, which applies to group home insurance and the other personal property lines to which Chapter 24 also applies. MCL 500.2105; MCL 500.2401; MCL 500.2601; OFIS Report to JCAR (October 1, 2004), p 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Under all three chapters, the insurers, rather than the Commissioner or OFIS, formulate the plans they use to establish insurance rates. In formulating rating plans under Chapters 24 and 26, \u201c[d]ue consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience... and to all other relevant factors within and outside this state.\u201d MCL 500.2403(l)(a); MCL 500.2603(l)(a). \u201cRisks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums,\u201d and \u201c[t]he rating plans may measure any differences among risks that may have a probable effect upon losses or expenses....\u201d MCL 500.2403(l)(c); MCL 500.2603(l)(c). \u201cRates shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d MCL 500.2403(d); MCL 500.2603(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">For home and automobile insurance under Chapter 21, classifications must be \u201cbased only upon 1 or more\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>of the factors set forth in MCL 500.2111. MCL 500.2111(2). These factors include such things as the age of the driver, average weekly or annual mileage, and amount of insurance. In addition, MCL 500.2110a permits insurers to \u201cestablish and maintain a premium discount plan utilizing factors in addition to those permitted by section 2111,\u201d provided that \u201cthe plan is consistent with the purposes of this act and reflects reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses\u201d and the insurer applies the plan uniformly to all its insureds. Rates under Chapter 21, like those established under Chapters 24 and 26, \u201cshall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d MCL 500.2109(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The Commissioner derives her rulemaking authority from MCL 500.210, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations in addition to those now specifically provided for by statute as he may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes and to execute and enforce the provisions of the insurance laws of this state in accordance with the provisions of [the APA].[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In addition, MCL 500.2484 (Chapter 24) and MCL 500.2674 (Chapter 26) provide: \u201cThe commissioner may make reasonable rules and regulations necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">C. THE OFIS RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The OFIS rules on insurance scoring, Mich Admin Code, R 500.2151 through 500.2155, provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Rule 1. As used in these rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">(1) \u201cInsurance score\u201d means a number, rating, or grouping of risks that is based in whole or in part on credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>information for the purposes of predicting the future loss exposure of an individual applicant or insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">(2) \u201cPersonal insurance\u201d means private passenger automobile, homeowners, motorcycle, boat, personal watercraft, snowmobile, recreational vehicle, mobile-homeowners and non-commercial dwelling fire insurance policies. \u201cPersonal insurance\u201d only includes policies underwritten on an individual or group basis for personal, family, or household use.

INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly held the OFIS rules invalid and unenforceable. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the OFIS rules are not \u201cwithin the matter covered by the enabling statute\u201d as required by <em>Luttrell, </em>421 Mich at 100, because insurance scoring is permissible under the Insurance Code. The record supports plaintiffs\u2019 contention that insurance scoring may be used to establish a premium discount plan under Chapter 21. Insurance scores may also be used as a rating factor under Chapters 24 and 26, and defendant has failed to show that insurance scoring produces rates that are \u201cunfairly discriminatory.\u201d The Commissioner has the authority to \u201cpromulgate rules and regulations\u201d to \u201ceffectuate the purposes\u201d of the Insurance Code and to \u201cexecute and enforce\u201d its provisions. MCL 500.210. By enacting a total ban on insurance scoring, a practice that may be employed in a manner that is consistent with the Insurance Code, defendant exceeded her authority as the OFIS Commissioner.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ii. INSURANCE SCORING MAY BE USED TO ESTABLISH A PREMIUM DISCOUNT PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Chapter 21 of the Insurance Code, MCL 500.2110a,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> permits insurers to establish and maintain a premium discount plan using factors in addition to those specifically enumerated in MCL 500.2111, provided that the plan \u201cis consistent with the purposes of this act and reflects reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses\u201d and is uniformly applied to all the insurer\u2019s insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The evidence establishes that a premium discount plan using insurance scoring may reflect reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses on the part of the insurer employing the plan. Commissioner Fitzgerald\u2019s 2002 report concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">[t]here exists a correlation between a person\u2019s insurance credit score and the likelihood that a claim will be filed. A thorough review of material submitted by ChoicePoint and by a number of companies demonstrates that better scores are connected to fewer claims and thus lower expenses than are the scores of persons with weaker credit histories. [Fitzgerald Report, <em>supra </em>at 22.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In addition, several affidavits submitted by plaintiffs in the lower court record indicate a correlation between insurance scores and risk of loss. The affidavit of Morrall Claramunt, Executive Vice President and Secretary of plaintiff Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Company, is representative. Claramunt stated in his affidavit that \u201cFrankenmuth\u2019s experience shows that there is a clear and direct correlation between insurance scores and risk. Among our insureds, people with higher insurance scores are better risks.\u201d Claramunt stated that 91 percent of Frankenmuth\u2019s homeowners insurance customers and 89 percent of its automobile insurance customers receive insurance score discounts on their premiums. He estimated that 68.1 percent of Frankenmuth\u2019s homeowners insurance customers and 43.5 percent of its automobile insurance customers would experience premium increases as a result of the OFIS rules\u2019 ban on insurance scoring. Claramunt stated that \u201c[t]hese premiums do not reflect a shift in corresponding risk of loss, but result in low-risk insureds subsidizing the insurance rates of high-risk insureds.\u201d Proposed Intervenors\u2019 Appendix to Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction, March 29, 2005, included in Plaintiffs Appendix in Docket No. 137407, p 116a. Affidavits of representatives of plaintiffs Farm Bureau Insurance Company, Progressive Michigan Insurance Company, Hastings Mutual Insurance Company, and Citizens Insurance Company of America similarly stated that those companies\u2019 experiences show a correlation between insurance scores and risk, and that the OFIS rules would result in lower-risk insureds subsidizing the rates of higher-risk insureds. See <em>id. </em>at 115a-152a.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Evidence in the administrative record also supports the conclusion that there is a correlation between insurance scores and risk of loss. For example, according to a statement submitted by Allstate Insurance Company, \u201cthe use of credit information is the most powerful predictor of losses to be developed in the past 30 years.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Appendix in Docket No. 137400, p 200b. A chart submitted by Allstate Insurance Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>pany based on Michigan data demonstrates that \u201cinsureds . . . that have superior insurance scores have [a] corresponding superior loss cost experience,\u201d and that insureds with the lowest insurance scores have \u201cover 50% more claims paid\u201d than insureds with the highest insurance scores. <em>Id. </em>at 203b. In addition, Michigan data submitted by Farm Bureau Insurance of Michigan \u201cclearly suggests that, as a group, insureds with better insurance scores have better loss experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98b. The personal auto product manager for Progressive Michigan Insurance Company testified that \u201c[o]ur data shows that credit information is highly predictive of loss . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105b. A comprehensive study conducted by EPIC Actuaries, LLC, concluded that \u201cthe propensity for loss decreases as [the] insurance score increases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59b. Finally, the Virginia Bureau of Insurance Study concluded that \u201cthere is a concrete statistical correlation between insurance scores based on credit bureau data and the likelihood of an individual filing an insurance claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132b.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Defendant acknowledges that \u201cthere is no dispute that [MCL 500.2110a] authorizes a premium discount plan based on factors that correlate to expected reductions in losses or expenses. For example, discounts may be based on maintaining fire extinguishers in the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>because it is expected that the presence of fire extinguishers will be associated with reduced losses.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Brief in Docket No. 137400, p 18. Defendant argues, however, that MCL 500.2110a does not permit a premium discount plan using insurance scoring \u201cbecause insurance scoring is not associated with anticipated reductions in overall losses. In other words, insurers do not expect their overall losses to change whether or not they have an insurance-scoring discount plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). In support of this conclusion, defendant states that \u201cinsurers admitted\u201d at the public hearings and as part of the public comment process \u201cthat doing away with insurance scoring would not change overall premiums.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant quotes testimony from a spokesperson for State Farm Insurance Company: \u201cInsurance scoring does not change the total amount of premium collected by the insurance companies and a ban of its use will not change the total amount either.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">From insurers\u2019 testimony that the OFIS rules banning insurance scoring would not result in an industry-wide reduction in premiums for insurance consumers,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> defendant argues that insurers do not expect a reduction in \u201coverall losses\u201d to be associated with offering discounts for insurance scores. Defendant\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>misreads MCL 500.2110a, which says nothing about <em>overall </em>losses or expenses. MCL 500.2110a allows \u201can insurer\u201d to establish \u201ca plan\u201d \u201cif <em>the plan . .. </em>reflects reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses.\u201d The plain meaning of this provision is that an insurer may establish a plan that it reasonably anticipates will reduce <em>its own </em>losses or expenses. It is unclear how an insurer would \u201creasonably anticipateG\u201d the effect of its premium discount plan on <em>industry-wide </em>losses or expenses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Individual insurers <em>do, </em>of course, anticipate reductions in their own losses or expenses to result from the use of premium discount plans using insurance scoring. Specifically, they anticipate that insurance score discounts will enable them to attract and retain more low-risk customers by offering these customers lower rates. Plaintiffs have demonstrated a clear correlation between insurance scores and risk of loss, as already discussed. Therefore, they have established that a discount plan that enables an insurer to attract and retain more lower risk insureds \u201creflects reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses for that insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Defendant\u2019s attempts to distinguish the use of insurance scores to establish a premium discount plan from the use of safety devices to establish such a plan fails to acknowledge that MCL 500.2111 already permits insurers to take into account \u201c[s]ecurity and safety devices,\u201d including \u201csmoke detectors\u201d and \u201csimilar, related devices.\u201d MCL 500.2111(7)(b). Similarly, for automobile insurance, the statute permits \u201c[u]se of a safety belt\u201d to be used as a classification factor. MCL 500.21112(b)(ic). The Legislature added MCL 500.2110a in 1997 to permit insurers to offer discounts on the basis of factors \u201cin addition to those permitted by\u201d MCL 500.2111. Defendant\u2019s effort to distinguish discounts for safety devices from discounts for higher insurance scores also fails to recognize that offering discounts for high insurance scores, like offering discounts for safety devices, allows insurers to attract insureds who present less risk (because they currently have safety devices or high insurance scores), and may provide future incentives for insureds to acquire safety devices or improve their insurance scores, and thus become statistically less risky customers. There is little difference between providing a discount for anti-lock brakes, for example, and providing a discount based on high insurance scores.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Discounts for anti-lock brakes are offered because they reduce the risk of loss, and discounts for high insurance scores are offered because they reduce the risk of loss. The more insureds there are with anti-lock brakes, the lower the risk of overall loss. Likewise, the more insureds there are with high insurance scores, the lower the risk of overall loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Defendant also argues that a premium discount plan using insurance scoring is impermissible under MCL 500.2110a because it ignores one of the express purposes of the Insurance Code: to make insurance available and affordable for everyone.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Defendant contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that, unless a premium discount plan reduces overall losses and reduces premiums for some policyholders without a corresponding increase in premiums for others industry-wide, it is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s purpose of making insurance available and affordable for everyone. These assertions about the overarching purposes of the insurance code are unavailing because, as discussed above, MCL 500.2110a expressly permits <em>\u201can </em>insurer\u201d to establish <em>\u201ca </em>plan\u201d \u201cif <em>the plan . . . </em>reflects reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Moreover, in his 2002 report, Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that \u201cinsurance credit scoring contributes to the continued availability and affordability of automobile and homeowners insurance.\u201d Fitzgerald Report, <em>supra </em>at 17. There is also evidence in the administrative record that the majority of Michigan residents will see an increase in their insurance premiums <em>if insurance scoring is prohibited. </em>See Plaintiffs\u2019 Appendix in Docket No. 137400 at 98b, 106b, 169b, 194b, and 204b. If so, the prohibition of insurance scoring would obviously make insurance less affordable for many Michigan policyholders. The availability of insurance would be diminished because insurers would no longer be able to use \u201cthe most powerful predictor of losses\u201d to determine rates. <em>Id. </em>at 200b. A number of insurers submitted testimony indicating that competition in Michigan would likely decrease because of the increased risks associated with a less sophisticated and precise classification structure, thereby decreasing the availability of insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 100b and 177b. For example, one insurer opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">If Michigan joins the distinct minority of states rejecting [insurance scoring] and depriving carriers of this highly predictive rating tool, [we] fear[] that many national carriers will decline to write in this state. Declining carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>presence will translate to fewer options for consumers and ultimately, higher rates. <em>[Id. </em>at 177b.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also explained in a report to Congress that using insurance scoring is of broad benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Insurance companies have a strong economic incentive to try to predict risk as accurately as possible. In a competitive market for insurance in which all firms have access to the same information about risk, competition for customers will force insurance companies to offer the lowest rates that cover the expected cost of each policy sold. If an insurance company is able to predict risk better than its competitors, it can identify consumers who currently are paying more than they should based on the risk they pose, and target those consumers by offering them a slightly lower price. Thus, developing and using better risk prediction methods is an important form of competition among insurance companies.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">It seems unlikely that more available and more affordable insurance will result from decreased competition among insurers any more than such a market phenomenon would likely result in the increased availability or affordability of any other product or service. That is, it is the <em>prohibition, </em>not the <em>allowance, </em>of insurance scoring that will, in fact, make insurance both less available and less affordable to Michigan residents. It is noteworthy in this regard that after the Maryland legislature banned the use of insurance scoring for homeowners insurance, rates increased as much as 20 percent for homeowner policyholders, and at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>insurer indicated that about 75 percent of its homeowner policyholders incurred rate increases.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Even defendant does not appear to dispute that while banning insurance scoring would lower insurance premiums for insurance customers with lower credit scores, it would <em>raise </em>premiums for many others with higher insurance scores who are now receiving discounts on the basis of those scores. It is difficult to see how offering discounts to some insureds on the basis of good insurance scores is inconsistent with the Insurance Code\u2019s general purpose of availability and affordability of insurance for all consumers. Defendant has not shown that insurance scoring cannot be used to establish a premium discount plan that complies with MCL 500.2110a.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">iii. INSURANCE SCORING DOES NOT PRODUCE RATES THAT ARE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">For the reasons explained above, insurance scoring may be used to establish a premium discount plan under Chapter 21. For insurance under Chapters 24 and 26, insurers must give due consideration to \u201cpast and prospective loss experience\u201d and \u201call other relevant factors....\u201d MCL 500.2403(l)(a); MCL 500.2603(l)(a). \u201cRisks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums,\u201d and \u201crating plans may measure any differences among risks that may have a probable effect upon losses or expenses ....\u201d MCL 500.2403(l)(c); MCL 500.2603(l)(c). \u201cRates shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d MCL 500.2403(l)(d); MCL 500.2603(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Thus, under Chapters 24 and 26, insurers may generally establish any rating plan that \u201cmeasures any differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>enees among risks that may have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.\u201d As discussed above, the experience of the insurance industry, as established in the lower court record, demonstrates a correlation between insurance scores and risk of loss. Thus, just as insurance scoring may be used to establish a premium discount plan under Chapter 21, the use of insurance scoring as part of a rating plan is consistent with Chapter 24 and 26. All three chapters, however, prohibit rates that are \u201cexcessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d MCL 500.2109(l)(a); MCL 500.2403(l)(d); MCL 500.2603(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Defendant argues that insurance scoring is contrary to the Insurance Code because it produces rates that are unfairly discriminatory. As noted, Chapters 21, 24, and 26 all provide that \u201c[r]ates shall not be... unfairly discriminatory.\u201d MCL 500.2109(l)(a); MCL 500.2403(l)(d); MCL 500.2603(l)(d). Chapters 21, 24, and 26 define \u201cunfairly discriminatory\u201d in a nearly identical fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">A rate for a coverage is unfairly discriminatory in relation to another rate for the same coverage if the differential between the rates is not reasonably justified by differences in losses, expenses, or both, or by differences in the uncertainty of loss, for the individuals or risks to which the rates apply. A reasonable justification shall be supported by a reasonable classification system; by sound actuarial principles when applicable; and by actual and credible loss and expense statistics or, in the case of new coverages and classifications, by reasonably anticipated loss and expense experience. A rate is not unfairly discriminatory because it reflects differences in expenses for individuals or risks with similar anticipated losses, or because it reflects differences in losses for individuals or risks with similar expenses. [MCL 500.2109(l)(c); see also MCL 500.2403(l)(d); MCL 500.2603(l)(d).][<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>An existing OFIS rule defines \u201creasonable classification system\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">a system designed to group individuals or risks with similar characteristics into rating classifications which are likely to identify significant differences in mean anticipated losses or expenses, or both, between the groups, as determined by sound actuarial principles and by actual and credible loss and expense statistics or, in the case of new coverages or classifications, by reasonably anticipated loss and expense experience. [Mich Admin Code, R 500.1505(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Defendant and the dissent argue that insurance scoring is not a reasonable classification system because credit reports are unreliable and their use therefore results in misclassification of policyholders. Significantly, however, although the Commissioner also regulates the state banking and finance industries, the Commissioner has taken no action to curtail the use of credit reports in these industries. Indeed, the state of Michigan, including the Commissioner\u2019s own office, employs credit reports to make thousands of decisions each year that affect Michigan residents. In 2009 alone, the state spent over $250,000 of taxpayer dollars to obtain thousands of credit reports.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, by requiring the Commissioner and other state agencies to obtain credit reports, the Legislature has effectively determined that credit reports are reliable. See, e.g., MCL 493.137(4)(b)(\u00bf) and MCL 493.163(l)(a)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In support of its argument that credit reports are inaccurate, defendant primarily relies on a 2003 report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>by the United States General Accounting Office (GAO). The report is entitled \u201cLimited Information Exists on Extent of Credit Report Errors and Their Implications for Consumers.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As the title suggests, the GAO study detailed in the report essentially found that too little information existed to draw any conclusions about the accuracy of credit reports. The GAO Report Highlights explain that \u201c[information on the frequency, type, and cause of credit report errors is limited to the point that a comprehensive assessment of overall credit report accuracy using currently available information is not possible.\u201d It further notes that \u201c[industry officials and studies indicated that credit report errors could either help or hurt individual consumers depending on the nature of the error and the consumer\u2019s personal circumstances.\u201d Defendant cites three studies discussed in the report that raised concerns about the accuracy of credit reports: one by the Consumer Federation of America and National Credit Reporting Association, one by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and a survey conducted by Consumers Union and published by Consumer Reports. GAO Report, <em>supra </em>at 4-6. With respect to these studies, the GAO report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">We cannot determine the frequency of errors in credit reports based on the Consumer Federation of America, U.S. PIRG, and Consumers Union studies. Two of the studies did not use a statistically representative methodology because they examined only the credit files of their employees who verified the accuracy of the information, and it was not clear if the sampling methodology in the third study was statistically projectable. Moreover, all three studies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>counted any inaccuracy as an error regardless of potential impact. Similarly, the studies used varying definitions in identifying errors, and provided sometimes obscure explanations of how they carried out their work. Because of this, the findings may not represent the total population of credit reports maintained by the [consumer reporting agencies, or] CRAs. Moreover, none of these groups developed their findings in consultation with members of the credit reporting industry, who, according to a [Consumer Data Industry Association][<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] representative, could have verified or refuted some of the claimed errors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">Beyond these limitations, a CDIA official stated that these studies misrepresented the frequency of errors because they assessed missing information as an error. According to CRA officials errors of omission may be mitigated in certain instances because certain lenders tend to use merged credit report files in making lending decisions .... <em>[Id. </em>at 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The materials defendant cites for the proposition that credit reports are unreliable are inconclusive at best. Moreover, there is evidence in the administrative record that most of the \u201cerrors\u201d in credit reports are minor ones, such as misspelled street names, that have little or no substantive effect on the actual insurance scoring itself. Plaintiffs\u2019 Appendix in Docket No. 137400 at 118b-119b, 206b. See also the written testimony of Allstate Insurance Company, indicating that its \u201cinternal data,\u201d derived from the more than 43.5 million credit reports it ordered in 2001, 2002, 2003, in connection with the use of insurance scoring models, \u201cindicate] a minute amount of error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206b.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cunreliability\u201d resulting from minor errors that have little or no effect on insurance scoring is irrelevant for purposes of the Insurance Code. In order for any unreliability to produce rates that are unfairly discriminatory within the meaning of the Insurance Code, the unreliability would have to result in a \u201cdifferential between the rates\u201d that \u201cis not reasonably justified by differences in losses, expenses, or both, or by differences in the uncertainty of loss, for the individuals or risks to which the rates apply.\u201d MCL 500.2109(l)(c); see also MCL 500.2403(l)(d); MCL 500.2603(l)(d). A rate is not unfairly discriminatory if there is a \u201creasonable justification\u201d for the differential in rates \u201csupported by a reasonable classification system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, plaintiffs have demonstrated that insurance scoring may be used to establish a \u201creasonable classification system.\u201d Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tiffs\u2019 \u201cactual and credible loss statistics\u201d indicate that insurance scoring may be used to establish a \u201csystem designed to group individuals or risks with similar characteristics which are likely to identify significant differences in mean anticipated losses or expenses, or both, between the groups.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 500.1505(3). For example, an affidavit of Dawn Elzinga, Director of Property Casualty Actuarial and an employee of plaintiff Farm Bureau, summarizes data collected by Farm Bureau reflecting its losses since Farm Bureau began using insurance scoring premium discounts for personal automobile insurance on July 1, 2000. From 2000 through 2004, insureds with the highest insurance scores (those receiving the largest discounts) filed 20 claims for every 100 cars insured, while insureds with the lowest insurance scores (those who were not receiving any discount) filed 28 claims for evexy 100 cars insured. See Plaintiffs Appendix in Docket No. 137407 at 124a-125a. Similarly, plaintiff Hastings submitted to the trial court actuarial analyses it commissioned in 2004 in order to comply with OFIS filing requirements. The analyses demonstrate a direct, linear relationship between insurance scores and risk for both automobile and homeowners policies. According to an affidavit of Keith E. Jandahl, Vice President of Underwriting for Hastings, these analyses were filed with OFIS, which never challenged the filing. See <em>id. </em>at 140a, 143a, and 145a.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the use of insurance scoring inherently violates the Insurance Code\u2019s prohibition on rates that are \u201cunfairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>discriminatory.\u201d Because the Commissioner has no authority under the Insurance Code to ban a practice that the code permits, the OFIS rules exceed the scope of the Commissioner\u2019s rulemaking authority under the Insurance Code. Under <em>Luttrell, </em>421 Mich at 100, the OFIS rules are invalid.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">iv conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The Commissioner has the authority to insure that insurers\u2019 practices comply with the Insurance Code.

In addition, the Allstate chart mentioned above includes Michigan-only data, <em>id. </em>at 203b, and Farm Bureau\u2019s data cited above are also exclusively from Michigan. <em>Id. </em>at 102b. Finally, the dissent incorrectly asserts that none of these studies includes data on Michigan home policies. Allstate provided a chart that includes data on Michigan home policies and this chart shows that insureds with the highest insurance scores also incur \u201cfar less loss costs\u201d than do insureds with lower insurance scores. <em>Id. </em>at 203b.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Concerning the EPIC study, the dissent further argues, relying on the 2004 OFIS report to JCAR, <em>supra </em>at 20, 24, that the actual Michigan data in the EPIC study undermine the authors\u2019 assertion that the graphs for each state exhibit similar patterns of decreasing claims frequencies with increasing insurance scores. Michael J. Miller, one of the authors of the EPIC study, has specifically responded to these claims. In an April 12, 2005 affidavit, Miller states that \u201c[t]he OFIS is wrong\u201d in claiming \u201cthat the conclusions in our June 2003 report are \u2018totally contradicted\u2019 by the Michigan data in our sample.\u201d Miller explains that the EPIC study was based on data from six automobile coverages: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical payments, personal injury protection, comprehensive, and collision. The study\u2019s conclusions were based on the results from all six coverages, but because of the sheer size of the report, the authors chose to exhibit in the report results from only one of the six coverages: property damage liability. While that was a good choice for 49 states, it was not an ideal choice for Michigan because of Michigan\u2019s unique no-fault law, which causes the frequency of property damage claims in Michigan to be about one-fifth of the rate countrywide. \u201cThe relatively few claims resulted in substantial random variations in the data, making the correlation between credit-based insurance scores and losses less obvious in the Michigan data for this coverage.\u201d Miller continues:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Attached to this affidavit are five exhibits of the Michigan data from our June 2003 study. Each of the five Michigan coverages is represented by a separate graph. <em>These exhibits show for Michigan exactly what we found from the countrywide data: credit-based insurance scores are correlated with the propensity for an insurance </em>claim, <em>or loss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Given this strong correlation which is evident in Michigan and across the country, it would be unreasonable to assume that there is no relationship between credit-based insurance scores and auto insurance claims. The knowledge that credit-based insurance scores are related and predictive of insurance losses, means that rates established without reflection of credit scores will he inadequate for some insureds, excessive for other insureds, and unfairly discriminatory for all.

I agree with the majority that the Court should reach the substantive issues in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent from its conclusion regarding the validity of the rules promulgated by defendant that prohibit insurers from classifying insureds on the basis of their credit records (the OFIS rules). Also, of particular concern to me is the majority\u2019s harmless-error analysis. It is seriously flawed and sets a dangerous precedent for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">In <em>Luttrell v Dep\u2019t of Corrections,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court adopted a three-pronged test for analyzing the validity of an administrative agency\u2019s rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">Where an agency is empowered to make rules, courts employ a three-fold test to determine the validity of the rules it promulgates: (1) whether the rule is within the matter covered by the enabling statute; (2) if so, whether it complies with the underlying legislative intent; and (3) if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>meets the first two requirements, when <em>[sic] </em>it is neither arbitrary nor capricious.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In <em>In re Complaint of Rovas against SBC Michigan, </em>we held that an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes is entitled to \u201crespectful consideration\u201d and \u201cshould not be overruled without cogent reasons.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">THE MAJORITY\u2019S CRITICAL ERRORS</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In my view, the majority goes awry in at least five significant ways. First, it misapplies the applicable standards of review. Under the first prong of <em>Luttrell, </em>the proper inquiry is not whether \u201cinsurance scoring is permissible under the Insurance Code.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Code says nothing about insurance scoring. The relevant inquiry is whether rules banning the use of insurance scoring in setting insurance rates are within the matters covered by MCL 500.210.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Second, by considering and rejecting each argument offered in support of the OFIS rules, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>improperly shifts the burden of proof to defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, the majority fails to give \u201crespectful consideration\u201d to defendant\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes as <em>In re Rovas Complaint </em>requires.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Fourth, the majority errs by not confining its review of the record to conform to its \u201charmless error\u201d analysis. The majority holds that \u201ceven if the trial court erred by not limiting its review to the administrative record, the error was harmless because there is ample evidence <em>in that record </em>to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that insurance scoring is permissible under the Insurance Code.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Yet the majority subsequently expands its review by referring to evidence outside that record.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The majority has it backwards. If the circuit court erred by creating its own evidentiary record, its conclusion must be wholly supportable on appeal by evidence in the administrative record. For an error to be considered harmless, the conclusion reached in the case must be supportable notwithstanding the alleged error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the majority deems it necessary, as evidenced by its analysis, to examine both the administrative record and the circuit court record to support its conclusion, the error cannot be \u201charmless.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>After conducting a proper \u201charmless error\u201d analysis, I reach the opposite conclusion from the majority. Any procedural error was harmless because the evidence in both the administrative record and the circuit court record failed to establish that the OFIS rules are invalid. Thus, my inquiry gives plaintiffs the benefit of every doubt and examines the evidence in both records. The result is that, if a procedural error occurred, it was harmless. By expanding the scope of its review, the majority fails to accord defendant the same treatment, thereby making its harmless-error analysis erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Fifth and finally, the majority\u2019s overly broad review of the record goes beyond even the administrative and circuit court records. It relies on sources outside any record provided to this Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">These errors are crucial to the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the discussion of the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims demonstrates, much conflicting evidence exists on whether insurance scoring is predictive of loss. The majority appears willing to overrule defendant\u2019s decision simply because it disagrees with it. However, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the proper level of deference is applied, it is irrelevant whether the majority would decide the issue differently. Rather, after examining the conflicting evidence, one can only conclude that defendant did not exceed her authority by promulgating the rules banning the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\n<em>HOME BUILDERS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Under <em>Home </em>Builders,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the circuit court indisputably erred by creating and considering an evidentiary record outside of what was created during the rulemaking process. However, despite the fact that the circuit court impermissibly expanded the record in contravention of <em>Home Builders, </em>I do not believe that the error is outcome determinative. Under the proper standard of review, neither the circuit court record nor the administrative record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the OFIS rules are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">After declining to review the administrative record and instead constructing its own record, the circuit court concluded that the OFIS rules were invalid. It did so on the basis of its independent factual conclusion that insurance scores accurately reflect differences in risk. I believe that, by reaching its own factual conclusions and failing to consider the administrative record at all, the circuit court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">We long ago held that \u201ccourts accord due deference to administrative expertise and [may] not invade the province of exclusive administrative fact-finding by displacing an agency\u2019s choice between two reasonably differing views.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although this holding arose in the context of judicial review of quasi-judicial administrative decisions, I see no basis for limiting it to such cases. Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>review of agency actions implicates significant questions about the separation of powers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Home Builders </em>cited ample authority in summarizing this point:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The federal courts generally limit judicial review to the administrative record already in existence, rather than permitting either review de novo or trial de novo. <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co v Lorion, </em>470 US 729, 743-744; 105 S Ct 1598; 84 L Ed 2d 643 (1985); <em>Camp v Pitts, </em>411 US 138, 142; 93 S Ct 1241; 36 L Ed 2d 106 (1973) (\u201c[T]he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.\u201d); <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union v Horner, </em>272 US App DC 81, 89; 854 F2d 490 (1988) (\u201cStated most simply, our task is to determine . .. whether [the agency] considered the relevant factors and explained the facts and policy concerns on which it relied, and whether those facts have some basis in the record.\u201d); <em>Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, Inc v Bowen, </em>808 F2d 486, 489 (CA 6, 1987). For example, in <em>Florida Power, supra </em>at 744, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cIf the record before the agency does not support the agency action, if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, or if the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation. <em>The reviewing court is not generally empowered to conduct a </em>de novo <em>inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.\u201d[</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Moreover, agency actions taken in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, as contrasted with those taken in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>quasi-legislative capacity, are subject to a heightened standard of review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, quasi-legislative agency actions are afforded greater deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Accordingly, the factual findings on which an administrative agency\u2019s rule is based certainly must be considered in reviewing the validity of that rule. To allow a court to make factual findings based solely on a record made in the court would allow the judiciary to substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. Moreover, it would allow the courts to usurp the authority that the Legislature granted to administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">THE VALIDITY OF THE OFIS RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The first prong of the <em>Luttrell </em>analysis requires plaintiffs to show that the OFIS rules banning insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>anee scoring are not \u201cwithin the matter covered\u201d by the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that way, plaintiffs are given the burden of showing that a total ban on insurance scoring is inconsistent with the Code. Because I conclude that the OFIS rules are within the matter covered by the Insurance Code, I conclude that plaintiffs have not met their burden. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate either that the rules are incompatible with the underlying legislative intent or that they are arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u201cWITHIN THE MATTER COVERED BY THE ENABLING STATUTE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">When courts apply the first prong of the <em>Luttrell </em>test, the most relevant authorities are the enabling statutes of the Insurance Code. MCL 500.210 defines the scope of the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s regulatory powers. Section 210 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">[t]he commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations in addition to those now specifically provided for by statute as he may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes and to execute and enforce the provisions of the insurance laws of this state in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 88 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being sections 24.71 to 24.80 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, and subject to Act No. 197 of the Public Acts of 1952, as amended, being sections 24.101 to 24.110 of the Compiled Laws of 1948.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">MCL 500.210 delegates broad discretionary authority to the Commissioner to promulgate rules \u201cas he may deem necessary\u201d to enforce insurance laws and \u201ceffectuate the purposes\u201d of the Insurance Code. Even Judge ZAHRA\u2019s opinion, which would have held the OFIS rules invalid, conceded that \u201c[i]n the broadest sense, the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>under review do not offend the first prong of the <em>Luttrell </em>standard.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, as Judge WHITE noted,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the OFIS rules were promulgated in compliance with the prescribed procedures in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">I agree that, on their face, the OFIS rules are within the broad discretionary authority that the Legislature bestowed on defendant to \u201ceffectuate the purposes\u201d of the Insurance Code. The majority reaches the opposite conclusion because, as noted previously, it merely asks whether insurance scoring is \u201cpermissible\u201d under the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">COMPLIANCE WITH THE UNDERLYING LEGISLATIVE INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The title of the Insurance Code provides that the purpose of the Code is \u201cto provide for the continued availability and affordability of automobile insurance and homeowners insurance in this state and to facilitate the purchase of that insurance by all residents of this state at fair and reasonable rates... .\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, the OFIS rules cannot satisfy this prong of the <em>Luttrell </em>standard if they are contrary to that intent. Ascertaining legislative intent necessitates a close examination of the statutory language of the applicable statutes. I would hold that the OFIS rules do not comply with the Legislature\u2019s intent if Chapters 21, 24, and 26 of the Insurance Code authorize insurance scoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">CHAPTER 21</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">It is undisputed that insurance scoring is not included within the enumerated permissible rating fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tors in MCL 500.2111. Therefore, using insurance scoring to set insurance rates is only permissible under Chapter 21 if it is a permissible \u201cpremium discount plan\u201d under MCL 500.2110a. Affording the required \u201crespectful consideration\u201d to defendant\u2019s interpretation of MCL 500.2110a, I agree that setting rates based on insurance scoring does not constitute a \u201cpremium discount plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">At the public hearings held before the OFIS rules were adopted, insurers conceded that eliminating insurance scoring would not change the total premiums that they collect from their insureds.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It follows that the proposed \u201cdiscount plan\u201d based on insurance scoring does not reflect a belief on the part of the insurers that insurance scoring will reduce its overall losses. If it did, the insurers would surely be forced to increase their premiums to reflect the expected increase in losses that would be incurred once their \u201cdiscount plans\u201d had been disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Rather, setting premium rates on the basis of insurance scoring simply reallocates the amount each insured pays on the basis of its insurance score. Defendant uses an example in which an insurer must collect $900 in premiums to pay for its expected losses and expenses. Dividing these losses evenly across Class A, Class B, and Class C, each class of insureds would be charged $300. However, using insurance scoring to predict losses, the insurer charges its highest scoring insureds (Class A) a $200 premium. The insurer charges its less favored policyholders a $300 premium, and its lowest scoring policyholders a $400 premium. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The insurer still collects $900 in premiums.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> I agree with Judge WHITE that this classification scheme constitutes an unapproved rating factor rather than a discount.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, I see no cogent reasons to overrule defendant\u2019s interpretation of MCL 500.2110a.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">CHAPTER 24 AND CHAPTER 26</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Chapter 24 and Chapter 26 of the Insurance Code allow insurers greater authority in setting premiums than does Chapter 21.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> MCL 500.2403(1)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>MCL 500.2603(1)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> provide the limitation on setting rates at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Plaintiffs argue that under MCL 500.2426 and MCL 500.2626, defendant may not disapprove rates that are based on insurance scores because insurance scoring is actuarially sound. Defendant counters that insurance scoring is not a \u201creasonable classification system\u201d under MCL 500.2403(l)(d) and MCL 500.2603(l)(d). A \u201creasonable classification system\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">a system designed to group individuals or risks with similar characteristics into rating classifications which are likely to identify significant differences in mean anticipated losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>or expenses, or both, between the groups, as determined by sound actuarial principles and by actual and credible loss and expense statistics or, in the case of new coverages or classifications, by reasonably anticipated loss and expense experience.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Thus, defendant claims that rates set based on insurance scores are \u201cunfairly discriminatory\u201d because they are not \u201clikely to identify significant differences in mean anticipated losses or expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">An examination of both the circuit court record and the administrative record reveals the reasonableness of defendant\u2019s conclusion that rates based on insurance scores are unfairly discriminatory. First, the accuracy of credit reports, on which insurance scores are based, is unclear. The GAO report cited by the majority concluded that \u201ca comprehensive assessment of overall credit report accuracy using currently available information is not possible.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As defendant noted, the evidence on this point is inconclusive.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The majority appears to concede that the reliability of credit reports is subject to question. Yet it proceeds by effectively requiring defendant, rather than plaintiffs, to show that \u201cthe unreliability [in credit scores] would have to result in a \u2018differential between the rates\u2019 that \u2018is not reasonably justified ....\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>I would conclude the contrary and hold that the uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of credit reports is evidence per se that a classification system based on those reports is unreasonable. It should be plaintiffs\u2019 burden to rebut this conclusion by producing evidence that such a classification is reasonable. To do so, plaintiffs would need to demonstrate that classifying persons on the basis of insurance scores is \u201clikely to identify significant differences in mean anticipated losses or expenses.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The record simply does not establish that credit scores correlate with the risk of loss in a way that makes insurance scoring a \u201creasonable classification system\u201d under MCL 500.2403(l)(d) and MCL 500.2603(l)(d). Defendant reasonably rejected some of the studies submitted at the public hearings in opposition to the OFIS rules because they used \u201cunivariate analysis\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and analyzed data from states other than Michigan.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The only study not conducted by plaintiffs that included data on Michigan automobile policies, which plaintiffs cited often as supporting their position, showed \u201ca total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>lack of correlation.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Moreover, defendant.noted that \u201cthe agency is not aware of any study at all. . . that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>includes data on Michigan home policies.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The majority entirely ignores these findings and picks and chooses from among the available data to independently consider whether a classification system based on credit scores is reasonable.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">However, the circuit court record provides little that undermines defendant\u2019s factual findings made at the public hearings. Plaintiffs continued to rely heavily on the studies that defendant reasonably rejected. The new evidence introduced in the circuit court consisted primarily of affidavits from various insurance industry executives. These cite statistics that purportedly show a correlation between credit scores and risk. While generally supporting plaintiffs\u2019 position, the affidavits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>insufficient to rebut defendant\u2019s conclusion that the use of insurance scoring to set rates is not a \u201creasonable classification system.\u201d The statistical data in the affidavits, like the studies in the administrative record, are based on a univariate analysis. For reasons cited previously, it was not unreasonable for defendant to reject this analysis.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Finally, I do not address the majority\u2019s discussion of sources outside the administrative and circuit court records because the majority improperly relies on them.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Reference to statutes that are not applicable to this case may be appropriate when discerning the proper interpretation of a statute; however, it is not warranted simply as a means of bolstering the evidence that is on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">As with Chapter 21, defendant\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutory provisions in Chapters 24 and 26 is entitled to \u201crespectful consideration\u201d under <em>In re Rovas Complaint. </em>Because setting rates using insurance scoring is not clearly permissible under any chapter, I conclude that the OFIS rules do not violate the legislative intent behind the Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The majority concludes that it need not decide whether the OFIS rules are arbitrary and capricious because \u201cthey are not \u2018within the matter covered by the enabling statute.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Given that I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion on the latter point, I am com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>pelled to also address the former issue regarding whether the OFIS rules are arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u201cA rule is not arbitrary or capricious if it is rationally related to the purpose of the enabling act.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> For the reasons stated previously, I conclude that the OFIS rules are rationally related to the purpose of the Insurance Code: to provide for continued availability and affordability of insurance in this state and to facilitate the purchase of that insurance by all residents at fair and reasonable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the OFIS rules are invalid because they deprive them of due process. They argue that the rules invalidate existing insurance rates without a contested case hearing and an opportunity for judicial review. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The rules do not invalidate existing insurance rates. They are prospective only and apply solely to new and renewal policies issued after their effective date. Moreover, the rules are not self-enforcing; they do not invalidate rates. Defendant acknowledges that, after the rules take effect, insurers are entitled to notice and an opportunity for a hearing before rates may be invalidated. If an insurer\u2019s rate filing uses insurance scoring, that rate filing will be disapproved as a violation of the OFIS rules. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument conflates their right to a contested case hearing before a rate filing may be invalidated into a right to such a hearing before new rules may be promulgated. To create such a right would cripple an agency\u2019s authority to promulgate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>rules and be duplicative of the procedural protections already present in the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that any rate hearing will be a meaningless exercise because the outcome will be predetermined and the filing will be disapproved. This argument is disingenuous because plaintiffs chose to file this action for declaratory judgment attacking the <em>facial </em>validity of the rules. To accept plaintiffs\u2019 due process argument would be to ignore that plaintiffs chose this forum, rather than individual contested case hearings, to challenge the OFIS rules. Moreover, this argument could just as easily be raised by an insurer that sets rates on the basis of impermissible factors such as race or gender; however, it is inconceivable that such rates would be allowed simply because the result of the contested case hearing was predetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to reach the substantive issues in this case. However, I dissent from its conclusion that the Insurance Commissioner exceeded her rulemaking authority under <em>Luttrell v Dep\u2019t of Corrections.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">I would hold that the OFIS rules are valid and enforceable. Therefore, I would affirm the Court of Appeals judgment vacating the circuit court\u2019s order granting a permanent injunction and declaring defendant\u2019s rules illegal, unenforceable, and void.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-8\">Cavanagh and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Kelly, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-12\"> I disagree with the majority\u2019s waiver analysis.

Under MCL 500.210, the Commissioner has the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of the Insurance Code. In my view, the power to enact rules to \u201ceffectuate the purposes\u201d of the Insurance Code provides a broader grant of authority than the power simply to inquire whether the Code permits a particular practice. Because the majority hinges its conclusion on this prong of the <em>Luttrell </em>test, its precise application is imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">As the majority observes, I do question whether the Insurance Code authorizes insurance scoring.

Defendant\u2019s brief frequently refers to \u201coverall\u201d losses. However, nowhere does defendant specifically contend that a discount plan is permissible under MCL 500.2110a only if it reflects anticipated reductions in losses or expenses across the entire insurance industry, nor does my analysis impose such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Rather, I interpret MCL 500.2110a as the majority does, as requiring that a discount plan reasonably anticipate a reduction in losses or expenses to each insurer. Initially, I note that an insurer cannot \u201creasonably\u201d anticipate a reduction in losses or expenses based on a discount plan premised on insurance scoring if credit reports are unreliable. See <em>infra </em>at 16-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s example illustrates that insurance rates that are set on the basis of insurance scoring will not reduce the premiums that an individual insurer collects. Instead, such rates will reallocate the dollar amount of the premium paid by each insured. I fail to see how such rates can reflect \u201creasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses\u201d if the insurer continues to collect the same amount in total premiums.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b498-11\"> <em>Ins Institute, </em>280 Mich App at 361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\"> <em>In re Rovas Complaint, </em>482 Mich at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b498-13\"> MCL 500.2426 and MCL 500.2626 both state that no \u201crating plan\u201d that is filed pursuant to the requirements of their respective chapters shall be disapproved if the rates thereby produced meet the requirements of the chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b498-14\"> MCL 500.2403(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>(c) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums.

A reasonable justification shall be supported by a reasonable classification system; by sound actuarial principles when applicable; and by actual and credible loss and expense statistics or, in the case of new coverages and classifications, by reasonably anticipated loss and expense experience. A rate is not unfairly discriminatory because the rate reflects differences in expenses for individuals or risks with similar anticipated losses, or because the rate reflects differences in losses for individuals or risks with similar expenses.

It is available at &lt;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ Attachment_5_-_EPIC_Charts_-_MI_l 13194_7.pdf&gt; (accessed June 24, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The majority correctly observes that, in the body of its report, the authors asserted that the \u201cgraphs for each state ... exhibit strikingly similar patterns of decreasing claim frequencies with increasing insurance scores to the pattern observed in the countrywide data.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 392 n 21 (emphasis omitted), quoting Plaintiffs\u2019 Appendix in Docket No. 137400, at 33b. However, this assertion is undermined by the actual data, which show that claim frequency in Michigan based on insurance scoring ranged from only 0.5% to 0.8%. While the claimants with the highest insurance score did have the lowest rate of claims (0.5%), claimants with the third highest insurance score had one of the highest rates of claims (0.8%). Therefore, one is hard-pressed to square the actual data with the authors\u2019 conclusion that the majority quotes.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The majority excuses this disparity by citing Michael Miller\u2019s affidavit, in which Miller attempts to explain it away. <em>Ante </em>at 393 n 21. The affidavit claims that \u201cthe relatively few claims resulted in substantial random variations in the data, making the correlation between credit-based insurance scores and losses less obvious in the Michigan data for this coverage.\u201d The existence of an excuse for why the Michigan data makes the connection between credit scoring and losses \u201cless obvious\u201d does nothing to justify the majority\u2019s reliance on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Finally, Miller attached five graphs to his affidavit with Michigan-specific data purporting to buttress the EPIC study\u2019s conclusion. Again, the majority takes the author\u2019s stated conclusion at face value. However, as with the data from the EPIC study, most of the actual numbers do not show a strong correlation between credit scoring and propensity for loss. Instead, the portion of the graphs charting Michigan-specific data often deviate significantly from that pattern and do not demonstrate the \u201cstrong correlation\u201d that the majority posits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\"> OFIS Report to JCAR, <em>supra </em>at p 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> The majority\u2019s response to this dissent on the substantive issues involved is unavailing because it presupposes the majority\u2019s ultimate conclusion: that insurance scoring is predictive of loss. <em>Ante </em>at 397, 397 n 25. Thus, its conclusions that \u201c[djiscounts for anti-lock brakes are offered because they reduce the risk of loss, and discounts for high insurance scores are offered because they reduce the risk of loss\u201d do not advance its position. <em>Ante </em>at 397. Similarly, I see little value in speculating that offering discounts based on insurance scoring might lead sometime in the future to reductions in premiums. <em>Ante </em>at 397 n 25. Indeed, for defendant to rely on such speculation as a basis for formulating administrative rules is, in my view, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Finally, the majority\u2019s contention that \u201csetting premium rates without considering insurance scoring also reallocates the amount insureds pay\u201d is similarly unavailing. <em>Ante </em>at 397 n 25 (emphasis omitted). Plaintiffs contend that the use of insurance scoring is permissible because it constitutes a \u201cdiscount plan\u201d under MCL 500.2110a. However, as previously noted, if insurance scoring simply reallocates rates, rather than resulting in an overall reduction in premiums, it is an unapproved rating factor, not a discount plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">By contrast, no party has contended that setting premium rates without considering insurance scoring constitutes a \u201cdiscount plan\u201d within the meaning of MCL 500.2110a.
