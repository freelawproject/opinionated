We hold that ex parte interviews, which are permitted under Michigan law, are also consistent with HIPAA regulations, provided that \u201creasonable efforts have been made ... to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of [45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v)].\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii)(B). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Court of Appeals summarized the relevant facts and trial court proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Plaintiff filed this wrongful-death medical-malpractice action alleging that defendant had failed to properly diagnose or treat plaintiffs decedent, Linda Clippert, thereby proximately causing her death. Defendant sought to interview Clippert\u2019s treating physician, but plaintiff refused to waive Clippert\u2019s confidentiality rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 USC 1320d <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiff signed a waiver allowing the release of medical records, but refused to provide a release for oral communications. Defendant moved for a qualified protective order to permit an ex parte interview with Clippert\u2019s treating physician, but the circuit court denied the motion. The court concluded that \u201cthe HIPAA provision relative to a protective order only... pertains to documentary evidence\u201d and \u201cthat HIPAA does not authorize ex parte oral interviews.\u201d <em>[Holman v Rasak, </em>281 Mich App 507, 508; 761 NW2d 391 (2008).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The Court of Appeals granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and concluded that defense counsel may conduct an ex parte interview with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>plaintiffs treating physician \u201cif a qualified protective order, consistent with 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1), is first put in place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513. The Court \u201cagree[d] with plaintiff that HIPAA supersedes Michigan law to the extent that its protections and requirements are more stringent than those provided by state law,\u201d but disagreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat a defendant\u2019s ex parte interview with a treating physician may not be the subject of a qualified protective order under HIPAA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511-512. It reasoned that the relevant HIPAA regulation, 45 CFR 164.512 (e) (1) (ii), does not exclude oral communication from the regulations governing disclosure of protected health information. <em>Id. </em>at 512. Moreover, \u201c45 CFR 160.103 specifically provides that HIPAA applies to both oral and written information, and 45 CFR 164.512(e)(2) makes clear that the regulations concerning qualified protective orders \u2018do not supersede other provisions of this section that otherwise permit or restrict uses or disclosures of protected health information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 45 CFR 164.512(e)(2). The panel also rejected plaintiffs argument that defendants may rely on written medical records and conduct depositions if more information is required. It quoted this Court\u2019s observation in <em>Domako v Rowe, </em>438 Mich 347, 361; 475 NW2d 30 (1991), that informal interviews are \u201c \u2018routine practice\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018[t]here is no justification for requiring costly depositions . . . without knowing in advance that the testimony will be useful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holman, </em>281 Mich App at 512-513. The panel reversed the trial court\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal to consider whether HIPAA permits defense counsel to seek ex parte interviews with a plaintiffs treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>II. HIPAA</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996.

With exceptions not relevant here, \u201cprotected health information\u201d means \u201cindividually identifiable health information\u201d transmitted by or maintained in electronic media or \u201c[transmitted or maintained in any other form or medium.\u201d 45 CFR 160.103. \u201cHealth information\u201d includes both \u201coral\u201d information and information that is \u201crecorded in any form or medium . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIndividually identifiable health information\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">is information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">(1) [i]s created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">(2) [r] elates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">(i) [t]hat identifies the individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">(ii) [w]ith respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Thus, \u201cprotected health information\u201d is any health information, oral or recorded, that is individually iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tillable and transmitted or maintained by a covered entity in any form or medium. 45 CFR 160.103.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Although a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion regarding discovery is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, <em>People v Phillips, </em>468 Mich 583, 587; 663 NW2d 463 (2003), this case presents questions of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo as questions of law, <em>In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots, </em>463 Mich 378, 383; 617 NW2d 310 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Under Michigan law, defense counsel in a medical malpractice action is permitted to seek an ex parte interview with a plaintiffs treating physician once the plaintiff has waived the physician-patient privilege with respect to that physician. <em>Domako, </em>438 Mich at 361. MCL 600.2157 establishes the physician-patient privilege and also sets forth the rule on waiver of the privilege. It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">Except as otherwise provided by law, a person duly authorized to practice medicine or surgery shall not disclose any information that the person has acquired in attending a patient in a professional character, if the information was necessary to enable the person to prescribe for the patient as a physician, or to do any act for the patient as a surgeon. <em>If the patient brings an action against any defendant to recover for any personal injuries, or for any malpractice, and the patient produces a physician as a</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>witness in the patient\u2019s own behalf who has treated the patient for the injury or for any disease or condition for which the malpractice is alleged, the patient shall be considered to have waived the privilege provided in this section as to another physician who has treated the patient for the injuries, disease, or condition. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In <em>Domako, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c[N]o party to litigation has anything resembling a proprietary right to any witness\u2019s evidence. <em>Absent a privilege no party is entitled to restrict an opponent\u2019s access to a witness ....\u201d </em>While we recognize that the physician is different from an ordinary witness as a result of the confidential nature of the physician\u2019s potential testimony, that confidentiality is adequately preserved by the physician-patient privilege. <em>Once the privilege is waived, there are no sound legal or policy grounds for restricting access to the witness. [Domako, </em>438 Mich at 361, quoting <em>Doe v Eli Lilly &amp; Co, </em>99 FRD 126, 128 (D DC, 1983) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">With respect to ex parte interviews, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">Although the rules are silent on informal methods of discovery, <em>prohibition of all ex parte interviews would be inconsistent with the purpose of providing equal access to relevant evidence and efficient, cost-effective litigation. </em>The omission of interviews from the court rules does not mean that they are prohibited, because the rules are not meant to be exhaustive. See MCR 2.302(F)(2) (permitting parties to modify the court rules to use other methods of discovery). <em>Their absence from the court rules does indicate that they are not mandated and that the physician cannot be forced to comply, but there is nothing in the court rules precluding an interview if the physician chooses to cooperate. [Domako, </em>438 Mich at 361-362.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">After we decided <em>Domako, </em>the Legislature enacted MCL 600.2912f,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides that a defendant in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>medical malpractice action or the defendant\u2019s attorney or representative \u201cmay communicate\u201d with persons or entities with respect to whom the plaintiff has waived the physician-patient privilege \u201cin order to obtain all information relevant to the subject matter of the claim or action and to prepare the person\u2019s or entity\u2019s defense to the claim or action.\u201d MCL 600.2912f(2). The statute also makes clear that a person who discloses such information \u201cdoes not violate [MCL 600.2157] or any other similar duty or obligation created by law and owed to the claimant or plaintiff.\u201d MCL 600.2912f(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Under HIPAA, the general rule pertaining to the disclosure of protected health information is that a covered entity may not use or disclose protected health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>information without a written authorization from the individual as described in 45 CFR 164.508, or, alternatively, the opportunity for the individual to agree or object as described in 45 CFR 164.510. 45 CFR 164.512, however, enumerates several specific situations in which \u201c[a] covered entity may use or disclose protected health information without the written authorization of the individual, as described in [45 CFR] 164.508, or the opportunity for the individual to agree or object as described in [45 CFR] 164.510 ....\u201d 45 CFR 164.512.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This regulation provides alternative requirements for disclosures in specific situations. Relevant here is paragraph (e), \u201c[disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings,\u201d which permits a covered entity to disclose protected health information in response to \u201can order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>a court or administrative tribunal,\u201d or \u201c[i]n response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process, that is not accompanied by an order of a court or administrative tribunal, if\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">(A) [t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance, as described in paragraph (e)(l)(iii) of this section, from the party seeking the information that reasonable efforts have been made by such party to ensure that the individual who is the subject of the protected health information that has been requested has been given notice of the request; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">(B) [t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance, as described in paragraph (e)(l)(iv) of this section, from the party seeking the information that reasonable efforts have been made by such party to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(l)(v) of this section. [45 CFR 164.512(e)(1)(i) and (ii).][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">A \u201cqualified protective order\u201d is an order of a court or administrative tribunal or a stipulation by the parties that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">(A) [plrohibits the parties from using or disclosing the protected health information for any purpose other than the litigation or proceeding for which such information was requested; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">(B) [rlequires the return to the covered entity or destruction of the protected health information (including all copies made) at the end of the litigation or proceeding. [45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Under HIPAA, \u201c[a] standard, requirement, or implementation specification\u201d of HIPAA \u201cthat is <em>contrary </em>to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>provision of State law preempts the provision of State law\u201d unless, among other exceptions, \u201c[t]he provision of State law relates to the privacy of individually identifiable health information and is more stringent than a standard, requirement, or implementation specification adopted under\u201d HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.203 (emphasis added). \u201cContrary\u201d means either that \u201c[a] covered entity would find it impossible to comply with both the State and federal requirements\u201d or that \u201c[t]he provision of State law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\u201d HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.202. \u201cMore stringent,\u201d in this context, means \u201cprovides greater privacy protection for the individual who is the subject of the individually identifiable health information.\u201d 45 CFR 160.202.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We hold that HIPAA does not preempt Michigan law permitting ex parte interviews because Michigan law is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to HIPAA under either definition of that term. Michigan law is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to HIPAA under the first definition because it is possible for a covered entity to comply with both Michigan law and HIPAA. As the parties acknowledge, HIPAA contains no express mention of ex parte interviews. Thus, the New York Court of Appeals has concluded that New York law permitting ex parte interviews and HIPAA could coexist because HIPAA \u201cmerely superimposed procedural requirements\u201d onto state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">In addition, HHS has pointedly advised that where \u201cthere is a State provision and no comparable or analogous federal provision, or the converse is the case,\u201d there is no possibility of preemption because in the absence of anything to compare \u201cthere cannot be ... a \u2018contrary\u2019 requirement\u201d and so \u201cthe stand-alone requirement \u2014 be it State or federal \u2014 is effective\u201d (64 Fed Reg 59918, 59995). As a result, there can be no conflict between New York law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>HIPAA on the subject of ex parte interviews of treating physicians because HIPAA does not address this subject. <em>Accordingly, the Privacy Rule does not prevent this informal discovery from going forward, it merely superimposes procedural prerequisites. </em>As a practical matter, this means that the attorney who wishes to contact an adverse party\u2019s treating physician must first obtain a valid HIPAA authorization or a court or administrative order; or must issue a subpoena, discovery request or other lawful process with satisfactory assurances relating to either notification or a qualified protective order. <em>[Arons v Jutkowitz, </em>9 NY3d 393, 415; 880 NE2d 831; 850 NYS2d 345 (2007) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We agree with the <em>Arons </em>court\u2019s analysis. Ex parte interviews are permitted under Michigan law, and nothing in HIPAA specifically precludes them. Because it is possible for defense counsel to insure that any disclosure of protected health information by the covered entity complies with 45 CFR 164.512(e) by making \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to obtain a qualified protective order, HIPAA does not preempt Michigan law concerning ex parte interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Plaintiff raises several arguments in support of her position that 45 CFR 164.512(e) does not permit ex parte interviews. First, she claims that HIPAA does not authorize informal discovery and that its provision for disclosure of protected health information pursuant to a qualified protective order applies only when a party seeks protected health information in the context of formal discovery. We disagree. Under 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii), a covered entity is permitted to \u201cdisclose protected health information in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">(ii) [i]n response to a <em>subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process </em>that is not accompanied by an order of a court or administrative tribunal, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>(A) [t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance, as described in paragraph (e)(l)(iii) of this section, from the party seeking the information that reasonable efforts have been made by such party to ensure that the individual who is the subject of the protected health information that has been requested has been given notice of the request; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">(B) [t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance, as described in paragraph (e)(1) (iv) of this section, from the party seeking the information that reasonable efforts have been made by such party to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(l)(v) of this section. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">As previously discussed, ex parte interviews are permitted under Michigan law as a means of informal discovery. Thus, even if \u201cdiscovery request\u201d contemplates formal discovery, a request for an ex parte interview is at least \u201cother lawful process\u201d within the meaning of 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii). Therefore, as long as \u201c[t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance ... that reasonable efforts have been made ... to secure a qualified protective order\u201d that meets the requirements of subsection (e)(l)(v), disclosure of protected health information by a covered entity during an ex parte interview is consistent with both Michigan law and HIPAA. The HIPAA regulations were \u201cnot intended to disrupt current practice whereby an individual who is a party to a proceeding and has put his or her medical condition at issue will not prevail without consenting to the production of his or her protected health information.\u201d 65 Fed Reg 82462-01, 82530 (December 28, 2000), discussing 45 CFR 164.512(e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Plaintiff and the dissent also argue that an ex parte interview is not a proper subject of a qualified protective order because 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v)(B) requires the \u201creturn to the covered entity or destruction of the protected health information (including all copies made) at the end of the litigation or proceeding.\u201d Plaintiff argues that this provision thus contemplates that only \u201cdocumentary\u201d evidence will be the subject of a qualified protective order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. The distinction plaintiff makes between \u201cdocumentary\u201d information and other types of information is not one that exists in HIPAA. As previously discussed, \u201chealth information\u201d explicitly includes \u201coral information,\u201d and all individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium is \u201cprotected health information\u201d under HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.103. We see no logical reason that \u201cprotected health information\u201d maintained in a physician\u2019s records and conveyed verbally by a physician during an ex parte interview cannot be the subject of a qualified protective order under 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v). The requirement in subsection (e)(l)(v)(B) to return or destroy \u201cprotected health information\u201d applies to <em>all </em>protected health information, as the term is defined under HIPAA and its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Moreover, plaintiffs argument proceeds from the assumption that an ex parte interview never generates a physical record. This is simply incorrect. For instance, if the ex parte interview is conducted orally, a recording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>of the conversation could be produced. Alternatively, defense counsel and a physician might choose to conduct an ex parte interview via e-mail. And written documents may be exchanged at an ex parte interview. All of these records could be \u201creturned\u201d or \u201cdestroyed,\u201d thus making the requirement of 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v)(B) applicable, and defeating the argument that a qualified protective order cannot be fashioned for an ex parte interview under the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Plaintiff also argues that 45 CFR 164.512(e) does not allow ex parte interviews because defense counsel does not particularize the specific health information being sought in the interview, and that ex parte interviews lack adequate protections and limitations on the scope of disclosure. She argues that 45 CFR 164.512(e) \u201cpresumes that the parties are aware of the [protected health information] that has been requested before entry of a qualified protective order.\u201d (Plaintiffs Reply Brief, pp 1-2.) She relies on the following language from 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v): \u201c \u2018For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a qualified protective order means, with respect to protected health information requested under paragraph (e)(l)(ii) of this section, an order of the court....\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added by plaintiff.) 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1)(h), however, makes no reference to a request for <em>specific </em>health information. It simply provides that a covered entity may disclose protected health information \u201c[i]n response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process\u201d if the other requirements of the section are met. This is in contrast to 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(i), which permits disclosure in response to a court order. <em>\u201cprovided that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>the covered entity discloses only the protected health information expressly authorized by such order[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that Michigan\u2019s approach to informal discovery, which permits defense counsel to seek an ex parte interview with a plaintiffs treating physician, is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to HIPAA. An ex parte interview may be conducted and a covered entity may disclose protected health information during the interview in a manner that is consistent with HIPAA, as long as \u201c[t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance . . . that reasonable efforts have been made ... to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of [45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v)].\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii)(B).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Nor does Michigan law concerning ex parte interviews \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\u201d HIPAA \u2014 the second definition of \u201ccontrary\u201d under 45 CFR 160.202. Plaintiff claims that allowing ex parte interviews frustrates HIPAA\u2019s purpose of protecting the privacy of an individual\u2019s health information. While HIPAA is obviously concerned with protecting the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information, it does not enforce that goal to the exclusion of all other interests. Rather, it balances the protection of individual privacy with the need for disclosure in some situations. Thus, a covered entity may disclose pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tected health information: (1) to \u201c[a] public health authority that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability,\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(b)(i); (2) to an employer, if \u201c[t]he covered entity is a covered health care provider who is a member of the workforce of such employer or who provides health care to the individual at the request of the employer\u201d in order \u201c[t]o evaluate whether the individual has a work-related illness or injury,\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(b)(v)(A)(2); (3) \u201cto a health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law, including audits; civil, administrative, or criminal investigations; inspections; licensure or disciplinary actions; civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions,\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(d)(1); and (4) \u201cto authorized federal officials for the conduct of lawful intelligence, counter-intelligence, and other national security activities authorized by the National Security Act,\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(k)(2). Given HIPAA\u2019s interest in balancing the need for disclosure in certain contexts with the importance of individual privacy, we cannot conclude that ex parte interviews are \u201ccontrary\u201d to the objectives of HIPAA, as long as the interviews are sought according to the specific requirements of 45 CFR 164.512(e). Because we conclude that HIPAA does not preempt state law, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Finally, we emphasize that while we have been asked in this case to decide whether HIPAA permits defense counsel to seek an ex parte interview with a plaintiffs treating physician, 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1) is directed at covered entities, not parties or trial courts. HIPAA does not require a trial court to grant a motion for a protective order. Therefore, a trial court retains its discretion under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>MCR 2.302(C)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to issue protective orders and to impose conditions on ex parte interviews.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Similarly, 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1) addresses the circumstances under which a covered entity <em>may </em>disclose protected health information. Nothing in that provision, or in Michigan law, <em>requires </em>a covered entity to consent to an ex parte interview or to disclose protected health information during such an interview. See <em>Domako, </em>438 Mich at 362 (\u201c[TJhere is nothing in the court rules precluding an interview if the physician chooses to cooperate.\u201d). As one commenter pointed out, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>breadth of HIPAA and the substantial repercussions for HIPAA violations undoubtedly will cause healthcare providers to think twice before agreeing to ex parte interviews, even if defense counsel has a strong argument that HIPAA should not apply.\u201d Comment, <em>Don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell: HIPAA\u2019s effect on informal discovery in products liability and personal injury cases, </em>2006 BYU L Rev 1075, 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Under Michigan law, nothing precludes defense counsel from seeking an ex parte interview with a plaintiffs treating physician once the plaintiff has waived the physician-patient privilege. Michigan law is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to HIPAA within the first definition of that term under 45 CFR 160.202 because, under HIPAA, a covered entity may disclose protected health information during an ex parte interview if \u201c[t]he covered entity receives satisfactory assurance... that reasonable efforts have been made... to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of [45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v)].\u201d 45 CFR 164.512(e) (1) (ii) (B); see also 45 CFR 160.202. Nor does Michigan law concerning ex parte interviews \u201cstand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\u201d HIPAA \u2014 the second meaning of \u201ccontrary\u201d under 45 CFR 160.202 \u2014 given the balance HIPAA strikes between the protection of individual privacy and the necessity of disclosure in some contexts. Thus, HIPAA does not preempt Michigan law concerning ex parte interviews. Nothing in either HIPAA or Michigan law, however, <em>requires </em>a covered entity to agree to an informal ex parte interview with defense counsel, or to disclose protected health information during such an interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s request for a qualified protective order on the grounds that HIPAA precludes ex parte interviews. The result reached by the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and this case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-4\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal agency charged with administering HIPAA, has provided the following gloss on its role under HIPAA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, was enacted on August 21, 1996.

The majority holds that an ex parte interview can be conducted under MCR 2.302(C) in a manner that is consistent with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided that reasonable efforts have been made to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1)(v) as set forth in 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii)(B). I must respectfully dissent from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">First, ex parte interviews are generally conducted orally. The introductory portion of 45 CFR 164.512 specifically limits <em>oral </em>disclosures of a covered entity\u2019s information to instances \u201c[w]hen the covered entity is <em>required by this section </em>to inform the individual of, <em>or when the individual may agree to, </em>a use or disclosure permitted by this section ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because an ex parte interview is not required and cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>be compelled by this section or under Michigan law, nor is there a requirement within 45 CFR 164.512(e) that a patient be informed of an ex parte interview in a judicial proceeding, and plaintiff has not agreed to the ex parte interview in this instance, the provisions of 45 CFR 164.512(e) relied on by the majority cannot be construed as authorizing an ex parte interview that involves the oral disclosure of health information.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Second, I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Michigan law authorizing ex parte interviews is valid and enforceable after the adoption of HIPAA. First, the physician-patient waiver provisions of both MCL 600.2157 and MCL 600.2912f are preempted by HIPAA, because they are contrary to and not more stringent than HIPAA. Second, the majority errs in its reliance on <em>Domako v Rowe, </em>438 Mich 347; 475 NW2d 30 (1991), to support ex parte interviews. While <em>Domako </em>was a thoughtful and well reasoned opinion at the time, it relies on MCL 600.2157 and provisions of the Michigan Court Rules that embody that statute. That statute is now preempted by HIPAA. I conclude that ex parte interviews are not allowed in Michigan because HIPAA does not specifically authorize ex parte interviews, and the court rules and statutes relied on to authorize the interviews have been preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Finally, even assuming that an ex parte interview was a permitted oral disclosure under 45 CFR 164.512(e), the majority opines that a party is <em>only </em>required to make <em>reasonable efforts </em>to obtain a qualified protective order rather than <em>actually </em>having to obtain a court order. In so holding, the majority fails to recognize that 45 CFR 164.512(e) applies to judicial and administrative proceedings, and that provisions of this subsection are only applicable if there is a corresponding judicial or administrative procedure available under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>state law or court rule. This medical malpractice action is being pursued in a circuit court, rather than in an administrative proceeding, and as such is subject to our court rules. Under our court rules, there is no mechanism for a party to only make a <em>reasonable effort </em>to obtain a court order. Under the Michigan Court Rules, a party must make a request for an order by motion, and the request is either granted or denied. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, only a reasonable effort to secure the order is required, which can only mean that the request could be incompletely made or denied altogether and an ex parte interview could still take place. The majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion are completely at odds with our court rules and undermine the authority of trial courts to enforce the court rules and their own orders. Thus, the majority errs by relying on an inapplicable HIPAA provision to support its analysis, and I cannot agree with such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I. HIPAA</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">HIPAA was enacted in 1996 to provide a minimum national standard for the protection of private health information. HIPAA was intended to be a shield to protect private medical information from disclosure to third parties. HIPAA is a complex and comprehensive regulatory scheme. This overview is only intended to provide the necessary background to address those HIPAA regulations that deal with judicial proceedings and ex parte communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">HIPAA provides an all-encompassing umbrella that protects the confidentiality of patient health information. HIPAA regulations specify that a <em>covered entity </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>may not use or disclose </em>protected health information, <em>except as permitted or required under the act. </em>45 CFR 164.502(a). Under its broad definitions, a <em>covered entity </em>includes a health plan, a health care clearinghouse, or a health care provider who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a covered transaction. 45 CFR 160.103. <em>Health Information </em>includes both oral information as well as information that is recorded in any form or medium that is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse. <em>Id. Individually identifiable health information </em>includes any information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, or the past, present, or future provision of or payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and either identifies the individual, or provides a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual. <em>Id. </em>In sum, HIPAA\u2019s umbrella covers any health information, oral or recorded, that is individually identifiable and transmitted or maintained by a covered entity in any form or medium <em>unless a specific requirement or exception is found in the act </em>that provides for release of the protected information.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Finally, any HIPAA standard or requirement that is <em>contrary </em>to state law <em>preempts </em>state law, unless the state law is <em>more stringent </em>than HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.203. <em>Contrary </em>means either that a covered entity would find it impossible to comply with both the state and federal requirements or that the provision of state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.202. <em>More stringent </em>means that the state law provides greater privacy protection than HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.202.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>II. HIPAA AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">HIPAA contains narrowly tailored exceptions for disclosures of protected health information during judicial or administrative proceedings. See 45 CFR 164.512(e). While HIPAA carves out certain areas of the law, such as worker\u2019s compensation, for individualized treatment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> HIPAA does not contain a separate section applicable only to medical malpractice claims. Nor does HIPAA impose more or less protection of health information for persons bringing medical malpractice claims, and thus medical malpractice claims are bound by the terms and conditions of 45 CFR 164.512(e) governing judicial proceedings. In judicial proceedings, absent a validly executed HIPAA compliant authorization as mandated by 45 CFR 164.508, a covered entity may only disclose health information according to the specific terms and conditions set forth in 45 CFR 164.512(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">HIPAA does not address or mention ex parte interviews. The majority opines that because ex parte interviews are not mentioned in HIPAA, they are not contrary to HIPAA, and are thus authorized. I believe this analysis and conclusion are in error. HIPAA only allows for the release of information pursuant to a specifically enumerated requirement or exception. 45 CFR 164.502(a). If no requirement or exception exists, disclosure is not allowed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The majority also suggests that HIPAA draws no distinction between when a covered entity\u2019s information needs to be disclosed in documentary form and when the disclosure can be made orally. To the contrary, 45 CFR 164.512 does make this distinction. While the majority relies on 45 CFR 164.512 to authorize <em>oral </em>ex parte interviews, they fail to address its introductory portion, which specifically limits when a covered entity may disclose protected health information <em>orally:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">A covered entity may use or disclose protected health information without the written authorization of the individual, as described in \u00a7 164.508, or the opportunity for the individual to agree or object as described in \u00a7 164.510, in the situations covered by this section, subject to the applicable requirements of this section. <em>When the covered entity is required by this section to inform the individual of or when the individual may agree to, a use or disclosure permitted by this section, the covered entity\u2019s information and the individual\u2019s agreement may be given orally. </em>[45 CFR 164.512 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">As this plain language indicates, oral disclosures are allowed, but are limited to \u201c[w]hen the covered entity is <em>required by this section to inform </em>the individual of, or <em>when the individual may agree to, </em>a use or disclosure permitted by this section, <em>the covered entity\u2019s information </em>and the individual\u2019s agreement <em>may be given orally.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). This introductory language contains <em>limited </em>circumstances wherein oral disclosures of information are permitted. If the circumstance is not provided for by that language, oral disclosure of information is not allowed. I respectfully suggest that the majority errs in its analysis, because neither of the specific circumstances applicable to use or disclosure of the covered entity\u2019s information is present in this instance. Ex parte interviews can not be required by this section or Michigan law, nor is there a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>requirement within 45 CFR 164.512(e) that a patient be informed of an ex parte interview in a judicial proceeding. Additionally, the ex parte interview was not agreed to in this instance. Accordingly, the two subsections of 45 CFR 164.512(e) relied on by the majority cannot be construed as authorizing ex parte interviews, because the very terms of the introductory language of that section does not allow for oral disclosures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">However, even if the introductory language limiting oral disclosures didn\u2019t exist, the majority\u2019s reliance on 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii)(B)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would be troubling. Subsection 164.512(e)(l)(ii)(B) permits disclosure \u201c[i]n response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process, <em>that is not accompanied by an order of a court </em>or administrative tribunal, <em>if\u201d:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">The covered entity receives satisfactory assurance, as described in paragraph (e)(l)(iv) of this section, from the party seeking the information that reasonable efforts have been made by such party to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(l)(v) of this section. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">This subsection, by its very terms, contemplates the use of state law procedures that occur <em>without the need for a court order. </em>Consistent with the mandates of this subsection the majority opines that a party is only required to make <em>reasonable efforts </em>to obtain a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v) rather than <em>actually </em>having to obtain a court order. In so holding, the majority fails to recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>that subsection 164.512(e) applies to judicial and administrative proceedings, and that its provisions are only applicable if there is a corresponding judicial or administrative procedure available under state law or court rule. This medical malpractice action is being pursued in a circuit court rather than in an administrative proceeding, and as such is subject to our Michigan Court Rules. Under our court rules, there is no mechanism for a party to <em>only </em>make a <em>reasonable effort </em>to obtain a court order. MCR 2.119(A)(1) requires a request for an order to be made by motion, and the motion is either granted or denied. Query, what does the majority contemplate when it proposes that only a reasonable effort need be made to obtain an order in a circuit court? The majority\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d analysis can only mean that a request could be incompletely made, or denied by the trial court altogether, and an interview could still take place. Either of these results would be absurd. This analysis and conclusion are completely at odds with our court rules and completely undermine the authority of trial courts to enforce the court rules, or even their own orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">I think it is clear that the majority errs by relying on an inapplicable HIPAA provision to support its analysis, and I cannot agree with such an interpretation. When interpreting \u00a7 164.512, it must be understood that this subsection of provision of HIPAA regulation applies not only to courts, but also to every federal agency, including those that administer Medicare, Medicaid, veterans\u2019 benefits, and Social Security, to name a few. Most of these federal agencies do not have ready access to circuit court judges who can issue or deny orders. Using a provision that is obviously designed for an administrative proceeding in a judicial proceeding leads to an absurd result. \u201c[Sjtatutes must be construed to prevent absurd results. . . .\u201d <em>Rafferty v Markovitz, </em>461 Mich 265, 270; 602 NW2d 367 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The majority\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 164.512(e)(l)(v) is equally troubling. Again, even if the prefatoiy section limiting oral disclosures did not exist, the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 164.512(e)(l)(v) may be used because it permits disclosure pursuant to a <em>qualified protective order </em>issued by a court or administrative tribunal or a stipulation by the parties is similarly erroneous. This provision <em>\u201c[rjequires the return to the covered entity or destruction of the protected health information (including all copies made) at the end of the litigation or proceeding.\u201d 45 </em>CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v)(B) (emphasis added). A verbal ex parte interview cannot be returned or destroyed at the conclusion of the litigation. The fact that an interview <em>could be </em>recorded or memorialized, thus creating something that could be returned or destroyed, does not resolve the analytical problem as the majority suggests. HIPAA\u2019s return-or-destroy provision is <em>mandatory </em>and <em>not permissive, </em>and we are not free to rewrite HIPAA\u2019s mandates; we are required to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Further, to support its analysis, the majority borrows the phrase <em>oral information </em>from the broad definition of what is covered by HIPAA and uses it to expand this narrowly tailored exception to justify its interpretation. I must respectfully disagree with this premise and the methodology used to come to the conclusion.. What is protected by HIPAA is not the same as what is excepted. What is protected by HIPAA is vast; the exceptions are specific and narrowly tailored. Disclosure is only allowed if <em>permitted or required under the act, 45 </em>CFR 164.502(a), and, again, we are not free to rewrite HIPAA\u2019s mandates; we are required to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">III. MICHIGAN STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">It is also necessary to review Michigan law to determine whether ex parte interviews are allowable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>any statute or court rule in a manner that is consistent with HIPAA\u2019s provisions which allow for <em>oral </em>disclosures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This inquiry begins with a review of applicable Michigan medical malpractice statutes to determine if the statutes are enforceable or if they are preempted by HIPAA. State law is preempted by HIPAA if the state law is contrary to HIPAA, meaning that a covered entity would find it impossible to simultaneously comply with the federal and state law and the state law is not more stringent than HIPAA. 45 CFR 160.202.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Two statutory provisions, MCL 600.2157 and MCL 600.2912f, provide for the waiver of privilege in the context of medical malpractice actions. The relevant language of MCL 600.2157 is contained in its second sentence, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\"><em>If the patient brings an action against any defendant to recover for any personal injuries, or for any malpractice, and the patient produces a physician as a witness </em>in the patient\u2019s own behalf who has treated the patient for the injury or for any disease or condition for which the malpractice is alleged, <em>the patient shall be considered to have waived the privilege provided in this section </em>as to another physician who has treated the patient for the injuries, disease, or condition. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The unambiguous language of this provision clearly indicates that the physician-patient privilege is waived by virtue of two triggering events: (1) <em>filing </em>a lawsuit for personal injury or malpractice, and (2) <em>producing a physician as a witness </em>in the patient\u2019s own behalf. Once those two triggering events occur, nothing more is required by the statute and the privilege is waived. The statute does not require compliance with HIPAA to release or compel production of the health information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Rather, by virtue of the two triggering events alone, waiver occurs and the information may be released or compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Under HIPAA, all health care information is protected by its umbrella <em>unless </em>it is specifically exempted. Release of information in judicial proceedings under HIPAA is controlled by 45 CFR 164.512(e). However, the exceptions contained within this section are specific and narrowly tailored. Significantly, none of the specific and narrowly tailored exceptions within \u00a7 164.512(e) allows for release of information by virtue of the mere occurrence of the two triggering events named in MCL 600.2157, filing and production of a witness. Thus, the second sentence of MCL 600.2157 is <em>contrary </em>to HIPAA because <em>contrary </em>means that a covered entity would find it impossible to comply with both the Michigan and HIPAA requirements, or that the provision of Michigan law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and full purposes and objectives of HIPAA. A covered entity cannot simultaneously comply with the second sentence of \u00a7 2157 and HIPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Moreover, the second sentence of \u00a7 2157 is clearly <em>not more stringent </em>in its requirements than HIPAA because <em>more stringent </em>means that the state law provides greater privacy protection for the individual who is the subject of the individually identifiable health information. 45 CFR 160.202. The second sentence of \u00a7 2157 simply does not provide a patient with greater privacy protection; to the contrary, it provides less. Accordingly, by the very terms and conditions set forth in HIPAA, the second sentence of \u00a7 2157, which provides for waiver, is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">MCL 600.2912f must also be reviewed to determine whether any of its provisions are also preempted by HIPAA. I conclude that \u00a7 2912f is preempted <em>in its </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>entirety </em>because it too is contrary to and not more stringent than HIPAA. MCL 600.2912f provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">(1) <em>A person who has given notice under [MCL 600.2912b] </em>or who has commenced an action alleging medical malpractice <em>waives for purposes of that claim or action the privilege created by [MCL 600.2157] and any other similar privilege created by law </em>with respect to a person or entity who was involved in the acts, transactions, events, or occurrences that are the basis for the claim or action or who provided care or treatment to the claimant or plaintiff in the claim or action for that condition or a condition related to the claim or action either before or after those acts, transactions, events, or occurrences, whether or not the person is a party to the claim or action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">(2) Pursuant to subsection (1), <em>a person or entity who has received notice under [MCL 600.2912b] or who has been named as a defendant </em>in an action alleging medical malpractice or that person\u2019s or entity\u2019s attorney or authorized representative <em>may communicate with a person specified in [MCL 600.5838a] in order to obtain all information relevant to the subject matter of the claim </em>or action and to prepare the person\u2019s or entity\u2019s defense to the claim or action. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">This statute provides that the physician-patient privilege is waived once a notice of intent (NOI) is provided pursuant to MCL 600.2912b. Section 2912f, once again, does not require that release of protected health care information be contingent upon compliance with HIPAA by such means as providing the covered entity with a HIPAA compliant authorization or a court order compelling production. Waiver is triggered in this instance by the mere act of sending or receiving an NOI. Nothing more is required. Subsection 164.512(e), which covers disclosure during judicial and administrative proceedings, does not have an exception for disclosure by virtue of an NOI being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>provided to a defendant in and of itself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> HIPAA provides narrowly tailored methods of release, none of which are similarly required by \u00a7 2912f. As HIPAA contains no exception by virtue of providing an NOI, this entire statute is contrary to HIPAA because a covered entity would find it impossible to comply with both the Michigan and HIPAA requirements, and this statute would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and full purposes and objectives of HIPAA. A covered entity cannot comply with the second sentence of \u00a7 2912f and HIPAA, and \u00a7 2912f is clearly not more stringent in its requirements than HIPAA. Section 2912f does not provide greater privacy protection for the individual who is the subject of the individually identifiable health information; to the contrary, it provides less.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">This interpretation of \u00a7 2157 and \u00a7 2912f recognizes that HIPAA protects <em>all </em>health care information in any form and that <em>if and only if </em>there is a specifically enumerated exception in HIPAA are its provisions waived. HIPAA contains no provision that permits waiver of privilege by the mere act of <em>filing </em>a medical malpractice action or sending an NOI, and we are not free to write such an exception into the federal act. If HIPAA did contain such an exception, all one would need to do is give a copy of the complaint or an NOI to a covered entity and ask that it release the requested information. Obviously, no one contemplates this as the procedure; however, that is precisely all these two statutes require. Accordingly, I conclude that the second sentence of \u00a7 2157 and all of \u00a7 2912f are preempted by HIPAA and are not enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\"><em>TV. DOMAKO </em>AND THE MICHIGAN COURT RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Finally, it is also necessary to review <em>Domako </em>and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>court rules to determine whether ex parte interviews can be conducted consistently with HIPAA\u2019s provisions which allow for <em>oral </em>disclosures. In <em>Domako, </em>this Court reviewed both \u00a7 2157 and our court rules to determine whether ex parte interviews were permissible. <em>Domako </em>found equally compelling support for allowing ex parte interviews in both sources. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">The statute provides protection for information relayed by the patient to the physician, and it also provides for a waiver of the privilege when the plaintiff \u201cproduce [s] any physician as a witness in his own behalf\u201d in a malpractice action. <em>Similarly, the Michigan Court Rules offer protection for medical information-.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cWhen a mental or physical condition of a party is in controversy, medical information about the condition is subject to discovery under MCR 2.310 to the extent that... the party does not assert that the information is subject to a valid privilege.\u201d [MCR 2.314(A)(1)(b).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\"><em>Just as in the privilege statute, the court rules provide for the waiver of the physician-patient privilege. </em>MCR 2.314(B)(1) clarifies the procedure by which the patient waives the privilege: \u201cThe privilege must be asserted in the party\u2019s written response under MCR 2.310. A privilege not timely asserted is waived in that action....\u201d The Staff Comment declares that this section requires a party to decide at the discovery stage whether to assert the privilege. <em>Unlike other forms of litigation, a case involving medical malpractice cannot proceed without evidence of the physical or mental condition of the plaintiff. Therefore, requiring the plaintiff to decide whether to assert the privilege at the discovery stage, rather than at trial, promotes efficient use of judicial resources by fostering an early resolution of this issue.[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">As previously indicated, \u00a7 2157 has been preempted by HIPAA, and that portion of the <em>Domako </em>analysis is no longer valid. Accordingly, the only remaining question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>whether Domako\u2019s court rule analysis has continuing validity, and I conclude that it does not, despite the fact that <em>Domako </em>was a thoughtful and well reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>Domako </em>reasoned that ex parte interviews were permissible under our court rules because <em>\u201c(j]ust as in the privilege statute, the court rules provide for the waiver of the physician-patient privilege ... [a]privilege not timely asserted is waived in that </em>action....\u201d <em>Domako, </em>438 Mich at 354 (emphasis added). This analysis is fundamentally premised on the concept that inaction waives the privilege. However, privileges cannot be waived by virtue of inaction under HIPAA; rather, there must be a requirement or an exception for disclosure of protected health information. As ex parte interviews are not required and cannot be compelled, and no exception allows for them, they cannot be used in Michigan, and the <em>Domako </em>analysis cannot be sustained under the current mandates of HIPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Further, the majority\u2019s reliance on and analysis of MCR 2.302(C) is flawed. While <em>Domako </em>suggested that MCR 2.302(C) could be used to impose restrictions on ex parte interviews after the waiver of privilege, the majority here suggests that MCR 2.302(C) could be used to authorize the interviews. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the rule authorizes ex parte interviews. MCR 2.302(C) contains no language authorizing ex parte interviews, and the majority fails to explain how this rule could be so interpreted given the content of the rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Finally, my analysis should not be read to suggest or imply that a plaintiff may frustrate legitimate discovery, or engage in the gamesmanship that <em>Domako </em>wisely sought to curtail. However, these concerns are effectively addressed in MCR 2.314(B)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">Unless the court orders otherwise, if a party asserts that the medical information is subject to a privilege and the assertion has the effect of preventing discovery of medical information otherwise discoverable under MCR 2.302(B), the party may not thereafter present or introduce any physical, documentary, or testimonial evidence relating to the party\u2019s medical history or mental of physical condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">While requiring a defendant to conduct discovery by means of a deposition, rather than by an ex parte interview, could not be considered \u201cpreventing discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ery of medical information,\u201d if a plaintiff does assert the privilege during a deposition and thus prevents discovery of medical information, he or she will be precluded from offering testimony at trial relating to his or her medical history or mental or physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority that an ex parte interview can be conducted under MCR 2.302(C) in a manner that is consistent with HIPAA, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to secure a qualified protective order that meets the requirements of 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(v) as set forth in 45 CFR 164.512(e)(l)(ii)(B). Ex parte interviews involve <em>oral </em>disclosures of a covered entity\u2019s information. The introductory portion of 45 CFR 164.512 specifically limits <em>oral </em>disclosures of a covered entity\u2019s information to instances \u201c[wjhen the covered entity is <em>required by this section </em>to inform the individual of, <em>or when the individual may agree to, </em>a use or disclosure permitted by this section. . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because an ex parte interview is not required by either this section or Michigan law, nor is there a requirement within 45 CFR 164.512(e) that a patient be informed of an ex parte interview in a judicial proceeding, and plaintiff has not agreed to an ex parte interview in this instance, the subsections of 45 CFR 164.512(e) relied on by the majority cannot be construed as authorizing an ex parte interview that involves the oral disclosure of health information.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Michigan law authorizing ex parte interviews is valid and enforceable after the adoption of HIPAA. First, the physician-patient waiver provisions of MCL 600.2157 and MCL 600.2912f are preempted by HIPAA, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>they are contrary to, and not more stringent than, HIPAA. Second, the majority errs in its reliance on <em>Domako </em>to support ex parte interviews, because <em>Domako </em>was based on Michigan law that has since been preempted by HIPAA. I conclude that ex parte interviews are not allowed in Michigan because HIPAA does not specifically authorize ex parte interviews, and Michigan law authorizing such interviews has been preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Finally, by holding that a party is only required to make <em>reasonable efforts </em>to obtain a qualified protective order rather than <em>actually </em>having to obtain a court order, the majority fails to recognize that the Michigan Court Rules contain no mechanism for a party to only make a <em>reasonable effort </em>to obtain a court order. Requiring only a reasonable effort to secure the order can only mean that the request could be incompletely made, or denied altogether, and an ex parte interview could still take place. The majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion are completely at odds with our court rules and undermine the authority of trial courts to enforce the court rules and their own orders, and I cannot agree with such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Accordingly, I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> 42 USC 1320d <em>et seq. </em>References to \u201cHIPAA\u201d may include the regulations promulgated under that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> Compare and contrast HIPAA\u2019s treatment of workers\u2019 compensation claims, which provides for a more expansive method of disclosure than is allowed in the general category for judicial proceedings.
