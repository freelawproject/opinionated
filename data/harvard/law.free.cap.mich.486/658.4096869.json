We respectfully disagree. MCL 750.145c has a graduated scheme of offenses and punishments. It punishes (1) those who are responsible for the <em>origination </em>of child sexually abusive material (a 20-year felony), (2) those who are responsible for the distribution and promotion of the prohibited material (a 7-year felony), and (3) those who are responsible for the knowing possession of the prohibited material (a 4-year felony). From these three tiers of offenses and punishments, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend the imposition of the same maximum punishment on a person who downloads a prohibited image from the Internet and burns it to a CD-R for personal use as on the person who is responsible in the first instance for the creation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>existence of the pornographic images of minors. The person who is responsible for bringing the prohibited images into existence is obviously more morally, and under the statute, more criminally, culpable than the person who downloads an image and saves it to another medium for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We hold that when the terms \u201cproduces\u201d and \u201cmakes\u201d in MCL 750.145c(2) are construed in accordance with their immediately surrounding text and with a view toward the statute\u2019s overall organization, including a graduated scheme of offenses and punishments, a defendant may not be convicted of the 20-year felony when there is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a criminal intent to do something other than possess the CD-Rs for his own personal use. Just as a person who downloads a song from the Internet and burns it to a CD-R is not considered to have produced or made a song, so a person who burns a prohibited image to a CD-R for his personal use has not produced or made the image.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">It is clear that the Legislature intended only that defendant could be convicted of the 4-year felony of knowingly possessing child sexually abusive material under MCL 750.145c(4). Those who copy or duplicate <em>existing </em>prohibited images for personal use do not produce or make child sexually abusive material under MCL 750.145c(2); rather, they are only in possession of it. MCL 750.145c(2) is primarily applicable to those who <em>originate </em>child sexually abusive material. Therefore, we reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions under MCL 750.145c(2), and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">As relevant here, defendant was charged with five counts of \u201carranging] for, producing], mak[ing], or financing] \u201d child sexually abusive material, in violation of MCL 750.145c(2), after a search of his two laptop computers and approximately 50 CD-Rs found in his bedroom. After being bound over for trial, defendant moved to quash the information with regard to these charges, arguing that the burning or saving of images or data to a CD-R does not rise to the level of producing or making child sexually abusive material. He further argued that the transfer of images from the Internet to his computer\u2019s hard drive and then to the CD-Rs constituted nothing more than the storage of data. Thus, he contended that he should only be charged with \u201cknowingly possessing] \u201d child sexually abusive material under MCL 750.145c(4) because he had not originated the prohibited images.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The trial court denied this motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">[T]he only question, one of apparent first impression, is whether the act of downloading the image from the internet and \u201cburning\u201d (recording) the image to a CD constitutes the \u201cmaking\u201d or \u201cproduction\u201d of such materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">The dictionary . .. contains several definitions of the word \u201cmake.\u201d Among them are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">To cause to exist, occur, or appear; create; to fit, intend, or destine by, or as if by creating; to bring into being by forming, shaping, or altering material; to put together from components.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">Applying this definition here, the \u201cbottom line\u201d is that, after the requisite, mechanical, and technical functions, some things exist (CD-Rs with these images on them) that did not exist prior to that act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Defendant appealed by leave granted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a published opinion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">The term \u201cmake\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cto bring into existence by shaping, changing, or combining material!.]\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). Defendant acquired child sexually abusive material through the Internet, and he shaped, formed, and combined the material through placement of various selected pictures, videos, and images onto specific CD-Rs, bringing into existence something that had not previously existed, i.e., distinctly created and compiled child-pornography CD-Rs. <em>[People v Hill, </em>269 Mich App 505, 518; 715 NW2d 301 (2006).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The Court of Appeals also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">Regardless of whether defendant\u2019s actions are viewed as copying the original photographs and videos, or copying electronic or computer visual images of the downloaded photographs and videos, the fact remains that copies and reproductions were made. Defendant\u2019s argument that use of the CD-Rs was just a mechanism by which to store possessed child pornography ignores the reality that the storing of the images was accomplished through the copying or duplication of already existing images that continued to exist after the images were burned onto the CD-Rs. The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. The decision by the Legislature to specifically include reproductions or copies in defining \u201cchild sexually abusive material,\u201d which term is then incorporated into [MCL 750.145c(2)], leaves no room for a contrary judicial construction. <em>[Id. </em>at 517.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">We denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, with three justices indicating that they would grant leave to appeal. 477 Mich 897 (2006). We also denied defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, with three justices indicating that they would grant reconsideration and, on reconsideration, would grant leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 477 Mich 1016 (2007). Defendant next unsuccessfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>sought relief in federal court. <em>Hill v People, </em>2007 US Dist LEXIS 47700 (WD Mich, July 2, 2007, Case No 1:07-CV-271), and then proceeded to a bench trial. As relevant to the convictions under review, the evidence demonstrated that defendant had downloaded and copied to CD-Rs five specific images depicting child sexually abusive material.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court found defendant guilty of five counts of violating MCL 750.145c(2), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">The proofs show a repeated pattern of taking an image off the computer and moving it or saving it somewhere else where it did not previously exist. . . . Mr. Hill is guilty of. . . making, producing etc. child sexually abusive materials . . . [that] were created by affirmative action by the user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Defendant appealed in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed his convictions and declined his request to reconsider its earlier published decision holding that the downloading and burning of child sexually abusive material to a CD-R constitutes making or producing child sexually abusive material. <em>People v Hill, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 19, 2009 (Docket No. 281055).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court then granted leave to appeal. 485 Mich 911 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Whether conduct falls within the scope of a penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>statute, in this case MCL 750.145c(2), is a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo. <em>People v Stone, </em>463 Mich 558, 561; 621 NW2d 702 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">III. RULES OF INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">MCL 750.145c is a relatively lengthy statute. Most relevant for present purposes are subsections (2) through (4), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">(2) A person who persuades, induces, entices, coerces, causes, or knowingly allows a child to engage in a child sexually abusive activity for the purpose of producing any child sexually abusive material, or a person, who arranges for, produces, makes, or finances, or a person who attempts or prepares or conspires to arrange for, produce, make, or finance any child sexually abusive activity or child sexually abusive material[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years, or a fine of not more than $100,000.00, or both, if that person knows, has reason to know, or should reasonably be expected to know that the child is a child or that the child sexually abusive material includes a child or that the depiction constituting the child sexually abusive material appears to include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>child, or that person has not taken reasonable precautions to determine the age of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">(3) A person who distributes or promotes, or finances the distribution or promotion of, or receives for the purpose of distributing or promoting, or conspires, attempts, or prepares to distribute, receive, finance, or promote any child sexually abusive material or child sexually abusive activity is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 7 years, or a fine of not more than $50,000.00, or both, if that person knows, has reason to know, or should reasonably be expected to know that the child is a child or that the child sexually abusive material includes a child or that the depiction constituting the child sexually abusive material appears to include a child, or that person has not taken reasonable precautions to determine the age of the child. This subsection does not apply to the persons described in section 7 of 1984 PA 343, MCL 752.367.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">(4) A person who knowingly possesses any child sexually abusive material is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both, if that person knows, has reason to know, or should reasonably be expected to know the child is a child or that the child sexually abusive material includes a child or that the depiction constituting the child sexually abusive material appears to include a child, or that person has not taken reasonable precautions to determine the age of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The issue here is how the terms \u201cproduces\u201d and \u201cmakes\u201d in subsection (2) should be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The rules of statutory construction are well established. As this Court explained in <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 420-422; 662 NW2d 710 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">When construing a statute, the Court\u2019s primary obligation is to ascertain the legislative intent that may be reasonably inferred from the words expressed in the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">The doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>i.e., that \u201ca word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting,\u201d affords us assistance in interpreting [statutes],.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">.. . \u201c[Statutes] exist[] and must be read in context with the entire act, and the words and phrases used there must he assigned such meanings as are in harmony with the whole of the statute .. ..\u201d \u201c[W]ords in a statute should not be construed in the void, but should be read together to harmonize the meaning, giving effect to the act as a whole.\u201d Although a phrase or a statement may mean one thing when read in isolation, it may mean something substantially different when read in context. \u201cIn seeking meaning, words and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which follow.\u201d \u201cIt is a familiar principle of statutory construction that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We are also instructed to give undefined statutory terms their plain and ordinary meaning unless the undefined word or phrase is a term of art.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The Legislature did not specifically define the terms \u201cproduces\u201d or \u201cmakes.\u201d Therefore, it is appropriate to consider dictionary definitions to discern the meanings of these terms. <em>Oakland Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Mich Prop &amp; Cas Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>456 Mich 590, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>From all of this, it is clear that what a court should do in construing a term in a criminal statute for which there are a variety of potential definitions is to determine from among those definitions which the Legislature most reasonably intended by the specific context in which the term is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">iv application</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">This Court first considered MCL 750.145c in <em>People v Tombs, </em>472 Mich 446; 697 NW2d 494 (2005). In <em>Tombs, </em>the defendant turned in a company laptop computer, and more than 500 images of child pornography were found on it in a file location not readily or easily locatable. The defendant was convicted of violating MCL 750.145c(3), promoting or distributing child sexually abusive material. This Court first recognized the longstanding principle that a criminal statute is presumed to include a criminal intent or <em>mens rea </em>absent an express or implied indication that the Legislature wanted to dispense with it. <em>Id. </em>at 456-457 (opinion by KELLY, J.); <em>id. </em>at 466 (Taylor, C.J., concurring).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We then held that the criminal intent to possess child sexually abusive material was not the same as the criminal intent to promote or distribute child sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>abusive material. <em>Id. </em>at 448 (opinion by KELLY, J.). We affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals that reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for distributing or promoting child sexually abusive material, stating: \u201cAlthough defendant intended to distribute the laptop containing child sexually abusive material to his former employer, no evidence suggests that he distributed the material with a criminal intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459-460.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The lead opinion in <em>Tombs </em>examined MCL 750.145c and proceeded to summarize the Court\u2019s position as follows: \u201cThe Legislature expressly separated the crimes of production of child sexually abusive material, distribution or promotion of the material, and simple possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. It further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">Possession is not the same as promotion. The prosecutor blurs the two, asserting that by obtaining the material from the Internet, defendant promoted it. To accept that argument, this Court would have to ignore the express language of the Legislature that created a graduated scheme of offenses and punishments regarding child sexually abusive material. [ZcL][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\"><em>Tombs </em>recognized that MCL 750.145c clearly establishes three tiers in its graduated scheme of both offenses and punishments. Those who are involved in the production of child sexually abusive material are subject to a maximum sentence of 20 years, those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>distribute or promote such material are subject to a maximum sentence of 7 years, and those who knowingly possess such material are subject to a maximum sentence of 4 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">There is an inherent logic to this scheme. The Legislature reasonably concluded that those who distribute or promote child sexually abusive material are more morally and criminally culpable than those who possess such material and that those who create or originate such material are the most morally and criminally culpable. The case at bar requires us to determine whether defendant\u2019s act of downloading and burning child sexually abusive material to CD-Es falls within the top tier or the bottom tier; it is not argued by either party that it falls within the middle tier, and we also do not believe that it does, for what defendant has done does not constitute the promotion or distribution of child sexually abusive material. That is, unlike <em>Tombs, </em>this case does not involve determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct falls within adjacent tiers and whether it is punishable as a 4-year or 7-year felony. Eather, this case involves determining whether defendant\u2019s conduct falls within the <em>lowest </em>or the <em>highest </em>tier and thus whether defendant has committed a 4- or 20-year felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">We keep the graduated scheme of MCL 750.145c and the magnitude of the potential disparity in defendant\u2019s criminal liability in mind as we attempt to discern the most reasonable definitions for \u201cproduces\u201d and \u201cmakes\u201d as used in MCL 750.145c(2). Again, the pertinent language of that subsection is \u201carranges for, produces, makes, or finances\u201d any child sexually abusive material. On the basis of the previously stated principles, we must consider MCL 750.145c <em>as a whole </em>in determining the meaning of \u201cproduces\u201d and \u201cmakes\u201d in this statutory context. Pursuant to the maxim of <em>nosci</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>tur a sociis, </em>these words must be viewed in light of the surrounding terms employed in MCL 750.145c(2), i.e., \u201carranges for\u201d and \u201cfinances,\u201d because the latter supply guidance regarding what the former mean in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\u201cMakes\u201d and \u201cproduces\u201d are used in MCL 750.145c(2) as verbs that may communicate a variety of different concepts. The Court of Appeals adopted the first definition of \u201cmake\u201d in the <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001) \u2014 \u201cto bring into existence by shaping, changing, or combining material[.]\u201d <em>Hill, </em>269 Mich App at 518. But this is only one of many definitions for \u201cmake\u201d in that dictionary. The second and third definitions are as follows: \u201c2. to cause to exist or happen .... 3. to cause to become . . . .\u201d The same dictionary also provides the following relevant definitions of \u201cproduce\u201d: \u201c1. to cause to exist; give rise to ... . 2. to bring into existence .... 7. to bring (a play, movie, opera, etc.) before the public.\u201d We also consider the surrounding words, \u201carranges for\u201d and \u201cfinances.\u201d The dictionary offers the following relevant definitions of \u201carrange\u201d as in \u201carranges for\u201d: \u201c3. to prepare or plan.... 5. to make plans or preparations. . . .\u201d For \u201cfinances,\u201d it offers the following relevant definition: \u201c3. to supply with money or capital. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The definitions of \u201carranges for,\u201d \u201cfinances,\u201d and \u201cproduce\u201d afford obvious insight into how the adjoining term \u201cmake\u201d should be interpreted. When these four words are viewed together, their relatedness or common meaning becomes increasingly apparent \u2014 each constitutes a verb selected by the Legislature to communicate that persons included \"within this subsection are those who are somehow responsible for the creation or origination of child sexually abusive material. Those who arrange for child sexually abusive material are involved at the front end of the process by identifying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>coordinating the participants, equipment, and locations. That is, the arranger has undertaken actions that lead to the actual production of the child sexually abusive material. Those who finance child sexually abusive material provide funding that leads to the same result. The terms \u201carranges for\u201d and \u201cfinances\u201d suggest that the most reasonable understanding of \u201cproduce\u201d is \u201cto bring (a play, movie, opera, etc.) before the public.\u201d In other words, one should envision a producer as a person similar to the producer of a play, movie, or opera who is directly responsible for the creation or origination of a particular production, in this case child sexually abusive material. \u201cProduce\u201d refers to the conduct of those persons but for whom the production (the material) would not exist in the first place, i.e., those who have transformed an idea into a reality. Without those who have arranged for, financed, or produced, there would be no child sexually abusive material at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">This leaves the term \u201cmakes.\u201d Given the related definitions and understandings of \u201carranges,\u201d \u201cproduces,\u201d and \u201cfinances,\u201d we believe that \u201cmakes\u201d should be interpreted in a similar manner as meaning \u201cto cause to exist or happen\u201d or \u201cto cause to become.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That is, \u201cmakes\u201d should be interpreted in the common fashion as referring to someone who is primarily involved in the creation or origination of the child sexually abusive material. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>When the terms \u201cproduces\u201d and \u201cmakes\u201d are understood in this light, it is simply untenable to conclude that downloading an existing image from the Internet and burning it to a CD-R for personal use constitutes producing or making child sexually abusive material under MCL 750.145c(2). While such conduct certainly constitutes proof of knowing possession of such material, it does not constitute sufficient proof of the making or producing of that material. Thus, when we consider the statute, as a whole, especially the maxim of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>in conjunction with the graduated scheme of offenses and punishment, we conclude that MCL 750.145c(2) is primarily concerned with punishing those who are involved in the creation or origination of child sexually abusive material and not those who download and maintain that material for personal use.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The Court of Appeals held that defendant had made child sexually abusive material, in violation of MCL 750.145c(2), because he brought into existence something that had not previously existed. We respectfully disagree with this analysis. While the burned <em>CD-Rs </em>may not have previously existed, this does not mean, in our judgment, that defendant made child sexually abusive material within the scope of MCL 750.145c(2). The fact that defendant placed prohibited images from different websites onto CD-Rs does not by itself rise to the level of making child sexually abusive material within the scheme enacted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, such a reading of the statute can only be reached if one fails to give full consideration to the statute\u2019s graduated scheme of offenses and punishments and if the term \u201cmakes\u201d is read in isolation and without considering the immediately surrounding words. When \u201cmakes\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>given a meaning reasonably compatible with those companion terms, its most reasonable interpretation pertains to the creation or origination of the child sexually abusive material in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">.We believe our conclusion is reinforced by consideration of the manner in which most persons ordinarily think about other types of Internet downloading. It is common today for computer users to legally, and sometimes illegally, download songs, movies, television shows, music videos, and books from the Internet. When such materials are subsequently burned to a CD-R or recordable DVD or some other storage device, as they often are, few would be inclined to characterize that conduct as the making or producing of that song, movie, television show, music video, or book. Such a characterization would, to say the least, be strained and incompatible with the \u201ccommon and approved usage of the language .. ..\u201d MCL 8.3a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The Court of Appeals and the dissents focus on the fact that MCL 750.145c(l)(m) defines \u201cchild sexually abusive material\u201d as \u201cany depiction,\u201d including any \u201creproduction [or] copy,\u201d of a \u201ccomputer-generated image, or picture ... .\u201d Thus, they read the prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>against making or producing child sexually abusive material in conjunction with the fact that a reproduction or copy of a computer-generated image falls within the ambit of prohibited images in concluding that burning a prohibited image to a CD-R constitutes making prohibited material. Again, we respectfully disagree. If an image constitutes child sexually abusive material, this is true -without regard to whether a defendant is someone who arranges for, produces, makes, or finances, or who distributes or promotes, or who only knowingly possesses. In other words, once it is determined that an image constitutes child sexually abusive material, it must then be determined into which of the statute\u2019s three tiers the defendant\u2019s conduct falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The fact that the definition of \u201cchild sexually abusive material\u201d in MCL 750.145c(l)(m) includes copies of computer-generated images does not provide particular insight into what either \u201cmakes\u201d or \u201cproduces\u201d means in MCL 750.145c(2). Rather, the fact that child sexually abusive material includes not just originals but also copies simply communicates that a person may be charged with knowingly possessing a copy of a computer-generated image, or with promoting or distributing a copy of a computer-generated image, or with arranging for, producing, making, or financing a copy of a computer-generated image, in a manner indistinguishable from the person engaged in those same activities in connection with an original image.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Defendant here was convicted of five counts of producing or making child sexually abusive material on the basis of 5 specific images. A review of his 2 laptop computers and 50 CD-Rs revealed 5 copies of one of the images and fewer, or no, duplicates of the other images that sustained his convictions. The fact that 5 copies of a single prohibited image were found after searching 52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>different locations containing approximately 70,000 images is insufficient, in our judgment, in the absence of other evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a criminal intent on defendant\u2019s part to produce or make this material.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since a common definition of \u201cchild sexually abusive material\u201d applies to all three tiers of MCL 750.145c, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend that burning, or copying, images to a CD-R would have any special significance when determining which particular tier had been violated by that burning or copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We are persuaded that the Legislature did not intend to impose the same maximum penalty on a person who downloads a prohibited image from the Internet and burns it to a CD-R for personal use as on the person who is responsible for the creation of the pornographic images of children. The latter is obviously more morally and criminally culpable than the person who downloads an image and saves it to another medium for personal use; at least, this is what the Legislature, in our judgment, has communicated by its enactment of MCL 750.145c. Those who arrange for, produce, make, or finance child sexually abusive material are punished more severely because they are the reason the images exist in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">While the Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of \u201cmakes\u201d has some dictionary support, its analysis was incomplete because it did not consider the statute as a whole and because it did not consider that \u201cmakes\u201d should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>given a meaning compatible with its surrounding words. When properly construed, the terms \u201cproduces\u201d and \u201cmakes\u201d are best understood as addressing those who are involved in the creation or origination of child pornography, and not those who download and burn a CD-R of prohibited images for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">V RESPONSE TO THE DISSENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The dissents obscure the issue before the Court by emphasizing the large quantity of prohibited images found in defendant\u2019s possession. There is no doubt that defendant possessed a very considerable amount of child sexually abusive material. However, the question before this Court is not whether defendant was a committed user of child sexually abusive material \u2014 he was \u2014 or whether he criminally violated MCL 750.145c \u2014 he did \u2014 but whether burning even a single prohibited image to a CD-R constitutes producing or making child sexually abusive material in violation of MCL 750.145c(2).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The dissents fail to adequately consider the statute\u2019s overall organization and graduated scheme of offenses and punishments. As a consequence, the dissents end up blurring, and eventually ignoring altogether, the very distinct criminal definitions and requisite states of mind necessary to obtain a conviction under MCL 750.145c when they interpret \u201cmakes\u201d as encompassing the conduct of a person who burns a prohibited image to a CD-R for the purpose of storing, or making permanent, his possession of that image. Contrary to Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Young\u2019s assertion that the majority \u201cwould prefer that the statute cease\u201d after its most severe violation has been defined, it is the dissenting justices who inappropriately read this language in isolation, ignoring the overall structure and organization of the statute, ignoring the distinct offenses that the statute defines, and ignoring the gradations of punishment that the statute establishes. It is the dissents that distort what is manifest in the statute \u2014 that distinctions are to be made among criminal violators, distinctions predicated on whether the violator has created or originated the material, distributed the material, or merely possessed the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The dissents would compress nearly every criminal violator into the category of \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201coriginator\u201d on the basis of their having made a <em>copy </em>of material created or originated by others. Thus, to the dissenters, there is no distinction, as we believe is manifest in the statute, between a person who downloads and burns child sexually abusive material to a storage device and the person who procures the seven-year-old girl, pays her parents, and then produces a film or image in which she is depicted in sexual poses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, these are distinctions that the Legislature has made, and they are reasonable distinctions. The dissents notwithstanding, we do not \u201crelieve[] ... of criminal responsibility\u201d the computer downloader when we recognize that the Legislature drew <em>distinctions </em>in MCL 750.145c between types of misconduct. No criminal responsibilities are being \u201crelieved\u201d when legislative distinctions are respected and the computer downloader of prohibited material is made subject to a 4-year term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ment and the distributor of the same material is made subject to a 7-year term of imprisonment instead of the 20-year term of imprisonment reserved for the producer of the material, but for whose actions the material would never have existed in the first place. The Legislature is entitled to draw distinctions in its definitions of criminal activity, and this Court is obligated as a general matter to abide by those distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Given that various things can be downloaded from the Internet and burned to other media, the dissents\u2019 strained interpretation of the term \u201cmakes\u201d would have consequences far beyond the instant case. A person can download \u2014 legally or illegally \u2014 songs, books, music videos, television shows, or movies from the Internet and burn them to another medium such as a CD-R or recordable DVD. Yet virtually no one beyond the dissenting justices would consider such a person to have \u201cmade\u201d or \u201cproduced\u201d those songs, books, music videos, television shows, or movies. The legal or illegal down-loader of <em>Star Wars </em>is not the equivalent of George Lucas, the legal or illegal downloader of <em>The Da Vinci Code </em>is not the equivalent of Dan Brown, and the legal or illegal downloader of the <em>Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band </em>album is not the equivalent of John Lennon or Paul McCartney. Even if these downloaders preserve the materials on a CD or DVD, they have not \u201cmade\u201d those movies, \u201cmade\u201d those books, or \u201cmade\u201d that music in the same way as the creators of the materials.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, we are satisfied that a person who burns a prohibited image to a CD-R or recordable DVD for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>personal use is not the equivalent of the person who procured the child, placed the cameras in front of her, and created or originated child sexually abusive material. While both are criminally liable, they are liable under different sections of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Indeed, under the dissents\u2019 interpretations, one might argue that someone who only <em>viewed </em>a prohibited image on a computer screen is guilty of making child pornography, given that computers themselves automatically store viewed images in temporary files. In other words, if Justice YOUNG genuinely believes that burning even a single prohibited image to a CD-R always constitutes making child pornography because it increases \u201cthe net amount of child pornographic images in existence,\u201d it would seem that consistency would require that a defendant who is merely <em>aware </em>of such temporary files would also be guilty of making child sexually abusive material whenever he views those images.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Finally, the dissents also assert that the majority has created \u201cout of whole cloth\u201d an \u201cadditional hurdle\u201d by requiring proof of a defendant\u2019s intent. This is plainly incorrect. There is nothing at all remarkable in a court\u2019s reading a criminal intent into a criminal statute, given that such statutes are generally presumed to include a criminal intent. See <em>Morissette v United States, </em>342 US 246; 72 S Ct 240; 96 L Ed 288 (1952); <em>Staples v United States, </em>511 US 600; 114 S Ct 1793; 128 L Ed 2d 608 (1994); <em>Tombs, </em>472 Mich at 452-456 (opinion by KELLY, J.); <em>id. </em>at 465-468 (TAYLOR, C.J., concurring). Absent any state-of-mind requirement, a wife who transported her husband\u2019s laptop to the police station because she suspected that it contained child sexually abusive material would herself arguably be a possessor and distributor of the material. See <em>Tombs, </em>472 at 458-459 (opinion by KELLY, J.). Similarly in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>case, absent any state-of-mind requirement, a wife who downloaded a child sexually abusive image from her husband\u2019s computer and brought it to the police would herself run the risk of being characterized as a maker of the material under the dissents\u2019 interpretations of MCL 750.145c. Contrary to the dissents, it does not create an \u201cadditional hurdle\u201d to prosecutions, or create a new statute \u201cout of whole cloth,\u201d to require proof of a criminal intent in a criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">A defendant who downloads child sexually abusive material from the Internet and burns the images to a CD-R, when there is no evidence the defendant had a criminal intent to do something other than possess the CD-R for his own personal use, may not be convicted of violating MCL 750.145c(2), which makes it a 20-year felony for any person who \u201carranges for, produces, makes, or finances\u201d \u201cany child sexually abusive material .. . .\u201d Rather, that person is properly convicted of knowing possession of child sexually abusive material in violation of MCL 750.145c(4), a 4-year felony. The three tiers of offenses and punishments in MCL 750.145c compellingly indicate the Legislature did not intend to impose the same maximum penalty on a person who downloads a prohibited image from the Internet and burns it to a CD-R for personal use as on a person who is involved in the creation or origination of child sexually abusive material. Therefore, we reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions under MCL 750.145c(2), and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-7\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\"> CD stands for \u201ccompact disc.\u201d A CD-R (compact disk-recordable) is a blank compact disc that an individual can purchase and onto which pictures, movie or video files, and various other digital images, information, and data can be \u201cburned,\u201d or saved permanently, through the use of a computer.

While those identified in the opening clause definitely are persons who directly deal with the children, those identified in the second clause, the arrangers, producers, makers, and financers, <em>may </em>also on frequent occasion have direct contact with the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> Indeed, we note that before the instant Court of Appeals opinion, all published Michigan caselaw only applied the portion of MCL 750.145c(2) concerning a person who \u201cproduces\u201d or \u201cmakes\u201d child sexually abusive material to those involved in the creation or origination of prohibited images. See, e.g., <em>People v Heim, </em>206 Mich App 439; 522 NW2d 675 (1994) (defendant who photographed his 16-year-old niece), <em>People v Hack, </em>219 Mich App 299; 556 NW2d 187 (1996) (defendant who coerced two children to engage in sexual acts that he videotaped), <em>People v Riggs, </em>237 Mich App 584; 604 NW2d 68 (1999) (defendant who photographed and videotaped four young girls), <em>People v Harmon, </em>248 Mich App 522, 526-528; 640 NW2d 314 (2001) (defendant who photographed two minors engaged in sexual acts), and <em>People v Wilkens, </em>267 Mich App 728; 705 NW2d 728 (2005) (defendant who recorded himself and two minors engaging in sexual acts). Thus, those who originate or create child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>pornography are guilty of violating MCL 750.145c(2), even if they only intend to keep the material for personal use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> In <em>Tombs, </em>we held that the criminal intent to knowingly possess child sexually abusive material was not the same as the criminal intent to promote or distribute child sexually abusive material. <em>Tombs, </em>472 Mich at 448 (opinion by Kelly, J.). Similarly, we hold here that the criminal intent to knowingly possess child sexually abusive material, when the possession is accomplished by burning a CD-R for the purpose of possessing the prohibited images and not for future distribution or promotion, does not establish the criminal intent to produce or make child sexually abusive material. In <em>Tombs, </em>we also held that one who handed a computer containing child pornography to someone else did not distribute child pornography, even though the act of handing a computer to another person would satisfy a dictionary definition of \u201cdistribute.\u201d The Court held that the act of intentionally handing a computer over to another was insufficient by itself to constitute distributing child pornography. Rather, there had to be some criminal intent to distribute, and the defendant in <em>Tombs </em>did not possess that intent. Similarly, defendant here burned CD-Rs, and these acts by themselves did not constitute making or producing child pornography because there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that this was defendant\u2019s intent when he burned the CD-Rs for his personal use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> We further believe the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis produces highly anomalous results. Consider two persons, one of whom downloads and burns child sexually abusive material to a CD-R for his personal possession and one of whom takes that CD-R and attempts to sell it. Under the dissents and the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the downloader has committed a 20-year felony while the seller has committed only a 7-year felony. We do not believe that this is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intentions because the three tiers of MCL 750.145c instead suggest that the distributor is more criminally culpable than the downloader who, in order to obtain possession, has burned the prohibited images to a CD-R. When the Legislature has deemed the maker more culpable than the distributor, we disagree with the dissents\u2019 broad interpretation of \u201cmake,\u201d which we believe casts a far broader net than intended by the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\"> Cf. <em>People v Peterson, </em>63 Mich App 538, 548; 234 NW2d 692 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">[T]he quantity of [marijuana] seeds possessed was so slight that we are constrained to find that reasonable jurors could not infer the intent to deliver from that quantity.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Also critical to interpreting the prohibition against making child pornography is the statutory definition of two relevant terms. \u201cChild sexually abusive activity\u201d is defined as \u201ca child engaging in a listed sexual act,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while \u201cchild sexually abusive material\u201d is statutorily defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\"><em>any depiction, </em>whether made or produced by <em>electronic, </em>mechanical, or other means, including a developed or undeveloped photograph, picture, film, slide, video, <em>electronic visual image, </em>computer diskette, <em>computer or computer-generated image, </em>or picture, or sound recording which is of a child or appears to include a child engaging in a listed sexual act; a book, magazine, <em>computer, computer storage device, </em>or other visual or print or printable medium containing such a photograph, picture, film, slide, video, electronic visual image, computer, or computer-generated image, or picture, or sound recording; or <em>any reproduction, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>copy, or print of such a photograph, picture, film, slide, video, electronic visual image, book, magazine, computer, or computer-generated image, </em>or picture, other visual or print or printable medium, or sound recording.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">I agree with the majority opinion that MCL 750.145c establishes a graduated scheme of offenses and punishments. Broken down into its simplest terms, the statute provides a 20-year maximum sentence for those who make child pornography, a 7-year maximum sentence for those who distribute child pornography, and a 4-year maximum sentence for those who knowingly possess child pornography. It is the most severe sanction \u2014 the 20-year maximum sentence for those who make child pornography \u2014 that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">MCL 750.145c(2) contains two distinct clauses, separated by the conjunction \u201cor.\u201d The first clause covers a person who \u201cpersuades, induces, entices, coerces, causes, or knowingly allows a child to engage in a child sexually abusive activity for the purpose of producing any child sexually abusive material.. . .\u201d This clause penalizes those who cause a child to <em>engage in </em>a sexual act for the purpose of producing child pornography. These are the \u201ccreators\u201d or \u201coriginators\u201d of the child pornography, those whom the majority opinion acknowledges as having <em>\u201cdirect </em>contact with a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">While the majority would prefer that the statute cease at the creators or originators of the child pornography, it does not. The second clause of MCL 750.145c(2) imposes criminal sanctions on a person who \u201carranges for, produces, <em>makes, </em>or finances. .. any child sexually abusive activity or <em>child sexually abusive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>material. . . ,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) The latter portion of the statutory provision pertains to more than the child sexually abusive <em>activity </em>\u2014 significantly, it also relates to the child sexually abusive <em>material. </em>And that is a critical point in any effort to give full meaning to this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">As noted, \u201cchild sexually abusive material\u201d is statutorily defined as <em>any depiction </em>of a child engaged in a sexual act. The statute uses broad language to cover a wide range of image formats, including images produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, photographs, pictures, films, slides, videos, electronic visual images, books, and magazines. It also includes depictions on a computer diskette, a computer, or a computer storage device. Significantly, \u201cchild sexually abusive material\u201d includes <em>\u201cany reproduction, copy, or print </em>of such a photograph, picture, film, slide, video, electronic visual image, book, magazine, computer, or computer-generated image, or picture, other visual or print or printable medium, or sound recording.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The definitive question in this case is quite simple: did defendant \u201cproduce [or] make\u201d a \u201creproduction [or] copy\u201d of an \u201celectronic visual image,\u201d a \u201ccomputer, or computer-generated image,\u201d or other \u201cvisual or print\u201d medium when he took the deliberate action of copying \u201cJeff0015.jpg\u201d to his computer hard drive? Unquestionably, the answer is <em>yes. </em>Defendant then took the additional, volitional steps of copying that image to his computer a <em>second </em>time, as well as copying it to several CD-Rs.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that MCL 750.145c(2) is \u201cprimarily concerned\u201d with punishing \u201cthe creation or origination\u201d of child pornography and \u201cnot those who download\u201d it \u201cfor personal use\u201d has no basis in the language of the statute. Indeed, the majority opinion takes great pains to avoid noting or giving significance to the fact that by downloading <em>and successively copying </em>child pornography, defendant intentionally produced or made a \u201creproduction [or] copy\u201d of the same illicit pornographic image <em>five distinct times.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Forced to acknowledge that the plain language of the statute says what it says and that \u201ca person may be charged with\u201d \u201cproducing, <em>making, </em>or financing a <em>copy </em>of a computer-generated image\u201d in a \u201cmanner indistinguishable from the person\u201d who created the original image, the majority opinion nevertheless proceeds to write the second clause of MCL 750.145c(2) out of existence by concluding that a defendant\u2019s ultimate plans for the child pornography negate the criminal prohibition regarding the method of acquisition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Presumably, a defendant copying child pornography would only ever do so for one of two purposes \u2014 either to possess it for himself or to distribute it to others. Both of these purposes are reflected in MCL 750.145c(3) and (4), which provide for a 7-year maximum sentence for those who <em>distribute </em>child pornography and a 4-year maximum sentence for those who <em>possess </em>child pornog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>raphy. Under the majority opinion, despite the clear mandate imposing a 20-year sentence on those who make copies of child pornography, a defendant who makes copies of child pornography will <em>never </em>face more than either 4 or 7 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">By holding that a defendant who makes copies of child pornography is guilty of only a 4-year felony when the copies are made \u201cfor personal use,\u201d the majority opinion essentially holds that defendant\u2019s criminal liability is limited to that of a mere possessor under MCL 750.145c(4). However, under the plain language of the statute, defendant is more than a mere possessor of child pornography. The majority\u2019s holding is especially hard to square with the fact that defendant took the additional, <em>volitional </em>steps of copying the images to his computer and separately to CD-Rs. I believe that these actions fall squarely under MCL 750.145c(2) rather than MCL 750.145c(4). As the Court of Appeals opinion noted, it is certainly possible to <em>possess </em>child pornography without copying or reproducing the images. Indeed, defendant could have satisfied his yen for \u201cpersonal use\u201d of child pornography and \u201cmerely possessed\u201d the images by viewing them on the Internet without actually <em>copying </em>the images to his computer twice and recopying the images to several entirely separate compact discs. However, once he copied an image, he clearly violated MCL 750.145c(2). While the majority opinion maintains that the originator of child pornography is \u201cobviously more morally\u201d and \u201cmore criminally\u201d culpable than the copier of child pornography, nothing in the statutory scheme indicates that the Legislature shares the majority\u2019s culpability assessment. Indeed, the clear language of the statute indicates that the Legislature has deemed that both are <em>equally culpable, </em>and certainly <em>more culpable </em>than a defendant who possesses an illicit image without having taken the additional step of copying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The majority opinion also indicates that defendant\u2019s making \u201c5 copies of a single prohibited image\u201d is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain defendant\u2019s convictions. This is a conclusion that has absolutely no basis in the text of the statute. It is unclear to me why making five copies of an identical pornographic image of a minor is insufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s convictions because the <em>entirety </em>of MCL 750.145c(2) contains no numerical minimum requirement concerning copies of child pornography. Making even a <em>single </em>copy of child pornography violates the statute. The reason the majority opinion makes no effort to explain the calculus involved in determining that making five copies is insufficient is because it simply cannot justify such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The majority opinion runs far afield in responding to this dissent \u2014 and naturally so because the statutory language is clear and the majority is forced to strain in order to justify its conclusion. Central to the majority opinion\u2019s argument is its false conclusion that MCL 750.145c(2) is limited to the <em>originator </em>of child pornography. Thus, only those defendants having <em>\u201cdirect </em>contact with a minor\u201d may be charged with violating MCL 750.145c(2). Not surprisingly, the majority opinion gives absolutely <em>no meaning </em>to the fact that the statute also encompasses those who <em>make copies </em>of child pornography, not merely those who \u201cprocured the child\u201d and \u201cplaced the cameras in front of her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">While the hyperbole comparing child pornography to downloading materials from the Internet in violation of federal copyright laws certainly makes for entertaining reading, it is equivalent to comparing apples to orangutans. The federal copyright laws encompass those who willfully infringe a copyright, which includes making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>copies of the creator\u2019s copyrighted material.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By including a \u201creproduction [or] copy\u201d of pornographic child images in the definition of \u201cchild sexually abusive material,\u201d <em>the very material prohibited </em>under MCL 750.145c(2), the Legislature has unambiguously indicated that one need not be the Cecil B. DeMille of child pornography in order to run afoul of MCL 750.145c(2) for \u201cmak[ing]\u201d child sexually abusive material.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">I find nothing vexing, much less \u201csimply untenable,\u201d about our Legislature\u2019s decision to place an increased sanction on defendants who <em>make copies </em>of child pornography, thereby increasing the net amount of child pornographic images in existence. Because there is no question that defendant intentionally made multiple copies of child pornography, his convictions were proper and should be affirmed. Because the majority opinion concludes otherwise, and because it creates additional hurdles to the prosecution of those who copy child pornography, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b770-5\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"> Five images, described as \u201cJeff0015.jpg,\u201d were created on defendant\u2019s laptop computer on October 5, 2002, and September 9, 2003, and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>on three separate CD-Rs created April 15, 2003, April 26, 2003, and June 11, 2003.
