An acknowledgment of parentage, signed by the parents and filed with the State Registrar, is not an \u201cinitial custody determination\u201d under the UCCJEA because it is does not satisfy the definition of \u201cinitial custody determination\u201d provided in that act. Nevertheless, the presumptive award of custody contained in the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act remains part of a valid agreement into which the parents entered, and may be set aside only when a custody determination has been made by the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Under the UCCJEA, a child\u2019s initial custody determination must take place in the child\u2019s home state, unless the home state declines to exercise home-state jurisdiction under the UCCJEA because another state would be a more appropriate forum. In this case, we conclude that Illinois is the child\u2019s home state, and thus only it has the authority to determine whether Michigan is the more appropriate forum. We remand to the Monroe Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Pending resolution of the home-state jurisdictional issue, the award of custody to the mother that was stipulated by the parties pursuant to Acknowledgment of Parentage Act, as well as the temporary orders concerning parenting time and child support, remain intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">PACTS and procedural history</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Plaintiff and defendant are the biological parents of M., born October 12, 2006. Plaintiff and defendant cohabitated but never married. The parties moved from Illinois to Michigan months before M. was born in Michigan. On January 25, 2007, plaintiff and defendant executed and filed an AOP naming defendant as the child\u2019s father and establishing paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In April 2007, the parties and the child returned to Illinois and continued to reside together. Plaintiff attended college and worked, while defendant attended law school. Both parties had Illinois driver\u2019s licenses, and M. received state health insurance that required Illinois residency. During the time that the family resided in Illinois, plaintiff regularly returned to Michigan with the child for extended visits with Michigan family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In May 2008, the relationship between the parties ended, and plaintiff and the child returned to Michigan to live with plaintiffs parents. Five days after returning to Michigan, plaintiff filed a paternity action in .the Monroe Circuit Court. Additionally, plaintiff filed an ex parte petition for alternative service, temporary custody, and the scheduling of a UCCJEA conference. On May 18, 2008, the Michigan trial judge entered an ex parte order granting the request for alternative service and a UCCJEA conference, but declined to address the custody issue. On June 4, 2008, defendant filed a custody action in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">On July 7, 2008, a telephone conference was held between the judges from the Michigan and Illinois courts, as well as the parties, to discuss which state had home-state jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. Defendant argued that Illinois had jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. Plaintiff argued that Michigan should exercise jurisdiction because the child was residing with plaintiff in Michigan, plaintiffs petition had been filed first, and both plaintiff and the child had significant ties to Michigan. Both the Illinois and Michigan judges expressed initial agreement that jurisdiction should lie in Michigan, but also agreed that an evidentiary hearing should be held in Michigan in order to determine which state had home-state jurisdiction. Defendant was granted parenting time in Michigan \u201cat his convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>After adjournments, discovery, and failed settlement attempts, the jurisdictional hearing was conducted on January 6, 2009. The AOP was entered into evidence in the court record for the first time at this hearing. On February 17, 2009, the trial court entered a five-page \u201cdecision and order regarding jurisdiction.\u201d The court ruled that Michigan had jurisdiction to hear the case because, by executing an AOI] the parents \u201ceonsent[ed] to the jurisdiction of Michigan specifically on the issues of custody, support and parenting time.\u201d Furthermore, because an AOP granted \u201cinitial custody\u201d of a minor to the mother, the judge reasoned that the \u201cUCCJEA would not be invoked\u201d because the \u201cgrant of initial custody was already made by the parents who voluntarily invoked the Acknowledgment of Parentage law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Subsequently, a trial was held to determine custody. After taking testimony from a number of witnesses, the trial court applied the best interest factors contained in MCL 722.23, awarding joint legal custody to both parties, and physical custody to the plaintiff. Defendant was awarded parenting time, and a child support order was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Defendant appealed the order of custody. On September 15, 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, \u201calbeit for a different reason.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The panel held that the trial court could properly exercise home-state jurisdiction under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>UCCJEA because a properly executed AOP operated as an initial custody determination as a matter of law. Because the Michigan AOP operated as an \u201cinitial custody determination\u201d under the UCCJEA, Michigan had continuing jurisdiction and it was \u201cnot necessary to consider defendant\u2019s argument that Illinois is the home state.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">This Court granted leave to appeal, asking the parties to address whether the Court of Appeals erred in relying on the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act rather than the UCCJEA to determine that Michigan should exercise subject-matter jurisdiction, and, if jurisdiction properly lies in Illinois as the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d under the UCCJEA, whether Michigan is the more convenient forum for resolution of this matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">This case involves the requirements of the UCCJEA and the interplay between the UCCJEA and the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act. Issues of statutory construction are questions of law reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, in the absence of any factual dispute, whether Michigan may exercise home-state jurisdiction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under the UCCJEA is a question of law reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The Acknowledgment of Parentage Act, MCL 722.1001 <em>et seq., </em>provides a voluntary means for both parents, acting together, to establish paternity of a child born out of wedlock. An AOP is \u201cvalid and effective\u201d when the unwed parents complete the form, sign it, and have their signatures notarized.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A validly executed AOP establishes paternity and may provide the \u201cbasis for court ordered child support, custody, or parenting time without further adjudication under the paternity act... .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The act further provides that the AOP is to be filed with the State Registrar and kept \u201cin a parentage registry in the office of the state registrar.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The Acknowledgment of Parentage Act further provides that when an AOP is executed, \u201cinitial custody\u201d is granted to the mother: <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">After a mother and father sign an acknowledgment of parentage, the mother has <em>initial custody </em>of the minor child, <em>without prejudice to the determination of either parent\u2019s custodial rights, </em>until otherwise determined by the court or otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing and acknowledged by the court. This grant of initial custody to the mother <em>shall not, </em>by itself, <em>affect the rights of either parent </em>in a proceeding to seek a court order for custody or parenting time.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Lastly, parents who execute an AOP agree to consent to the \u201cgeneral, <em>personal </em>jurisdiction\u201d of Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>courts \u201cregarding the issues of the support, custody, and parenting time of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">The UCCJEA, MCL 722.1101 <em>et seq., </em>governs interstate child custody disputes. At issue in this case is MCL 722.1201, which governs a state court\u2019s authority to make an \u201cinitial child-custody determination.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 204,[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination <em>only </em>in the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">(a) This state is the <em>home state </em>of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within 6 months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">(b) A court of another state does not have jurisdiction under subdivision (a), or a court of the home state of the child has <em>declined to exercise jurisdiction </em>on the ground that this state is the more appropriate forum under section 207 or 208, and the court finds both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(i) The child and the child\u2019s parents, or the child and at least 1 parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(ii) Substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">(c) All courts having jurisdiction under subdivision (a) or (b) have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under section 207 or 208.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">(d) No court of another state would have jurisdiction under subdivision (a), (b), or (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">(2) Subsection (1) is the <em>exclusive jurisdictional basis </em>for making a child-custody determination by a court of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">(3) Physical presence of, or personal jurisdiction over, a party or a child is neither necessary nor sufficient to make a child-custody determination. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The UCCJEA also defines statutory terms that are critical to our resolution of this case. Of note, a \u201cchild-custody determination\u201d is defined as \u201ca judgment, decree, or <em>other court order </em>providing for legal custody, physical custody, or parenting time with respect to a child. Child-custody determination includes a permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order. Child-custody determination <em>does not </em>include an order relating to child support or other monetary obligation of an individual.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Additionally, the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d is defined as the state in which a child lived with a parent <em>\u201cfor at least 6 consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child-custody proceeding.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The Court of Appeals in this case held that an AOf] executed pursuant to the Acknowledgment of Parent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>age Act, operated as an initial custody determination for the purposes of the UCC JEA. It is true that the plain language of the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act effectively conditions the parents\u2019 ability to execute an AOP on their willingness to allow the mother to be granted \u201cinitial custody of the minor child . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While this grant of initial custody occurs by operation of law when the parties stipulate to the child\u2019s paternity, the statutory language also makes clear that the initial grant of custody creates no impediment should either parent wish to seek a judicial determination of custodial rights. MCL 722.1006 indicates that the grant of initial custody is <em>\u201cwithout prejudice </em>to the determination of either parent\u2019s custodial rights\u201d and that the grant of initial custody \u201cshall not, by itself, <em>affect the rights of either parent </em>in a proceeding to <em>seek a court order </em>for custody or parenting time.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, nothing in the plain language of the Acknowl\u00e9dgment of Parentage Act equates the execution of an AOP to a judicial determination regarding custody; rather, the statutory language leads to the opposite conclusion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Additionally, for the purposes of an interstate custody dispute, an AOP does not satisfy the statutory definition of \u201cchild-custody determination\u201d provided in the UCC JEA, because the acknowledgment is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cjudgment, decree, <em>or other court order </em>providing for legal custody, physical custody, or parenting time with respect to a child.\u201d MCL 722.1102(c) (emphasis added). An AOP is not issued or entered by <em>any </em>court, nor is it in the form of a \u201cjudgment, decree, or other court order____\u201d Rather, the parental stipulation is filed in the executive branch with the State Registrar and kept in a specific parentage registry. The judicial branch has absolutely no involvement in the execution of an AOP Indeed, the involvement of the judicial branch occurs, if ever, only <em>after </em>the AOP has been filed, as the acknowledgment serves as the \u201cbasis for court ordered child support, custody, or parenting time without further adjudication under the paternity act----\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Simply put, the initial grant of custody to the mother required under the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act is not an \u201cinitial child-custody determination\u201d under the UCCJEA, and the Court of Appeals erred by concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">It is true that the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act requires, as a condition of executing an AOI] that parents consent \u201cto the general, personal jurisdiction\u201d of Michigan courts regarding \u201cthe issues of the support, custody, and parenting time ... ,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, jurisdiction over a person<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> has never been synonymous with jurisdiction over a <em>case, </em>and the parties\u2019 consent to personal jurisdiction provides no support for the conclusion that Michigan has home-state jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. The plain language of the UCCJEA indicates that it provides \u201cthe <em>exclusive </em>jurisdictional basis for making a child-custody determination.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Merely having personal jurisdiction over a party or child is insufficient to make a child custody determination.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, the consent to personal jurisdiction required by the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act provides no basis for Michigan to exert home-state jurisdiction pursuant to the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\">The record reveals that the child\u2019s home state for the purposes of the UCCJEA is the state of Illinois, because that is the state in which the child resided \u201cfor at least 6 consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child-custody proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that, despite the fact that the state of Illinois has home-state jurisdiction, the state of Michigan is a more convenient forum for the resolution of the custody dispute. However, under the UCCJEA, it is the <em>home state </em>that must decide whether to \u201cdecline to exercise its jurisdiction\u201d because \u201cit determines\u201d that \u201cit is an inconvenient forum\u201d and that \u201ca court of another state is a more appropriate forum.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, while plaintiff presents persuasive arguments supporting the conclusion that Michigan is the more appropriate forum in which to resolve the interstate custody dispute, these arguments are best directed to the Illinois court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Finally, we take care to note that, pending resolution of the interstate child custody dispute, the stipulation of the parties granting custody to the mother, as contained in the AO\u00ed\u00a1 remains intact.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Additionally, the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>support order, as well as the order concerning parenting time, likewise remains intact.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The Court of Appeals erred by concluding that the presumptive award of custody given to a mother when an AOP is executed pursuant to the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act serves as an \u201cinitial custody determination\u201d under the UCCJEA. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the Monroe Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-7\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh, Weaver, Corrigan, Markman, and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> On March 3, 2009, after the Michigan court held that Michigan had jurisdiction over the case, the Illinois circuit court entered an order transferring the case to Michigan and dismissing defendant\u2019s Illinois case with prejudice. Subsequently, a motion was filed to vacate that order. The Illinois court refused to vacate the order transferring the case to Michigan, but did amend the previous order to indicate that the case would be \u201cmerely taken off call\u201d rather than dismissed with prejudice pending defendant\u2019s Michigan appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> <em>Foster v Wolkowitz, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued September 15, 2009 (Docket No. 291825), p 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\"> <em>Id., </em>unpub op at Y.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> 485 Mich 999 (2009).
