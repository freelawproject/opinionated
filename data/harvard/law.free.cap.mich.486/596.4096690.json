At trial, the child\u2019s hearsay statements to a third party were admitted over defendant\u2019s objection. Those statements, which were made when the child first revealed the allegations of abuse, contained all the details of the alleged assaults and were used at trial to corroborate the child\u2019s testimony. Defendant appealed, arguing that the statements should not have been admitted because they were not spontaneously given as required by Michigan Rule of Evidence 803A.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">We agree that the child\u2019s statements were not \u201cspontaneous\u201d and therefore hold that the statements should not have been admitted under the limited \u201ctender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>years\u201d hearsay exception created by MRE 803A. We nevertheless affirm defendant\u2019s convictions because the improper admission of the hearsay statements was harmless error. The error is not so prejudicial as to require reversal because the hearsay statements were not used substantively at trial to prove guilt (but rather only to show consistency in the child\u2019s testimony), the statements were cumulative to the victim\u2019s testimony at trial, and there was other corroborating evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but do so on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Defendant Jason Gursky was tried on and convicted of four counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree (CSC-I) for sexual penetration of a person under the age of 13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim in this case, GA, was the daughter of Gursky\u2019s girlfriend, Lori.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The charges against Gursky arose out of two alleged incidents of sexual contact with GA: one in September 2005, when GA was six, and the second around April 30, 2006, when GA was seven. On May 4, 2006, during a visit to the home of Stacy Morgan, a close friend of Lori, GA first alleged that Gursky had improperly touched her.</p>\n<p id=\"API\">The focus of this appeal is the proper characterization of GA\u2019s statements when she first discussed the sexual abuse. Those statements are thus provided here in detail, as relayed by Morgan during her testimony at Gursky\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Lori arrived at Morgan\u2019s home about 8:00 p.m. after picking her children up from their father\u2019s home. Morgan, acting on a suspicion that \u201csomething had been going on\u201d with Gursky,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asked GA <em>\u201cif anyone had been touching her.\u201d </em>GA did not verbally respond, but <em>\u201cgot a horrified look on her face,\u201d </em>and her eyes welled up. Morgan summoned GA to come closer and talk with Morgan and Lori, which she did and orally responded <em>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </em>Morgan answered: <em>\u201cHas anyone ever touched your private parts?\u201d </em>GA\u2019s eyes welled up again, she started to suck her thumb, and she responded that somebody had. Morgan followed up: <em>\u201cWhere have you been touched? Who touched you?\u201d </em>and then listed <em>\u201cpeople\u2019s names, every man\u2019s name that could come to mind, the last of which was Jason [Gursky].\u201d </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At the mention of defendant\u2019s name, GA began <em>\u201cbawling, [and] gasping for breath,\u201d </em>pointed to her vaginal area, and indicated that defendant had touched her <em>\u201cdown there.\u201d </em>Morgan continued questioning GA: <em>\u201cHow did he touch you? 'What did he touch you with?\" </em>GA responded: <em>\u201cWith his finger.\u201d </em>Morgan asked: <em>\u201cDid he touch you any other way? Did he touch you with his penis?\" </em>And GA responded that he had not. Morgan asked: <em>\u201cDid he ever touch you any other way?\u201d </em>and GA responded that <em>\u201che kissed me with his tongue.\u201d </em>Morgan followed up: <em>\u201cOnyour mouth?\u201d </em>GA responded: <em>\u201cNo, down here\u201d </em>and again pointed to her vaginal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Morgan noted that GA was <em>\u201ckind of hesitant\u201d </em>so she hugged GA and said to her, <em>\u201cMiss Stacy is your safe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>person. You know, tell me and I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. </em>\u201d She gave GA time to calm down, during which time Lori left the room to call Gursky. Morgan then asked how many times the alleged abuse had happened. GA <em>\u201ckind of looked in the sky\u201d </em>and responded <em>\u201cI think it was four times because the first time was when we lived at Miss Tracy\u2019s basement.\u201d </em>Later Lori confronted Gursky, who denied touching GA; when Lori brought GA into the room with Gursky, GA again began to cry but did not make any further accusations against Gursky. A few days later, GA wondered aloud to her mother, <em>\u201cwhat if it was a bad dream ?\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The following day Lori went to the police and prepared a written statement describing GA\u2019s allegations. A detective subsequently asked Gursky to come to the police station, where he questioned Gursky for approximately two hours. Gursky answered all the detective\u2019s questions, denied the accusations, and never requested a lawyer. During these interviews, the detective noted that Gursky\u2019s fingernails were \u201cjagged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">That same day GA was examined by a nurse, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>common when a sexual assault is believed to have happened within the prior 96 hours. GA complained to the nurse of experiencing pain in her vaginal area since \u201cJason put his finger in my pee-pee.\u201d GA told the nurse that defendant had kissed and touched her \u201cwhere her pee-pee comes out from.\u201d During the examination, the nurse noted that GA had an abrasion on her labia minora, which appeared to have occurred within the last 24 to 48 hours, but could have occurred earlier. The nurse later testified that the abrasion was \u201cconsistent\u201d with a fingernail scratch, or could have resulted from innocent behavior. Other than the scratch, the nurse found no other trauma to GA.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Defendant was charged with four counts of CSC-I. Pursuant to MRE 803A, the prosecution provided notice that it would call Stacy Morgan to testify regarding what GA told her when GA first relayed the details of sexual abuse. MRE 803A provides a hearsay exception to allow the admission of statements by victims of child abuse under the age of 10 that would otherwise be excluded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Before trial, defendant objected to the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>GA\u2019s statements to Morgan on the grounds that they did not fall within the parameters of MRE 803A\u2019s hearsay exception \u2014 specifically, that the statements were not \u201cspontaneous\u201d as required by MRE 803A(2). Defendant argued that \u201cit is clear from the statement of this Stacy Morgan ... that while she\u2019s there[,] names are suggested to this child, including [Mr. Gursky\u2019s] name... she is continuously questioned as to what occurred here----It is not spontaneous by any means.\u201d The trial court did not directly rule on this issue or address defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the lack of spontaneity. Instead, the court stated that \u201cthe reasonableness of the delay [between the alleged incidents and GA\u2019s disclosures is]... really the only issue I can consider.\u201d The court then held that the delay was reasonable, and Morgan\u2019s testimony thus admissible under MRE 803A.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The trial commenced, and GA testified that she had awakened on two separate occasions when defendant had touched her \u201cprivate\u201d with \u201chis finger\u201d and \u201ctongue.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She also testified that she first told this to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Morgan and her mother, but could not recall being asked any questions by Morgan. Morgan testified about what GA had originally told her when GA had first disclosed the alleged abuse, the details of which are set forth above. Lori testified about the circumstances regarding GA\u2019s first statement of sexual abuse. She further testified about how she had found defendant in GA\u2019s bedroom at 3:30 a.m. on the night of the second incident with the bedcovers pulled down and his hands on GA\u2019s legs. The nurse also testified about her medical evaluation of GA, including the scrape on GA\u2019s labia. In closing argument, the prosecutor argued that if the jury believed GA\u2019s testimony, they must convict; she then acknowledged that this testimony was buttressed by Morgan\u2019s testimony which \u201ccorroborates everything GA said on the stand.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant was convicted of all four counts and sentenced to four concurrent terms of 15 to 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the admission of Morgan\u2019s testimony regarding GA\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The panel concluded that although the trial court had abused its discretion by failing to address defendant\u2019s objection that GA\u2019s out-of-court statements were not spontaneously made, reversal was not required because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the error was harmless: either way, the testimony was admissible. The Court of Appeals cited <em>People v Dun-ham </em>for the proposition that \u201canswers to open-ended, innocuous questions are spontaneous.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court reviewed the record and then reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">The victim responded emotionally to the first mention of the subject matter, crying and sucking her thumb. She willingly gave details that exceeded the scope of Morgan\u2019s inquiry. She pointed to her vaginal area and reported that the touching had occurred \u201cdown there,\u201d volunteered that the touching was with a finger and a tongue, denied that defendant touched her with his penis, and volunteered that the conduct had occurred over a greater span of time than suspected by Morgan. <em>Taken as a whole, the victim\u2019s statements were primarily spontaneous, despite being prompted by Morgan\u2019s questions. </em>Thus, the testimony would have been admissible had the trial court considered this objection and, therefore, the court\u2019s erroneous legal conclusion had no effect on the outcome of the trial.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On the basis of this reasoning and finding the statements to be \u201cprimarily spontaneous,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Defendant sought leave to appeal in this Court. We granted his application for leave to appeal and directed the parties to address specifically</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">(1) whether the statements made by the complainant to Stacy Morgan on or about May 4, 2006, were \u201cshown to have been spontaneous and without indication of manufacture\u201d within the meaning of MRE 803A(2), and (2) whether it was more probable than not that any error in this regard was outcome determinative.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The decision whether to admit evidence is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, which will be reversed only where there is an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, decisions regarding the admission of evidence frequently involve preliminary questions of law, such as whether a rule of evidence or statute precludes admitting of the evidence. This Court reviews questions of law de novo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201cwhen such preliminary questions of law are at issue, it must be borne in mind that it is an abuse of discretion to admit evidence that is inadmissible as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">A. THE \u201cSPONTANEITY\u201d REQUIREMENT OF MRE 803A</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">1. PRINCIPLES OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hearsay is generally prohibited and may only be admitted at trial if provided for in an exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> MRE 803A provides just such an exception for a child\u2019s statement regarding sexual assault in certain circumstances. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">A statement describing an incident that included a sexual act performed with or on the declarant by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>defendant or an accomplice is admissible to the extent that it corroborates testimony given by the declarant during the same proceeding, provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">(1) the declarant was under the age of ten when the statement was made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">(2) <em>the statement is shown to have been spontaneous and without indication of manufacture-,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">(3) either the declarant made the statement immediately after the incident or any delay is excusable as having been caused by fear or other equally effective circumstance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">(4) the statement is introduced through the testimony of someone other than the declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">If the declarant made more than one corroborative statement about the incident, only the first is admissible under this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">A statement may not be admitted under this rule unless the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party the intent to offer the statement, and the particulars of the statement, sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet the statement[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">MRE 803A, which codified the common-law \u201ctender years exception,\u201d is also an exception to the prohibition against the use of hearsay testimony to bolster the credibility of a witness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Relevant to this appeal, MRE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>803A plainly requires the declarant\u2019s original statement to have been \u201cspontaneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not define \u201cspontaneous.\u201d As when construing statutes, in the absence of a specific definition of a common term used in an evidentiary rule, it is appropriate to look to the dictionary definition to discern the term\u2019s ordinary and generally accepted meaning.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cSpontaneous\u201d is defined as: \u201c(1) coming or resulting from natural impulse or tendency; without effort or premeditation; natural and unconstrained; unplanned; (2) of a person: giving to acting on sudden impulse.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The standards for spontaneity have been well litigated. The leading case on this issue in Michigan is <em>People v Dunham, </em>a decision of the Court of Appeals holding that statements made in response to customary, open-ended questions may be considered spontaneous.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In <em>Dunham, </em>a child was asked questions by an adult mediator during the child\u2019s parents\u2019 divorce. The questions were generally innocuous and customarily asked of all children participating in divorce mediation, yet the child in <em>Dunham </em>responded with allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>sexual abuse. Virtually every Court of Appeals decision (including the panel in this case) has applied <em>Dunham </em>when examining the issue of spontaneity, although the holding has been broadened to stand for the general proposition that statements made in response to questioning may be considered spontaneous.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Until this case, this Court has not itself discussed or defined the parameters under which a statement can be spontaneous for the purposes of MRE 803A.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Other states\u2019 courts and the federal courts have addressed the issue of spontaneity as well; their decisions may be classified into separate groups for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>purposes here. The most recognizable spontaneous statements are those that arise out of pure impulse\u2014 that is, they are made by the declarant without prompt, plan, or questioning. This type of \u201cimpulsive\u201d statement is prototypically spontaneous because it appears to \u201ccome out of nowhere\u201d or \u201cout of the blue.\u201d For example, in <em>People v </em>Bowers,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Colorado Supreme Court held that a child\u2019s statements were spontaneous where she made unexpected allegations of sexual abuse with no questioning or prompting from the adult. There, a babysitter was changing the child\u2019s brother\u2019s diaper when the child pointed to her brother\u2019s penis and said that her father \u201c \u2018had one just like that hut it was bigger and he hurts me with it\u2019 \u201d and the child also said to a foster care program coordinator that \u201c T don\u2019t like honeys ... I don\u2019t like Daddy to put his honey on me.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court held that the statements were made \u201cspontaneously without prompting or suggesting.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">Statements that are made as a result of prompt, plan, or questioning by a third party, yet are in some manner atypical, unexpected, or do not logically follow from the prompt are also widely considered spontaneous. This type of \u201cnon sequitur\u201d statement is generally considered spontaneous because it shows that the declarant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>was acting from natural impulses or tendencies by responding atypically to what may otherwise have been innocent prompts. For example, in <em>State v Aaron </em>L,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Connecticut Supreme Court held that the victim\u2019s statement showed spontaneity and consistency, and was therefore sufficiently reliable to be admissible under Connecticut\u2019s residual exception to the hearsay rule. There, the child\u2019s statement, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you that I touch daddy\u2019s pee-pee,\u2019 \u201d did not \u201clogically relate to the event that preceded it\u2014 her mother admonishing the victim that it was not nice to grope her breast.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">A third category that poses closer questions involves cases where statements are given as a result of open-ended and nonleading questions that include answers or information outside the scope of the questions themselves. Often, this type of unplanned yet responsive statement may be considered \u201cspontaneous\u201d because the information that results is based on knowledge independent of that provided in the question. For example, in <em>State v Shafer, </em>the Washington Supreme Court held that where the child \u201cwithout prompting\u201d told her mother about encounters with the defendant and the child\u2019s mother then inquired further, while the child\u2019s \u201cstatements in response to her mother\u2019s questioning were not entirely spontaneous, they were not the result of leading questions or a structured interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>gation\u201d and were thus admissible.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Similarly, the decision in <em>McCafferty v </em>Leapley<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> demonstrates how a spontaneous statement may arise out of simple questioning or innocent prompting. There, the child\u2019s statements \u201cabout how her \u2018daddy\u2019 sucked on her neck were given spontaneously in response to a nonleading question about how she got the mark on her neck. Her statements about this were consistent with what she told others and with what she demonstrated on [the adult\u2019s] own neck and with [the adult\u2019s] playroom dolls. ... [It was also the child] who volunteered in play statements such as \u2018this is how she could sit on her daddy\u2019s weenie.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The aforementioned Michigan Court of Appeals decision in <em>Dunham </em>\u2014 holding that statements resulting from open-ended, nonleading questions may be spontaneous \u2014 is another prime example of this type of statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Statements falling within this last category, however, are also the type that are most likely to be nonspontaneous, and thus deserve extra scrutiny by trial courts before they may be admitted. When examining statements that have some of the same characteristics as GA\u2019s statements here, many courts have found a <em>lack </em>of spontaneity. The analysis they employed is informative for our purposes here. For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v DG </em>provides a useful comparison.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> There, the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>there was not a \u201c \u2018probability that the statement [was] trustworthy\u2019 \u201d as required by New Jersey\u2019s applicable rule, because the \u201csituation under which [the child] disclosed the sexual abuse was very stressful\u201d and the child did not \u201cspontaneously divulge information concerning the assault\u201d to the adult, but rather the adult \u201cinterrogated her after finding her performing questionable acts while at play.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Interrogation, aggressive or leading questioning, and similar factual scenarios may all work to eliminate the spontaneity of a declarant\u2019s statement, which would thus render it inadmissible in the MRE 803A context.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">2. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Having examined these principles of hearsay and the requirement of \u201cspontaneity\u201d generally, we must determine the parameters of this requirement in Michigan for the purposes of MRE 803A.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We hold that MRE 803A generally requires the declarant-victim to initiate the <em>subject of sexual abuse. </em>The question of spontaneity, at its essence, asks whether the statement is the creation of the child or another. There is certainly no doubt that the types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>\u201cimpulsive\u201d or \u201cnon sequitur\u201d statements described above should be considered spontaneous for the purposes of MRE 803A because they result from the declarant\u2019s \u201cnatural impulse or tendency\u201d or are \u201cunplanned\u201d and made \u201cwithout effort or premeditation,\u201d as a common definition of spontaneity provides. Such statements are quintessentially the \u201ccreation\u201d of the child-declarant, and are thus certainly admissible under MRE 803A, assuming they meet the rule\u2019s other requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">This case, on the other hand, requires that we address the closer question: whether prompts from adults render a child\u2019s responsive statement inadmissible. This type of statement most often arises in the context of questioning by an adult. We hold that the mere fact that questioning occurred is not incompatible with a ruling that the child produced a spontaneous statement. However, for such statements to be admissible, the child must broach the subject of sexual abuse, and any questioning or prompts from adults must be nonleading or open-ended in order for the statement to be considered the creation of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">To be clear, we do <em>not </em>hold that any questioning by an adult automatically renders a statement \u201cnonspontaneous\u201d and thus inadmissible under MRE 803A. Open-ended, nonleading questions that do not specifically suggest sexual abuse do not pose a problem with eliciting potentially false claims of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> But where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the initial questioning focuses on possible sexual abuse, the resultant answers are not spontaneous because they do not arise without external cause. When questioning is involved, trial courts must look specifically at the questions posed in order to determine whether the questioning shaped, prompted, suggested, or otherwise implied the answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">This approach requires that trial courts review the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statement in order to determine the issue of spontaneity. Even though courts should look at the <em>surrounding circumstances </em>and <em>larger context </em>in order to understand whether the statement was spontaneously made, we note that this review is not solely determinative of the question of admissibility. As MRE 803A requires, the statement must be \u201cshown to have been spontaneous <em>and </em>without indication of manufacture.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The language of MRE 803A(2) clearly demonstrates that spontaneity is an independent requirement of admissibility rather than one factor that weighs in favor of reliability or admissibility.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, even if, considering the totality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of the circumstances, the trial court determines that a statement is spontaneous for the purposes of MRE 803A(2), it must nevertheless also conduct the separate analyses necessary to determine whether the statement meets the other independent requirements of MRE 803A.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Turning to the facts of this case, we do not conclude that GA\u2019s statements were spontaneously given. Morgan directed GA to sit on Lori\u2019s lap, whereupon Morgan, Lori, or both questioned GA about sexual abuse. Morgan testified that she specifically broached the subject of sexual abuse on her initiative, questioning and otherwise probing GA for details. According to her trial testimony, Morgan asked GA numerous questions, including whether \u201canyone had been touching her,\u201d \u201cHas anyone ever touched your private places?\u201d \u201cWhere have you been touched? Who touched you?\u201d and, after identifying defendant, \u201cHow did he touch you? What did he touch you with?\u201d There is simply no indication in this case that GA would have made the statements she made or even broached the subject of sexual abuse if not otherwise prompted and, indeed, directly questioned by Morgan. Moreover, the testimony indicates that GA hesitated for \u201cquite a while\u201d before making the first statement; this tends to suggest that GA did not come forth with her statements on her own initiative, and thus that the statements were not necessarily products of her creation. More troubling, Morgan specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>suggested defendant\u2019s name to GA in a list of possible perpetrators. These facts demonstrate that GA\u2019s statements were not spontaneously given, nor did they arise out of an otherwise innocent conversation or set of nonleading and open-ended questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Although there were concededly spontaneous <em>elements </em>in GA\u2019s statements, this is insufficient to establish the <em>general </em>kind of spontaneity the rule requires. The Court of Appeals below concluded that \u201con balance\u201d the statements were \u201cprimarily spontaneous\u201d by focusing not on who broached the subject of sexual abuse, but instead on the nature of some of the questions that were open-ended, the degree of voluntariness GA displayed in answering questions and providing details not necessarily evident by the nature of the questions, and the physical reactions that GA exhibited as a result of the questioning. In this sense, the statements had spontaneous elements inasmuch as the answers were \u201cgiven without premeditation,\u201d some answers seemed \u201cunplanned,\u201d and some of her responses were \u201cnatural\u201d and impulsive \u2014 and this is true <em>even if </em>GA\u2019s statements were given in response to direct questions. Nevertheless, when considering the questions in their entirety, we cannot conclude that GA\u2019s responses were, on the whole, spontaneous. As noted, because spontaneity is an independent requirement under MRE 803A(2) rather than one factor that weighs in favor of reliability and therefore admissibility, an overall sense of reliability or trustworthiness cannot render nonspontaneous statements admissible under MRE 803A.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In deciding that GA\u2019s statements are inadmissible, we must be clear that we do not expect a parent or other concerned adult not trained in the delicate nature of questioning a child regarding sexual abuse to recognize the danger of influencing a child\u2019s responses with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>type of questioning used here. Nor do we expect that most parents or adults would treat this situation casually in order to allow the child to come forward with a \u201cspontaneous\u201d statement. Indeed, quite the contrary is likely to be true: it is perfectly natural for a parent or other concerned adult to engage in direct questioning or seek as much information as possible if his suspicions are aroused regarding possible sexual abuse of a child. We merely hold that statements resulting from such questioning cannot meet the narrow grounds for admissibility under MRE 803A. The prohibition on hearsay is the longstanding general rule, and thus exceptions to this prohibition must be appropriately enforced.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In sum, we hold that a statement prompted by an adult\u2019s question specifically concerning sexual abuse is not spontaneous. This is true even if other indicia of reliability exist, such as an emotional response or details provided by the child that exceed the scope of the adult\u2019s inquiry. The Court of Appeals thereby erred by focusing on these other indicia of reliability rather than who broached the subject of sexual abuse, the specific questions asked by the adult during the conversation, and how some of the questioning suggested or implied answers. Viewing GA\u2019s statements in light of the totality of the circumstances in this case, these critical factors render her statements nonspontaneous. In future cases, though, we emphasize that a statement made in response to an adult\u2019s question or comment that does not concern abuse, or where the <em>child </em>brings up the subject of abuse, may be spontaneous, and for the purposes of MRE 803A may be equally as admissible as if the child had made a statement arising \u201cout of nowhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>B. HARMLESS ERROR ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Having determined that the trial court in this case abused its discretion by impermissibly allowing Stacy Morgan to testify regarding GA\u2019s out-of-court statements concerning alleged sexual abuse, we must next determine whether this error was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions. We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim of error in this case involves preserved, non-constitutional error. The standard we must apply here is governed by statute. MCL 769.26 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, or the <em>improper admission </em>or rejection <em>of evidence, </em>or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, <em>unless </em>in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that <em>the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of </em>justice.[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">In making this determination for preserved, non-constitutional error, this Court asks whether, absent the error, it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that a different outcome would have resulted.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The burden is on the defendant to show that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Where the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice and a defendant cannot meet this burden, we have deemed the error \u201charmless\u201d and thus not meriting reversal of the conviction.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Michigan law provides that where a hearsay statement is not offered and argued as substantive proof of guilt, but rather offered merely to corroborate the child\u2019s testimony, it is more likely that the error will be harmless.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Moreover, the admission of a hearsay statement that is cumulative to in-court testimony by the declarant can be harmless error, particularly when corroborated by other evidence.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This Court has cautioned, though, that \u201cthe fact that the statement [is] cumulative, standing alone, does not automatically result in a finding of harmless error. . .. [Instead, the] inquiry into prejudice focuses on the nature of the error and assesses its effect in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In a trial where the evidence essentially presents a one-on-one credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ity contest between the victim and the defendant, hearsay evidence may tip the scales against the defendant, which means that the error is more harmful.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> This may be even more likely when the hearsay statement was made by a young child, as opposed to an older child or adult.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> However, if the declarant himself testified at trial, \u201cany likelihood of prejudice was greatly diminished\u201d because \u201cthe primary rationale for the exclusion of hearsay is the inability to test the reliability of out-of-court statements[.]\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Where the declarant himself testifies and is subject to cross-examination, the hearsay testimony is of less importance and less prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">On the basis of this harmless error framework, we are not convinced that defendant has met the burden of showing that, but for the fact that Morgan testified regarding GA\u2019s original statements of abuse, it is more probable than not that a different outcome would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">First, the prosecutor relied on Morgan\u2019s testimony only as <em>corroboration </em>for GA\u2019s direct testimony, and did not admit the testimony for its substantive value. The prosecutor\u2019s opening sentence when discussing Morgan\u2019s testimony during closing arguments explicitly indicated the limited purpose for which this testimony was offered: \u201cStacy Morgan\u2019s testimony corroborates eveiything that [GA] said on the stand last Friday.\u201d The prosecutor then proceeded to describe precisely how Morgan\u2019s testimony confirmed that GA\u2019s statements at trial and when talking to Morgan were the same. In essence, Morgan\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>was used to show that GA had not changed her story in the intervening time. Although Morgan\u2019s testimony was undoubtedly important, the record is clear that it simply was never used substantively by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This is consistent with an MRE 803A statement generally, which is only \u201cadmissible to the extent that it corroborates testimony given by the declarant during the same proceeding . .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Second, Morgan\u2019s testimony was cumulative to GA\u2019s testimony at trial. GA testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. GA\u2019s testimony at trial was sufficient <em>standing alone </em>to support defendant\u2019s conviction of all four CSC charges.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Although whether a hearsay statement is cumulative is not dispositive to this analysis under Michigan law, it is an indicator that the error was not highly prejudicial, particularly in the presence of other corroborating evidence. Here, the improperly admitted portions of Morgan\u2019s testimony did not introduce any new information to the jury. Instead, Morgan\u2019s testimony was merely cumulative to GA\u2019s in-court testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Defendant contends that this case largely rested on GA\u2019s credibility and believability, which Morgan undoubtedly bolstered. However, there was <em>additional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>corroborating evidence </em>introduced which tends to belie this claim. Perhaps the most damaging of this evidence is Lori\u2019s testimony that she walked in to GA\u2019s room at 3:30 a.m. and found defendant kneeling at GA\u2019s bed, with the bedcovers pushed down, touching GA in the leg area. This testimony corroborates GA\u2019s testimony regarding the timing of the alleged crime, namely that defendant had touched and \u201ckissed\u201d her vaginal area that night, and corroborates precisely GA\u2019s testimony that her mother entered the room during the sexual assault and then left the room again. The nurse also testified that GA stated during the medical examination that she experienced pain in her vaginal area because \u201cJason put his finger in my pee-pee\u201d and that defendant had kissed and touched her \u201cwhere her pee-pee comes out from.\u201d This testimony was properly admitted under MRE 803(4), which allows the admission of statements made for purposes of medical treatment.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The nurse\u2019s testimony also introduced the fact that GA had recently suffered a scratch on her labia minora.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Thus, the other properly admitted evidence reveals that this case was <em>not </em>purely a one-on-one credibility contest between the defendant and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Third, to the degree that Morgan\u2019s testimony prejudiced defendant when she described how GA <em>reacted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>during the conversation, the victim\u2019s emotional reactions <em>are not hearsay </em>and are perfectly admissible at trial.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Morgan testified about the horrified look on GA\u2019s face, how her eyes welled up, how she began sucking her thumb, and her crying, bawling, and gasping for breath. Testimony to this effect would be damaging inasmuch as these were GA\u2019s inadvertent, non-coerced physical reactions that tended to show the reliability of her statements. More important, though, the testimony about these reactions <em>is admissible </em>as non-hearsay because they are nonassertive conduct.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Morgan could properly testify as to GA\u2019s nonassertive conduct that she personally observed and about which she has first-hand knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On the basis of this analysis, we hold that although Morgan\u2019s testimony was erroneously admitted, the error does not require reversal. Morgan\u2019s testimony was cumulative to and corroborated GA\u2019s testimony, which was further buttressed by other evidence. On this record, defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that a different outcome would have been the more probable result without Morgan\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>rv CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We hold that the child\u2019s statements in this case were not \u201cspontaneous\u201d and therefore should not have been admitted under the limited hearsay exception created by MRE 803A. Statements specifically prompted by an adult\u2019s question concerning sexual abuse are not spontaneous, even if other indicia of trustworthiness or reliability exist. However, where the child brings up the subject of abuse, the resulting statement may be considered spontaneous, even if later questioning occurs by an adult. For such statements to be admissible, the child must broach the subject of sexual abuse, any questioning or prompts from adults must be nonleading and open-ended, and the statement must be the creation of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Although the trial court abused its discretion by admitting hearsay testimony in this case, we nonetheless affirm defendant\u2019s convictions because the improper admission was harmless error. Defendant has not been able to show that the error is so prejudicial as to require reversal. Here, the hearsay statements were not used substantively at trial to prove guilt (but rather only to show consistency in the child\u2019s testimony), the statement was cumulative to other trial evidence, and there was other corroborating evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is thus vacated, and defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed on other grounds.</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Weaver, Corrigan, Markman, and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-12\"> MCL 750.520b(l)(a) (\u201cA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if he or she engages in sexual penetration with another person and if...

GA was wearing pajamas and underwear in her bed. During the night, Gursky appeared in her bedroom, reached underneath her clothing, and touched her vaginal area with his finger and tongue. The third and fourth incidents occurred on one night at the end of April 2006. That night, GA had fallen asleep on the couch, so Lori put her to bed in her street clothes in the bedroom that GA shared with her brother, and Lori then went to bed herself. Lori woke up around 3:30 a.m. and noticed that her door had been closed; she walked out of her room and noticed that no one was in the living room where the TV was on, but she also saw that the door to the children\u2019s bedroom was slightly open. She opened the door and noticed Gursky kneeling by the middle of GA\u2019s bed, where the covers had been pushed to the end of the bed. GA was lying on her back and Gursky had his hand between her knee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>feet. Lori asked Gursky what he was doing, and he replied that he was tucking in the children. Lori stood there a while longer, then left; a few minutes later she returned to the children\u2019s bedroom and noticed that GA had been changed into her nightgown.

While true that the prosecutor discussed Morgan\u2019s testimony in her closing statement, it was the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cfifth reason\u201d for conviction out of seven reasons total. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s discussion of Morgan\u2019s testimony accounts for less than 2V2 transcript pages, which likely amounted to no more than a few minutes time during the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. Despite defendant\u2019s characterization to the contrary, we do not believe that this represents the type of overwhelming reliance that would lead to the conclusion that Morgan\u2019s testimony was highly prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b700-12\"> MRE 803A.

And it appears that the jury <em>did </em>find GA credible in this case. For example, GA\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence supporting the allegation that defendant had sexually assaulted her on the first occasion, yet the jury returned verdicts of guilty on those charges. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication, our assertion that the jury must find the victim credible if the victim\u2019s testimony is the only evidence of a crime in this type of case is merely a statement of obvious fact, not commentary on GA\u2019s credibility in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Moreover, we reject the dissent\u2019s citation of a single law review article in an attempt to discredit GA\u2019s testimony in toto. <em>Post </em>at 629-630.

I disagree, however, that this error was harmless. I think that a full review of the record reveals that this case rested largely on the complainant\u2019s credibility, and, as the prosecution stressed in its closing argument, Stacy Morgan\u2019s corroborating testimony bolstering GA\u2019s credibility was an essential piece of evidence that was critical to the outcome of this case. Therefore, I think that defendant has satisfied his burden under <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484; 596 NW2d 607 (1999), to show that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that a different outcome would have resulted absent Morgan\u2019s testimony. Thus, I respectfully dissent from part III(B) of the majority opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The majority\u2019s harmless-error analysis goes astray in several places. First, the majority glosses over the key details regarding the important facts in this case. Second, the majority gives insufficient weight to this Court\u2019s caselaw regarding the importance of improperly admitted hearsay. Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s attempt to minimize the importance of the hearsay testimony to the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">To begin with, the majority ignores several key details regarding the facts that it relies on to argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>there was evidence, other than Morgan\u2019s testimony, that corroborated GA\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">First, the majority states that \u201cthe most damaging of this [corroborative] evidence\u201d was Lori\u2019s testimony \u201cthat she walked in to GA\u2019s room at 3:30 a.m. and found defendant kneeling at GA\u2019s bed, with the bedcovers pushed down, <em>touching GA in the leg area.\u201d Ante </em>at 624 (emphasis added). The majority mischaracterizes Lori\u2019s testimony and overlooks a potentially innocent explanation for the evidence that it finds so damning. A full review of the record indicates that Lori testified that defendant stayed up late playing video games with her son on the night that she saw defendant in GA\u2019s room. She also testified that she had told defendant previously that she preferred that GA sleep in her pajamas, but, on that night, she had put GA to bed in her street clothes because GA had fallen asleep in the living room. When Lori confronted defendant about what he was doing in GA\u2019s room, he explained that he had changed GA into her pajamas. Further, while the majority states that Lori saw defendant \u201ctouching GA in the leg area,\u201d the record indicates that what Lori actually testified is that she saw defendant\u2019s hand \u201cbetween [GA\u2019s] knee and feet,\u201d which has much less sinister implications. In light of these details, the corroborative nature of this particular evidence is substantially weakened, along with the majority\u2019s harmless-error conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Second, the majority also ignores several important details surrounding the nurse\u2019s and investigating detective\u2019s testimony. As the majority notes, the nurse testified that GA had a scratch on her labia minora, and the investigating detective testified that defendant\u2019s fingernails were jagged or sharp when he interviewed defendant. Although the majority acknowledges that the nurse testified that the scratch likely occurred in the 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>to 48 hours preceding her examination of GA, it fails to mention that the exam occurred <em>five days after </em>defendant allegedly sexually abused GA. Nor does the majority consider that the nurse testified that the scratch could have resulted from totally innocent behavior, such as a child playing. Furthermore, the nurse\u2019s testimony regarding GA\u2019s description of what had happened to her corroborates at most one instance of sexual abuse. It does not corroborate the testimony related to the other accusation of sexual abuse against defendant. Again, when this particular evidence is considered in context, its corroborative nature is substantially weakened, and the majority\u2019s harmless-error conclusion is further eroded.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The majority also gives insufficient weight to this Court\u2019s caselaw when it concludes that the prejudicial nature of the error was limited because GA testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination, making Morgan\u2019s testimony merely corroborative and cumulative. In making these generalizations, the majority pays lip service to this Court\u2019s warnings that \u201cthe fact that the statement was cumulative, standing alone, does not automatically result in a finding of harmless error,\u201d <em>People v Smith, </em>456 Mich 543, 554; 581 NW2d 654 (1998), and that hearsay evidence may tip the scales against a defendant when a case presents a credibility contest, especially when the declarant is a young child. <em>People v Straight, </em>430 Mich 418, 427-428; 424 NW2d 257 (1988); <em>Smith, </em>456 Mich at 555 n 5. Unfortunately, however, the majority largely fails to heed those warnings in reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">To start with, the utility of cross-examining a seven-year-old girl is debatable. In order to avoid the appearance of bullying a child before the jury, \u201cno defense lawyer will subject a small child to an unnecessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>traumatic courtroom experience,\u201d even at the expense of leaving a possible error in the testimony undiscovered. Christiansen, <em>The testimony of child witnesses: Fact, fantasy, and the influence of pretrial interviews, </em>62 Wash L R 705, 719 (1987). Further, a child \u201cwill adopt false memory as truth and be unable to distinguish the source of what she recalls. The sources of her knowledge are obscured and the possibility of falsehood hidden behind her sincere belief in the truth of her memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This concern is reflected in MRE 803A\u2019s limitations on the admissibility of hearsay statements made by children, which require that a child\u2019s statements be made as soon as practicable after the incident and that the statements be spontaneous and without indication of manufacture. Therefore, given that Morgan\u2019s suggestive questioning occurred before GA testified at trial, cross-examination may have been useless in this case. As a result, the jury may have been \u201cpresented with an unshakably false basis for assessing the weight of her testimony,\u201d and defendant\u2019s felony convictions may have been based on inaccurate information that was impossible to test. <em>Id. </em>at 719-720.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Also, the majority\u2019s reliance on MCL 750.520h to argue that the prosecution in this case did not need to corroborate GA\u2019s testimony is misplaced. The credibility of GA\u2019s testimony was a critical issue because there was little physical evidence in this case. Indeed, as the majority notes, GA\u2019s testimony was the <em>only </em>basis for defendant\u2019s conviction for one of the alleged incidences of abuse. Presumably, the only support for the jury\u2019s finding was its belief that GA was credible, which was unfairly bolstered by the inadmissible hearsay. Therefore, as the majority acknowledges, the prosecution did not need to corroborate GA\u2019s testimony only if we are willing to <em>\u201cassum[e\\ . . . that the jury found her credible.\u201d Ante </em>at 623 n 52 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The fact that GA\u2019s credibility was the key issue is precisely why the error was not harmless: Morgan\u2019s erroneously admitted hearsay testimony strongly bolstered GA\u2019s credibility. Thus, as the majority admits, we are left to assume that even without Morgan\u2019s testimony the jury would have found GA credible. This case simply presents too many unknowns to base multiple serious criminal convictions on a bare assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Furthermore, there are several problems with the majority\u2019s reference to GA\u2019s credibility. First, it inaccurately states that GA\u2019s statements were \u201cconsistent over time.\u201d This ignores that several days after Morgan\u2019s conversation with her, GA made a seemingly inconsistent statement when she asked Lori, \u201cMommy, what if it was a bad dream?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Second, the majority\u2019s statement that it is not commenting on GA\u2019s credibility is incorrect and irrelevant. The majority does comment on the credibility of GA\u2019s testimony when it notes that GA\u2019s statement \u201cremained consistent over time.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 623 n 52. Because the majority must rely on GA\u2019s admittedly inadmissible statement to Morgan to label her statements \u201cconsistent,\u201d the majority only compounds the harm and proves that Morgan\u2019s testimony was critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Third, the majority\u2019s commentary on the credibility of GA\u2019s statements is irrelevant. The question is not whether this Court finds GA credible but whether the inadmissible hearsay unfairly influenced <em>the jury\u2019s </em>ability to determine GA\u2019s credibility. Because it is more probable than not that the hearsay influenced the jury and affected the trial\u2019s outcome, the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s claim, I do not discredit GA\u2019s testimony \u201cin toto.\u201d Rather, I merely note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>children, by no fault of their own, are highly susceptible to influence. On the basis of this widely accepted observation, which the majority accepts, I conclude that the jury\u2019s ability to determine whether it found GA\u2019s testimony credible was unfairly influenced by Morgan\u2019s inadmissible testimony to the point that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Finally, the majority\u2019s attempt to minimize the importance of Morgan\u2019s hearsay testimony to the prosecution\u2019s case is also misleading. <em>Ante </em>at 622 n 50. Simply because the prosecution listed Morgan\u2019s testimony as the \u201cfifth reason\u201d supporting conviction in her closing argument is not evidence that the testimony was not important. The order in which the prosecution presented the supporting evidence in her closing argument is not an indication of the weight that the prosecution or, more importantly, the jury gave the evidence. And, even if the order of presentation did somehow relate to the testimony\u2019s importance, it should be noted that in the first paragraphs of its closing argument, the prosecution stressed that GA\u2019s believability was key to the case. Furthermore, the first sentence of the prosecution\u2019s discussion of Morgan\u2019s testimony during closing argument stressed that Morgan\u2019s testimony \u201ccorroborated everything that [GA] said on the stand .. . .\u201d Similarly, it is irrelevant that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s discussion of Morgan\u2019s testimony accounts for less than <em>21h </em>transcript pages,\u201d given that this is no indication of the weight that the jury gave Morgan\u2019s testimony. Indeed, in <em>People v Snyder, </em>462 Mich 38; 609 NW2d 831 (2000), we remanded for a new trial under the <em>Lukity </em>standard because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling by the trial court that affected the complainant\u2019s credibility. We reasoned that, much like this case, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s case rested almost entirely on the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>complainant,\u201d and the \u201cprosecutor took advantage of the circuit court\u2019s erroneous ruling during her closing argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In summary, defendant\u2019s convictions largely rested on GA\u2019s credibility, and, as the prosecution stressed, Morgan\u2019s corroborating testimony bolstering her credibility was an essential piece of evidence in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, much of the admissible \u201ccorroborating\u201d evidence cited by the majority is less convincing when viewed in context, and the majority\u2019s conclusion that this case was not merely a credibility contest is called into question. Finally, as the majority acknowledges, this Court has held that hearsay evidence is more harmful in credibility contests, particularly when the declarant is a young child. Accordingly, I do not agree with the majority that the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion was harmless error, and I would remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-6\">Kelly, C.J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> Although I remain committed to my <em>Lukity </em>dissent, 460 Mich at 504-510 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting), because I think that defendant is entitled to a new trial even under the higher burden created by the majority in <em>Lukity, </em>I will apply that standard here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> Indeed, the trial court based its decision to deny defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on its belief that \u201c[t]he complainant... has been absolutely consistent with her version of events from the first time she disclosed it [to Morgan] through ... her testimony in court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
