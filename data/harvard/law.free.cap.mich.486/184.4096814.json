We hold that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice, which therefore requires reversal under MCL 769.26.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions under MCL 257.617(3) and MCL 257.625(4) and (8), and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">I. PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Shortly before 2:00 a.m. on July 21, 2005, defendant struck and killed a pedestrian, Kevin Bass, with his car while traveling on Packard Road in Ypsilanti Township in Washtenaw County. At the time of the accident, Packard Road was an unlit, five-lane road, and it was dark outside and raining heavily. Although there was a sidewalk adjacent to Packard Road, the victim was walking down the middle of the road, with his back to oncoming traffic. The victim was extremely intoxicated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>and his blood alcohol content (BAC) was at least 0.268 grams per 100 milliliters of blood. Although defendant initially left the scene of the accident after hitting the victim, he later returned while the police were investigating the incident and was arrested. Defendant\u2019s BAC at the time of the accident was an estimated 0.091 to 0.115 grams per 100 milliliters. There were also 6 nanograms of 11-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-carboxy-THC) per milliliter in defendant\u2019s blood. Defendant was charged with several offenses, including OWI causing death; operating a motor vehicle with the presence of a schedule 1 controlled substance in his body, causing death; and failure to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Before trial, the prosecutor filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence related to the victim\u2019s intoxication. The prosecutor argued that the victim\u2019s intoxication was irrelevant to whether defendant caused the accident or caused the victim\u2019s death. The trial court agreed and suppressed the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">At trial, testimony revealed that defendant had been at two bars earlier that evening. At one bar, defendant was accompanied by Nicole Norman. Norman testified that she and defendant were at the bar from 11 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. At no time did she see defendant smoke marijuana, and defendant did not smell of marijuana. Norman further testified that after they left the bar, defendant drove her to Stephanie Meyers\u2019s house. After picking up Meyers, defendant dropped Norman and Meyers off at Norman\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Meyers testified that she was a passenger in Norman\u2019s car and Norman was driving down Packard Road moments before the accident. Meyers stated that it was pouring outside, and she did not see the victim until he was alongside the driver\u2019s side door. It was then that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Meyers and Norman \u201csnapped [their] necks backwards noticing him...Meyers also recalled that when Norman saw the victim, she stated, \u201cThat man\u2019s going to get killed.\u201d In addition, Norman testified that had she been driving in the lane that the victim was walking in, she probably would not have been able to stop her vehicle in time to avoid hitting him. Defendant was traveling down Packard Koad moments after Norman\u2019s car had passed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Defendant\u2019s accident reconstruction expert found that defendant would have had to have been driving 15 miles per hour to avoid hitting the victim. The prosecution\u2019s accident reconstruction expert agreed with defense counsel that if defendant first saw the victim from 30 feet away, then defendant would have had to have been traveling at a rate of 10 to 15 miles per hour to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Defendant was convicted of failing to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in death; OWI, second offense; and operating a motor vehicle with the presence of a schedule 1 controlled substance in his body, causing death. Defendant appealed, claiming, in relevant part, that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC, that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on proximate cause with respect to the charges of failing to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in death and operating a motor vehicle with a schedule 1 controlled substance, causing death, and that his conviction of operating a motor vehicle, causing death, based on the presence of 11-carboxy-THC in his body violated his due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In a divided decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions. Noting that it is foreseeable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>a pedestrian to be in a roadway, the majority reasoned that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by suppressing the evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC because the victim\u2019s level of \u201cintoxication was not relevant to the critical issue in the proximate cause analysis, which is whether the victim\u2019s death was a foreseeable consequence of defendant\u2019s conduct of driving while intoxicated . ..\" <em>People v Feezel, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 13, 2008 (Docket No. 276959), p 12. Moreover, the majority concluded that the trial court did not err by failing to reinstruct the jurors on proximate causation because proximate causation is not an element of MCL 257.617(3) and any error related to MCL 257.625(8) was harmless. Finally, the majority concluded that defendant\u2019s due process arguments had been rejected by this Court in <em>Derror.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The partial dissent argued that the trial court\u2019s deficient instruction with respect to MCL 257.625(8) and its incorrect evidentiary ruling deprived defendant of a substantial defense and thus denied defendant his right to a fair trial. <em>Feezel, </em>unpub op at 1, 6 (SAAD, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 483 Mich 1001 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">A. THE CAUSATION ELEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The first issue presented in this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC. We hold that, under the facts of this case, the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit the evidence because it was relevant to the element of proximate causation in MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>257.617(3) and MCL 257.625(4) and (8). Moreover, because the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice, it requires reversal under MCL 769.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">1. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">A trial court\u2019s decision to either admit or exclude evidence \u201cwill not be disturbed absent an abuse of... discretion.\u201d <em>People v McDaniel, </em>469 Mich 409, 412; 670 NW2d 659 (2003). A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision falls \u201coutside the range of principled outcomes.\u201d <em>People v Smith, </em>482 Mich 292, 300; 754 NW2d 284 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">If a reviewing court concludes that a trial court erred by excluding evidence, under MCL 769.26 the verdict cannot be reversed \u201cunless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d In examining whether a miscarriage of justice occurred, the relevant inquiry is \u201cthe \u2018effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Straight, </em>430 Mich 418, 427; 424 NW2d 257 (1988), quoting <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750, 764; 66 S Ct 1239; 90 L Ed 1557 (1946). If the evidentiary error is a nonconstitutional, preserved error, then it \u201cis presumed not to be a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears that, more probably than not, it was outcome determinative.\u201d <em>People v Krueger, </em>466 Mich 50, 54; 643 NW2d 223 (2002). An error is \u201coutcome determinative if it undermined the reliability of the verdict\u201d; in making this determination, this Court should \u201cfocus on the nature of the error in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>2. OVERVIEW OF CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Three of the offenses with which defendant was charged contain an element of causation, so the prosecution was required to prove causation beyond a reasonable doubt for each offense. The Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it held otherwise. The plain language of the statutes that prohibit OWI causing death, MCL 257.625(1) and (4), and the statutes that prohibit operating a motor vehicle with the presence of a schedule 1 controlled substance in one\u2019s body, causing death, MCL 257.625(4) and (8), requires that the defendant\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle have <em>caused </em>the death of another person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, the plain language of MCL 257.617(3) contains an element of causation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Specifically, the statute imposes criminal liability if an individual fails to stop \u201cfollowing an accident <em>caused </em>by that individual and the accident results in the death of another....\u201d MCL 257.617(3) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, because the statute specifically requires the prosecution to establish that the accident was \u201ccaused\u201d by the accused, the Court of Appeals ignored the plain language of the MCL 257.617(3) and erred by holding that it does not contain a causation element. Having determined that each of the statutes contains a causation element, we now turn to the definition of the term \u201ccause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In <em>People v Schaefer, </em>we stated that, in the criminal law context, the term \u201c \u2018cause\u2019 has acquired a unique, technical meaning.\u201d <em>People v Schaefer, </em>473 Mich 418, 435; 703 NW2d 774 (2005). Specifically, the term and concept have two parts: factual causation and proximate causation. <em>Id. </em>at 435-436. Factual causation exists if a finder of fact determines that \u201cbut for\u201d defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>conduct the result would not have occurred. <em>Id. </em>A finding of factual causation alone, however, is not sufficient to hold an individual criminally responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 436. The prosecution must also establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of, in this case, the accident or the victim\u2019s death. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Proximate causation \u201cis a legal construct designed to prevent criminal liability from attaching when the result of the defendant\u2019s conduct is viewed as too remote or unnatural.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the finder of fact determines that an intervening cause supersedes a defendant\u2019s conduct \u201csuch that the causal link between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the victim\u2019s injury was broken,\u201d proximate cause is lacking and criminal liability cannot be imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 436-437. Whether an intervening cause supersedes a defendant\u2019s conduct is a question of reasonable foreseeability. <em>Id. </em>at 437. Ordinary negligence is considered reasonably foreseeable, and it is thus not a superseding cause that would sever proximate causation. <em>Id. </em>at 437-438. In contrast, \u201cgross negligence\u201d or \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d on the part of a victim is considered sufficient to \u201cbreak the causal chain between the defendant and the victim\u201d because it is not reasonably foreseeable. <em>Id. </em>Gross negligence, however, is more than an enhanced version of ordinary negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 438. \u201cIt means wantonness and disregard of the consequences which may ensue....\u201d <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 198; 148 NW 400 (1914).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cWantonness\u201d is defined as \u201c[c]onduct indicating that the actor is aware of the risks but indifferent to the results\u201d and usually \u201csuggests a greater degree of culpability than recklessness . . . Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed). Therefore, while a victim\u2019s negligence is not a defense, it is an important factor to be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether proximate cause has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>People v Campbell, </em>237 Mich 424, 430-431; 212 NW 97 (1927).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">3. SUPPRESSION OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">We must examine whether, in this case, the victim\u2019s BAC was a relevant and admissible fact for the jury\u2019s consideration when determining whether the prima facie element of proximate causation was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold that it was. However, we caution that trial courts must make a threshold determination that there is a jury-submissible question of fact regarding gross negligence before such evidence becomes relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Under the Michigan Rules of Evidence, evidence is admissible only if it is relevant as defined by MRE 401 and is not otherwise excluded under MRE 403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>People v Crawford, </em>458 Mich 376, 388; 582 NW2d 785 (1998), we explained that \u201c[p]ursuant to MRE 401, evidence is relevant if two components are present, materiality and probative value.\u201d \u201cMateriality is the requirement that the proffered evidence be related to \u2018any fact that is of consequence\u2019 to the action.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting MRE 401. This Court has stated that \u201c[because the prosecution must carry the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, .. . the elements of the offense are always \u2018in issue\u2019 and, thus, material.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>458 Mich at 389. When examining whether the proffered evidence is probative, a court considers whether the \u201cevidence tends \u2018to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]he threshold is minimal: \u2018any\u2019 tendency is sufficient probative force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389-390 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Moreover, MRE 403 excludes evidence, even if relevant, only if its probative value is \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Thus, MRE 403 \u201cdoes not prohibit prejudicial evidence; only evidence that is unfairly so.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>458 Mich at 398. Further, \u201c[ejvidence is unfairly prejudicial when there exists a danger that <em>marginally </em>probative evidence will be given undue or preemptive weight by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Under these rules of evidence, a court must make a threshold determination in cases such as this of whether evidence of the victim\u2019s intoxication is relevant to the element of proximate causation. If the evidence is relevant, a court must also determine whether the evidence is nevertheless inadmissible under MRE 403. We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC was relevant because it was both material and probative. In addition, its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury because the evidence was highly probative of the element of proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">First, the materiality requirement of MRE 401 was met because, as explained earlier, the charges at issue required the prosecution to prove an element of causation beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Crawford, </em>458 Mich at 389. In addition, under the broad definition of \u201cprobative,\u201d evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC must merely have <em>any </em>tendency to make gross negligence on the part of the victim more or less probable. See <em>id. </em>at 389-390. Depending on the facts of a particular case, there may be instances in which a victim\u2019s intoxication is not sufficiently probative, such as when the proofs are insufficient to create a question of fact for the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>about whether the victim was conducting himself or herself in a grossly negligent manner. Generally, the mere fact that a victim was intoxicated at the time a defendant committed a crime is not sufficient to render evidence of the victim\u2019s intoxication admissible. While intoxication may explain why a person acted in a particular manner, being intoxicated, by itself, is not conduct amounting to gross negligence. In this case, however, the victim\u2019s extreme intoxication was highly probative of the issue of gross negligence, and therefore causation, because the victim\u2019s intoxication would have affected his ability to perceive the risks posed by his conduct and diminished his capacity to react to the world around him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, in this case, the proffered superseding cause was the victim\u2019s presence in the middle of the road with his back to traffic at night during a rain storm with a sidewalk nearby. Thus, the proofs were sufficient to create a jury-submissible question about whether the victim was grossly negligent, and the victim\u2019s high level of intoxication would have aided the jury in determining whether the victim acted with \u201cwantonness and a disregard of the consequences which may ensue . . ..\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>182 Mich at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Second, the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. The evidence was not unfairly prejudicial because, as ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>plained earlier, the victim\u2019s high level of intoxication went to the heart of whether the victim was grossly negligent; thus, the evidence was not merely marginally probative, but instead was highly probative of the element of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In addition, the probative value of the evidence was not, as the prosecution argues, substantially outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury. The prosecution\u2019s argument that the admission of evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC would \u201cshift responsibility\u201d from defendant ignores that under the circumstances of this case, the victim\u2019s conduct directly related to the disputed element of proximate causation and, therefore, whether the victim\u2019s actions amounted to ordinary or gross negligence. See, e.g., <em>May v Goulding, </em>365 Mich 143, 148; 111 NW2d 862 (1961) (describing the difference between wanton misconduct and ordinary negligence as \u201c \u2018faults of different hues in the spectrum of human conduct\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). As a result, the probative value of the victim\u2019s high level of intoxication was not <em>substantially </em>outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury because, under the facts of this case, the victim\u2019s BAC was highly probative of the element of proximate causation, which necessarily required the trier of fact to determine whether the victim\u2019s own behavior amounted to a superseding cause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">For all these reasons, we disagree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the evidence was irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>because the \u201cvictim\u2019s intoxication, or lack thereof, does not impact the foreseeability of an intoxicated driver striking a pedestrian in the road.\u201d <em>Feezel, </em>unpub op at 11. While it is true that when a person drives intoxicated it is foreseeable that the person <em>may </em>cause an accident or <em>possibly </em>strike a pedestrian, this general premise ignores the fact that proximate causation must be decided on a case-by-case basis. See <em>Stoll v Laubengayer, </em>174 Mich 701, 705; 140 NW 532 (1913) (stating that \u201c[w]hile this court has never apparently attempted to accurately define the term \u2018proximate cause,\u2019 it has in many cases <em>applied the principle </em>as enunciated in the authorities <em>to the particular facts under </em>consideration\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, this principle is embedded within the concept of proximate causation, which requires the trier of fact to determine whether the victim\u2019s own conduct amounted to a superseding cause. See <em>Schaefer, </em>473 Mich at 438-439 (stating that gross negligence \u201cby <em>the victim </em>.. . will generally be considered a superseding cause\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, to hold defendant criminally responsible, the trier of fact must find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of <em>this </em>victim\u2019s death or of <em>this </em>accident given the particular facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Therefore, while the victim\u2019s intoxication is not a defense, under the facts of this case it should have been a factor for the jury to consider when determining whether the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of the accident, under MCL 257.617(3), or a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death, under MCL 257.625(4) and (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We emphasize, however, that evidence of a victim\u2019s intoxication may not be relevant or admissible in all cases. Indeed, the primary focus in a criminal trial remains on the defendant\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, any level of intoxication on the part of a victim is not automatically relevant, and the mere consumption of alcohol by a victim does not automatically amount to a superseding cause or de facto gross negligence. Instead, under MRE 401, a trial court must determine whether the evidence tends to make the existence of gross negligence more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence and, if relevant, whether the evidence is inadmissible under the balancing test of MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Thus, when determining whether evidence of a victim\u2019s intoxication is admissible, the trial court must make a threshold determination that evidence of the victim\u2019s conduct is sufficiently probative for a proper purpose \u2014 to show gross negligence. In other words, the trial court must determine that the issue of gross negligence is \u201cin issue.\u201d See <em>People v McKinney, </em>410 Mich 413, 418; 301 NW2d 824 (1981). The court may allow the admission of evidence of the victim\u2019s intoxication to aid the jury in determining whether the victim\u2019s actions were grossly negligent only when the proofs are sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury. If a trial court cannot come to the conclusion that a reasonable juror could view the victim\u2019s conduct as demonstrating a wanton disregard of the consequences that may ensue, however, then the evidence of intoxication is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Applying these standards to the facts of this case, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to admit the evidence of the victim\u2019s BAC. In excluding the evidence, the trial court deprived the jury of its ability to consider an important, relevant factor in determining whether the victim was grossly negligent. As a result, the error undermined the reliability of the verdict. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and vacate defendant\u2019s convictions of those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">4. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">To aid the trial court on remand, we note that in this case, the jury instructions, when read as a whole, may have been confusing. In <em>Schaefer, </em>we stated that the term \u201ccause\u201d is \u201ca legal term of art normally not within the common understanding of jurors . . . .\u201d <em>Schaefer, </em>473 Mich at 441. As a result, a jury could not be expected to understand that the term \u201crequired the prosecutor to prove <em>both </em>factual causation and proximate causation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The trial court instructed the jury and gave the jury a written instruction on the term\u2019s unique meaning, but the instruction was buried within the elements of the charge of OWI causing death and not included in the instructions for MCL 257.617(3) and MCL 257.625(4) and (8). Moreover, the instructions for these other charges were separated from the causation instruction by instructions on lesser included offenses and a jury verdict form. Because the potential deprivation of personal rights in criminal cases is extreme and a defendant is \u201centitled to have all the elements of the crime submitted to the jury in a charge which [is] neither erroneous nor misleading,\u201d <em>People v Pepper, </em>389 Mich 317, 322; 206 NW2d 439 (1973), we caution the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>trial court on remand to avoid possible confusion by either reinstructing the jury on causation for each crime that contains a causation element or by referring the jurors back to its earlier causation instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">B. DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION UNDER MCL 257.625(4) AND (8)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The next issue presented in this appeal is whether defendant\u2019s conviction under MCL 257.625(4) and (8) was proper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Derror, </em>a majority of this Court held that 11-carboxy-THC, a byproduct of metabolism created when the body breaks down the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, is a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212 of the Public Health Code. <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 319-320. <em>Derror </em>also clarified <em>Schaefer </em>by holding that in prosecutions involving a violation of MCL 257.625(8), \u201cthe prosecution is not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant knew he or she might be intoxicated\u201d because the section does not require intoxication or impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 334. Thus, because the prosecution need only establish that a defendant had any amount of a schedule 1 controlled substance in his or her body while operating a motor vehicle, under <em>Derror, </em>a person who operates a motor vehicle with the presence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>amount of 11-carboxy-THC in his or her system violates MCL 257.625(8). <em>Id. </em>at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We hold that 11-carboxy-THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212 and, therefore, a person cannot be prosecuted under MCL 257.625(8) for operating a motor vehicle with any amount of 11-carboxy-THC in his or her system. As a result, <em>Derror </em>was wrongly decided, and because the doctrine of stare decisis supports overruling <em>Derror, </em>we overrule <em>Derror </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">1. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND THE RULES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>484 Mich 397, 410; 774 NW2d 1 (2009). The primary goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998). When a statute is ambiguous, judicial construction is appropriate to determine the statute\u2019s meaning. See <em>id. </em>When determining the Legislature\u2019s intent, the \u201c \u2018statutory language is given the reasonable construction that best accomplishes the purpose of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is a well-established rule of statutory construction that provisions of a statute must be construed in light of the other provisions of the statute to carry out the apparent purpose of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 209; 501 NW2d 76 (1993). As a result, \u201cthe entire act must be read, and the interpretation to be given to a particular word in one section arrived at after due consideration of every other section so as to produce, if possible, a harmonious and consistent enactment as a whole.\u201d <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182-183; 189 NW 221 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>2. BACKGROUND: MCL 257.625(8) AND <em>DERROR</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">MCL 257.625(8) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">A person, whether licensed or not, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state if the person has in his or her body <em>any amount of a controlled substance listed in schedule 1 under section 7212 of the public health code, </em>1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7212, or a rule promulgated under that section.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Under \u00a7 7212(l)(c) of the Public Health Code, marijuana is listed as a schedule 1 controlled substance. MCL 333.7212(l)(c). \u201cMarijuana\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201cMarihuana\u201d means all parts of the plant Canabis [sic] sativa L., growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin. It does not include the mature stalks of the plant, fiber produced from the stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of the plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom, fiber, oil or cake, or the sterilized seed of the plant which is incapable of germination. [MCL 333.7106(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">On the basis of these statutes, a majority of this Court concluded in <em>Derror </em>that 11-carboxy-THC is a schedule 1 controlled substance. The majority reasoned that \u201cthe Public Health Code includes within the definition of marijuana every compound and derivative of the plant.. . .\u201d <em>Derror, 475 </em>Mich at 325. After examining several medical dictionaries with diverse definitions, the majority chose the definition of \u201cderivative\u201d that it believed most closely effectuated the Legislature\u2019s intent, which was \u201ca chemical substance related structur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ally to another substance and theoretically derivable from it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327-329 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Applying this definition of \u201cderivative,\u201d the majority concluded that 11-carboxy-THC was included in it because the compound is structurally related to THC. <em>Id. </em>at 329. As a result, the majority concluded that MCL 257.625(8) proscribes driving with <em>any </em>amount of 11-carboxy-THC in a person\u2019s body regardless of whether the person is actually \u201cunder the influence\u201d of marijuana while operating the motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 333-334, 341. That interpretation, however, was contrary to the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">3. 11-CARBOXY-THC IS NOT A SCHEDULE 1 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE BECAUSE IT IS NOT A DERIVATIVE OF MARIJUANA</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Derror </em>was wrongly decided. The <em>Derror </em>majority erred because it interpreted \u201cderivative\u201d by choosing a definition, out of several divergent definitions, that <em>seemed </em>to include 11-carboxy-THC as a derivative when experts were in disagreement about whether 11-carboxy-THC is a derivative. <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 327-328; <em>id. </em>at 350-351 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). More importantly, however, the majority\u2019s interpretation ignored and was inconsistent with other relevant statutory provisions. Specifically, the majority failed to interpret MCL 333.7212 in a manner consistent with federal law, ignored the factors the Legislature indicated should be used to determine whether a substance should be classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance, and ignored the Legislature\u2019s definition of \u201cmarijuana\u201d and the Legislature\u2019s list of schedule 1 controlled substances, which do not contain the term \u201cmetabolite\u201d or the full or any abbreviated name of 11-carboxy-THC. When MCL 333.7212 is interpreted in the context of the statutory scheme, it does not appear that the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ture intended for 11-carboxy-THC to be classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">To begin with, our Legislature has declared that the provisions of the Public Health Code are \u201cintended to be consistent with applicable federal and state law and shall be construed, when necessary, to achieve that consistency.\u201d MCL 333.1111(1). Notably, while Michigan\u2019s definition of marijuana is virtually identical to the relevant portions of the federal definition,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> no federal court has held that 11-carboxy-THC is a controlled substance. Moreover, federal courts have stated that \u201cthe purpose of banning marijuana was to ban the euphoric effects produced by THC.\u201d <em>United States v Sanapaw, </em>366 F3d 492, 495 (CA 7, 2004), citing <em>United States v Walton, </em>168 US App DC 305, 306; 514 F2d 201 (1975) (stating that \u201cthe \u2018hallucinogenic\u2019 or euphoric effects produced by this agent led to the Congressional ban on possession, importation and distribution of marijuana\u201d). An expert in this case, however, agreed that 11-carboxy-THC has no known pharmacological effect. See, also, <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 321, indicating that the experts in that case agreed that 11-carboxy-THC \u201c \u2018itself has no pharmacological effect on the body and its level in the blood correlates poorly, if at all, to an individual\u2019s level of THC-related impairment.\u2019 \u201d (Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tion omitted.) By ignoring federal law, the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Derror </em>ignored our Legislature\u2019s proclamation that the Public Health Code is intended to be consistent with applicable federal law and <em>\u201cshall </em>be construed... to achieve that consistency.\u201d MCL 333.1111(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In addition, in interpreting \u201cderivative\u201d by choosing a definition, out of several divergent definitions, that <em>seemed </em>to include 11-carboxy-THC, the <em>Derror </em>majority ignored other relevant statutory provisions that suggest that 11-carboxy-THC should not be considered a schedule 1 controlled substance. Our Legislature has indicated that the Michigan Board of Pharmacy must include a controlled substance in schedule 1 if \u201cthe substance has high potential for abuse\u201d and has no accepted medical use or lacks accepted safety for use in treatment. MCL 333.7211. In addition, the Legislature has listed other factors to consider when making a determination regarding the classification of a substance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">(a) The actual or relative potential for abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">(b) The scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">(c) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">d) The history and current pattern of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">(e) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">(f) The risk to the public health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(g) The potential of the substance to produce psychic or physiological dependence liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">(h) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this article. [MCL 333.7202.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As the <em>Derror </em>dissent indicated, <em>u[n]one </em>of these factors that are used to determine if a substance should be classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance applies to 11-carboxy-THC.\u201d <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 349 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Indeed, \u201c11-carboxy-THC has <em>no </em>pharmacological effect on a person, and, therefore, it has no potential for abuse or potential to produce dependence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201cit is impossible to take 11-carboxy-THC and make it into THC; therefore, it is not an immediate precursor of a substance already classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, although MCL 333.7202 does not expressly prohibit the inclusion of particular substances in schedule 1, it would be absurd to suggest that 11-carboxy-THC, which fails to meet the criteria of MCL 333.7202, fits within that schedule. By ignoring the statutory provisions that are used to classify a controlled substance, this Court failed to carry out the purpose of the Legislature. <em>Farrington, </em>442 Mich at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In addition, 11-carboxy-THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212(l)(d). Under MCL 333.7212(l)(d), \u201csynthetic equivalents\u201d of various marijuana-related substances are included in schedule 1. \u201cSynthetic substances are substances that were altered, sometimes in minor ways, but that can still have pharmacological effects on a person.\u201d <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 352 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). This definition does not include 11-carboxy-THC, which is a metabolite \u2014 a natural byproduct that is created when a person\u2019s body breaks down THC. <em>Id. </em>at 321 (majority opinion). There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>fore, 11-carboxy-THC is not a \u201csynthetic\u201d substance and, thus, not a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Finally, the definition of \u201cmarijuana,\u201d MCL 333.7106(3), and the Legislature\u2019s list of schedule 1 controlled substances, MCL 333.7212, do not contain the term \u201c11-carboxy-THC\u201d or any equivalent name. Nor do the statutes contain the term \u201cmetabolite.\u201d The Legislature, however, \u201cknows how to use the term \u2018metabolite\u2019 when it wants to.\u201d <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 352 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). In fact, MCL 722.623a requires a person to report suspected child abuse if a newborn infant has any amount of a metabolite of a controlled substance in his or her body. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is a well-known principle that the Legislature is presumed to be aware of, and thus to have considered the effect on, all existing statutes when enacting new laws.\u201d <em>Walen v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>443 Mich 240, 248; 505 NW2d 519 (1993). The Legislature\u2019s decision to exclude the word \u201cmetabolite\u201d from the relevant statutory provisions is further support that the Legislature did not intend that 11-carboxy-THC be classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Therefore, by failing to construe the applicable portions of the Public Health Code to achieve consistency with federal law, and by failing to examine the statute in light of other relevant statutory provisions, the <em>Derror </em>majority failed to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent. We hold that 11-carboxy-THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212 and, therefore, a person cannot be prosecuted under MCL 257.625(8) for operating a motor vehicle with any amount of 11-carboxy-THC in his or her system. Although the <em>Derror </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute was probably unconstitutional, because we hold that 11-carboxy-THC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>is not a schedule 1 controlled substance, defendant\u2019s conviction under MCL 257.625(4) and (8) cannot stand. Thus, we need not address the constitutional issues raised.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">4. THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Deciding to overrule precedent is not a decision that this Court takes lightly. Indeed, this Court should respect precedent and not overrule or modify it unless there is substantial justification for doing so. While <em>\u201cstare decisis </em>is essential to the respect accorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability of the law,\u201d it is \u201cnot a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision[.]\u201d <em>Lawrence v Texas, </em>539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), this Court formally established a test to determine when it is appropriate to depart from stare decisis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, this Court must consider whether the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>vious decision was wrongly decided. <em>Id. </em>at 464. This Court must then apply a three-part test to determine whether the doctrine of stare decisis nonetheless supports upholding the previously decided case. These include (1) whether the decision defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship if the decision were overturned, and (3) whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">As previously explained, <em>Derror </em>was wrongly decided. Applying the three-part <em>Robinson </em>test, we further conclude that the doctrine of stare decisis does not support upholding <em>Derror.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The first factor weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Derror </em>because the decision defies practicable workability given its tremendous potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement based on the \u201cwhims of police and prosecutors.\u201d <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 358-359 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has recognized that a critical aspect of the vagueness doctrine is \u2018 \u201cthe requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, quoting <em>Kolender v Lawson, </em>461 US 352, 358; 103 S Ct 1855; 75 L Ed 2d 903 (1983) (citation omitted). In fact, the Court has stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>when \u201cthe legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit \u2018a standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kolender, </em>461 US at 358 (citation omitted). The <em>Derror </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute, however, allows a person to be prosecuted for driving with <em>any </em>amount of 11-carboxy-THC in the person\u2019s system, even though the metabolite has no pharmacological effects. As a result, a prosecutor could \u201cchoose to charge a person found to have 0.01 nanograms of 11-carboxy-THC in his system\u201d if the prosecutor so desires. <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 359 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). In addition, \u201cwhether a person is deemed to have any amount of 11-carboxy-THC in his system depends on whatever cutoff standard for detection is set by the laboratory doing the testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. As a result, Michigan citizens cannot be sure of what conduct will be deemed criminal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Moreover, in 2008 the people of the state of Michigan legalized the use of marijuana in limited circumstances. The Michigan Medical Marihuana Act declared that \u201cchanging state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill people who have a medical need to use marihuana.\u201d MCL 333.26422(b). Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute in <em>Derror, </em>however, individuals who use marijuana for medicinal purposes will be prohibited from driving long after the person is no longer im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>paired. Indeed, in this case, experts testified that, on average, the metabolite could remain in a person\u2019s blood for 18 hours and in a person\u2019s urine for up to 4 weeks. See, also, <em>Derror, </em>475 Mich at 321-322, and <em>id. </em>at 356 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (stating that 11-carboxy-THC could remain in a person\u2019s blood for a long period after the THC is gone and could remain in a person\u2019s system for weeks after the marijuana was ingested). And if scientific testing develops to \u201cdetect 11-carboxy-THC from marijuana that was ingested one year ago, ten years ago, or 20 years ago, it is ... a crime to drive....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). As a result, \u201clong after any possible impairment from ingesting marijuana has worn off, a person still cannot drive according\u201d to the <em>Derror </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 356. Thus, under <em>Derror, </em>an individual who only has 11-carboxy-THC in his or her system is prohibited from driving and, at the whim of police and prosecutors, can be criminally responsible for choosing to do so even if the person has a minuscule amount of the substance in his or her system. Therefore, the <em>Derror </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute defies practicable workability given its tremendous potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The second <em>Robinson </em>factor also weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Derror </em>because <em>Derror </em>has not become \u201cso embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>everyone\u2019s expectations\u201d that overruling the case would result in \u201csignificant dislocations.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 466. To begin with, the case was recently decided. Moreover, as this Court explained in <em>Robinson, </em>a citizen normally looks to the words of the statute itself when looking for guidance on how to direct his or her actions. <em>Id. </em>at 467. 11-carboxy-THC, however, is not listed anywhere in the statute that lists schedule 1 controlled substances, MCL 333.7212. Indeed, the <em>Derror </em>majority\u2019s conclusion that 11-carboxy-THC is a schedule 1 controlled substance required this Court to examine and choose from widely divergent dictionary definitions and ignored other statutory language that describes when a substance must be placed in schedule 1. See MCL 333.7202 and MCL 333.7211. Because this Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute confounded the legitimate expectations of citizens, it is this Court that \u201chas disrupted the reliance interests].\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Finally, although the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act represented a change in the law that lends some support to the third <em>Robinson </em>factor, overall the first two <em>Robinson </em>factors support overruling <em>Derror. </em>Because this Court cannot adhere to its previous, distorted reading of the statute under the doctrine of stare decisis, we overrule <em>Derror </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We hold that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to admit the evidence of the victim\u2019s intoxication because it was relevant to the issue of causation in MCL 257.617(3) and MCL 257.625(4) and (8). Thus, under the facts of this case, the victim\u2019s BAC should have been a factor for the jury to consider when determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>whether the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of the accident and the victim\u2019s death. Moreover, we hold that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice, requiring reversal under MCL 769.26.

And, as will be discussed, <em>Derror </em>defies practical workability because it encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and federal courts have not interpreted the virtually identical federal definition of \u201cmarijuana\u201d as including 11-carboxy-THC in schedule 1.

The Legislature, furthermore, forbade anyone to operate a motor vehicle with <em>\u201cany </em>amount\u201d of a schedule 1 controlled substance\u2014 such as a derivative of marijuana \u2014 in his or her body.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The decision to overrule <em>Derror </em>and rule that the metabolite 11-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-carboxy-THC) is not a \u201cderivative\u201d of marijuana nullifies this clear legislative intent. In overruling <em>Derror, </em>a majority of justices usurp the role of policymaker from the people and their elected representatives and enact a policy contrary to that articulated in Michigan\u2019s controlled substances statutes. Even worse, because there is undisputed evidence that this defendant had trace amounts of <em>actual tetrahydrocannabinol </em>in his system, a majority of justices have used this case as a vehicle to overrule a decision with which they disagree even though there is plainly no reason to reach this question. This is a type of judicial overreach and activism of the worst kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Accordingly, I dissent from the conclusion that 11-carboxy-THC is not a derivative of marijuana within the meaning of Michigan\u2019s controlled substance laws.

In fact, it merely repeats similar arguments offered by the dissent in <em>Derror. </em>These arguments were unpersuasive when <em>Derror </em>was decided, and they remain unpersuasive today.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">First, the lead opinion claims that the <em>Derror </em>Court \u201cfailed to interpret MCL 333.7212 in a manner consistent with federal law,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as required under MCL 333.1111(1),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because \u201cno federal court has held that 11-carboxy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>THC is a controlled substance.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, \u201cno federal court has specifically <em>excluded </em>11-carboxy-THC from the definition of \u2018marijuana.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>Derror </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of MCL 333.7212 is consistent with federal law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Second, the lead opinion claims that <em>Derror </em>\u201cignored other relevant statutory provisions that suggest that 11-carboxy-THC should not be considered a schedule 1 controlled substance.\u201d In particular, the lead opinion claims that the Michigan Board of Pharmacy is not required to include 11-carboxy-THC in schedule 1 because the substance does not have \u201chigh potential for abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This argument is specious. Although MCL 333.7211 mandates the inclusion of certain substances in schedule 1, \u201c [i]t does not prohibit the inclusion of <em>other </em>substances in schedule l.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the Legislature expressly listed marijuana as a schedule 1 controlled substance. Because 11-carboxy-THC is a derivative of marijuana, it too constitutes a schedule 1 controlled substance,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> regardless of whether it \u201chas high potential for abuse\u201d within the meaning of MCL 333.7211.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Finally, the lead opinion claims that, because the Legislature did not specifically <em>include </em>the terms \u201c11-carboxy-THC\u201d or \u201cmetabolite\u201d in the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, it purposely <em>omitted </em>them from that list. This argument is also specious and misses the entire point of the <em>Derror </em>decision: the Legislature expressly listed marijuana in schedule 1 and then specifically defined \u201cmarijuana\u201d as including its derivatives. The Legislature should not have to draft a statute in the manner of a person wearing a belt and suspenders, by expressly banning every conceivable iteration and by-product of marijuana in order to protect the citizens of Michigan from people who drive with marijuana and marijuana by-products in their systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Because <em>Derror </em>was correctly decided, the decision whether to overrule <em>Derror </em>should end there. However, even if <em>Derror </em>had been wrongly decided, other relevant factors exist that caution against overruling <em>Derror.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Before overruling a wrongly decided precedent, this Court must consider \u201cwhether the decision at issue defies \u2018practical workability,\u2019 whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the questioned decision.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> None of these factors compel overruling <em>Derror.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em>Derror </em>does not defy practical workability merely because of the <em>\u201cpotential </em>for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, the voters\u2019 approval of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> is not, as the lead opinion suggests, relevant to deciding whether to overrule <em>Derror.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To begin with, legalization of the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of marijuana for a limited medical purpose cannot be equated with an intent to allow its lawful consumption in conjunction with driving. The lead opinion\u2019s argument, taken to its logical extreme, suggests that <em>marijuana itself, </em>not just its derivative, 11-earboxy-THC, should no longer be a schedule 1 controlled substance because of its limited legalization by the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act. It is clear that the act operates <em>in harmony with </em>existing controlled substances laws, not <em>in place </em>o/them.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In particular, the act only provides that a <em>\u201cqualifying </em>patient who has been issued and possess a registry identification card shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner ... for the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Notably, the act also prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle \u201cwhile under the influence of marihuana.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Finally, the lead opinion expresses concern that <em>Derror </em>impermissibly prohibits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">those qualified individuals who lawfully use marijuana in accordance with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act... from driving for an undetermined length of time given the potential of 11-carboxy-THC to remain in a person\u2019s system long after the person has consumed marijuana and is no longer impaired. \u201d[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">This concern is a red herring. The act itself provides: \u201cAll other acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act do not apply <em>to the medical use of marihuana as provided for by this act.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, to the extent the act\u2019s prohibition of driving \u201cunder the influence\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>prescribed medical marijuana may be narrower than the statutes at issue in this case and the application of <em>Derror, </em>the people of Michigan have determined that the act supersedes Michigan\u2019s controlled substances laws. Nevertheless, it does so <em>only </em>vis-a-vis prescribed medical marijuana, not in other circumstances, such as those in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s denigration of the reliance interests involved in applying <em>Derror </em>is similarly misguided. Some justices in the majority attach significance to the doctrine of \u201clegislative silence\u201d or \u201cacquiescence.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> But here, the lead opinion\u2019s position appears to be inconsistent with this professed adherence to the doctrine that \u201c [i]f a legislature reenacts a statute without modifying a high court\u2019s practical construction of that statute, that construction is implicitly adopted.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is noteworthy that the Legislature has reenacted MCL 257.625 <em>four times </em>by amending it since this Court decided <em>Derror.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At none of those times did the Legislature amend the provision that forbids a person to operate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>motor vehicle with \u201cany amount of a controlled substance listed in schedule 1 under. . . MCL 333.7212 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Legislature has not amended the list of schedule 1 controlled substances since <em>Derror </em>to exclude metabolites of marijuana or 11-carboxy-THC. Thus, for those in the majority who subscribe to the doctrine of legislative acquiescence, the Legislature\u2019s multiple reenactments and acquiescence have significance and, accordingly, embarrassingly belie the majority\u2019s argument that no reliance interests are involved in overturning <em>Derror.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">III. AS THERE WAS ACTUAL THC IN DEFENDANT\u2019S BLOOD, THERE IS NO NEED TO REACH THE QUESTION WHETHER DERIVATIVES ARE WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Finally, and perhaps most important, the decision to overrule <em>Derror </em>is simply unnecessary in the instant case. Not only did defendant\u2019s blood contain the derivative 11-carboxy-THC, it <em>also contained THC itself. </em>All members of this Court, including those in the majority, agree that having \u201cany amount\u201d of THC in a driver\u2019s bloodstream, however slight, is illegal under this statute. Therefore, in a case in which it is undisputed that defendant violated this statute by virtue of the presence of actual THC, it is unnecessary to review whether 11-carboxy-THC is a schedule 1 controlled substance. Consequently, the decision by a majority of justices to overrule <em>Derror </em>should be seen for what it is: an unnecessary and exceedingly aggressive act to kill a case with which the new majority of this Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In enacting MCL 333.7212, the Legislature made the policy decision to include marijuana \u201cand <em>every ... </em>deriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tive\u201d of marijuana<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> in the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. The Legislature, furthermore, forbade anyone to operate a vehicle with <em>\u201cany </em>amount\u201d of a schedule 1 controlled substance \u2014 such as a derivative of marijuana \u2014 in his or her body.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Derror </em>correctly determined that the metabolite 11-carboxy-THC is a \u201cderivative\u201d of the marijuana. The determination by the majority of justices to overrule <em>Derror </em>is not only ill considered, but also usurps the clear policy choices of the people of Michigan. It is undisputed that there was <em>actual THC </em>in defendant\u2019s bloodstream. Therefore, whether derivatives of THC are also prohibited is not a question that is necessary for this Court to reach <em>in this case. </em>This decision is thus indicative of the new majority\u2019s willfulness to overrule cases with which it disagrees. Accordingly, I vigorously dissent from the decision to overrule <em>Derror.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b305-5\">Corrigan and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\"> <em>People v Derror, </em>475 Mich 316; 715 NW2d 822 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> MCL 333.7106(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> MCL 257.625(8) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\"> MCL 333.7106(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\"> See <em>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary </em>(6th ed), p 3221.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\"> Additionally, the Legislature has included \u201csynthetic equivalents\u201d of THC in schedule 1.
