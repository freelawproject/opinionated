Defendant temporarily possessed a firearm in violation of the felon-in-possession statute but introduced evidence at trial supporting the theory that his violation was justified because he acted in self-defense. The prosecutor did not resist defendant\u2019s argument regarding the availability of self-defense, and the trial court gave a standard self-defense jury instruction. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court also instructed the jury regarding the momentary innocent possession defense to the charge of being a felon in possession. The jury convicted defendant. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the common law affirmative defenses of self-defense and duress are generally available to a defendant charged with being a felon in possession if supported by sufficient evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We originally granted leave to consider whether any of the traditional common law affirmative defenses are available for a charge of felon-in-possession and, if so, whether the defendant has the burden of proving the affirmative defense. We conclude, however, that only the common law affirmative defense of self-defense was properly raised before the trial court. Limiting our analysis to the issue preserved below, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Court of Appeals that self-defense is generally available for a felon-in-possession charge if supported by sufficient evidence. Defendant introduced sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that he violated the felon-in-possession statute but that his violation could be justified because he honestly and reasonably believed that his life was in imminent danger and that it was necessary for him to exercise force to protect himself. Therefore, we hold that self-defense is an available defense under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">We also take this opportunity to reaffirm that the prosecution bears the burden of disproving the common law affirmative defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, we conclude that the Court of Appeals properly ruled that the trial court\u2019s modified jury instruction on the momentary innocent possession defense was erroneous. Because this instructional error more probably than not resulted in a miscarriage of justice, defendant is entitled to a new trial on the felon-in-possession charge. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 result and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">On September 11, 2005, defendant Roberto Marchello Dupree and a female companion attended a birthday party for his brother at the house of defendant\u2019s sister-in-law, Adrian Dupree. Adrian\u2019s 24-year-old niece, Ashley Horton, and Horton\u2019s 24-year-old boyfriend, Damond Reeves, also attended. When the party was ending, defendant and Reeves began quarrelling on the porch. The altercation culminated in defendant shooting Reeves three times. As a result of the altercation, the prosecutor charged defendant with two counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of assault with intent to commit murder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> felonious assault,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> felon-in-possession,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a three-day trial, the jury acquitted defendant of all charges except the felon-in-possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The witnesses gave conflicting testimony at trial about the circumstances surrounding the altercation. Reeves testified that defendant directed an expletive at him and shoved him for no reason. Reeves also testified that he and defendant fought until defendant left the fracas, went inside, and returned with a gun. Reeves stated that defendant shot him three times as he continued wrestling with defendant from the front yard to the street. Although the sequence of events was unclear, Horton testified that when she attempted to intervene, defendant struck her in the face with the gun. She went inside to call the police and heard a shot. Horton returned to the porch and heard a second shot before going back inside, where she heard a third shot. She stated that defendant later entered the house, put the gun to her chin, and pulled the trigger. The gun did not fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">By contrast, defendant and two other bystanders testified that the altercation began when Reeves shoved Adrian Dupree off the porch. Defendant told Reeves not to disrespect his sister-in-law and asked him to leave. Reeves then pushed defendant. The two men fell off the porch and began wrestling. Reeves\u2019s shirt was pulled up, exposing a gun in the waistband of his pants. Defendant testified that he feared for his life because Reeves was larger than defendant, inebriated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>armed. Defendant stated that Reeves went for his gun and that defendant grabbed it to protect himself. As the two men struggled over the gun, defendant shot Reeves three times. Defendant kept the gun until he left with his female companion in her vehicle, throwing the gun out the window after he was some distance from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">During the three-day jury trial, defense counsel argued that defendant had not assaulted Horton, but had acted in self-defense in response to Reeves\u2019s actions. Regarding the felon-in-possession charge, defense counsel asserted that defendant\u2019s temporary possession of the gun was justified because defendant had seized possession of the gun to protect himself during the struggle. Defense counsel requested a standard self-defense jury instruction for all charges. The prosecutor did not object, and the trial court instructed the jury as requested. Additionally, the court instructed the jury sua sponte that it could find defendant not guilty of being a felon in possession if it found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">As to being a felon in possession, [defendant] claims that the gun was produced in a struggle. And of course, if that\u2019s the case that the gun was produced during the course of a struggle and you find that it happened that way, that would be a defense to felon in possession provided you find that he did not keep the gun in his possession any longer than necessary to defend himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Defense counsel objected to the trial court\u2019s instruction, arguing that the court should not have included the phrase \u201cany longer than necessary to defend himself.\u201d The trial court responded that it had crafted the instruction, which it labeled \u201cthe necessity defense to being a felon-in-possession,\u201d from federal law. After further discussion, the court gave defense counsel more time to locate legal authority to substantiate the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>When defense counsel failed to locate any legal authority invalidating the instruction, the prosecutor suggested that the trial court provide an instruction on the momentary innocent possession defense to carrying a concealed weapon then under consideration by this Court in <em>People v Hernandez-Garcia, </em>477 Mich 1039 (2007).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected. The court overruled the objection and reinstructed the jury concerning the momentary innocent possession defense to being a felon in possession as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">And if the person had a brief or momentary possession of the weapon based on necessity, that\u2019s a defense to being a felon in possession. And the elements to that are that the defendant had the gun because he had taken it from someone else who was in wrongful possession of it, or he took it from him because of necessity, because he needed to. Second, that the possession after taking the gun was brief. <em>And third, that it was the defendant\u2019s intention to deliver the gun to the police at the earliest possible time. </em>The law imposes that duty as a concomitant part of that. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The trial court stated that the modified instruction replaced its prior instruction regarding \u201cthe necessity defense.\u201d Subsequently, the jury acquitted defendant of all felony charges except the felon-in-possession charge. The court sentenced defendant to serve a term of 48 months\u2019 to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment as a fourth-offense habitual offender.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The majority concluded that defendant had not waived his claim of instructional error and that the common law affirmative defenses of self-defense and duress are generally available for felon-in-possession charges. The Court adopted the term \u201cjustification\u201d to describe the affirmative defense under which \u201ca defendant might be justified in temporarily possessing a firearm \u2014 even though the possession is unlawful \u2014 if the possession is immediately necessary to protect the defendant or another from serious bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Using the elements of common law duress as its basis, the lead opinion listed five elements that would allow a defendant to raise a justification defense to a felon-in-possession charge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court held that each of the five elements had been established in this case and that the instructional error was not harmless because the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>modified jury instruction effectively directed a guilty verdict on the felon-in-possession charge. The dissenting Court of Appeals judge disagreed, concluding that the instructional error was harmless and that the evidence did not support a jury instruction on the justification defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The prosecution then applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted the application and directed the parties to address whether any of the traditional common law affirmative defenses of self-defense, necessity, or duress are available for the charge of being a felon in possession, MCL 750.224\u00cd, and, if so, whether the defendant has the burden of proof to establish the defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Whether common law affirmative defenses are available for a statutory crime and, if so, where the burden of proof lies are questions of law. This Court reviews questions of law de novo. <em>People v Thompson, </em>477 Mich 146, 151; 730 NW2d 708 (2007). We review a claim of instructional error involving a question of law de novo, but we review the trial court\u2019s determination that a jury instruction applies to the facts of the case for an abuse of discretion. <em>People v Gillis, </em>474 Mich 105, 113; 712 NW2d 419 (2006). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that the asserted instructional error resulted in a miscarriage of justice. MCL 769.26; <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484, 493-494; 596 NW2d 607 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The preliminary issue in this case is whether the prosecution or defendant properly raised and preserved the traditional common law affirmative defenses of self-defense and duress before the trial court. Although the Court of Appeals analyzed the availability of both affirmative defenses in its decision and the parties addressed both defenses in their arguments before this Court, our review is necessarily limited by the specific issue preserved below. We have \u201clong recognized the importance of preserving issues for the purpose of appellate review.\u201d <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 546; 520 NW2d 123 (1994); see also <em>People v Brott, </em>163 Mich 150, 152; 128 NW 236 (1910) (\u201cThis court has often held that it will not review questions that have not been raised in the trial court, and such is the rule according to the great weight of authority.\u201d). In accordance with the general rule of issue preservation, \u201cissues that are not properly raised before a trial court cannot be raised on appeal absent compelling or extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Grant, </em>445 Mich at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that neither defendant nor the prosecution properly raised the affirmative defense of duress before the trial court. Defendant did not present evidence that pertained to the affirmative defense of duress or otherwise assert its availability for the charge of felon-in-possession. Similarly, the prosecution failed to interpose any issue concerning duress or its attendant burden of proof at trial. It appears that defendant first injected the issue of duress in the Court of Appeals. The prosecution seized on the issue in this Court, discussing duress extensively in its brief and at oral argument. In light of these facts, we cannot conclude that the parties preserved the issue of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>However, we conclude that defendant properly raised the common law affirmative defense of self-defense before the trial court. Defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that he did not assault Horton, but acted in self-defense in response to Reeves\u2019s actions. Defendant introduced testimony to support his self-defense theory at trial, which the prosecutor attempted to discredit. Further, defendant requested a standard self-defense jury instruction for all charges. The prosecutor did not object to defendant\u2019s request for a self-defense jury instruction. Consequently, we agree with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it concluded that self-defense is generally available for a felon-in-possession charge because defendant preserved the issue of self-defense for appellate review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The felon-in-possession statute, MCL 750.224f, places defendants in two distinct categories. <em>People v </em>Perkins, 473 Mich 626, 630; 703 NW2d 448 (2005).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statutory prohibition is identical for defendants in either category. MCL 750.224f provides that both cat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>egories of defendants \u201cshall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in this state\u201d until a series of requirements is fulfilled. The statute does not address the availability of common law affirmative defenses, including self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The Legislature\u2019s failure to provide explicitly for the common law affirmative defense of self-defense does not foreclose defendants from relying on it to justify a violation of MCL 750.224f. It is axiomatic that the common law affirmative defense of self-defense is embedded in our criminal jurisprudence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Historically, in cases in which the statutory provision did not squarely resolve the issue before this Court, we have applied the common law, presuming that the Legislature enacted statutes mindful of those aspects of common law that have become \u201cfirmly embedded in our jurisprudence . .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> More recently, the United States Supreme Court recognized the interrelated nature of criminal statutes and the common law, stating that legislative bodies enact criminal statutes \u201cagainst a background of Anglo-Saxon common law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We find this rationale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>instructive. Absent some clear indication that the Legislature abrogated or modified the traditional common law affirmative defense of self-defense for the felon-in-possession charge in MCL 750.224f or elsewhere in the Michigan Penal Code, we presume that the affirmative defense of self-defense remains available to defendants if supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AXt\">Our conclusion that self-defense remains an available defense is reinforced by our canvass of authorities elsewhere. Among the states that have addressed whether self-defense is an available defense to a statutory prohibition against felons possessing firearms, most other jurisdictions have concluded that self-defense is an available defense. The Tennessee Supreme Court, for example, acknowledged the availability of self-defense as one potential affirmative defense to the charge of being a felon in possession. See <em>State v Bledsoe, </em>226 SW3d 349, 357 n 7 (Tenn, 2007). Similarly, the Indiana Court of Appeals concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">Indiana\u2019s prohibition against a felon possessing a firearm was not intended to affect his or her right to use a firearm in self-defense, but was intended only to prohibit members of the affected classes from arming themselves with firearms or having such weapons in their custody or control in circumstances other than those in which the right to use deadly force in self-defense exists or reasonably appears to exists. <em>[Harmon v State, </em>849 NE2d 726, 734 (Ind App, 2006).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The Minnesota Supreme Court also recognized the availability of self-defense for the charge of felon-in-possession but stated that \u201cthe closer questions are whether the defendant, even if justified in wresting the gun away from [a dangerous aggressor], continued his aggression beyond the limits of self-defense or his possession of the pistol beyond justifiable possession.\u201d <em>State v Spaulding, </em>296 NW2d 870, 876 (Minn, 1980). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>We agree with the weight of authority from our sister jurisdictions that self-defense is an available defense to the charge of being a felon in possession if supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">At common law, the affirmative defense of self-defense justifies otherwise punishable criminal conduct, usually the killing of another person, \u201cif the defendant honestly and reasonably believes his life is in imminent danger or that there is a threat of serious bodily harm and that it is necessary to exercise deadly force to prevent such harm to himself.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Generally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">[o]ne who is not the aggressor in an encounter is justified in using a reasonable amount of force against his adversary when he reasonably believes (a) that he is in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from his adversary and (b) that the use of such force is necessary to avoid this danger.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\u201cA finding that a defendant acted in justifiable self-defense necessarily requires a finding that the defendant acted intentionally, but that the circumstances justified his actions.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Professor LaFave articulated the rationale of the affirmative defense of self-defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">It is only just that one who is unlawfully attacked by another, and who has no opportunity to resort to the law for his defense, should be able to take reasonable steps to defend himself from physical harm. When the steps he takes are reasonable, he has a complete defense to such crimes against the person as murder and manslaughter, attempted murder, assault and battery and the aggravated forms of assault and battery, and perhaps other crimes as well. His intentional infliction of (or, if he misses, his attempt to inflict) physical harm upon the other, or his threat to inflict such harm, is said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>to be justified when he acts in proper self-defense, so that he is not guilty of any crime.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">With the enactment of the Self-Defense Act (SDA), MCL 780.971 <em>et seq., </em>the Legislature codified the circumstances in which a person may use deadly force in self-defense or in defense of another person without having the duty to retreat.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, the SDA did not become effective until October 1, 2006, and the altercation in this case occurred on September 11, 2005. Because the SDA does not retroactively apply to conduct that occurred before its effective date,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the traditional common law affirmative defense of self-defense in existence before the enactment of the SDA governs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In this case, sufficient evidence supported a jury instruction on the common law affirmative defense of self-defense. As the Court of Appeals succinctly observed, \u201c[defendant] presented evidence from which a jury could find \u2014 and apparently did find \u2014 that he acted in self-defense when he struggled over the gun with Reeves and ultimately shot Reeves three times.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We agree that defendant introduced evidence from which a jury could conclude that defendant\u2019s criminal possession of the firearm was justified because defendant honestly and reasonably believed that his life was in imminent danger and that it was necessary for him to exercise force to protect himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Defendant testified that when he intervened after Reeves shoved defendant\u2019s sister-in-law off the porch, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Reeves responded by grabbing defendant and pulling him off the porch. Defendant stated that as he and Reeves continued wrestling, he became aware that Reeves had a gun. Further, defendant testified that he feared for his life because Reeves was a large man, weighing approximately 300 pounds, and because Reeves was intoxicated and armed. Defendant also testified that he and Reeves continued struggling over the gun even after he shot Reeves three times. Defendant stated that he repeatedly told Reeves \u201cJust stop\u201d and \u201cLet me go\u201d after Reeves said \u201cI\u2019m hit.\u201d Additionally, defendant testified that he retained possession of the gun after he and Reeves separated and that he threw the gun from the window of his female companion\u2019s vehicle once they had driven some distance from the house. However, the testimony is unclear whether Reeves remained in the vicinity of the house before defendant left the scene with his female companion. The record is similarly unclear concerning at what point Reeves no longer posed a threat to defendant, particularly because the testimony suggests that Reeves continued to challenge defendant for possession of the gun even after he had been shot three times. Under these facts, defendant introduced sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant violated the felon-in-possession statute but that his violation could be justified because he acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Having concluded that the common law affirmative defense of self-defense may be interposed in this felon-in-possession case, we also conclude that the prosecution bears the burden of disproving the common law defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Stated another way, once the defendant injects the issue of self-defense and satisfies the initial burden of producing some evidence from which a jury could conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>that the elements necessary to establish a prima facie defense of self-defense exist, the prosecution bears the burden of proof \u201c \u2018to exclude the possibility that the killing was done in self-defense . .. \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This allocation of the burden of proof is well settled in this Court<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We discern no cogent reason to disrupt the established burden of proof. Accordingly, we reaffirm that once the defendant satisfies the initial burden of production, the prosecution bears the burden of disproving the common law defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Finally, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on the momentary innocent possession defense was not harmless error. Defendant, therefore, is entitled to a new trial on the felon-in-possession charge. Under MCL 769.26, a preserved nonconstitutional error is not grounds for reversal unless, after an examination of the entire cause, it affirmatively appears that it is more probable than not that the asserted error was outcome determinative.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In this case, after instructing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the jury sua sponte about \u201cthe necessity defense\u201d to being a felon in possession from federal law, the trial court rescinded that instruction and gave the jury a modified instruction on the now defunct momentary innocent possession defense.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jury that it could find defendant not guilty of being a felon in possession if the jury found the following elements of the momentary innocent possession defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\">And the elements to that are [first] that the defendant had the gun because he had taken it from someone else who was in wrongful possession of it, or he took it from him because of necessity, because he needed to. Second, that the possession after taking the gun was brief. <em>And third, that it was the defendant\u2019s intention to deliver the gun to the police at the earliest possible time. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The trial court clarified that this instruction replaced its prior instruction regarding \u201cthe necessity defense\u201d to being a felon in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The Court of Appeals majority correctly ruled that the modified jury instruction was not harmless. We presume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Under the trial court\u2019s modified instruction on the momentary innocent possession defense, the jury had no alternative but to find defendant guilty of being a felon in possession because defendant proffered no evidence that he intended \u201cto deliver the gun to the police at the earliest possible time.\u201d To the contrary, defendant testified that he threw the gun from the window of his female companion\u2019s vehicle after he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>some distance from the house. As a result, the modified jury instruction wholly negated defendant\u2019s theory of the case in regard to the felon-in-possession charge, namely that his temporary possession of the gun was justified under the circumstances because defendant had seized possession to protect himself during a struggle. \u201cA criminal defendant is entitled to have a properly instructed jury consider the evidence against him.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Defendant did not have a properly instructed jury in this regard. After examining the nature of the instructional error in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence, it affirmatively appears more probable than not that the error was outcome determinative. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to a new trial on the felon-in-possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Having necessarily limited our analysis to the specific issue properly raised and preserved before the trial court, we conclude that the traditional common law affirmative defense of self-defense is generally available to a defendant charged with being a felon in possession if supported by sufficient evidence. We also conclude that self-defense was available under the facts of this case. Once a defendant satisfies the initial burden of producing some evidence from which a jury could conclude that the elements necessary to establish a prima facie defense of self-defense exist, the prosecution bears the burden of disproving the affirmative defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, we hold that the trial court\u2019s modified jury instruction on the momentary innocent possession defense to being a felon in possession was not harmless error.

I agree that common-law self defense is a valid defense to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, MCL 750.224f. I also agree that once a defendant properly raises the defense, the prosecution bears the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, I agree that the trial court\u2019s erroneous jury instruction was not harmless error. I write separately because I disagree that the affirmative defense of duress is not properly before this Court. Indeed, the record belies the majority\u2019s claim that \u201c[d]efendant did not present evidence that pertained to the affirmative defense of duress ....\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">To properly raise a duress defense, the defendant bears the burden of producing \u201c \u2018some evidence from which the jury can conclude that the essential elements of duress are present.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Lemons, </em>454 Mich 234, 246; 562 NW2d 447 (1997) (citation omitted). To satisfy the burden of production, a defendant must produce some evidence from which the jury could conclude the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">\u201cA) The threatening conduct was sufficient to create in the mind of a reasonable person the fear of death or serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201cB) The conduct in fact caused such fear of death or serious bodily harm in the mind of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">\u201cQ The fear or duress was operating upon the mind of the defendant at the time of the alleged act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u201cD) The defendant committed the act to avoid the threatened harm.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 247 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">I agree with the Court of Appeals concurrence that \u201c [although defendant in the instant case labeled his defense \u2018self-defense\u2019 rather than \u2018duress,\u2019 he unquestionably presented to the jury a scenario entirely consistent with a classic duress defense.\u201d <em>People v Dupree, </em>284 Mich App 89, 113; 771 NW2d 470 (2009) (GLEICHER, J., concurring). As the majority acknowledges, defendant testified that Damond Reeves, a 300-pound, highly inebriated man with a gun, pushed defendant and then began wrestling with him. During the struggle, defendant became aware that Reeves possessed a gun, and defendant testified that he feared for his life. Defendant also testified that Reeves reached for his gun during the struggle and that he shot Reeves as they struggled over the gun. Finally, defendant testified that Reeves continued to attempt to take the gun from defendant even after defendant shot Reeves three times, despite the fact that defendant repeatedly told Reeves to \u201cJust stop\u201d and \u201cLet me go.\u201d In my view, this account is a textbook example of a factual scenario from which a jury could conclude that the essential elements of duress were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Furthermore, I agree with the Court of Appeals concurrence that the trial court essentially instructed the jury on the duress defense when the court stated the following in its initial jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\u201cAs to being a felon in possession, [Dupree] claims that the gun was produced in a struggle. And of course, if that\u2019s the case that the gun was produced during the course of a struggle and you find that it happened that way, that would be a defense to felon in possession provided you find that he did not keep the gun in his possession any longer than necessary to defend himself.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the issues related to the duress defense are not properly before this Court. I nonetheless concur because the result is the same given that the majority correctly holds that defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b793-4\">Kelly, C.J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
