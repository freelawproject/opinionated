In deciding the issue, we must also determine what constitutes the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence referred to in MCL 750.520f(l), which requires a minimum sentence of \u201cat least 5 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Azz\">Defendant contends that the statute\u2019s mandate is simply 5 years, whereas the prosecution contends that the statute mandates any minimum sentence of 5 years or more. If we accept defendant\u2019s argument, his 10-year minimum sentence was a departure from the guidelines recommendation and he is entitled to resentencing. The trial court did not provide substantial and compelling reasons justifying a departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we agree with the prosecution, defendant\u2019s 10-year minimum sentence was not a departure because the Legislature has explicitly stated that a mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals agreed with the prosecution, concluding that \u201c[bjecause defendant\u2019s 10-year minimum sentence is \u2018at least\u2019 five years, it satisfies the requirements of [MCL 750.520f].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We conclude that the guidelines apply to defendant\u2019s sentence and that the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence in MCL 750.520f(l) is a flat 5-year term. Because the trial court imposed a 10-year minimum sentence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>exceeded both the applicable guidelines range and the 5-year mandatory minimum, defendant\u2019s sentence was a departure from the guidelines. However, the trial court did not state substantial and compelling reasons justifying a departure, let alone any reasons justifying the particular departure made. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Larry Wilcox was charged with first-degree CSC. The felony information notified him that he faced an enhanced sentence under MCL 750.520f as a repeat CSC offender and under MCL 769.10 as a second-offense habitual offender. At trial, the prosecutor introduced two documents into evidence in support of the repeat offender enhancements. They established that defendant had been convicted of second-degree CSC<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The jury convicted defendant as charged. His sentencing information report calculated the applicable guidelines minimum sentence range as 27 to 56 months. After acknowledging that MCL 750.520\u00cd applied, the trial judge imposed a sentence of 10 to 40 years. The judge did not indicate that the 120-month minimum sentence was a departure from the guidelines range and did not provide a substantial and compelling reason for departing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Defendant appealed as of right. The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence in a published opinion. The panel summarily dismissed his argument that the sentence improperly exceeded both the sentencing guidelines range and the 5-year mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>minimum sentence established by MCL 750.520f(l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The panel further opined that defendant\u2019s sentence was not a departure from the guidelines, implicitly concluding that the guidelines were inapplicable because defendant had been sentenced under MCL 750.520f.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether the sentencing guidelines applied to the sentence and, if so, whether defendant is entitled to resentencing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">We review issues of statutory interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our primary goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first step in ascertaining intent is to focus on the language of the statute. If the language is unambiguous, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning expressed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Resolution of the issue in this case depends on how the statutes discussing the application of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>guidelines interact with MCL 750.520f. MCL 769.34(2) describes the offenses to which the sentencing guidelines apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or for a departure from the appropriate minimum sentence range provided for under subsection (3), the minimum sentence imposed by a court of this state for a felony enumerated in part 2 of chapter XVII committed on or after January 1, 1999 shall be within the appropriate sentence range under the version of those sentencing guidelines in effect on the date the crime was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Thus, the sentencing guidelines apply to felonies enumerated in part 2 of chapter XVII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, MCL 777.11 through 777.19, committed on or after January 1, 1999, except as otherwise provided in MCL 769.34(2). Defendant was convicted of first-degree CSC,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which is a felony enumerated in MCL 777.16y. It is undisputed that he committed the offense after January 1, 1999. Therefore, the sentencing guidelines apply to his sentence absent an exception elsewhere in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">MCL 769.34(2) does provide exceptions to the applicability of the sentencing guidelines. MCL 769.34(2)(a) contains the exception at issue here. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\"><em>If a statute mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall impose sentence in accordance with that statute. Imposing a mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section. </em>If a statute mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections and the statute authorizes the sentencing judge to depart from that minimum sentence, imposing a sentence that exceeds the recommended sentence range but is less than the manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>tory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section. If the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections and the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, authorizes the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is less than that minimum sentence, imposing a sentence that exceeds the recommended sentence range but is less than the mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The parties do not dispute that MCL 750.520f provides for a mandatory minimum sentence, putting it within the purview of MCL 769.34(2)(a). MCL 750.520f(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">If a person is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under [MCL 750.520b, 750.520c, or 750.520d], the sentence imposed under those sections for the second or subsequent offense <em>shall provide for a mandatory minimum sentence of at least 5 years. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The dispositive question is whether the mandatory minimum sentence established by MCL 750.520f(l) is \u201cat least 5 years\u201d or simply a flat 5-year minimum sentence. Defendant contends that the 5-year minimum is the only sentence that is mandatory and that any sentence above 5 years is permissive. Therefore, defendant argues, any minimum sentence exceeding 5 years is permissible rather than mandated; as a consequence, it is governed by the guidelines. Defendant states that, if the minimum sentence exceeds the range set by the guidelines, it must be justified by substantial and compelling reasons. Because his 10-year minimum sentence exceeded both the 5-year mandatory minimum and the applicable guidelines range, defendant argues that his sentence constituted a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The prosecution counters that the words \u201cat least\u201d indicate a legislative intent that any minimum sentence imposed under MCL 750.520f may exceed 5 years, regardless of the guidelines range. Therefore, the prosecution argues, any minimum sentence imposed on a repeat CSC offender under MCL 750.520f is limited only by the \u201ctwo-thirds rule\u201d contained in MCL 769.34(2)(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because defendant\u2019s 10-year minimum is \u201cat least 5 years\u201d and does not exceed two-thirds of the maximum sentence imposed (40 years), the prosecution concludes that the sentence complied with MCL 769.34(2)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We reject the prosecution\u2019s argument. The use of the words \u201cat least\u201d in MCL 750.520f(l) does not grant trial courts the discretion to impose minimum sentences that are subject only to the limitation of the two-thirds rule. Such an interpretation is inconsistent with MCL 769.34(2)(a). Also, it is contrary to a central purpose of the sentencing guidelines \u2014 greater uniformity in sentencing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The first sentence of MCL 769.34(2)(a) provides that, if a statute mandates a minimum sentence, \u201cthe court shall impose sentence in accordance with that statute.\u201d The next sentence states that imposing a mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure from the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ing guidelines. The difference in the language of the two sentences is of critical importance. The first states that, when a statute like MCL 750.520f provides for a mandatory minimum sentence, the court must impose a sentence \u201cin accordance with\u201d the statute. This wording provides for a sentence that merely conforms with, but is not necessarily compelled by, the statute at issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because it is \u201cat least 5 years,\u201d defendant\u2019s 10-year minimum sentence is unquestionably in accordance with MCL 750.520f.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">By contrast, the second sentence of MCL 769.34(2)(a) lacks the broad wording \u201cin accordance with\u201d that is present in the first sentence. It provides only that \u201c[i]mposing a mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure\u201d from the sentencing guidelines. This linguistic distinction is critical because, given the statute\u2019s language, only the mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure from the guidelines. Notably, the statute does not specify that a sentence imposed \u201cin accordance with\u201d a statute providing a mandatory minimum sentence is \u201cnot a departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Therefore, the proper interpretation of these statutes hinges on the extent to which MCL 750.520f(l) is \u201cmandatory,\u201d so that a sentence compelled by it is not a departure under MCL 769.34(2)(a). One definition of \u201cmandatory\u201d is \u201cauthoritatively ordered; obligatory.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cMandatory\u201d and, in particular, \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d are also legal terms of art. As such, reference to a legal dictionary is appropriate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cmandatory\u201d as \u201c[o]f, relating to, or constituting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>command; required; preemptory.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although Black\u2019s contains no definition for \u201cmandatory minimum,\u201d it defines \u201cmandatory sentence\u201d as \u201c[a] sentence set by law with no discretion for the judge to individualize punishment.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Applying these definitions to MCL 750.520f(l), we must conclude that the only minimum that is \u201cmandatory\u201d in the statute is 5 years. Five years is the only minimum sentence in MCL 750.520f(l) that is \u201cset by law with no discretion for the judge to individualize punishment.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> By contrast, the words \u201cat least\u201d are permissive. They authorize a higher minimum sentence, such as the 10-year minimum imposed here, but nothing in the statute mandates that the minimum sentence exceed 5 years. Although MCL 750.520f(l) authorizes a minimum sentence in excess of 5 years, it does not mandate it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The prosecution argues that this interpretation of the statute renders nugatory the words \u201cat least.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree. The use of \u201cat least\u201d in MCL 750.520f(l) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>authorizes courts to impose minimum sentences of 5 years or more. However, because only 5 years is mandatory, MCL 769.34(2)(a) exempts only a 5-year minimum sentence from the departure provision in MCL 769.34(3). Hence, if a minimum sentence under MCL 750.520f(l) exceeds 5 years and is higher than the top of the applicable guidelines range, it constitutes a departure. The judge must articulate substantial and compelling reasons for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The language \u201cat least\u201d in MCL 750.520f(l) is not in the least rendered nugatory under this analysis. In fact, it comes into play often. Any offender convicted of a repeat CSC offense whose guidelines range exceeds 5 years may properly receive a minimum sentence of \u201cat least 5 years.\u201d For example, a repeat CSC offender whose guidelines range is 180 to 240 months may properly receive a 200-month minimum sentence. Such a sentence would be permissible because it meets the mandatory provision of MCL 750.520f(l) in that it is not less than 5 years. The additional 140 months in excess of 5 years also complies with MCL 769.34(2) because the sentence is within the applicable guidelines range.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Moreover, to accept the prosecution\u2019s interpretation would undermine the legislative intent behind the sentencing guidelines statutes and potentially lead to arbitrary sentencing. Allowing trial courts to ignore the guidelines when imposing a sentence under MCL 750.520f could lead to similarly situated defendants receiving wholly disparate sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>For example, under the prosecution\u2019s interpretation, a repeat CSC offender like defendant, whose guidelines range contemplates a relatively low minimum sentence, could nevertheless receive a 60- to 90-year sentence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such a harsh minimum sentence would not require that the trial court give substantial and compelling reasons justifying the disparity between the guidelines range and the actual minimum sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">By contrast, a recidivist offender subject to a guidelines range that far exceeds the 5-year mandatory minimum could receive a sentence far below the guidelines range. The trial court could impose the 5-year minimum without being required to provide a justification for the downward departure.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>dant in question could be subject to a guidelines range contemplating, for example, at least a 20-year minimum term. Given the Legislature\u2019s stated goal in enacting the guidelines of promoting uniformity in sentencing, we believe that this is not a result that the Legislature contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines minimum sentence range was 27 to 56 months. Under MCL 750.520f(l), the trial court was required to impose a minimum sentence of \u201cat least 5 years.\u201d However, because 5 years is the only truly minimum sentence that is mandatory under MCL 750.520f(l), any minimum sentence exceeding 5 years must fall within the applicable guidelines range. Otherwise, the sentence would not be \u201ca mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d It would constitute a departure from the sentencing guidelines, and the court would have to articulate substantial and compelling reasons for the extent of its departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The trial court\u2019s 10-year minimum sentence in this case constituted an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines. The court did not articulate substantial and compelling reasons for the extent of its departure. Accordingly, defendant is entitled to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We hold that the legislative sentencing guidelines apply to minimum sentences in excess of 5 years that are imposed under MCL 750.520\u00cd. We further hold that, for purposes of applying MCL 769.34(2)(a), the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence referred to in MCL 750.520f(l) is a flat 5-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Here, the trial court imposed a 10-year minimum sentence that exceeded both the applicable guidelines minimum sentence range and the 5-year mandatory minimum.

A 5-year minimum sentence for a defendant with a guidelines range of 7 to 10 years would indeed constitute a downward departure under MCL 769.34(2)(a). When the lower end of the guidelines range is 5 years or greater, a trial court that imposes a sentence of 5 years or more is no longer imposing a \u201cmandatory\u201d minimum. Rather, the court is merely imposing a sentence, as required by MCL 769.34(2)(a), that is \u201cin accordance with\u201d MCL 750.520f(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">By contrast, the 5-year minimum is \u201cmandatory\u201d when the guidelines range tops out below 5 years. In those circumstances, a 5-year sentence is truly the mandatory minimum sentence, so it is not a departure. It is hardly inconsistent to conclude that a 5-year sentence is no longer mandatory when a defendant\u2019s guidelines range expressly contemplates a higher minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The dissent cites several criminal statutes that provide for indeterminate mandatory minimum sentences, using language such as \u201cnot less than [X] years.\u201d See <em>post </em>at 76 n 9. It then argues that \u201cthe majority reads out of our law books the indeterminate nature of these mandatory minimum sentences and replaces those sentences with absolute minimum terms that the Legislature did not enact.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 76-77. This is incorrect. Under the majority opinion, ajudge remains free to impose any minimum sentence that is consistent with the guidelines range, subject to the two-thirds rule. Our opinion simply makes clear that, where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>judge imposes a minimum sentence in excess of the lowest permissible minimum sentence, it must be consistent with the guidelines. Hence, if the guidelines range tops out below the minimum sentence the court wishes to impose, the judge needs to provide substantial and compelling reasons for exceeding the guidelines. Our opinion does not \u201cread[] out of our law books\u201d the indeterminate nature of mandatory minimum statutes by replacing them with absolute minimum terms. By way of illustration, if a statute provides that the minimum sentence shall be \u201cat least two years,\u201d the trial court can impose a minimum sentence higher than two years. But if it wants to provide a minimum sentence higher than the top of the guidelines range, it must articulate substantial and compelling reasons for it. If the guidelines range is 12 to 24 months for a crime requiring a two-year minimum sentence and if the court wants to impose a three-year minimum sentence, it may do so. But it must provide substantial and compelling reasons for the upward departure. Concomitantly, if the guidelines range is 36 to 48 months and the court wishes to impose a two-year minimum sentence, it must provide substantial and compelling reasons for imposing a downward departure. Contrary to the dissent, requiring compliance with the articulation requirements of the guidelines does not replace an indeterminate minimum sentence with an absolute minimum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b151-8\">Weaver, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">(dissenting).

The sentence imposed here is excepted from the statutory guidelines and thus the sentencing court is not required to state \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d for the minimum sentence imposed, as the majority now requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree CSC for digitally penetrating the vagina of his daughter. Because he previously was convicted of second-degree CSC, he was sentenced as a repeat CSC offender to a minimum of 10 years in prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant argued that his 10-year minimum sentence represented an upward departure from the legislative sentencing guidelines and that the sentencing court failed to articulate substantial and compelling reasons to justify the upward departure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecution claimed that defendant\u2019s minimum sentence did not constitute a departure because it complied with the repeat CSC offender mandatory minimum sentence requirement, and the Court of Appeals agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">MCL 769.34(2) (a) places mandatory minimum sentences within the framework of the legislative sentencing guidelines and provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">If a statute mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall impose sentence in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>dance with <em>that statute. </em>Imposing a mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Thus, the statutory guidelines defer to another statute that specifies a mandatory minimum sentence. \u201cThat statute\u201d in this case is MCL 750.520f(l). It creates just such a mandatory minimum sentence for recidivist sex offenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">If a person is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under [MCL 750.520b, 750.520c, or 750.520d], the sentence imposed under those sections for the second or subsequent offense shall provide for a mandatory minimum sentence of <em>at least </em>5 years.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Here, defendant\u2019s 10-year minimum sentence was \u201cin accordance with\u201d the mandatory minimum sentence of \u201cat least 5 years.\u201d Moreover, as the sentencing court imposed \u201ca mandatory minimum sentence\u201d \u2014 a sentence of \u201cat least 5 years\u201d \u2014 that sentence was not a departure from the guidelines and the court was not required to justify the minimum sentence imposed. Therefore, the sentence imposed by the sentencing court satisfies both MCL 769.34(2) (a) and MCL 750.520f(l), as applied here in conformance with their clear and unambiguous meanings. Yet the majority disagrees; the question is why?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">I. THE MAJORITY FAILS TO CONSTRUE THE STATUTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PLAIN LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The majority claims that the mandatory minimum sentence articulated in MCL 750.520f(l) is \u201c5 years,\u201d not \u201cat least 5 years,\u201d as the statute plainly reads. Such a conclusion is obviously wholly inconsistent with the plain meaning of MCL 750.520f(l), as evidenced by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>grammatical structure, which describes the mandatory minimum sentence required under that provision as <em>\u201cat least </em>5 years.\u201d The Legislature could have created an <em>absolute </em>\u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence of 5 years, but it did not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, by using the phrase \u201cat least\u201d to modify \u201c5 years,\u201d the Legislature created an indeterminate \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence for recidivist sex offenders. Under the mandatory minimum sentence, 5 years is the <em>starting point </em>of the minimum sentence, <em>not </em>its upper terminus. Accordingly, a sentencing court must impose a sentence within the indeterminate mandatory minimum sentence of MCL 750.520f(l)\u2014 namely, any minimum sentence of 5 years or more \u2014 and that sentence \u201cis not a departure\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from the legislative sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The majority\u2019s misinterpretation will not be limited to the statute now before us. In numerous statutes, some covering our most serious crimes, the Legislature has chosen to create an <em>indeterminate, </em>rather than an absolute, mandatory minimum sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>day\u2019s decision, the majority reads out of our law books the indeterminate nature of these mandatory minimum sentences and replaces those sentences with absolute minimum terms that the Legislature did not enact.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The majority apparently eschews the clear language of MCL 750.520f(l) because it concludes that the 10-year minimum sentence imposed here would be \u201ccontrary to a central purpose of the sentencing guidelines \u2014 greater uniformity in sentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This rationale will not scour when one considers that the obligation of the judiciary is to apply legislative policies according to the unambiguous words used by the Legislature in the statutes enacted, not according to abstract policy considerations only judges can divine.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Whatever the broader policy of the legislative sentencing guidelines, the Legislature directed that a minimum sentence of <em>\u201cat least </em>5 years\u201d satisfies the particular statute at issue here, MCL 750.520f(l), and that is the policy we must apply.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>II. THE MAJORITY\u2019S MISCONSTRUCTION CREATES AN INCONSISTENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Despite the obvious and clear language of MCL 750.520f(l), the majority has inexplicably created its own alternative statute. The majority has similarly deviated from the obvious and clear language of MCL 769.34(2)(a) and created a new, but unexplained, statutory scheme for mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The majority determines that an absolute term of 5 years is the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d for a recidivist sex offender under MCL 750.520f(l). However, the majority also claims that a sentencing court <em>departs </em>from the guidelines when it sentences a defendant to a 5-year minimum term if the lower limit of the defendant\u2019s guidelines range is calculated at more than 5 years.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This is entirely contrary to MCL 769.34(2)(a), which expressly states that \u201c[i]mposing a mandatory minimum sentence <em>is not a departure under this </em>section.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Now the majority compels the sentencing court to justify as a departure a minimum sentence that is excepted from the statutory sentencing guidelines in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The problem with the majority\u2019s analysis is this: MCL 769.34(2) (a) specifically provides that the guidelines are <em>not </em>controlling here; rather, the guidelines defer to another statute that includes a mandatory minimum sentence. Yet the majority insists on reverting to the guidelines despite the Legislature\u2019s clear directive to the contrary and declines to provide any statutory support for this decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Imposing a 10-year minimum sentence for a recidivist sex offender is not a departure from the legislative sentencing guidelines because it is a \u201cmandatory minimum sentence\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of \u201cat least 5 years\u201d as provided in MCL 750.520f(l).
