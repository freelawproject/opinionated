L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>and of unlawful possession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h). </em>The defendant has appealed, arguing that (1) the judge committed reversible error in allowing the Commonwealth to use one of its peremptory challenges to exclude the only African-American from the jury; and (2) the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt (which were not objected to) were erroneous, and the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The Appeals Court concluded that the defendant was entitled to a new trial because of the Commonwealth\u2019s misuse of the peremptory challenge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 483 (1999). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>review. We conclude that the judge erred in allowing the peremptory challenge, and we reverse the convictions on that point. As a consequence, we need not reach the issue of the adequacy of the jury instructions on reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The dispositive issue arose in the following manner. During the jury selection process, the judge identified the prospective witnesses for the venire, indicating that several police officers might testify, and the judge asked whether any prospective juror needed to bring anything to his attention concerning an inability to sit as an unbiased juror. One juror (juror 3-16) volunteered that her husband was a police officer and that one of the names of the potential police witnesses sounded familiar to her. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">Juror 3-16: \u201cMy husband is a . . . police officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">The judge: \u201cWhat is his rank?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">Juror 3-16: \u201cHe\u2019s a patrolman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">The judge: \u201cHow long has he been in the Department?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">Juror 3-16: \u201cAbout twenty years, I think.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">The judge: \u201cAnd is he in any particular department?\u201d Juror 3-16: \u201cHe\u2019s in Property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">The judge: \u201cProperty?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\">Juror 3-16: \u201cMm-hmm. And also, extra details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-14\">The judge: \u201cI see. Well, Pm sure he comes home and discusses his work?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-15\">Juror 3-16: \u201cSometimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-16\">The judge: \u201cNow, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of . . . police officers listed here as prospective witnesses. Did you recognize any of those names?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-17\">Juror 3-16: \u201cYes. One of the names .... I personally don\u2019t know him, but I\u2019m sure my husband does.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-18\">The judge: \u201cDo you think it would be a problem to you to sit as a juror in a case like this, where you\u2019re going to have to make a decision as to the credibility of . . . police officers?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Juror 3-16: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">The judge: \u201cOkay. But you\u2019re still going to have to go home and talk to your husband every night. Is that going to be a problem to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">Juror 3-16: \u201cProbably not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">The judge: \u201cAny question in your mind that you could sit as a juror in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">Juror 3-16: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">The judge: \u201cI\u2019ll have you remain on the panel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Later, at the request of defense counsel, the judge asked the members of the venire whether they would tend to believe or disbelieve the testimony of a police officer just because of that person\u2019s occupation. When no one answered affirmatively, the judge stated, \u201cI find the balance of the panel is indifferent.\u201d Juror 3-16 was subsequently seated on the prospective trial jury. The prosecutor then sought to exercise a peremptory challenge to remove her. The following conference ensued at sidebar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">Defense counsel: \u201cYour Honor, naturally I would object because [juror 3-16] is one of the very few people of color in the jury panel; and it would appear that I think she\u2019s the only African-American on the panel, and I would ask that she not be excused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-12\">The judge: \u201cWell, to me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t even aware that the defendant was black. Is your client black?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\">Defense counsel: \u201cNo, the defendant is Hispanic, Your Honor. However, he has the option of selecting himself either black or Caucasian, as a Hispanic, and so for that same \u2014 I think he would be prejudiced by relieving the only African-American from the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\">The judge: \u201cBut he is Hispanic?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-15\">Defense counsel: \u201cYes, he is Hispanic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-16\">The judge: \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll hear from the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-17\">The prosecutor: \u201cWell, I remove minority jurors from the panel with great hesitation and great trepidation. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>think it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done it this year. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pattern. I am simply concerned about that particular juror\u2019s husband being on the . . . [pjolice [department. I believe it puts her in a very difficult position to listen to the testimony of other police officers. I would also say that I observed her smiling at [defense counsel] beforehand. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s acquainted with [defense counsel], but simply, that is the reason I exercised my challenge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">The judge: \u201cWell, based on the fact that it appears to me that \u2014 I didn\u2019t even realize that the defendant was Hispanic, from his appearance. He appears to me to be Caucasian. To me, that\u2019s not a Hispanic name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cWell, I think it is a Hispanic name. Calderon?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">The judge: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right. I was thinking it was \u2014 well, however, this is the same [juror] who came forward and said her husband was a police officer for twenty years; and I think that based on all the circumstances here, I\u2019m going to allow her to be excused, and I\u2019ll note your objection, counselor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">luror 3-16 was then excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">1. The defendant claims that the judge failed to follow procedural requirements set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 770-771 (1994), for determining whether there is a bona fide race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge when there is a likelihood of the exclusion of a juror by reason of membership in a protected group. Specifically, the defendant argues that (a) the Commonwealth\u2019s use of the peremptory challenge constituted a prima facie case of impropriety, which the judge implicitly recognized when he required the prosecutor to give his reasons for the challenge; (b) the judge did not afford defense counsel a chance to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s statements; and (c) after hearing the prosecutor\u2019s reasons, the judge failed to make his own independent evaluation as to their validity. The Commonwealth maintains that (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>there was no prima facie case of impropriety shown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; (b) the judge\u2019s failure to permit some rebuttal by defense counsel to the prosecutor\u2019s reasons was of no significance, because defense counsel had already stated his position and was allowed an objection; and (c) the judge implicitly accepted the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for the challenge as race-neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The law in this area is settled. \u201cThe use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors solely because of bias presumed to derive from their membership in discrete community groups is prohibited both by art. 12 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights], see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486-488, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), and the equal protection clause, see <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 84-88 (1986).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>409 Mass. 461, 464 (1991). The challenge of even a single prospective juror within a protected class can, in certain instances, constitute a prima facie showing of impropriety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>414 Mass. 732, 738 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 237, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1033 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>at 465. The defendant, a minority person, was entitled to a jury representing a fair cross section of the community, which would include African-Americans as well as Hispanics. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 478. The judge, by requiring the prosecutor to explain his reasons for the peremptory challenge of juror 3-16 after defense counsel\u2019s objection, implicitly found that the challenge might be improper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Caldwell, </em>418 Mass. <em>777, </em>778 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 175 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The burden was then on the Commonwealth to provide a neutral explanation establishing that the challenge was unrelated to juror 3-16\u2019s race. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>at 468. The reasons must be \u201cpersonal to the juror and not based on the juror\u2019s group affiliation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, supra </em>at 771, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 401 (1987). Because the prosecutor\u2019s articulation sounded superficial, defense counsel should have been permitted the opportunity to rebut the proffered explanation as suggesting pretext. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, supra </em>at 177-178. For all we know, if defense counsel had been allowed a response, the judge might have reconsidered his decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *3 Further, once the process was complete, the judge was required to make an independent evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons and to determine specifically whether the explanation was bona fide or a pretext. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, supra </em>at 771-772. This latter step involves more than a rubber stamping of the proffered reasons; it requires a meaningful consideration whether the challenge has a substantive basis or is impermissibly linked to race. The judge confined his ruling to the oblique statement that, \u201cbased on all the circumstances here,\u201d he would allow juror 3-16 to be excused. The definitive pronouncement expected of the judge was not forthcoming. The judge\u2019s failure to follow the proper procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s explanation was bona fide necessitates that we give no deference to the judge\u2019s ruling. See <em>id. </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Procedural mistakes in the allowance of a peremptory challenge by the Commonwealth, of course, do not constitute a per se basis for reversal. The mistakes and omissions require us to make our own determination whether the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons for the challenge were race-neutral. They were not. Although the credibility of police testimony might have been important to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, juror 3-16 had declared, to the judge\u2019s satisfaction, that she was unbiased and would decide the indictments on the merits. Furthermore, while the fact that juror 3-16\u2019s spouse was a police officer may have been reason for a successful defense challenge, on the obvious ground that she might be more inclined to believe the testimony of the police officers over the defendant\u2019s evidence, the fact provides no compelling reason for a challenge by the Commonwealth. We consider it specious to argue that the prosecutor may have acted prophylactically to remove from the jury someone who might be biased in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor. The assignment of examining juror 3-16\u2019s objectivity fell primarily to defense counsel, who was undoubtedly aware that the juror might harbor a bias in favor of the Commonwealth. Moreover, shortly before the peremptory challenge to juror 3-16 was made, the prosecutor brought to the judge\u2019s attention information indicating that another potential juror should be excused because of possible prejudice <em>against </em>the police. Common sense suggests that the prosecutor may not have been acting fairly when, after questioning one juror\u2019s antipathy to the police, he challenged juror 3-16 on the basis that she might be prejudiced <em>in favor of the </em>police.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s protestation that he \u201cremove[s] minority jurors from the panel with great hesitation and great trepidation\u201d adds no weight to the Commonwealth\u2019s claim of neutrality. See <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 98 (1986), quoting <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>405 U.S. 625, 632 (1972) (\u201cNor may the prosecutor rebut the defendant\u2019s case merely by denying that he had a discriminatory motive, or \u2018affirming] [his] good faith in making individual selections\u2019 \u201d). \u201cIf these general assertions were accepted as rebutting the defendant\u2019s prima facie case, the [constitutional protections] \u2018would be but. . . vain and illusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>requirement's].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>294 U.S. 587, 598 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Because of the procedural errors in the handling of the challenge, we have examined its validity on a de novo basis. We have kept in mind that equivocation does not equate with justification. We conclude that the diaphanous reasons given by the prosecutor do not validate the challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">2. Because the defendant is entitled to a new trial, we need not decide whether the reasonable doubt instructions were erroneous, and, if so, whether the errors created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. At any retrial, the judge should instruct on reasonable doubt in accordance with one of the approved formulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">3. Even though the defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful possession of ammunition was placed on file, we conclude that that conviction must also be reversed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chappee, </em>397 Mass. 508, 523 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 807, 807-808 n.1 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The judgments of conviction are reversed, the jury verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\">rhe Commonwealth suggests that juror 3-16 was not the only minority member of the venire, that the crimes were not interracial and were victimless, and that the judge had allowed juror 3-16 to stay after she was unable to state unequivocally her impartiality. Based on these considerations, the Commonwealth concludes that the prosecutor\u2019s challenge should enjoy the presumption of propriety normally given to peremptory challenges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The Commonwealth points out that other jurors on the panel \u201chad surnames which could have been Hispanic\u201d and suggests that, because juror 3-16 was not the only minority juror, the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge should have been presumed to be proper. While juror 3-16 was the sole African-American on the jury panel, the record does not conclusively show that there were other Hispanics in the jury box. The usual tools we rely on to measure one\u2019s ethnicity, primarily name and appearance, are often deceptive. (Even self-identification is not always determinative.) We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the presence of other Hispanics on the jury makes the judge\u2019s implicit finding of impropriety invalid. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>414 Mass. 732, 738-739 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 237, cert. denied, 522 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>U.S. 1033 (1997). We also reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that its challenge was somehow entitled to a presumption of propriety, because this case did not involve an interracial crime. While an indication that racial prejudice might be a potential issue at trial may be a factor in a judge\u2019s determination of a showing of impropriety, it is certainly not the exclusive factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s brief concedes that a response by defense counsel was appropriate, but suggests the lack of a response was of no effect. The Commonwealth argues as follows: \u201cWhile the defense counsel was not given the chance to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s reason, he had already stated his reason for opposing the challenge and it is difficult to see what more could have been said on this issue. Moreover, he preserved the issue by objection.\u201d We disagree that this failure was insubstantial. As stated by the Appeals Court, by foreclosing any rebuttal by defense counsel to the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation for the peremptory challenge, the defendant was \u201cthwarted in [his] attempt to show that reasons offered by the prosecutor did not \u2018pertain to the individual qualities of the prospective juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 486 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 177-178 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>816 F.2d 421, 423 (8th Cir. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The only other reason for the challenge offered by the prosecutor, that juror 3-16 smiled at defense counsel, will not justify the challenge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 553 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The dissenting opinion questions whether the judge made an implicit finding that the challenge was improper. That can be the only logical conclusion from the colloquy that occurred. It appears that the prosecutor did not want juror 3-16, an African-American woman, on the trial jury, despite her clear affirmations of neutrality and fairness, because, as a minority, she might be sympathetic to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b42-10\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">(dissenting). It is inconceivable to me that a criminal defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge of a juror based on the fact that the juror was married to a police officer would be regarded as improper. That the challenge in this case came from the prosecutor does not change the equation. Not only does the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that the- juror would be put in a very difficult position ring true, but we must also consider the prosecutor\u2019s independent obligation to seek a fair trial. Nor do I believe that, by permitting the prosecutor to explain his chal-. lenge in response to an objection by the defense, the judge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>making an implicit finding that the challenge might be improper. The situation would be different if the judge, following one or multiple peremptory challenges of minority members of the jury venire, had <em>\u201crequested </em>that the prosecutor <em>supply race-neutral explanations </em>for his challenges\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>418 Mass. <em>777, </em>778 (1994). I suggest that all attorneys trying jury cases would at least consider challenging a juror married to a police officer where a member of the spouse\u2019s department was going to be a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The result the court reaches today can be of little help to trial judges and attorneys in guiding their conduct in jury selection. I would prefer that, rather than impose on trial judges the impossible task of scrutinizing peremptory challenges for improper motives, we abolish them entirely. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
