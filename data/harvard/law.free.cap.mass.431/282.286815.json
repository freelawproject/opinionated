The arrow used was designed to kill big game such as bear, elk, antelope, deer, and boar by promoting rapid bleeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant through counsel raises two issues on appeal: (1) he is entitled to a new trial because the trial judge provided jurors with a recording of only a supplemental jury charge; and (2) the judge committed reversible error, by admitting in evidence four crossbows, found at the defendant\u2019s house, that were unrelated to the murder. The defendant also raises an additional issue, pro se, that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because (a) counsel did not move to dismiss the grand jury indictment, and (b) counsel failed to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s criminal record as part of the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. In addition, through counsel, he also asks that we exercise our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and either overturn his conviction, or reduce the verdict. We see no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 824 (1999), the jury were warranted in finding the following facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>398 Mass. 535, 536 (1986). On February 20, 1994, the victim and his passenger were traveling from work in the southbound high-speed lane of Route 95 when a driver in a vehicle came up behind them and flashed his high beams apparently indicating that the victim should move over so the vehicle could pass.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim did not immediately pull over, so the driver continued to flash the high beams. When the victim did pull over to allow the vehicle to pass, the victim flashed his high beams back at the vehicle as it sped away.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">According to the defendant\u2019s own testimony, after observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the victim\u2019s behavior just described, the defendant decided to give the victim \u201ca taste of his own medicine.\u201d The defendant got behind the victim\u2019s automobile, put on his high beams, and \u201cchase[dj\u201d it for some fourteen miles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The two automobiles changed lanes several times and, at one point, the victim hit his brakes and abruptly slowed down. Finally, the victim pulled to the side of the road and, instead of just driving on, the defendant decided to pull over also.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The victim and his passenger left their automobile and walked toward the defendant\u2019s automobile. The defendant also left his automobile, removed a crossbow from his trunk, and loaded an arrow onto it. The defendant also disengaged the safety on the crossbow while the victim and the passenger were approaching. As the victim approached the defendant, he asked, \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Almost immediately, the passenger heard \u201can air noise,\u201d which was the sound of the crossbow being fired. The defendant gave no warning to the victim and the passenger prior to firing the crossbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The victim was conscious long enough to tell the passenger he was shot and to walk back toward his automobile, where he began to stagger. The passenger drove the victim to a hospital where the victim died as a result of significant blood loss and hypothermia. The arrow had entered the victim\u2019s right chest area and caused a two-inch laceration to the front wall of a major artery that runs from the heart to the armpit.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The defendant\u2019s posttrial motion for a required finding of not guilty and a new trial was denied by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">2. <em>Tape recording of supplemental jury instructions. </em>The defendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the judge, in response to a specific question from the jury, provided the jury with a recording of only the supplemental instructions instead of a recording of the entire instructions as required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Baseler, 419 Mass. 500, 506 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>defendant argues that, by providing a recording of only the supplemental instructions, the judge created a risk that the jury would downplay the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion the judge<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> explained that he originally planned to submit to the jury a recording of the entire jury instruction. However, when he gave the instruction, he erred in defining involuntary manslaughter. He reinstructed the jury on involuntary manslaughter, but had second thoughts about sending the recording into the jury deliberation room because it contained both a correct and incorrect instruction on involuntary manslaughter. The jury retired for deliberation without the recording. A few hours later, the jury sent a note to the judge asking him to \u201cexplain ... the wording of malice and forethought [sz'c], and ... in layman\u2019s terms, all of the verdicts as we have become confused of the terms [szc] of all the verdicts.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After conferring with counsel, the judge answered the jury\u2019s question. The next day, a few minutes after resuming their deliberation, the jury sent another note to the judge stating, \u201cSome of the jurors would like to be able to read the instructions and definitions of each verdict listed on the [verdict form]. This needs to be clear to them.\u201d As no printed copy of his original instructions was available, the judge conferred with counsel and decided to reinstruct the jury on all the substantive offenses and to make a recording of it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge reinstructed the jury and repeatedly referred to the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove the elements of each charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and included instruction on self-defense. The judge then told the jurors that all instructions that were not recorded remained in full force, and said that the reason he was not reiterating all the previous instructions was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>because they had not questioned the other instructions. He also told them to feel free to ask more questions if they arose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The defendant claims that he properly raised this issue at trial. In the alternative he argues, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hallet, </em>427 Mass. 552, 552-555 (1998), that the judge\u2019s consideration of the issue in the motion for new trial resurrected the issue for purposes of appellate review. We disagree. The issue was not properly raised at trial,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> nor was it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>resurrected by the judge in denying the motion because he explicitly stated that he was not permitting \u201cunasserted claims of error to ripen in darkness until what was once easily curable becomes immutably fixed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we review the error under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cruz, 430 Mass. 182, 185 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We conclude, as did the judge, that there is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The jury were not reluctant to ask questions, yet never expressed confusion about the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. The recording submitted reiterated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove each element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In summarizing each charge the judge clearly placed the burden of proof on the Commonwealth. Furthermore, we note that the defendant does not argue that the instructions were incorrect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">3. <em>Crossbow evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the judge committed reversible error in admitting in evidence over his objection four crossbows that were owned by the defendant but not used in the murder. At trial, five plainclothes police officers came into the court room together each bearing a crossbow armed with an arrow. In overruling the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge said that, because the officers simply walked in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>put them down, it was not unfairly prejudicial. In addition, the judge ruled that the crossbows were relevant to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of, and familiarity with, them. \u201cWhether evidence is relevant in any particular instance, and whether the probative value of relevant evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, are questions within the sound discretion of the judge . . . [and] the judge\u2019s determination of these questions will be upheld on appeal absent palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>427 Mass. 65, 67-68 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 270 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 358 (1985), we stated that, \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant had weapons and ammunition of any kind was arguably relevant in that it tended to show that he was acquainted with weapons and was able to use them. Cases here and elsewhere have not, however, viewed the tenuous relevancy of evidence of a person\u2019s general acquaintance with weapons as outweighing the likelihood that such evidence will have an impact on the jury unfair to the defendant.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>357 Mass. 245, 248 (1970), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>326 Mass. 35, 39 (1950) (evidence of weapons unrelated to crime might be prejudicial; no such likelihood found); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>352 Mass. 218, 229-230, cert, denied, 389 U.S. 916 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In this case, it was unnecessary to introduce the crossbows to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s familiarity with the weapon because there already was evidence including testimony that the defendant owned five crossbows and photographs of crossbows found in various locations in the defendant\u2019s house. However, even if it were error to admit the other crossbows in evidence, no prejudice to the defendant resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u201cAn error is nonprejudicial only \u2018 \u201cif we are sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.... But if one cannot say . . . without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). In this case, there was abundant evidence that the defendant was an archery enthusiast. In addition to the testimony and photographs discussed <em>supra, </em>the defendant himself testified that he had been involved with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>archery since he was thirteen years of age, that he owned five crossbows, and had a target in his backyard. Both the defendant and his wife testified that he would bring crossbows with him on camping trips. Moreover, in his opening, defense counsel said that the defendant had been involved in archery for forty-five years. In this context, we can say that the presence of the crossbows in the courtroom did not substantially sway the outcome. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, supra </em>at 358-359 (no prejudice in erroneous admission of weapons other than murder weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel claims. </em>In capital cases, we review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard, which is more favorable to the defendant. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, </em>427 Mass. 718, 726 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>420 Mass. 242, 246 &amp; n.5 (1995), and cases cited. We look to see whether there was an error in the course of the trial and, if there was, \u201cwhether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">(a) <em>Alleged grand jury impairment. </em>The defendant argues, pro se, that the grand jury process was tainted, yet his counsel did not move to dismiss the indictment, thus depriving him of his right to effective assistance of counsel under both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant apparently contends that the grand jury testimony of the State trooper, in which the trooper read from his report the passenger\u2019s statement about the incident, impaired the grand jury process. The defendant makes three claims of inconsistent statements on the part of the passenger contained in the trooper\u2019s report: (1) the passenger\u2019s claim that the defendant never said a word before he shot the victim; (2) the passenger\u2019s claim that he retrieved the arrow from the victim\u2019s vehicle; and (3) the passenger\u2019s claim about being able to see from the angle at which he was standing. The defendant also claims that the trooper read the passenger\u2019s claim that the victim was not a \u201chot head\u201d or violent when the Commonwealth should have known that the victim had been convicted of rape of a child. In addition, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>contends that the trooper failed to inform the grand jury that, after several hours of trying to treat the victim, the hospital ran out of blood products.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The fact that trial counsel did not move to dismiss the indictment based on these alleged errors does not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because the defendant has not met the showing required to demonstrate grand jury impairment. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 621 (1986), we stated that, in a claim for impairment of a grand jury, the defendant must show \u201cthat false or deceptive evidence was given to the grand jury <em>knowingly and for the purpose of obtaining an indictment . . . [and] </em>that the presentation of <em>the false or deceptive evidence probably influenced the grand jury\u2019s determination </em>to hand up an indictment\u201d (emphasis added). Even if some inconsistencies exist in this testimony, there is nothing from which we could properly conclude that the statements were false or deceptive and knowingly introduced to the grand jury. In addition, the grand jury heard the trooper read both the defendant\u2019s own statement where he admitted shooting the victim, and the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s statement where she stated that she did not hear any words exchanged. This evidence diminishes the impact of the trooper\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s claim that the grand jury should have been told that the hospital ran out of blood products after several hours of treating the victim is without merit. There was evidence that the victim would not have survived even if more blood products were available. However, even assuming, arguendo, that more blood products would have helped the victim, actions on the part of medical personnel do not excuse the person inflicting the injuries. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, 399 </em>Mass. 60, 64 (1987), and cases cited (\u201ca jury would not be warranted in considering evidence that the victim\u2019s wounds were negligently treated unless there also was evidence that the treatment was the only cause of the victim\u2019s death\u201d). But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, supra </em>at 727 (defense of reckless medical care permissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">(b) <em>Failure to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s criminal record. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The defendant also argues, pro se, that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s criminal record to support the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under Massachusetts law, in cases involving self-defense, evidence of a victim\u2019s violent character is only admissible if the defendant shows that he knew of the victim\u2019s violent nature prior to the incident. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.3, at 137 (7th ed. 1999). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>430 Mass. 673, 678 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 Mass. 496, 501 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 Mass. 587, 588 (1945), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamishlian, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 931, 933 (1985).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">5. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, claims. </em>We have reviewed the complete record.

Baseler, 419 Mass. 500, 506 (1995), we summarized \u201cthe procedure a judge should follow when providing a jury with a tape recording of. . . instructions: (1) the judge must advise the counsel for both parties that the judge is going to do it; (2) the tape recording must be audible in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>its entirety and contain the whole instruction; (3) the judge shall give instructions to the jury about how to use the tape recorded charge; and (4) the judge should have the tape recording marked for identification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The trial judge was also the motion judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Were the jury to find the defendant guilty, they had before them murder in the first degree based on both deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty, murder in the second degree, and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.

So, nothing that I said was designed to or should be taken by you as an indication of what any specific verdict should or should not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u201cNow, as you go back to the jury room . . . I\u2019m going to send up this tape recorder, with the tape [of] these instructions, and you are free to use this as much or as little as you find helpful as your deliberations proceed. The fact that you have this tape recording doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t continue to ask questions if questions arise, but it does mean that you have at your disposal another resource ....</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u201cRemember, though, that these instructions have to be taken as a whole. It\u2019s not fair, not appropriate, to take little bits or pieces of what I\u2019ve said out of context and apply them to little bits or pieces of the evidence. You have to consider the instructions as a whole and in the context of those I gave you yesterday that I didn\u2019t repeat today . . . because it did not seem to me that they were responsive to the question you asked. But they still exist and you have to consider these instructions in their context.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u201cAs you use the tape recording, . . . [it] should be freely available to all and freely available to all to listen to as much or as little as all or each deems appropriate and advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u201cIn sum and in substance, this tape recording is a tool that you may use to assist you in understanding, comprehending and applying the instructions as a whole to the evidence as a whole, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s designed to do, no more and no less.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">At trial, the defendant objected to the judge\u2019s decision to send a recording of the supplemental instructions as follows: \u201cThe only objection [is] the reality .. . that if they want to re-hear one portion, they\u2019re going to have difficulty finding that particular portion on a small mini tape cassette recorder . . . [and] you run the risk of them picking out bits and pieces they want to hear.\u201d Defense counsel did not renew an objection once the judge gave his instructions to the jury. We agree with the judge that defense counsel\u2019s objection was not adequate to alert him to the requirement that the tape recordings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of jury instructions contain the whole instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baseler, </em>419 Mass. 500, 506 (1995).

However, the judge should do so \u201conly in those extraordinary cases where, upon sober reflection, it appears that a miscarriage of justice might otherwise result.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 449 (1980). \u201cA motion judge\u2019s determination only that an asserted error created no such injustice would not resurrect an issue because the issue would not have been considered fully on its substantive merits.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hallet, supra </em>at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In this case, although the motion judge\" devoted much time to discussing the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s inadequate objection to the use of the recording of supplemental instructions, the discussion did not resurrect the issue because the judge did not discuss the merits.
