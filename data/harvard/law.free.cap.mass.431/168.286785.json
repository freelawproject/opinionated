Prior to the appeal being heard, the defendant moved to strike the original brief filed on his behalf. A single justice of this court declined to strike the brief<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a motion for a new trial was remanded to the Superior Court. After hearing, the Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The defendant appeals from his conviction of murder in the first degree and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The appeals have been consolidated. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed. We decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or entry of a lesser degree of guilt on the conviction of murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">1. <em>Facts, </em>(a) <em>The events leading up to the murder. </em>We summarize the facts, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985). The defendant, Edward Martinez, was convicted of the premeditated murder of Freddys Abreu. The defendant and the victim lived in the same apartment building. The defendant shared an apartment with his father, his girl friend, Melissa Gaulin, and Gaulin\u2019s baby. The victim shared an apartment with his wife, Jaquay Abreu, and their daughter. The two couples were friendly with one another and visited one another\u2019s apartments. Jaquay Abreu, the victim\u2019s wife, testified that she also spoke with the defendant on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The victim sold crack cocaine and, shortly after moving into the apartment building, asked the defendant to join him in selling drugs. The defendant and the victim sold crack cocaine out of the apartment building for approximately two or three months before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Sometime before the murder, the victim purchased a silver handgun. Because the victim\u2019s wife objected to having a handgun in their home, the victim asked the defendant to keep the gun for him. The victim also gave the defendant approximately $1,000 worth of cocaine to hold. One day later, the victim asked the defendant to return the gun and the cocaine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The defendant refused to do so. An argument ensued. Two days later, the defendant\u2019s girl friend, Gaulin, reported to the police that the victim had been looking for the defendant and had threatened to kill her. Afraid, Gaulin went to stay with the defendant\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">(b) <em>The murder. </em>The next day, the victim, who apparently was friendly with the defendant\u2019s father, went to the defendant\u2019s apartment with a frozen dinner for the defendant\u2019s father. At approximately 10 p.m., the victim left the apartment building in his car and drove to the defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s apartment. The defendant came out to the victim\u2019s car along with Jacob Sanchez, the defendant\u2019s nephew. There was a brief argument, after which the victim drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">According to the testimony of Gaulin, Jacob Sanchez told the defendant to \u201cget the gun.\u201d Gaulin saw the defendant take the silver gun from a bag in his sister\u2019s apartment and put it back. She then went upstairs. The defendant and Sanchez left.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">At approximately 10:20 p.m., the victim returned to his apartment building. His wife heard his car pull up and looked out the window. She saw three men, dressed in dark clothing and hooded sweatshirts, approach her husband\u2019s car. She recognized one of the men as the defendant by his voice. The victim\u2019s wife saw the defendant pull out a gun and fire it twice at the victim. She recognized the gun as the silver gun the victim had given the defendant several days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">That night, the defendant returned to his sister\u2019s apartment alone. Gaulin noticed that he was shaking and sweating. He told her, \u201cI did it,\u201d or \u201c[w]e did it,\u201d and stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d The defendant also told Gaulin that he had gotten rid of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">(c) <em>The defendant\u2019s arrest. </em>The night of the murder, the victim\u2019s wife told the police that she had witnessed the defendant murder her husband. The police began a search of the area. The next morning, the police learned that the defendant was at his sister\u2019s apartment. When the police found him, the defendant agreed to speak with them at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The defendant initially denied knowing the victim. Later in the interview, however, the defendant admitted to selling crack cocaine for the victim. The defendant also told the police that he had severed his relationship with the victim several days earlier because the victim was not paying him enough. The defendant said that he knew the police were looking for him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and that he had run to another floor in the apartment building to hide earlier that day. When the police asked why the defendant thought the police were looking for him, the defendant terminated the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">(d) <em>The trial. </em>The defendant\u2019s claims of errors center on his own testimony and that of two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses \u2014 Jaquay Abreu and Gaulin. Jaquay Abreu, the victim\u2019s wife, testified that she saw the defendant shoot her husband. She stated that she identified the defendant as the shooter based on his voice and on what she could see from her window. The force of this evidence was strengthened by Abreu\u2019s testimony as to her knowledge of the defendant because of visits and telephone conversations with the defendant. Gaulin described the defendant\u2019s behavior before and after the murder, including his inculpatory statements immediately after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defendant proceeded on the theory that the victim\u2019s wife misidentified the murderer. The defendant testified that he and the victim argued on the night of the murder over the defendant\u2019s refusal to return the cocaine and the gun. The defendant also testified that his nephew, Jacob Sanchez, suggested they kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">According to the defendant\u2019s testimony, he pulled the gun out of a bag, but returned it to the bag when his girl friend became upset. The defendant\u2019s testimony indicated that he returned to his apartment building on the night of the murder because he was concerned about his father\u2019s safety. According to the defendant, he was knocking <em>on </em>the door of his apartment when he heard the two shots that killed the victim. The defendant\u2019s strategy focused on implicating Sanchez as the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">2. <em>Motions for required finding of not guilty. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motions for a required finding of not guilty. According to the defendant, the evidence was insufficient on the element of premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, we consider whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence would permit a rational juror to infer that the defendant, after quarreling with the victim, took a gun from his sister\u2019s home, rode to the victim\u2019s location, pointed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>firearm at the victim\u2019s head, and fired. \u201cThe use of a firearm in the killing is sufficient to support a verdict of murder in the first degree based on deliberately premeditated malice aforethought. . . . Evidence that the defendant brought a gun with him to the scene ... is evidence of planning\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Williams, 422 Mass. 111, 123 (1996). There was sufficient evidence to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">3. <em>Errors at trial, </em>(a) <em>Admission of the threat. </em>Gaulin testified to the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements and behavior after the murder. Gaulin became upset during her testimony. The judge ordered a recess, during which the prosecutor suggested that Gaulin\u2019s demeanor might be attributable to threats that the defendant\u2019s niece had made against Gaulin. According to Gaulin\u2019s subsequent testimony, the defendant\u2019s niece said that if Gaulin \u201cput her uncle in jail that she\u2019ll come and kill [Gaulin].</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Because Gaulin asked the prosecutor if she could \u201cget in trouble for testifying,\u201d the judge became concerned that Gaulin was afraid she might incriminate herself. The judge ordered that an attorney unrelated to the case be brought in to speak with Gaulin. The attorney spoke in private with Gaulin, and then told the judge that he had \u201cjust talked to a nervous young woman who stated that she has been threatened. She\u2019s concerned about that . . . .\u201d The attorney also reported that Gaulin was generally nervous about testifying but that no privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution applied. Based on the attorney\u2019s report, the judge permitted the Commonwealth to question Gaulin before the jury, over the defendant\u2019s objection, about the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The defendant claims that the judge erred in allowing Gaulin\u2019s testimony as to the threat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. Because the defendant objected at trial, we review to determine whether there was prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 164 n.3, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998) (issue preserved by objection at trial). We conclude that there was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a rational tendency to prove a material issue. Whether evidence is relevant in any particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>instance, and whether the probative value of relevant evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, are questions within the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 270 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>407 Mass. 798, 807 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We conclude that the prejudicial effect of the threat testimony outweighed its probative value. There was no suggestion that material aspects of Gaulin\u2019s testimony changed because of the threat. Therefore, the probative value of any evidence that the defendant\u2019s niece threatened Gaulin before she testified was minimal. However, the danger that the jurors would use evidence of a threat improperly was significant. As the defendant points out, the jurors might have associated the bad conduct of the defendant\u2019s niece with the defendant or given Gaulin\u2019s testimony artificially inflated weight because she testified despite being threatened. The judge implicitly acknowledged these dangers by giving two limiting instructions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Although the admission of the threat testimony was error, the error was not prejudicial to the defendant. The judge\u2019s limiting instructions were strong and stated the law correctly. We assume that the jurors followed the judge\u2019s instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 29 (1996).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In addition, although Gaulin\u2019s testimony was important to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, it was not indispensable. Gaulin testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that she heard the defendant confess to the murder. Her credibility was questionable, not solely because of her demeanor on the stand, but also because the jurors were aware that she had given contradictory statements to the police. The jurors heard the victim\u2019s wife testify to witnessing the defendant shoot the victim. Given such strong testimony, we do not think that the judgment was \u201csubstantially swayed\u201d by the erroneous admission of threats against a witness who testified to the defendant\u2019s inculpatory behavior after the murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, supra </em>at 163, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">(b) <em>Admission of identification testimony. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in admitting hearsay testimony about a statement Jaquay Abreu gave to Detective Kevin Sullivan on the night of the murder. At trial, Detective Sullivan testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, as to Abreu\u2019s statement, which included Abreu\u2019s description of how many shots were fired, the color of the gun, and the defendant\u2019s behavior after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Where an identifying witness is available for cross-examination and does not dispute the out-of-court identification, the testimony of a third person who observed the extrajudicial identification is admissible for both corroborative and probative purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 795-796 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 60-61 &amp; n.8 (1984). Such testimony may extend to out-of-court descriptions of a perpetrator\u2019s physical characteristics, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 72 (1983), cert, denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984), or clothing, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 690 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The Commonwealth argues that all of Detective Sullivan\u2019s testimony was proper under the verbal completeness doctrine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>377 Mass. 814, 826-831 (1979). The doctrine\u2019s reach does not extend as far as the Commonwealth argues. \u201cWhenever statements of a person are put in evidence, all that was said or written by him at the same time and upon the same subject becomes admissible; but other statements, even though made at the same time, are not admissible unless they are upon the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, supra </em>at 828, quoting W.B. Leach &amp; P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 320 (4th ed. 1967). For the purpose of testimony on extrajudicial identifications, the verbal completeness doctrine extends only to testimony as to the identifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>witness\u2019s identification of the defendant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paredes-Rodriguez, </em>160 F.3d 49, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1998) (interpreting Fed. R. Evid. 801[d][l/][C], which states that \u201c[a] <em>statement </em>is not hearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is . . . one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person\u201d [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Because there was error in allowing the detective to testify as to Abreu\u2019s complete description of events after the murder, we must determine whether the error prejudiced the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, supra. </em>We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The detective\u2019s testimony was duplicative of Abreu\u2019s testimony. \u201cThe admission of cumulative evidence does not commonly constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bart B., </em>424 Mass. 911, 915 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, supra </em>at 796 (no prejudice because \u201c[t]he jury had the full picture from the identifying witnesses themselves as to what they had seen\u201d). Nor was this a case where, as the defendant claims, \u201cprejudice is self-evident [because] one party\u2019s version of an incident is allowed to be repeated again and again.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 659-660 (1992), quoting <em>Cole </em>v. <em>State, </em>83 Md. App. 279, 286 (1990). Abreu\u2019s version of events was described twice, once by Abreu herself and once by Detective Sullivan. The limited portion of the testimony that went beyond the identification was not prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">(c) <em>Implying fabrication by defendant. </em>The defendant correctly asserts that the prosecutor improperly questioned the defendant as to the fact that the defendant sat through the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>monwealth\u2019s case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>400 Mass. 136, 140 (1987) (reversing defendant\u2019s conviction). \u201c[T]o use against the defendant his strategy to wait until after the prosecution had made its case before revealing his story would disparage the constitutional rights which allowed him that strategy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>424 Mass. 682, 690-691 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra, </em>this case hinged on the jurors\u2019 assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility. However, unlike in <em>Person, </em>the improper conduct in this case was limited to two questions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not suggest to the jurors, either through questioning or closing argument, that they should draw an inference adverse to the defendant because the defendant heard the testimony against him. Contrast <em>Person, supra. </em>Therefore, the error did not \u201cweaken[] [the defendant\u2019s] case in some significant way so as to require a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 Mass: 643, 650 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">(d) <em>Asking defendant to comment on witness\u2019s veracity. </em>The defendant argues that it was improper for the prosecutor to ask several questions requiring the defendant to comment on the veracity of another witness, Gaulin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is \u201cimproper to ask the defendant to testify to the credibility of other witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>430 Mass. <em>1, </em>7 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 567 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In <em>Triplett, </em>we reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction because \u201cthe Commonwealth repeatedly asked [the defendant] about those parts of [another witness\u2019s] testimony that contradicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>his own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566. In <em>Triplett, </em>the Commonwealth persisted in questioning the defendant about the veracity of testimony given by the defendant\u2019s mother despite the fact that the defendant had asserted that he did not remember the incident in question. This questioning was so intense that it prompted the defendant to exclaim, \u201cI\u2019m not going to call my mother a liar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566 n.5. We noted that \u201c[t]his form of questioning permeated the entire cross-examination of the witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Here, the focus of the improper questions was not Gaulin\u2019s most damaging testimony \u2014 that involving the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements after the murder \u2014 rather, the questions came in the context of inquiring as to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts in the days prior to the murder. In addition, most of the prosecutor\u2019s questions focused on whether the defendant had heard Gaulin\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In these circumstances, we conclude that \u201cthe error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 563 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). The error does not require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">(e) <em>Burden shifting. </em>According to eyewitness testimony, the perpetrator of the murder wore dark blue pants and a dark, hooded sweatshirt. The defendant, however, testified that, on the day of the murder, he wore a white T-shirt with the words \u201cwe are the world\u201d printed on the back and stone-washed blue jeans. Although the Commonwealth had in its possession at least the T-shirt, during cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the defendant: \u201cdid you bring with you today the . . . sneakers, the stone-washed jeans, or the white T-shirt you had on?\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s question implied that, because the defendant could not produce the clothes, he was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u201cA prosecutor may not conduct cross-examination \u2018in bad faith or without foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 561, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>367 Mass. 280, 285 (1975). The prosecutor\u2019s question was improper because its sole purpose was to \u201cimpl[yj the truth of a proposition [s]he kn[ew] to be false\u201d \u2014 that, because the defendant could not produce the evidence the Commonwealth had in its possession, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>defendant was lying. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra, </em>citing PJ. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 3.2, at 52 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The defendant argues that the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper question was to shift to him the burden of producing exculpatory evidence. We disagree. Shortly after the prosecutor asked the improper question, the Commonwealth introduced in evidence the T-shirt with \u201cwe are the world\u201d printed on the back: the jurors, therefore, were cognizant of the fact that at least some of the clothing was in the Commonwealth\u2019s possession all along. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, supra </em>at 563. Furthermore, the judge correctly instructed the jurors that the fact that the defendant took the stand \u201cdid not shift any burden away from the Commonwealth . . . to the defendant.... The burden remains totally with the Commonwealth, and never shifts to the defendant.\u201d We are satisfied that, although the prosecutor\u2019s question was improper, the jurors understood the appropriate burden of proof and, therefore, that the single question did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 &amp; n.3 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">(f) <em>The cumulative effect of the alleged errors. </em>The defendant argues that, even if none of the above errors requires reversal separately, the combined effect of the mistakes was so prejudicial that it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We disagree. The cumulative error was no more prejudicial than the individual errors, which had minimal impact. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kosilek, </em>423 Mass. 449, 457 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">4. <em>Other errors alleged. </em>The defendant claims that a number of additional errors were made at his trial. We disagree. These claims \u201crequire us to apply established principles of law to specific facts of [the defendant\u2019s] case. ... We shall deal with such issues only to the extent necessary to show that we are aware of the defendant\u2019s contentions and to apply the established law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>425 Mass. 378, 379 n.1 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">(a) <em>Jury irregularities. </em>The judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to remove three jurors after they were followed from the courtroom by a group of spectators was proper. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B. The judge held a hearing, out of the presence of the other jurors and with both counsel present, at which each juror involved in the incident was questioned. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 406 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 767 (1979). Each of the jurors stated that he or she could render a fair verdict. \u201c[A] judge may properly rely on a juror\u2019s statement that he remains impartial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>401 Mass. 437, 444 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamara, </em>422 Mass. 614, 615 (1996). \u201cThe judge determined that no good cause was shown necessitating the discharge of the juror[s]; there was no abuse of her discretion . .. . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. 93, 96 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 769.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The judge\u2019s inquiry into the three jurors\u2019 ability to act impartially was proper. Although \u201cin general . . . our law does not permit inquiry into \u2018the subjective mental processes of jurors, such as the reasons for their decisions,\u2019.\u201d the judge\u2019s questions were confined to the jurors\u2019 assessment of their ability to remain impartial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hebert, </em>379 Mass. 752, 755 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 198 (1979). Such inquiry is regularly employed in ascertaining whether an individual should sit on a jury and is distinguishable from improper questioning about a deliberating juror\u2019s thought processes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamara, supra. </em>There is nothing improper in repeating such questions if the circumstances so warrant. See <em>id.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">(b) <em>Exclusion of Abreu\u2019s arrest. </em>The judge\u2019s exclusion, over the defendant\u2019s objection, of evidence that Jaquay Abreu, the victim\u2019s wife, was arrested and arraigned on drug-related charges after the murder, but before the defendant\u2019s trial, was proper. Because Abreu\u2019s testimony did not differ from her prearrest statements, there was no basis for claiming that Abreu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>changed her testimony in order to curry favor with the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>423 Mass. 880, 884 (1996), and cases cited. Also, the judge\u2019s voir dire colloquy of the witness indicated that the defendant\u2019s line of questioning would not produce material testimony as to whether Abreu was biased in favor of the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 761. There was no error in excluding evidence of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">(c) <em>Alleged prosecutorial misconduct. </em>(1) <em>Implying knowledge of firearms. </em>The prosecutor\u2019s questions whether the defendant knew about firearms because he had served in the military were proper. The defendant raised the issue of his military training on direct examination, and the Commonwealth was entitled to probe further based on the reasonable inference that an individual with military training has experience with firearms. When the scope of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of firearms became clear, the prosecutor proceeded to another topic. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor made improper comments during her summation about the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his military service.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not go \u201cbeyond logical inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434. Also, there was abundant additional evidence that the defendant was familiar with the murder weapon: he possessed the weapon prior to the murder, and an eyewitness saw the defendant shoot the victim. See <em>id. </em>There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">(2) <em>Missing witness inference. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s questions as to an employment interview the defendant had on the day of the murder improperly raised a missing witness inference adverse to the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>397 Mass. 105, 108 (1986). The defendant\u2019s argument lacks merit. No missing witness instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>argued, sought, or given. Cf. <em>id. </em>Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s questions suggested that the interviewer possessed either exculpatory or inculpatory evidence. The questions were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">(3) <em>Consciousness of guilt. </em>While in the police station, the defendant told Gaulin to \u201cremember that he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d In her closing argument, the prosecutor told the jurors that \u201c[tjhose were the defendant\u2019s words. That\u2019s what he wanted Melissa to say. That\u2019s what he wants us to say. But the evidence tells us to say something quite different.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201c \u2018In closing argument, counsel may argue the evidence and the fair inferences which can be drawn from the evidence.\u2019 . . . \u2018Counsel may also attempt to assist the jury in their task of analyzing, evaluating, and applying evidence. Such assistance includes suggestions by counsel as to what conclusions the jury should draw from the evidence\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 390 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 431 (1984). The prosecutor\u2019s inference that the defendant was attempting to keep Gaulin quiet about his inculpatory statements was based on facts in evidence. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">(4) <em>\u201cTaunting\u201d the defendant. </em>The defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor \u201ctaunted\u201d the defendant lacks merit. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMars, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 788, 792 (1997). One point of contention was whether, before the murder, the victim went to the defendant\u2019s apartment to find the defendant or to bring food to the defendant\u2019s father. In cross-examining the defendant, the prosecutor asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that there was plenty of food for your father, the chef, to eat?\u201d The evidence indicated that the defendant\u2019s father was a chef. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">(5) <em>Defendant\u2019s silence. </em>Inspector Gerald Wayne of the Lowell police department testified to a post-Miranda interview with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> During direct examination, Inspector Wayne stated that, toward the end of the interview, the defendant said that he knew the police had been looking for him and that he had hidden in a vacant apartment during an earlier police visit. The prosecutor asked Inspector Wayne what happened next during the interview. According to Inspector Wayne, when the defendant was asked why he knew the police were looking for him, \u201che stated he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore, and . . . terminated the interview.\u201d Although the defendant did not object to this testimony,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the defendant claims on appeal that the prosecutor improperly questioned Inspector Wayne about the termination of the interview with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s silence after the police have given the warnings mandated by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467-479 (1966), may not be used against that defendant. . . . [T]o do so would \u2018penalize\u2019 the invocation of the right to Silence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 797 (1996), citing <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, supra </em>at 140. \u201cStill, in a few situations evidence of silence is properly admitted because it is not \u2018used against\u2019 the accused.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, supra </em>at 798, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. 105 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>421 Mass. 1005 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Inspector Wayne\u2019s testimony was \u201cintroduced in the context of the entire conversation, and was admitted so as not to leave the jury wondering why the interview ended abruptly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, supra </em>at 110. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, supra </em>at 798. \u201cWhen the defendant has temporarily waived the right to silence, testimony regarding the cessation of questioning is appropriate to prevent . . . confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, supra. </em>In addition, \u201cat no time did the Commonwealth use this single response either as evidence of guilt or to impeach an explanation . . . offered at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 314 (1980). The prosecutor\u2019s question was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Although there was no error in this line of questioning in the context of the defendant\u2019s trial, we note that, at the defendant\u2019s request, the judge should instruct the jurors, at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>testimony, that a defendant has a constitutional right not to answer any questions asked by the police. On such request by the defendant, the judge should also instruct the jurors that testimony regarding the termination of a post-Miranda interview was admitted only for the purpose of explaining why the interview ended and that the jurors should not draw any adverse inference against the defendant because of his silence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, ante </em>at 30, 38-39 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">(d) <em>Failure to instruct on manslaughter. </em>The judge did not err in failing to instruct the jurors on manslaughter. \u201cIf any view of the evidence in a case would permit a verdict on manslaughter rather than murder, a manslaughter charge should be given.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 578 (1996). \u201cIn determining whether such an instruction is warranted, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>419 Mass. 28, 31 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">All the evidence showed that the victim was sitting in his parked vehicle and the defendant was outside the vehicle when he fired the gun. No evidence suggested that the victim was threatening the defendant at that time. Nor did any evidence suggest that the defendant acted on reasonable provocation \u201cbefore sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierce, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 216 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soaris, </em>275 Mass. 291, 299 (1931). Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s theory at trial was not that he was provoked, but that he was not present when the victim was murdered. No manslaughter instruction was warranted in these circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">5. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. We review to determine whether \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977), or whether any error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(a) <em>Failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct. </em>In addressing the defendant\u2019s various claims of error, we concluded that none of the alleged errors created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. \u201c[T]he defendant asks us to determine that the trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to these errors constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. \u2018[I]f an error not objected to by trial counsel does not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E[,] ... a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to such error will not succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kosilek, </em>423 Mass. 449, 457-458 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681-682 (1992), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 807 (1996). The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">(b) <em>Failure to impeach Melissa Gaulin. </em>Gaulin testified that, when the defendant returned to his sister\u2019s apartment on the night of the murder, \u201c[h]e was sweating and shaking.\u201d He said either \u201cI did it\u201d or \u201cwe did it,\u201d and told Gaulin that \u201che didn\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d He also told her that \u201cwe got rid of it [the gun].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The defendant argues that Gaulin\u2019s testimony was critical to the Commonwealth\u2019s case against him. According to the defendant, his trial counsel might have been more effective in undermining Gaulin\u2019s testimony. We do not think that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, supra, </em>or that defense counsel\u2019s representation created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">(1) <em>Police coercion. </em>Gaulin gave two statements to the police. In the first, she provided an alibi for the defendant. In the second, she described the defendant\u2019s inculpatory behavior after the murder. The trial judge, who decided the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, found that the police threatened Gaulin before each of her statements. The defendant now argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not question Gaulin about the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">In the memorandum denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge noted that the threats were made before both the inculpatory and the exculpatory statements that Gaulin gave to the police. In these circumstances, bringing in evidence of these threats for impeachment purposes would not \u201chave accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(2) <em>Prior consistent and inconsistent statements. </em>On direct examination, Gaulin testified to the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements. She also testified to the two inconsistent statements she gave the police about the defendant\u2019s behavior after the murder. Although the first of these statements was inconsistent with Gaulin\u2019s trial testimony, the second statement corroborated that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The defendant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the statement that corroborated Gaulin\u2019s testimony and for failing to impeach Gaulin with the statement that was inconsistent with her testimony. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of testimony that had the effect of showing that the Commonwealth\u2019s witness had given two contradictory statements to the police. Indeed, the defendant could point to the fact that the Commonwealth itself had proved the misstatements and, on that basis, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence should not be believed. The admission of this evidence did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We also disagree with the defendant\u2019s complaint that his trial counsel was not emphatic enough in impeaching Gaulin because she described the defendant as saying both \u201cwe did it\u201d and \u201cI did it.\u201d In order to advance the theory that the defendant was not the perpetrator, defense counsel did question Gaulin as to her waffling between these two descriptions. It is not ineffective not to belabor a point.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">(3) <em>Motive to lie. </em>The defendant argues that his counsel should have put before the jurors a letter in which Gaulin expressed her anger at the defendant for leaving her. Gaulin wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you [and] you know how I can so please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d We agree with the Commonwealth and the judge that the import of this statement is ambiguous. We are also persuaded that, had defense counsel introduced a portion of the letter, the Commonwealth could have introduced the remainder of the letter, in which Gaulin promised to \u201cstay by\u201d the defendant and expressed a desire to prove her love to him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>377 Mass. 814, 826-831 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>409 Mass. 110 (1991) (discussing verbal completeness doctrine). Where a witness\u2019s prior statements are \u201cas harmful as or more harmful to the defendant than her trial testimony,\u201d defense counsel was not ineffective in not using those state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ments to impeach. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>408 Mass. 561, 569 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have reviewed the record as a whole and conclude that there is no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial, or to enter a lesser degree of guilt on the conviction of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Thus, that brief is before us as well as the new brief filed on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The defendant was also convicted of possession of an unlicensed firearm, for which he was sentenced to serve a concurrent term not exceeding five years and not less than two and one-half years. The defendant does not allege any error concerning this conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The defendant also complains that the judge \u201cfailed to comprehend what factors had to be weighed\u201d in determining whether to admit the testimony. The defendant apparently bases this claim on the fact that the judge did not explain her thought process in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection. A judge is not required to state her grounds for excluding testimony. <em>H.H. Hawkins &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Robie, </em>338 Mass. 61, 66 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">immediately after Gaulin testified as to the threat, the judge instructed the jury that they could consider the threat only in relation to Gaulin\u2019s demeanor. The judge instructed that, \u201cif believed, such threats cannot be held against this defendant nor . . . place the defendant in a negative light before a jury, even though it may have been done by someone who is related ... to this particular defendant. It must be considered an independent enterprise on the part of the person making the threat. . . . [Wjhatever [the defendant\u2019s niece] may or may not have done \u2014 that\u2019s up to you to determine on the subject of this witness\u2019s credibility \u2014 but you cannot carry that over to the defendant.\u201d The judge gave a substantially similar instruction in her final instruction to the jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The defendant suggests that the judge\u2019s instruction \u201cmay be tantamount to asking the jury to ignore that an elephant has walked through the jury box.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 676, 680 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>417 Mass. 348 (1994) (reversing conviction) (involving a four year old\u2019s fresh complaint that she was burned with cigarettes by her father). Melissa Gaulin\u2019s testimony as to the threat did not have the \u201cgripping quality\u201d of the testimony referred to in <em>Flebotte. </em>There is, therefore, no reason to think that the jurors were unable to follow the judge\u2019s limiting instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 29 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Our approach accords with the reasoning behind exempting out-of-court identifications from the hearsay rule. \u201c \u2018The premise . . . was that, given adequate safeguards against suggestiveness, out-of-court identifications were generally preferable to courtroom identifications,\u2019 because of the problem of fading memories.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paredes-Rodriguez, </em>160 F.3d 49, 58 (1st Cir. 1998), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>554, 563 (1988).
