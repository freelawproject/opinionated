O\u2019Neill, </em>Committee for Public Counsel Services, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-13\"><em>Amanda Lovell, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-14\">Spina, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agf\">A jury found the defendant, Gary Moorer, guilty of unarmed robbery and assault and battery. On appeal the defendant argues that the judge\u2019s denial of any opportunity to cross-examine the victim as to racial bias and his denial of any opportunity to comment on the subject in closing argument is reversible error. We agree with the defendant and reverse his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">The victim testified that he went to a Store 24 at the comer of Cambridge and Temple Streets in Boston shortly before 8 a.m. on July 6, 1996, to buy cigarettes. He took note of the defendant standing outside because \u201cthe cap [the defendant was wearing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) cap] and the face didn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d and he had never before seen the defendant at that store, which the victim frequented. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>acknowledged that he did not think that someone who looked like the defendant would have gone to MIT. The victim said that after he made his purchase he walked back to his car. He sensed someone behind him, turned, and saw the defendant. As he reached for his car door the defendant pushed him against the car door and removed his wallet. A scuffle ensued. The victim claimed the defendant pushed him to the ground and fled with the wallet. The defendant denied striking the victim. The victim\u2019s shouts for help were heard by some fire fighters, who saw the defendant running and apprehended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The victim described the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cHe had a sloping forehead. The nose and lips and jaw were normal to negroid shape, slightly balding head, short curly hair. He had about two days\u2019 old growth beard and also with sagging eyelids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">He made no observations about the defendant\u2019s clothing, other than the MIT cap. In his testimony before the grand jury the victim described the defendant as \u201ca black African,\u201d which he acknowledged at trial was a \u201cslip of the tongue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">During counsel\u2019s opening statement the defendant conceded that he took the victim\u2019s wallet, but claimed it was the result of a pickpocket (larceny from the person, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 25 [6]), not a robbery. The defense strategy was to show that the victim, a white man from Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), exaggerated the circumstances of their encounter because of racial bias. The defendant is an African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The strategy included cross-examination of the victim concerning two occasions before trial at which he overstated the amount stolen as $400, where the amount was actually $200. He first misstated the amount to police, but corrected himself the next day. The second time occurred before the grand jury, and he was corrected by the prosecutor. Counsel also elicited from the victim that his visit to the emergency room \u201ca couple of days later or that night,\u201d about which he testified on direct examination, actually occurred on July 29. The visit shortly after the incident was \u201cnot official[]:\u201dhe had some friends who were emergency room doctors, and they gave him some painkillers. He could not recall their names. On July 29 he told hospital personnel that he did not remember being struck in the chest, but said he \u201ccould have been pushed against a car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>During cross-examination of the victim, counsel inquired about apartheid in Rhodesia,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where the victim grew up, and the victim\u2019s potential for racial bias, and the prosecutor objected and the objection was sustained. Counsel continued, but the judge called both lawyers to sidebar. Counsel explained his strategy and his basis for continuing. The judge \u201cprohibited\u201d him from further inquiry into the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The judge interrupted counsel\u2019s closing argument<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and said in front of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cLook, you get off the racial card here. There is no racial card in this case, and I don\u2019t want you to broach it again, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cI want to tell this jury, this is a court of law. Racial factors do not enter into the system of justice for white, for black, for Asian, or for any other group of people; and there is no issue in this case of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The judge denied counsel\u2019s request to be heard at sidebar, and later denied his request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\u201cThe right of a criminal defendant to cross-examine a prosecution witness to show the witness\u2019s bias, and hence to challenge the witness\u2019s credibility, is well established in the common law, in the United States Constitution (Sixth Amendment), and in the Constitution of the Commonwealth (art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam </em>Bui, 419 Mass. 392, 400, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861 (1995), and cases cited. \u201cA judge may not restrict cross-examination of a material witness by foreclosing inquiry into a subject that could show bias or prejudice on the part of the witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>400 Mass. 508, 513 (1987). \u201cIf, on the facts, there is a possibility of bias, even a remote one, the judge has no discretion to bar all inquiry into the subject.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, supra </em>at 400. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 587 (1985). \u201cA defendant who seeks to pursue a subject in an attempt to demonstrate bias must make a plausible showing that the circumstances existed on which the alleged bias is based.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, supra </em>at 401. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 153 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The victim\u2019s comment that the defendant\u2019s face did not quite fit the MIT cap he was wearing created at least a remote possibility that he was racially biased. On that evidence, the defendant was entitled to inquire further.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, ante </em>535, 538-541 (2000) (evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>potential witness had been asked by Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness whether she dated black men insufficient to establish remote possibility of racial bias). The Commonwealth suggests that the judge\u2019s ruling went only to the form of the question, but our review of the record leads us to conclude otherwise. The judge made it abundantly clear that any inquiry into the subject of the victim\u2019s possible racial bias was off limits. That was error, based on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We also conclude that the error prejudiced the defendant. While he need not show precisely what the victim would have disclosed had the judge permitted cross-examination on the subject of racial bias, he must show that something having \u201cmore than minimal value . . . might have been forthcoming.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fordham, 417 Mass. 10, 20 (1994). This threshold was met by the victim\u2019s admission that he did not think that someone who looked like the defendant would have gone to MIT. Bias was the glue of the defense, for without it, the victim\u2019s overstatements as to his injuries and the amount stolen easily could be explained, and were, by confusion, shock, and nervousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The error was compounded when the judge interrupted defense counsel\u2019s closing argument and instructed the jury that there were no racial factors in the case. Counsel was making a proper argument and drawing a fair inference from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>418 Mass. 58, 59 (1994). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phoenix, </em>409 Mass. 408, 425 (1991) (improper to impute racial animosity during prosecutor\u2019s argument without evidentiary support). Counsel had a basis to argue as he had. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 205 (1977) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cutty, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 675 (1999). Whether racial bias affected the victim\u2019s credibility was a matter for the jury, not the judge, to determine. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, supra </em>at 60. The judge\u2019s intervention effectively obliterated whatever salvage value had remained in the defense. The defendant is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">See R. Oliver &amp; J.D. Page, A Short History of Africa 176, 188-189, 204-207 (6th ed. 1988, reprinted with 1995 postscript).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u201cSo let\u2019s look at [the victim]. He has, I suggest to you, exaggerated at every turn; hasn\u2019t he? Let\u2019s talk about his identification. And you\u2019re going to say, wait a minute. [The defendant\u2019s] not saying he\u2019s not' the guy. What does the identification have to do with it? It has this to do with it, ladies and gentlemen. If he\u2019s going to exaggerate about that and exaggerate about other things that I\u2019m going to talk about, can you rely on him to reach that high degree of certainty that the Judge is going to tell you about beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty? Are you going to be able to believe him?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u201cWhat did [the victim] tell you when he came in here . . . ? He said, on his way in to the Store 24, he stopped and noticed this man outside. And that\u2019s when he said, \u2018Yes, I noticed the face and the hat didn\u2019t go together.\u2019 Well, tell us about his facial features. He had \u2014 he told you, \u2018Oh, yes, he had a sloping forehead and he had a normal negroid shape, were his words, short curly hair and sloping eyelids.\u2019 He got a good look at him. He was able to give that kind of detailed description of that man that he saw standing outside the store. And he said that as he walked out and turned around, he recognized that same face to be the man that was following him.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u201cBut, twelve days after the incident, he was asked, \u2018Did you get a look at him at all during the straggle? Not clearly, no. \u2018He was behind me all the time.\u2019 Well, did you get a good look at him at all? \u2018Yes, briefly, but mostly or particularly while he was running away.\u2019 And, every time at the grand jury when he was asked, what did he look like, what did his face look like, he said, \u2018He was a black gentleman.\u2019 He got the race and he got the sex. But that was all he could say.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">\u201cNow, sixteen months later, he\u2019s coming in here under oath and telling you that he had this great opportunity to observe and he really paid attention and he really got the details of the face down. Does that give you confidence that he\u2019s in here telling you the truth, or does that sound like someone who is exaggerating?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">\u201cHe was asked at the grand jury or asked at the hearing in September, well, describe the face to us. Did you see the man in the MIT hat\u2019s face [sz'c]? That was the question. And he said, \u2018It was a typical African-American face. He seemed to me to be normal in every way.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">\u201cNow, can you imagine for a second somebody saying that about a white person?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Because of the potentially inflammatory nature of the cross-examination, counsel should have requested a sidebar conference to alert the judge as to his intention and the basis for his question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, ante </em>535, 540 n.2 (2000). A judge may require an offer of proof or a voir dire of the subject to determine the scope of the cross-examination that will be permitted. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>365 Mass. 484, 496 (1974) (\u201cThe judge presiding over the trial of a case has the power to keep the examination of witnesses within the limits of common decency and fairness, and he has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>duty to exercise that power promptly and firmly when it becomes necessary to do so\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">We need not address the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial made after clos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ing arguments. The defendant\u2019s argument that he is entitled to inquire as to racial bias without need of a good faith showing is without merit.
