(Wynn &amp; Wynn or firm), discriminated against Jill Carmichael on the basis of her sex when it failed to hire her as an associate on her graduation from law school. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We determine that the judge in the Superior Court correctly concluded that Wynn &amp; Wynn was not entitled to a jury trial. In addition, we conclude that the decision of the commission concerning the discriminatory failure to hire was supported by substantial evidence and was consistent with applicable law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). We affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>On May 18, 1992, Carmichael filed her discrimination complaint with the commission charging Wynn &amp; Wynn with failure to hire her on the basis of her sex. On August 18, 1992, Carmichael alleged additional claims for sexual harassment and disparate treatment while she was employed as a law clerk. On December 1, 1992, the MCAD investigating commissioner found probable cause to credit all of Carmichael\u2019s allegations. Conciliation efforts proved unsuccessful, and the matter was certified for a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In October and November, 1994, a four-day public hearing was held before an MCAD hearing officer. One year later, on November 16, 1995, the hearing officer issued her findings of fact and conclusions of law. She found in favor of Carmichael on her failure to hire claim, and awarded her damages for lost back wages and for emotional distress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She denied Carmichael\u2019s claim for front pay, and dismissed as untimely her claims of sexual harassment and disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Wynn &amp; Wynn appealed to the commission, and Carmichael cross-appealed. On September 30, 1996, the commission affirmed the decision in all respects. The commission also concluded that Carmichael had \u201cprevailed,\u201d and awarded her attorney\u2019s fees and costs. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Wynn &amp; Wynn filed a complaint for judicial review in the Superior Court, challenging the MCAD\u2019s ruling that it had failed to hire Carmichael because of her sex, and the award of fees and costs. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Carmichael filed a counterclaim seeking to set aside so much of the commission\u2019s decision as denied her damages for front pay and dismissed her sexual harassment and disparate treatment claims as untimely. In the alternative, Carmichael asked the judge to enforce the decision of the commission, and to award her attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Both Wynn &amp; Wynn and the commission moved to dismiss Carmichael\u2019s counterclaim as an \u201cappeal\u201d that had not been filed within the requisite thirty-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>filing period. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1). A Superior Court judge denied their motions. Wynn &amp; Wynn then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, as did Carmichael. The judge affirmed all aspects of the commission\u2019s decision, and judgment entered on September 12, 1997. Wynn &amp; Wynn and Carmichael filed timely appeals. Carmichael filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which the Superior Court judge awarded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On December 23, 1997, we issued our decision in <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>426 Mass. 332 (1997), holding that in a discrimination case a respondent has the same right to a jury trial as a complainant after the MCAD has taken final action. On January 9, 1998, Wynn &amp; Wynn moved to set aside the judgment of the Superior Court and for a jury trial, which the judge denied. Wynn &amp; Wynn appealed from that decision. We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion, and treat the appeals as consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">1. <em>The commission decision. </em>Under the State Administrative Procedure Act, we defer to the fact-finding function of the commission where substantial evidence exists to support its findings and there is no error of law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7); <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 133 (1976). The employment decision adverse to Carmichael that the hearing officer concluded was unlawful was made at a meeting in April, 1991, following which Carmichael, then a law student employed as a law clerk at Wynn &amp; Wynn, was told by a managing partner that there were no openings for an associate. We summarize the facts as determined by the hearing officer,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> supplementing her findings, as appropriate, with facts from the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">. Carmichael attended New England School of Law as a full-time student from September, 1988, to December, 1991. She passed the Massachusetts bar examination in February, 1992, and was sworn in as an attorney in June, 1992. In November, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>1989, while she was a law student, Carmichael obtained a position as a law clerk at Wynn &amp; Wynn in its Fall River office.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Carmichael\u2019s interview for that position was with Charles Murray, the managing partner of the Fall River office. During the interview she informed Murray that she was married, had a small child, and planned to have additional children in the future.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Carmichael was not pregnant at the time: she was not asked to, nor did she, volunteer this information. She was hired and, within a few days, began work as a law clerk. Her second child was born on September 28, 1990, approximately ten months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Throughout her tenure as a law clerk, Carmichael worked almost exclusively for William McKeon, an associate, later a partner, on a complex, multi-party litigation case, performing duties in the nature of paralegal work. During the academic year she worked approximately three days a week; during the summers she worked full time. We defer until later discussion the findings concerning Carmichael\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment by McKeon. See part 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In March, 1991, Carmichael asked to meet with Murray to discuss a raise, which Murray authorized; he also agreed to ask any attorneys supervising her to submit written evaluations of her work. Later that month Carmichael told Murray that she wished to be considered for an associate position with Wynn &amp; Wynn on her graduation from law school in December, 1991.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He said he would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">At Murray\u2019s initiative, in April, 1991, Carmichael\u2019s request to become an associate was discussed at a meeting of the attorneys in the Fall River office.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The hearing officer found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Murray expressed concern that (in his view) Carmichael had failed to inform him that she was pregnant when he hired her as a law clerk; he felt this indicated a lack of forthrightness on her part. Three other attorneys, Catherine Murphy, Laurie Mullen, and William Kenney each testified, however, that during the meeting Murray stated \u201cflatly\u201d that he would not have hired Carmichael as a law clerk had he known that she was pregnant, and that Carmichael\u2019s priorities were \u201celsewhere,\u201d presumably with raising a family instead of the practice of law. They said, and the hearing officer found, that Murray informed the group that he was going to tell Carmichael that there was no position available.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Murray denied making these statements, but the hearing officer did not credit his testimony. Three witnesses also testified that, after Murray made his comments, McKeon seemed shocked and stated, \u201cI\u2019m glad you said that and not me.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVz\">The hearing officer found that, although Murray told Carmichael that there were no openings, another law clerk was under consideration as an associate attorney. Moreover, three months later Murray hired a new associate, Gary Vancini, a Rhode Island lawyer with less than one year of legal experience. Carmichael immediately confronted Murray, who insisted that Vancini was in a different category. In August, 1991, Carmichael met with Attorney Kevin O\u2019Malley, who supervised the firm\u2019s law clerk program.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He informed her that her evaluations were excellent, that there was \u201cnot a black mark on them,\u201d but that, due to the hiring of Vancini, there was no position available in Fall River. Carmichael was again upset. Even then she sent a copy of her resume to the firm\u2019s named partner at its main office and asked to be considered for a position at any Wynn &amp; Wynn office. When Carmichael left Wynn &amp; Wynn in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>November, 1991, shortly before her graduation, she had heard nothing about her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The hearing officer found that until March, 1992, Carmichael had no reason to believe that her earlier pregnancy had anything to do with the decision not to hire her. A chance encounter with William Kenney, who by then had left the firm, led her to speak to Laurie Mullen and Catherine Murphy. They relayed to her the events of the April, 1991, meeting at which Carmichael\u2019s future at the firm had been discussed. Carmichael filed her discrimination charge shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The hearing officer made detailed findings concerning Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s explanation of its failure to hire Carmichael as an associate attorney. First, it said Carmichael\u2019s performance as a law clerk had been unacceptable. The hearing officer reviewed the testimony of various attorneys who had worked with Carmichael, credited some, and discredited others. She found that Carmichael had never received substantive negative feedback during her entire employment at the firm, and that Murray\u2019s evaluation of Carmichael was not credible and was tainted by sexism.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Wynn &amp; Wynn also claimed that Carmichael had not been offered an associate\u2019s position because no <em>entry-level </em>position existed at the time. The hearing officer found otherwise: shortly after the adverse employment decision (April, 1991), Murray had in fact hired associate Gary Vancini. The hearing officer also found that when associates Mullen and Murphy left the firm in February, 1992, Carmichael was not offered either of their positions; she found those associates were \u201creplaced by male attorneys.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Until the spring of 1992, Carmichael continued to believe that an attorney position would be offered to her if one became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The hearing officer concluded that Carmichael had demonstrated \u201cby direct evidence\u201d that discriminatory animus was a \u201cfactor\u201d in the decision not to hire her. She pointed to the array of witnesses who had testified credibly that Murray, the managing partner \u201cultimately responsible\u201d for Carmichael\u2019s hiring,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> had said he would inform Carmichael that there were no available openings in the face of evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The hearing officer concluded that Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>hire Carmichael as an attorney was the result of a determination \u201ctainted by sex discrimination.\u201d The decision, she said, may have resulted \u201cin part\u201d from concerns about Carmichael\u2019s performance, but the unlawful considerations were the \u201creal reason\u201d Carmichael was not offered a position. Murray, she concluded, was responsible for the decision not to hire Carmichael, and his expressed opinions with respect to her pregnancy \u201creveal a bias that tainted his estimation of her potential as an attorney and that was the primary factor influencing his decision not to offer her a position.\u201d The hearing officer also concluded that the conduct of McKeon and Murray pointed to \u201ca pervasive attitude of sexism\u201d that existed in the Fall River office; see part 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>2. Right to jury trial. </em>Wynn &amp; Wynn seeks retroactive application of our decision in <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>426 Mass. 332 (1997). The judge in the Superior Court denied the firm\u2019s motion for a new trial, reasoning that retroactive application of <em>Lavelle </em>to this case was not appropriate under the standards of <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Associates Fin. Servs. Co. of Mass., 367 </em>Mass. 708, 712 (1975). He further concluded that, even if a new trial was warranted,'Wynn &amp; Wynn had failed to preserve its right to a jury. We agree, but for somewhat different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Prior to our decision in <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 657 (1996), we applied the three-factor analysis described in <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Associates Fin. Servs. Co. of Mass., supra, </em>to determine whether a rule should have retroactive application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>MacCormack, </em>we concluded that the \u201cissue of retroactivity may be resolved more simply.\u201d <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 656. To eradicate \u201cselective temporal barriers\u201d to the application of claims under our State Constitution in civil cases, we determined that we would give retroactive effect to a new constitutional rule, such as <em>Lavelle,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to all litigants with live claims, i.e., those litigants with cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>still open on direct review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 656-658. In <em>Lavelle </em>we applied the rule recognizing the right of a respondent in a discrimination case to a jury trial to the parties before us. See <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 339. Because this case was pending on direct review at the time <em>Lavelle </em>was decided, it is appropriate to give retroactive effect here to that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">But that is not the end of our inquiry because Carmichael and the commission insist that Wynn &amp; Wynn did not, in any event, preserve its right to a jury trial. We have recognized that it would be manifestly unfair to conclude that a party waived a constitutional issue by failing to raise it before the theory on which its argument is premised \u201chas been sufficiently developed to put him on notice that the issue is a live issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowler, </em>407 Mass. 304, 307 (1990). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 587-588 (1978). We, therefore, must determine whether a respondent\u2019s right to a jury trial was sufficiently developed when Wynn &amp; Wynn could have, but did not, assert that right. We have little hesitancy in concluding that it was. The right to a trial by a jury is recognized in art. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See also Mass. R. Civ. R 38 (a), 365 Mass. 800 (1974) (right of trial by jury \u201cshall be preserved to the parties inviolate\u201d). Presented with any claim to a trial by jury in a discrimination case under G. L. c. 151B, we consistently have recognized that right as sacred. See <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 655 (extending the right to trial by jury to claims for unlawful retaliation); <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Info. Resources Co., </em>419 Mass. 792, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>794-795 (1995) (plaintiff constitutionally entitled to trial by jury for claim of employment discrimination based on physical handicap); <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220, 226 (1994) (\u201cplaintiff is constitutionally entitled to a trial by jury for her claim of employment discrimination based on sex\u201d). Our decision in <em>Lavelle </em>was the inevitable jurisprudential step that followed <em>Dalis </em>and <em>MacCormack\u2019, </em>we had not intimated in any respect that a respondent in a discrimination case had no such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Wynn &amp; Wynn argues that it could not have asserted a jury claim before <em>Lavelle </em>because its right had not been recognized. But that is exactly what was done in every other case in which the right to a jury trial in a discrimination case was at issue: the party asserting the right properly preserved the issue. See <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 334; <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 654; <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., supra </em>at 221. See also <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Info. Resources Co., supra </em>at <em>792-793;'Dean </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 911 (1995). It required no clairvoyance to anticipate the conclusion we reached in <em>Lavelle. </em>Indeed, Wynn &amp; Wynn seems to have anticipated it; it acknowledges that it intended to seek a right to a jury trial from the appellate court on appeal. The Superior Court judge was correct to conclude that Wynn &amp; Wynn waived its right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">3. <em>The discriminatory failure to hire. </em>Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s challenge to the conclusion <em>that it </em>unlawfully failed to hire Carmichael may be succinctly summarized. Carmichael had the burden, it argues, to prove as part of her \u201cprima facie\u201d case that there was an opening for an <em>entry-level </em>associate attorney. Even if the hearing officer correctly concluded that Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s reasons were a pretext, it continues, Carmichael faced a further \u201cinsurmountable hurdle\u201d: to prove as part of her prima facie case that a male entry-level associate was actually hired in her place. Wynn &amp; Wynn misapprehends our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In cases involving discrimination on a forbidden ground (here sex), the initial burden is on the complainant to produce evidence of unlawful discrimination. She may meet that burden in one of two ways: by direct evidence<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or indirectly, by circumstantial evidence. See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 137-138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(1976). The hearing officer concluded, and the commission agreed, that Carmichael had produced direct evidence sufficient to meet her burden. For reasons we shall explain, that conclusion is supported by substantial evidence and is not based on any error of law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Many of our cases examining the Massachusetts discrimination statute have discussed the shifting allocations of evidentiary burdens, adhering to the three-stage framework explicated in the two leading Federal discrimination cases, <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs </em>v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-253 (1981), and <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-805 (1973). See, e.g., <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 444-445 (1995); <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 134-136. In <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that there is often no direct evidence of discrimination; it adopted a three-stage approach to proof that would enable a plaintiff to prevail in the absence of direct evidence if other evidence is sufficient to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant has discriminated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In other words, the <em>McDonnell-Burdine </em>allocation of evidentiary burdens \u201cpresupposed that the evidence of unlawful discrimination would be circumstantial.\u201d <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 298 (1991), citing <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>469 U.S. Ill, 121 (1985) <em>(\u201cMcDonnell Douglas </em>test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Under that now familiar approach, a plaintiff has the initial burden to establish a prima facie case. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 441.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Once she succeeds in doing so, the burden of production shifts to the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>to \u201carticulat[e] a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the adverse employment action. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 136. Once the employer meets its burden, it falls to the plaintiff in the final stage to prove that the employer\u2019s reason proffered in stage two is just a \u201cpretext.\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 442. This three-stage process is premised on the idea \u201cthat <em>either </em>a legitimate <em>or </em>an illegitimate set of considerations led to the challenged decision\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 247 (1989) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">There exists, however, a rare class of cases, referred to as \u201cmixed-motive\u201d cases, in which the plaintiff, armed with some strong (direct) evidence of discriminatory bias, demonstrates that at least one factor motivating the employer\u2019s decision is illegitimate. This is such a case. The inquiry in these cases is not whether a legitimate reason for the employment is a \u201cpretext.\u201d Rather, the appropriate question is whether the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reason <em>also </em>motivated the employment decision and, if so, to what extent: \u201c[I]f a plaintiff in an unlawful discrimination case shows that an impermissible motive played a part in an employment decision, an employer may not-prevail by showing, as in <em>McDonnell-Burdine, </em>a legitimate reason for its decision; the employer \u2018instead must show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., supra </em>at 301, quoting <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The mixed-motive analysis is limited \u201cto those infrequent cases in which a plaintiff can demonstrate with a high degree of assurance that the employment decision of which [she] complains \u2018was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fernandes </em>v. <em>Costa Bros. Masonry, </em>199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir. 1999), quoting <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 247. A plaintiff proceeding down the mixed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>motive path<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> can meet her initial burden only by direct or strong evidence that proscribed criteria played a motivating part in an employment decision. See <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 244. Direct evidence in this context is evidence that, \u201cif believed, results in an inescapable, or at least highly probable, inference that a forbidden bias was present in the workplace.\u201d <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., supra </em>at 300. Stray remarks in the workplace, statements by people without the power to make employment decisions, and statements made by decision makers unrelated to the decisional process itself do not suffice to satisfy the plaintiffs threshold burden in these cases. See <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 277 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., supra </em>at 302 (\u201c[s]tray remarks suggestive of impermissible bias do not constitute the sort of evidence that places a case in the mixed motive category\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In this case the hearing officer correctly concluded that Carmichael had met her initial burden by demonstrating with direct evidence that discriminatory animus was a factor in the decision not to hire her. The statements by Murray at the April, 1991, meeting were not stray remarks. They were made by a person with the power to make employment decisions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, his statements related to the decisional process itself. Faced with direct evidence of gender discrimination, the hearing officer correctly did not require Carmichael to meet her threshold burden by proving in addition a \u201cpretext\u201d case using the classic four-part test for the first stage described in <em>Wheelock </em>and <em>Blare. </em>Rather, the hearing officer correctly evaluated Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s proffered reasons for informing Carmichael that no position was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>available,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> concluded that the decision not to offer Carmichael a position may have resulted \u201cin part\u201d from concerns about her performance, rejected Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s claim that no position was available,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and concluded that Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s actions were motivated primarily by unlawful discriminatory animus. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We have concluded that, using the mixed-motive framework, the hearing officer\u2019s findings were fully supported and there was no error of law. Wynn &amp; Wynn confined its challenge to her rulings concerning Carmichael\u2019s threshold burden of proof. In the interest of clarity, we now articulate the analysis that should be applied beyond the threshold stage when a mixed-motive framework is invoked in a discrimination case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>This case presents our first opportunity since <em>Price Water-house </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1989 to explicate the respective burdens of proof in a discrimination action under G. L. c. 15 IB where it has been shown that an employment decision resulted from a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives. <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130 (1976), was a pretext case decided long before <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra. </em>While <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437 (1995), was decided after <em>Price Waterhouse, Blare </em>is also a classic pretext case, and made no mention of <em>Price Waterhouse.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Later cases also did not give occasion to discuss <em>Price-Waterhouse. </em>See, e.g., <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1 (1998); <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122 (1997). Prior to <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>we held that in a mixed-motive case arising under our Labor Relations Act, G. L. c. 150A, the burden of persuasion remained with the plaintiff at every stage. See <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 559, 565-566 (1981). Following <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>however, the Appeals Court, in <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., supra </em>at 302, understandably followed the change in Federal law implicitly recognizing that many of the Federal cases we relied on in <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>were, in effect, overruled by <em>Price Waterhouse. </em>We now remove any doubt that the analysis contained in <em>Johansen </em>was correct; we follow the guidance of the United States Supreme Court with respect to the allocation of burdens of proof in mixed-motive cases.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Under the mixed-motive framework, the plaintiff must first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a proscribed factor played a motivating part in the challenged employment decision. Once the plaintiff carries her initial burden, the burden of persuasion<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> shifts to the defendant who \u201cmay avoid a finding of liability only by proving that it would have made the same decision\u201d even without the illegitimate motive.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 244-245. See <em>Northeast Metro. Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 89 n.1 (1991); <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., supra </em>at 299 (when evidence of \u201cdeclared animus or discrimination against the protected group ... in the employment setting the employer was required not only to prove that there was a lawful reason for the employment decision but also to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same employment decision even though it may have taken . . . gender . . . or other improper characterization into account\u201d). Cf. <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>401 Mass. 506, 509 (1988), quoting <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 566. Of course, once the plaintiff has met her initial burden of persuasion on the presence of an illegitimate motive, the decision whether the employer has met its burden of proving that another legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason actually led it to make the decision is normally for the jury or other finder of fact to decide. Cf. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., supra </em>at 127 (\u201cSummary judgment is admittedly a disfavored remedy in discrimination cases based on disparate treatment\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The rulings of the commission were consistent with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>formulation, even though it did not recognize explicitly that Wynn &amp; Wynn had the burden to proffer an affirmative defense against Carmichael\u2019s proof of direct evidence of discrimination. See note 30, <em>supra. </em>The commission\u2019s ruling and the trial judge\u2019s affirmation of its ruling were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">4. <em>The dismissal of Carmichael\u2019s other claims. </em>The hearing officer made findings concerning Carmichael\u2019s claims of sexual harassment.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> She credited Carmichael\u2019s testimony that, throughout her employment at Wynn &amp; Wynn, McKeon subjected Carmichael to harassing behavior. He told sexual jokes daily, referring to himself as her \u201cmaster\u201d and her as his \u201cservant.\u201d He commented on her clothing and the outline of her undergarments, and admonished her for not wearing nylons when she was pregnant because she did not have \u201ctan, shapely legs.\u201d The hearing officer also credited Carmichael\u2019s testimony that McKeon made demeaning remarks about female attorneys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>and commented on several occasions that a particularly assertive opposing female attorney must be a lesbian.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Carmichael filed her sexual harassment and disparate treatment claims in August, 1992. The hearing officer concluded that Carmichael did not meet the six-month statutory deadline, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, because she raised these claims for the first time eight months after she left Wynn &amp; Wynn and three months after she filed her original complaint. She further concluded that the claims did not relate back to the initial filing, 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(6)(a) (1999),<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> because the allegations were known to Carmichael at the time of and prior to the filing of her initial complaint. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">As to her claim of \u201crelating back,\u201d Carmichael relies on several Federal cases holding that a discrimination claim encompasses the allegations of the initial complaint and any resulting investigation that reasonably would be expected to grow out of those charges. See, e.g., <em>Yarber </em>v. <em>Indiana State Prison, </em>713 F. Supp. 271, 275 (N.D. Ind. 1988), quoting <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Blue Cross Mut. Hosp. Ins., Inc., </em>538 F.2d 164, 167 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 986 (1976) (scope of complaint includes investigation that would \u201creasonably be expected to grow out of the charge\u201d). See also <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., </em>751 F. Supp. 1565, 1572 (E.D.N.Y. 1990) (same); <em>Avagliano </em>v. <em>Sumitomo Shoji Am., Inc., </em>614 F. Supp. 1397, 1403 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (same). But Carmichael\u2019s additional claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sexual harassment did not \u201cgrow out of\u201d her claim of failure to hire, nor did Carmichael (or the investigating officer) discover the facts supporting her sexual harassment claim in the course of investigating her failure to hire claim. While the rules of \u201crelation back\u201d are liberal, cf. Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. R 15 (c), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 426 (Lexis 1999), they are not so broad as to encompass any claim that was known to the complainant that could have been brought in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Carmichael next contends that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because she was unaware of her statutory rights: there was no notice, she claims, displayed at the Wynn &amp; Wynn offices as required by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The six-month statutory deadline mandated by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, is \u201cin effect a statute of limitations subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Christo </em>v. <em>Edward G. Boyle Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 815, 817 (1988). See <em>Agin </em>v. <em>Federal White Cement, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 669, 672 n.8 (1994). But the doctrine of equitable tolling \u201cis applicable only where the prospective plaintiff did not have, and could not have had with due diligence, the information essential to bringing suit.\u201d <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 631 (1997). Carmichael was aware from the outset of the facts that would point to her sexual harassment and disparate treatment claims. See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>418 Mass. 394, 398 (1994). Reasonable diligence would surely have revealed to Carmichael that the Commonwealth for decades has provided both administrative and judicial relief for the victims of sex discrimination, and that sexual harassment of the kind described by Carmichael and found to be credible is not condoned. There was no error.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">5. <em>Damages award. </em>We turn now to address the challenges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>both Wynn &amp; Wynn and Carmichael to the damages awarded by the commission. Wynn &amp; Wynn disputes the damages awarded for back pay and emotional distress, as well as the commission\u2019s award to Carmichael of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Carmichael challenges the failure to award her damages for lost front pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On a finding of discrimination, the commission has the authority to grant such relief as is appropriate, including lost wages and benefits, damages for emotional distress, and, in appropriate circumstances, compensatory damages for loss of future earning capacity. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. See <em>Lavelle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>426 Mass. 332, 337 (1997). The formulation of the type of relief appropriate in a particular case is within the commission\u2019s discretion, see <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 315-317 (1976), provided any damages awarded are supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 182 (1985) (emotional distress). See also <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 390 (1988) (G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9, authorizes an award of damages for loss of future earnings and benefits that have been proved with reasonable certainty as attributable to employer\u2019s misconduct subject to employee\u2019s duty to mitigate); <em>St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 782, 782-783 (1975) (back pay).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">(a) <em>Back pay. </em>Wynn &amp; Wynn challenges the award of back pay, an issue it did not raise either before the commission or in the Superior Court. The judge did not reach the question, presumably for that reason. Objections, issues, or claims \u2014 however meritorious \u2014 that have not been raised in the trial court are deemed to have been waived on appeal. See <em>Mc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>Namara </em>v. <em>Honeyman, </em>406 Mass. 43, 53 (1989); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 338 (1997). Accordingly, we do not address any of Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s challenges to this aspect of the damage award.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">(b) <em>Emotional distress. </em>The hearing officer also found that Carmichael suffered emotional distress as a direct result of Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s unlawful actions and made detailed findings to that effect. \u201c[T]he finding of [discrimination] alone permit[s] the inference of emotional distress as a normal adjunct of the [employer\u2019s] actions.\u201d <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 182, quoting <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 317. In any event, the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that Carmichael\u2019s emotional trauma resulted from Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s own discriminatory conduct was fully supported by substantial evidence in the form of compelling testimony by Carmichael. See, e.g., <em>Franklin Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 974, 975 (1988). We reject Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s argument that any emotional distress Carmichael did suffer was caused by various personal problems Carmichael faced at the time, the stress of the litigation, or from McKeon\u2019s sexually harassing conduct, rather than from Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s discriminatory conduct. While there may have been evidence to that effect, the hearing officer plainly weighed all of the testimony, and reached her own conclusion as to credibility and the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The damages were neither greatly disproportionate to the injury proved, nor did they represent a miscarriage of justice. <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 824 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">(c) <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Wynn &amp; Wynn claims that the commission erred in awarding Carmichael her attorney\u2019s fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>because she did not prevail on \u201ctwo of her three claims,\u201d nor was she entitled to fees to litigate the \u201cdistinctly different\u201d claims on which she did not prevail. The commission determined that the interrelationship of the successful failure to hire claim and the unsuccessful sexual harassment claim was substantial, but reduced the award by ten per cent to reflect that Carmichael did not prevail on the latter.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The commission\u2019s conclusions are well within the permissible bounds of its discretion. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Winchester School Comm., </em>14 M.D.L.R. 1079 (1992). Cf. <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993) (\u201cThe amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, awarded on the basis of statutory authority, in this case G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, is largely discretionary with the judge . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Wynn &amp; Wynn further complains that Carmichael\u2019s attorneys billed in quarter-hour increments, and should have billed in one-tenth of an hour increments. The commission may, and did, consider the time increments used to account for time spent on this matter. As a general matter, billing in one-tenth of an hour increments is preferable, and there may be circumstances in which billing in quarter-hour increments results in an inflation of hours for certain tasks. But it falls within the discretion of the commission to determine whether there should be a reduction in a particular case; we see no reason to impose a per se rule that attorney\u2019s fees billed in quarter-hour increments must be reduced in every case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">(d) <em>Front pay. </em>The hearing officer made no award of front pay to Carmichael finding that any such award would be \u201centirely speculative\u201d in light of the existing economic conditions, because there was no reliable means of determining how long Carmichael would have remained with Wynn &amp; Wynn had she been hired. The hearing officer is warranted in refusing to award front pay if the amount is not reasonably ascertainable.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>See <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 390 (1988). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">6. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. </em>Carmichael has moved for an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs.

Moreover, an associate with less than one year\u2019s experience was hired shortly thereafter (July, 1991) and there was evidence that Wynn &amp; Wynn viewed associates with zero to two years\u2019 experience as interchangeable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Wynn &amp; Wynn challenges the hearing officer\u2019s finding that associates Laurie Mullen and Catherine Murphy \u201cwere replaced by male attorneys.\u201d It argues that three departing attorneys (Kenney, Mullen, and Murphy) were replaced by two attorneys, James O\u2019Rourke and Clement Brown, both experienced attorneys (sixteen years and five years, respectively) with \u201ctransportable business.\u201d Because we conclude, as a matter of law, that Carmichael was not required to prove that she was rejected in favor of a male, entry-level associate attorney, whether Mullen and Murphy were \u201creplaced\u201d by \u201cmale attorneys\u201d is irrelevant. We note, however, that there was uncontested evidence that three associates (Kenney, Muller, and Murphy) left the Fall River office in early 1992. It is a reasonable inference that at least one associate was needed to replace them. Wynn &amp; Wynn in fact advertised on two occasions that spring for an associate with zero to two years of experience, and the hearing officer was not required to credit Wynn &amp; Wynn\u2019s explanation that the advertisements were to address some internal reallocation of attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">We find it necessary to clarify the respective burdens in order to resolve a conflict in some cases. Compare <em>Brownlie </em>v. <em>Kanzaki Specialty Papers, Inc., </em>44 Mass.

Massachusetts trial judges have applied the burdens of proof in mixed-motive cases in conflicting, or at least equivocal, ways.

L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, may proceed on one or both of the available analytic frameworks, namely the mixed-motive and or pretext frameworks, to establish her case against an employer, depending on the nature of the evidence. In most cases the plaintiff will proceed on both theories simply because the structure of presentation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>evidence does not differ. The plaintiff should present evidence to establish a prima facie case under <em>Blare. </em>At the same time, the plaintiff should also present any direct evidence of discriminatory animus in the decisional process. The defendant should then present its case, including any legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment decision. Once all the evidence is received, the judge should decide whether the mixed-motive or pretext framework properly applies to the evidence. If the plaintiff succeeded in satisfying the mixed-motive threshold, the case should be decided based on whether the defendant \u201ccan prove that, even if it had not taken [the proscribed factor] into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra </em>at 242.

If the plaintiff fails to satisfy the mixed-motive threshold, and a prima facie case is established, the case should be decided under the \u201cpretext\u201d case principles described in <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys.

And to the extent the pregnancy claim can be seen as a disparate treatment claim, pregnant women are treated different or mothers, that also can be seen as a disparate treatment claim.\u201d Because we determine that this claim was untimely, we need not resolve whether Carmichael abandoned it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The hearing officer also found that while Carmichael was breast feeding her infant, she made arrangements to express breast milk at the office. On those occasions, Carmichael secluded herself in her office with a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on her door. On one occasion McKeon \u201cbarged into her office\u201d while her breasts were exposed, ignoring her request for privacy.

L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Rather, it points out, Carmichael relied on a late-filed counterclaim. The commission made a similar argument in the Superior Court in support of its motion to dismiss Carmichael\u2019s counterclaim. It does not press that point on appeal.
