See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The defendant, Oriol Soto, asserts that his second motion for a new trial should have been allowed because the judge did not advise him properly as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The Appeals Court reversed the order denying the motion for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 914 (1999). We vacate the order denying the defendant\u2019s second motion for a new trial and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>1. <em>Prior proceedings and facts. </em>The defendant was charged with trafficking in excess of 200 grams of cocaine in 1987. After a trial by jury in 1988, the defendant was convicted and sentenced. In 1990, the defendant filed an assented-to motion for a new trial. After hearing, the defendant\u2019s assented-to motion for a new trial was allowed \u201cin the interests of justice.\u201d In November, 1990, the defendant pleaded guilty to so much of the indictment as alleged possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. The Commonwealth and defense counsel agreed to the defendant\u2019s being sentenced to time served. The defendant was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In 1997, the defendant filed a motion to vacate his 1990 plea alleging that the judge did not comply with G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. A Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, endorsing the motion: \u201cAfter review of all documents and transcripts, motion denied without hearing since defendant was warned by court.\u201d The defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The record reflects that, in 1990, when the defendant offered a plea to so much of the indictment as alleged possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, the defendant was advised by the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">The judge: \u201cAre you a citizen of the United States?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">The defendant: \u201cI\u2019m not, but my wife and kids, they are legal, but I\u2019m legal in this country since 1979, since 1981.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">The judge: \u201cAll right, I am required to inform you that a conviction based on your plea of guilty could result in your being denied citizenship, or for that matter, being deported. Do you understand that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">The judge: \u201cAnd understanding that, do you still wish to plead guilty?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">The defendant: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Subsequent to that plea in May, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated proceedings to remove the defendant from the United States \u2014 he was in Puerto Rico at the time \u2014 because of his prior narcotics conviction. In the notice to appear, the INS classified him as an \u201carriving alien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, in pertinent part, requires the judge to advise a person pleading to criminal charges as follows: \u201cIf you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The judge at the plea colloquy did not advise the defendant that he could be excluded from admission to the United States. The Commonwealth does not argue otherwise. Rather, it claims that all that is required is that a defendant know his guilty plea may have immigration consequences. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 666 (1989). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Lamrini </em>is unpersuasive. The warnings in <em>Lamrini </em>were \u201cbarely adequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. As the Appeals Court noted, \u201c[t]he better practice would have been for the judge to read directly from the statute . . . <em>Id. </em>Lamrini knew the exact consequences of her plea \u2014 deportation. By contrast, in this case the defendant was not told he could be excluded from admission to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The Legislature has put the three required warnings in quotation marks, and each of them is required to be given so that a person pleading guilty knows exactly what immigration consequences his or her guilty plea may have. It is incumbent on the judge to notify a defendant that there are three specific consequences to a plea: (1) deportation; (2) exclusion of admission to the United States; and (3) denial of naturalization. A defendant must be advised of all three consequences of his plea. The words of the statute do not permit any other interpretation. \u201cWe are not free to ignore or to tamper with that clear expression of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661, 664 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea is vacated. An order shall enter allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and vacating the judgment. This matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
