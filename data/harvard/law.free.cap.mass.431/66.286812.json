L. c. 32, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge affirmed the decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s hourly pay is not included as part of \u201c[rjegular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>compensation\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. We transferred the case here on our own motion, and now affirm the judge\u2019s decision but on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>The facts are undisputed. The plaintiff taught in the Swampscott public schools for thirty-five years. In addition to his regular teaching duties, he was appointed as the director of the driver education program in 1982, and served in that capacity until his retirement. During that time he also taught driver education with both a classroom component that took place before school hours and road instruction that took place after school hours.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>According to the collective bargaining agreement, the plaintiff was paid a specific sum for his service as the director of driver education, but was paid an hourly rate for the classroom and road instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The pertinent statute, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201c \u2018Regular compensation\u2019 . . . shall mean the full <em>salary, wages </em>or <em>other compensation </em>in whatever form .... In the case of a teacher employed in a public day school who is a member of the teachers\u2019 retirement system, <em>salary </em>payable under the terms of an annual contract141 for <em>additional services </em>in such a school <em>and also compensation </em>for services rendered by said teacher in connection with a school lunch program or for services in connection with a program of instruction of physical education and athletic contests . . . shall be regarded as regular compensation rather than as bonus or overtime and shall be included in the salary on which deductions are to be paid [to the retirement fund] ...\u201d (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">When the plaintiff retired, the teachers\u2019 retirement board (board) counted the fixed stipend the plaintiff earned as the director of driver education as regular compensation for purposes of calculating his retirement but ruled that <em>\u201chourly payments </em>made for classroom and on the road instruction . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>performed before school, after school, on weekends, during the summer vacation as well as other vacations\u201d were not counted as regular compensation (emphasis added). CRAB and the judge each affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In affirming CRAB\u2019s decision, the judge relied, as did CRAB, on Roberts <em>vs. </em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, Plymouth Superior Court, No. 93-1217 (Jan. 12, 1995), which turned on the meaning of the words \u201cin a public day school\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. Here we conclude that the plain language of the statute provides a more straightforward solution to this case and does not require us to decide either the meaning of the phrases \u201cpublic day school\u201d and \u201cin such a school\u201d or whether the Roberts case controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The statute provides that, for teachers, only \u201csalary\u201d for \u201cadditional services\u201d is part of regular compensation. There is no disagreement that the plaintiff\u2019s driver education classroom and road instruction constituted \u201cadditional services.\u201d Therefore, the issue is whether the plaintiff\u2019s hourly payments constitute \u201csalary\u201d for those additional services. Unless it is a technical term, \u201cwords and phrases [in a statute] shall be construed according to [their] common an.d approved usage.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. See <em>Coco </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boylston, </em>392 Mass 221, 224 (1984) (absent contrary legislative intent, words in statute should be accorded their plain and ordinary meaning). Although a common use of the word \u201csalary\u201d is \u201c[a] reward or recompense for services performed,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1337 (6th ed. 1990), the term \u201csalary\u201d has another common use that is more limited \u2014 \u201cA fixed periodical compensation paid for services rendered. A stated compensation paid periodically as by the year, month, or other fixed period, in <em>contrast to wages which are normally based on an hourly </em>rate\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>See S.C. Moriearty, J.F. Adkins, &amp; S.L. Lipsitz, Employment Law \u00a7 14.1, at 493 (1995 &amp; Supp. 1999) (discussing overtime exemption rules as applied to \u201csalary rather than an hourly rate\u201d). Furthermore, in <em>Coco </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boylston, supra </em>at 224, and cases cited, where the meaning of the word \u201csalary\u201d in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43, was at issue, we said, \u201c[t]here is considerable authority from other jurisdictions, and some guidance from Massachusetts precedent, for interpreting the term \u2018salary\u2019 to refer to a fixed annual or periodic amount of pay depending upon the period of employment rather than upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the number of days or hours worked within that period.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This interpretation of the word \u201csalary\u201d also comports with the statutory definition provided in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-seventh: \u201c \u2018Salary\u2019 shall mean annual salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It is the common, but more limited, fixed payment definition that applies to the term \u201csalary\u201d in this case. The definition of \u201c[r]egular compensation\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, starts with three terms: \u201csalary, wages or other compensation in whatever form.\u201d However, when the Legislature addressed teachers, it provided that only \u201csalary\u201d for additional services is part of regular compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">All words, clauses, and parts of a legislative enactment should be given force and effect and no part is to be brushed aside unless no other rational course is open. <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Gloucester, </em>316 Mass. 496, 500 (1944). Where words in a statute are used in one part of a statute in a definite sense, they should be given the same meaning in another part of the statute. <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 617 (1982), and cases cited. Where \u201cthe Legislature has carefully employed specific language in one paragraph of a statute . . . but not in others which treat the same topic . . . the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Ctr., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982). See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>429 Mass. 736, 744 (1999); <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, supra </em>at 616; <em>Boylston Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Tahanto Regional Sch. Dist., </em>353 Mass. 81, 83-84 (1967). The statute uses the words \u201csalary, wages or other compensation\u201d within their common meaning to connote the <em>distinct </em>ways individuals are paid for services. As discussed, wages are usually a different form of payment from salary. See <em>Coco </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boylston, supra. </em>If we were to include the plaintiff\u2019s hourly payments as part of his \u201csalary,\u201d we would not be giving force to all the words of the statute. Furthermore, the board\u2019s regulation uses only the word \u201csalary\u201d where it defines \u201cregular compensation.\u201d See 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.02 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The plaintiff argues that the words \u201cshall be included in the salary\u201d at the end of the definition of \u201c[r]egular compensation\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, show that the word \u201csalary\u201d is meant in its broadest sense of a reward for services performed. Although this argument has some facial appeal, we conclude that, in context, the term is used to describe what has become regular compensation by specific statutory provisions. Moreover, the statutory intent is clearly to exempt irregular payments of compensation from the retirement base. (In G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, the definition of \u201c[r]egular compensation\u201d excludes bonus, overtime, or severance pay.) Hourly compensation paid on an irregular basis is more akin to overtime payments than to annual salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In analyzing the meaning of \u201cregular compensation\u201d in another context, this court stated: \u201cThe expression seems to us to point to recurrent or repeated amounts of compensation not inflated by extraordinary ad hoc payments.\u201d <em>Boston Ass\u2019n of Sch. Adm\u2019rs &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336, 341 (1981). Regular compensation \u201crefers to remuneration geared to work or services performed; moreover \u2018regular,\u2019 as it modifies \u2018compensation,\u2019 imports the idea of ordinariness or normality as well as the idea of recurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing in the text or the title of the act persuades us that the Legislature intended to include periodic hourly payments as part of regular compensation for teachers for the purpose of determining retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-16\">Under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (2) <em>(a), </em>an employee\u2019s retirement allowance is based on the average annual \u201cregular compensation\u201d for the three years of creditable service preceding retirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The plaintiff also taught driver education during the summer months, but does not contend that the money earned for that service is included in his calculation for retirement. Payments for certain summer school employment are explicitly excluded by regulation. See 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.02(2)(b) (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u201c[A]nnual contract\u201d means collective bargaining agreement. See 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.01 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In <em>Coco </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boylston, </em>392 Mass. 221, 224-226 (1984), we stated that a school committee\u2019s decision to transfer a tenured physical education teacher to part-time status with a reduction in salary was prohibited by G.L. c. 71, \u00a7 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">By contrast, in the language addressing police officers, fire fighters, and certain employees of municipal departments, the statute uses \u201cmoney paid for holidays\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d when discussing what is to be included as \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
