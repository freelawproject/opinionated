The plaintiffs had sought the fees under three statutes that allow an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing\u201d party in such suits: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1994) (\u00a7 1988); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (1994) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. The department appealed, claiming that, due to the existence of special circumstances that would render the award of fees unjust, attorney\u2019s fees in this case should have been denied. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs, all mentally disabled residents of Worcester State Hospital and Westborough State Hospital, brought a civil rights class action against the department and certain of its officials pursuant to arts. 1, 10, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; arts. 93 and 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution; the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994) (\u00a7 1983); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 (1994); and the ADA for improper handling of funds possessed or received by the plaintiffs while residing in the hospitals, particularly for misappropriation of the plaintiffs\u2019 Social Security disability insurance benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties reached a settlement, which was approved by the court. The settlement provided for virtually all the relief the plaintiffs sought except for their claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The plaintiffs moved to recover attorney\u2019s fees for legal work performed by their MHLAC counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to receive attorney\u2019s fees and left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>amount of such award to be agreed on by the parties. In a \u201cStipulation of Settlement of Attorneys\u2019 Fees,\u201d the defendants agreed that the plaintiffs would be paid $40,000 for the work done by MHLAC if the defendants did not appeal the issue of \u201cMHLAC\u2019s entitlement to fees\u201d or lost such an appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge approved this stipulation of settlement, and subsequently dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Section 1988 authorizes a judge, in her discretion, to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in any action to enforce a provision of \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. See <em>Perini Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>419 Mass. 763, 772, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 822 (1995); <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 452 (1981), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>456 U.S. 947 (1982). The purpose of the statutory provisions permitting an award of attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing plaintiffs is both to promote civil rights enforcement and to deter civil rights violators, by encouraging private lawsuits aimed against civil rights abuses. See <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 631-632 (1978); <em>Coutin </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, P.R., Inc., </em>124 F.3d 331, 337 (1st Cir. 1997); S. Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3 (1976). See also <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u201cThere are essentially two prerequisites to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1988, both derived from the language of that section: first, that the applicant be considered a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 in the litigation; and second, that a court exercise its \u2018discretion\u2019 to award fees in the applicant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Draper </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To be a prevailing party for \u00a7 1988 fee purposes, the plaintiff must \u201csucceed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the [party] sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, quoting <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978). The department does not challenge the trial judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs are a prevailing party within the meaning of \u00a7 1988. Instead, the department challenges the judge\u2019s discretionary award of fees, arguing that discretion should have been used to deny the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">\u201cDiscretion to deny fees ... is limited. Congress intended that successful plaintiffs \u2018should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 S. Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1976).\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>419 Mass. 185, 191 (1994), quoting <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 319 (1982). See <em>Perini Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 772 (same); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>410 Mass. 188, 197 (1991) (same). The department contends that there are such special circumstances here because an award of attorney\u2019s fees levied against one State agency, paid out of the treasury, to a second State agency, which deposits the funds back into the treasury, would result in a useless, circular accounting exercise that would neither encourage civil rights enforcement nor deter civil rights violations. The department argues, therefore, that the judge abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>her discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees because these special circumstances \u201cwould render an award of attorneys\u2019 fees a useless, wasteful, and therefore \u2018unjust\u2019 exercise that would not serve any of the purposes of the fee-shifting statutes.\u201d We are unconvinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The special circumstances exception to the award of fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988 is a narrow one. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 191; <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 320. We have, for example, concluded that the special circumstances exception cannot be invoked merely because \u201cthe case was fairly simple [or] because the plaintiffs were represented by legal services attorneys\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, supra </em>at 455. Similarly, we did not discover special circumstances rendering an award of attorney\u2019s fees unjust where the defendant claimed that there were limited benefits achieved by the action, that it acted in good faith, or that the award burdened State taxpayers. See <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, </em>411 Mass. 754, 758 (1992); <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra; Porter </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Collector of Taxes of Worcester, </em>385 Mass. 335, 342 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The department points to a case outside this jurisdiction, <em>Thorsted </em>v. <em>Gregoire, </em>841 F. Supp. 1068 (W.D. Wash. 1994), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Thorsted </em>v. <em>Munro, </em>75 F.3d 454, 456 (9th Cir. 1996), to support its view <em>that the </em>special circumstances exception should also include situations where an award of fees was \u201cunnecessary\u201d to serve the statutory purposes of deterrence or promotion of enforcement. We agree with the motion judge that <em>Thorsted </em>does not help the department. <em>Thorsted </em>involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a State law enacted by voter initiative. <em>Thorsted </em>v. <em>Gregoire, supra </em>at 1071. To support its judgment denying the award of fees, however, the <em>Thorsted </em>court relied on a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d including seven general facts, some of which are not present here. <em>Id. </em>The court found, for example, that a \u201ctypical civil rights case\u201d was not involved and no award was needed to serve the purpose of \u00a7 1988; that there was no way to settle the case by agreement; that no relief was won under the \u00a7 1983 claims beyond that won under the constitutional claims; and that the challenged legislation was adopted by a voters\u2019 initiative, and not by State officials, and thus the deterrent purpose connected with \u00a7 1983 was \u201cinapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, noting that \u201cthe district court did not abuse its discretion by denying fees based on the totality of the circumstances it identified.\u201d <em>Thorsted </em>v. <em>Munro, supra </em>at 456. It is by no means clear that the <em>Thorsted </em>courts would have found special circumstances warranting a denial of fees solely based on the fact the deterrent purpose of \u00a7 1983 was inapplicable and the award was not needed to serve the purpose of \u00a7 1988, as the department implies.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Even assuming that other courts have concluded that the special circumstances exception bars fee awards that do not serve the statute\u2019s deterrent purpose \u2014 an assumption we view as dubious, at best \u2014 we decline to join in any such extension of the scope of the special circumstances exception, as the department, in effect, urges. We instead adhere to the well-established standard that an award of fees could be denied where \u201cspecial circumstances render[] such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 197, citing <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 89 (1989). The department has articulated no injustice that will be worked against it by such an award, and would be hard pressed to do so given its assertion that the award will not come from its budget or accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Even if we were to agree with the widening of the special circumstances exception in essence urged by the department, which we do not, the department would have to demonstrate convincingly that the award of fees was in fact useless, wasteful, or did not serve the deterrence or enforcement purposes of the statutes. We note that for many years awards of attorney\u2019s fees to legal services organizations have been recognized as serving the statutory purposes of \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>611 F.2d 1302, 1305 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Mid-Hudson Legal Servs. </em>v. <em>G &amp; U, Inc., </em>465 F. Supp. 261, 262, 270 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). See also <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>758, 763-764 (1979), quoting <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 631 (1978) (\u201cwhen attorney\u2019s fees are statutorily authorized legal service organizations are entitled to receive such awards\u201d). The fact, for example, that a plaintiff is represented by a public interest law firm that otherwise would be entitled to no fee does not foreclose the award of fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988 or render such an award purposeless under that statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, supra </em>at 93, citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>8 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) par. 9444 (C.D. Cal. 1974). See also <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>395 Mass. 382, 395 (1985), citing <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>at 765. Congress contemplated and was well aware that State agencies and their officials would not infrequently be named as defendants in civil rights actions, and that State-funded legal services organizations would often represent plaintiffs against the State in civil rights cases. See <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Chang, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The department argues, nonetheless, that a fee award here would not serve the deterrent purpose of the fee-shifting statutes because the fees would not be paid by the department but would be paid out of the treasury from the Commonwealth\u2019s centralized settlements and judgments fund. After the plaintiffs turned the fees over to MHLAC, it continues, MHLAC, as a \u201cState agency,\u201d would be required to redeposit those funds into the treasury\u2019s general fund. See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2. As a consequence, the department asserts, \u201can award of fees would not result in additional funding for enforcement of civil rights by MHLAC, would not have any net impact on the Treasury [,] . . . would not affect settlement incentives in civil rights cases in which MHLAC is involved . . . [and] would have no deterrent effect on DMH.\u201d This line of reasoning depends on the department\u2019s demonstrating that the department would not pay the fees, and that MHLAC could not retain use of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Courts repeatedly have recognized that the award of attorney\u2019s fees is to the plaintiff, not the attorney representing the plaintiff. See <em>Venegas </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>495 U.S. 82, 87-88 (1990); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Jeff D., </em>475 U.S. 717, 730 n.19 (1986). The department\u2019s claim that the award is pointless and circular because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>would pass from the treasury to MHLAC and back to the treasury is unpersuasive because the award is not owed to MHLAC, but to the prevailing party, here, the class plaintiffs. What is done with those fees by the prevailing party is ordinarily not the concern of the losing party or determinative of the propriety of the award.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Notably, courts have concluded that a plaintiff\u2019s payment obligation to counsel, or the lack thereof, is not dispositive in determining the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees awarded by a court pursuant to \u00a7 1988. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, supra </em>at 92-93, and cases cited. See <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 894-895 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The department has, in any event, not convinced us that MHLAC could not retain use of the fees. MHLAC does not dispute that any funds received from an award of attorney\u2019s fees must be deposited into the treasury, but argues that such funds could be deposited in MHLAC\u2019s trust account in the treasury for use in pursuing other civil rights violations, and would not have to be returned to the treasury\u2019s general fund.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We need not address this question because we consider here only whether the department must comply with the order to pay attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Even if the payment indeed went from one central treasury account, unconnected to the department, to another, unconnected to MHLAC, the department has not shown that there would be no accounting record reflecting that the transfer was to settle a complaint for the department\u2019s alleged civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>violations. We observe, for example, that current regulations require the filing of a report with the general counsel of the comptroller when certain litigation involving a monetary claim against the Commonwealth terminates in a final settlement or judgment and that the report must indicate the amount of any attorney\u2019s fee award and include \u201ca description of the basis for the request\u201d for payment of the settlement or judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See 815 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.09(l)(a)(5) (1993). To the extent such a record of payment would be created and helped increase accountability for practices of the department, the payment could not be discounted as \u201cpointless and wasteful.\u201d In sum, the department has not shown that the award will be pointless and will not serve the enforcement or deterrent purposes of the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Finally, as the department admits, \u201cthe determination whether to award fees is squarely within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and a court therefore <em>may </em>exercise its discretion to deny fees based on the existence of special circumstances\u201d (emphasis added). The department faces a high hurdle when it asks us to overturn a judge\u2019s exercise of such discretion to award fees. We have said that, \u201c[a]t the appellate level, even the narrow \u2018special circumstances\u2019 exception to the general rule favoring fee awards has been applied only to affirm trial judges\u2019 initial decisions to deny fees, rather than to overturn decisions to award fees.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 320 (1982). This case is certainly not one that calls for the extraordinary invocation of the special circumstances exception to overturn on appeal a judge\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-17\">The Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee is appointed by the Supreme Judicial Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 34E. Its work includes conducting programs to assist and advise indigent patients and residents at mental health facilities in the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 34E. The operation of MHLAC is paid for, at least in part, by an annual appropriation of the Legislature, see, e.g., St. 1998, c. 194, \u00a7 2, line item 0321-2000; St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 2, line item 0321-2000, which, according to MHLAC, pays the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>salaries of staff attorneys who carry out MHLAC\u2019s work. MHLAC staff attorneys did the legal work for the plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\">The plaintiffs brought this case as a class action pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974). The plaintiff class was provisionally certified on December 21, 1994, and found to include approximately 2,000 members \u201cwho, on or after July 12, 1991, were or are admitted or committed to Worcester State Hospital or Westborough State Hospital and who were or are during their admission or commitment recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance benefits paid pursuant to Title II of the Social Security Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Prior to filing the complaint, the plaintiffs had signed an agreement with the Legal Assistance Corporation of Central Massachusetts (LACCM) that any fees recovered by them in this action would be turned over to LACCM. LACCM, in turn, designated attorneys from MHLAC to work with LACCM in the litigation and, pursuant to an agreement among the legal aid organizations involved, any attorney\u2019s fees recovered were to be allocated among the organizations. According to MHLAC\u2019s former executive director, any fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>paid for the MHLAC attorneys\u2019 work in this case will be received by MHLAC\u2019s trust account to be used in MHLAC\u2019s future legal representation of indigent persons and for its leg\u00e1l education programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">In addition to MHLAC, the plaintiff class was also represented by lawyers from three other legal aid organizations: the Center for Public Representation, Cambridge and Somerville Legal Services, and LACCM. The department agreed to pay attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $50,000 for work performed by lawyers from these three legal aid organizations. The payment of fees to these three organizations is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b866-12\">The stipulation does not preclude \u201cplaintiffs from seeking a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee for work performed by the MHLAC attorneys during the course of an appeal in this matter on which plaintiffs prevail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Because of the similarity of analysis concerning the three statutes governing award of attorney\u2019s feesj for convenience we conduct our analysis by reference to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1994), as the motion judge did. See note 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The two Federal statutes under which the attorney\u2019s fee claim is made contain similar fee-shifting provisions that provide for a court to use its discretion in making the determination of an award. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (\u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (1994) (same). In contrast, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act provides that \u201c[ajny aggrieved person or persons who prevail in an action authorized by this section shall be entitled to an award of the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount to be fixed by the court.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111. Although this statute is worded in language that appears to afford the judge less discretion, we have commented that the analysis of the award of fees under this statute is similar to the analysis under the Federal statutes. See, e.g., <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>405 Mass. 74, 75 (1989), citing <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 321 (1982), and <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 821-823 (1985) (commenting, in case where sole issue concerned correctness of denial of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, that \u201c[w]e look primarily to Federal law in determining whether to award attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). See also <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Youth Dev. Program, Inc., </em>390 Mass. 652, 657 (1983) (G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 111, are State analogues to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The department suggests that cases concerning fee awards to legal aid organizations have no bearing on this case because the recovery of fees here is by a \u201cState agency,\u201d MHLAC, and the resulting transfer of fees from one treasury account to another would be circular, having no deterrent or enforcement effect. As discussed below, however, the department has not proved that the fee award would be pointlessly circular. In terms of mission, clients served, lack of charges to clients, and diversity of possible funding sources, see G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 34E, MHLAC also bears similarities to nonprofit legal services organizations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Consequently, we find little that is germane in the department\u2019s observation that the \u201cplaintiffs have not incurred any out-of-pocket expenses associated with the cost of legal services performed by the class counsel,\u201d or that \u201cMHLAC staff attorneys are compensated through salaries included in the Legislature\u2019s annual appropriation to MHLAC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The fact that the \u201cStipulation of Settlement of Attorneys\u2019 Fees\u201d provides that any payment of fees owed the plaintiffs for that portion of the legal work done by MHLAC will actually be paid directly to MHLAC, \u201csubject to defendants\u2019 receipt of the fee agreement between plaintiffs and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel (or some other appropriate documentation reflecting plaintiffs\u2019 authorization for payment of fees by defendants directly to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel),\u201d does not change our analysis. The provision that any such direct payment is subject to documentation of the plaintiffs\u2019 authorization in fact underscores the point that the fees are owed the plaintiffs, not MHLAC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">MHLAC is authorized to receive Federal funds and \u201cmay accept gifts, grants or contributions from any source and may expend the same, for the purpose of compensating [its] mental health legal advisors.\u201d G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 34E. MHLAC argues that \u201ccontributions from <em>any </em>source\u201d would include \u201cthe transfer of attorneys\u2019 fees from the plaintiff class to MHLAC.\u201d The department disagrees, arguing that attorney\u2019s fees are not \u201ccontributions,\u201d and that, pursuant to art. 63, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, State agencies are not free to expend funds they receive except as provided by the Legislature and must deposit such funds into the treasury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Similarly, 815 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.01(2) et seq.
