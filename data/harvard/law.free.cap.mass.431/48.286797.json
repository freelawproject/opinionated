See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>418 Mass. 1, 1 n.1 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-6\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHg\">On March 27, 1990, in the Boston Municipal Court, the defendant, Roman Rzepphiewski, an alien, admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. On April 13, 1999, the defendant moved in the same court to withdraw this plea and vacate the finding of sufficient facts, arguing that the plea might render him deportable from the United States under the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (1994), and claiming that at the time he entered the plea, the judge did not advise him, as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, that his conviction could result in his deportation or other adverse immigration consequences under Federal law (deportation advisement). After the motion was denied, the defendant timely appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">1. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, provides that a defendant is entitled, on a motion, to have a judgment of conviction vacated and to withdraw his plea of guilty or nolo contendere if, at the time the plea was entered, the judge failed to give the required deportation advisement and the defendant \u201clater at any time shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute thus places on the defendant the burden of \u201cshowfingj\u201d that he \u201cmay\u201d be subject to deporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tion or other adverse immigration consequences as a result of an admission to sufficient facts in a State court proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We assume without deciding, as the defendant argued below and the Commonwealth now concedes, that an admission to sufficient facts on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, could subject an alien to deportation under the INA, as that act has recently been construed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, nothing in the record even asserts, let alone establishes, that the defendant <em>currently </em>is an \u201calien\u201d within the meaning of the INA and thus deportable under its relevant provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s affidavit, which he submitted below in support of his motion to vacate his plea, avers that he was an alien when he tendered his plea on or about March 26, 1990, but not that he continued in this status at the time he brought his motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant thus has not satisfied his burden under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, of \u201cshowing]\u201d that his admission to sufficient facts \u201cmay have\u201d the adverse immigration consequences that he cites or, therefore, that he is entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>extraordinary relief that the statute affords an alien defendant who did not receive the required advisement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 659 n.2 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podoprigora, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 n.1 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">2. The preceding analysis ordinarily would suffice to deny the defendant appellate relief. However, because the Commonwealth concedes that the defendant has met his burden of showing that his plea may result in his deportation, we proceed to address the defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, to withdraw his admission to sufficient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">(a) We deal first with the defendant\u2019s contention that he is entitled to benefit from the statute\u2019s express provision that, \u201c[a]bsent a record that the court provided the advisement required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required advisement.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. We conclude that the statute\u2019s presumption of nonadvisement is not operative in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">By April 13, 1999, when the defendant sought to withdraw his plea, the tape recording of the original plea hearing had apparently been destroyed pursuant to court rule, see Special Rule 308 (A) (4) (a) of the Boston Municipal Court Department (1999), and no transcript of the proceeding was available. The extant docket sheet indicates that, on March 27, 1990, a hearing took place at which the defendant, represented by counsel, waived his right to a jury trial and admitted to sufficient facts on the charged offense, but it does not explicitly state that the deportation advisement was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his plea, however, the motion judge, who was the same judge who had taken the defendant\u2019s plea on March 27, 1990, found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201c4/23/99. After review of my records, and noting the defendant\u2019s age (33) and years of schooling completed (11) are recorded, I conclude full colloquy was given [defendant]. See memo in comparable facts and result in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>[No.] 88-230033.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, the judge thus incorporated by reference what he had stated in a similar case: \u201c[The defendant] has no more reason to recall that alleged omission than I do to recall the details of [the deportation advisement\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>having been given.\u201d Moreover, he reasoned that his \u201ccontemporaneously made notes\u201d of the hearing, which recorded the defendant\u2019s age and years of schooling, coupled with his \u201cpractice from early on in [his] tenure as a judge\u201d to begin a plea colloquy by making these two inquiries, were evidence that he had engaged in the plea colloquy with the defendant. Based on these entries in his personal records and his customary practice in administering the plea colloquy, the judge concluded that he had \u201cno reason to believe that the \u2018alien warning\u2019 was not part of my colloquy with this defendant who appeared before me when I had been on the bench for more than [two] years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The defendant argues that, nevertheless, there is no \u201crecord,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, that the advisement was given during the plea hearing. Accordingly, he argues, citing bur decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661 (1994), and the decision of the Appeals Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 535 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>429 Mass. 556, 557-558 (1999) (affirming judge\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, which Appeals Court had reversed), we are compelled by the statute to presume conclusively that the deportation advisement was <em>not </em>given during that plea hearing, thereby entitling him to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201ca record\u201d that the advisement was given is absent, thus triggering the statutory presumption of nonadvisement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Significantly, the statute does not require that <em>the official record </em>of the plea hearing be produced to render the presumption of nonadvisement inoperative, but only <em>\u201ca record </em>that the court provided the advisement\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Cf. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 26A, 27A <em>(h) </em>(denoting tape recording of jury-waived and jury trials in Boston Municipal Court as \u201cthe official record\u201d of such proceedings in absence of stenographer); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 55A, 56 <em>(h) </em>(same in Juvenile Court proceedings). The Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>peals Court has held that the term \u201crecord\u201d in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is not limited to a tape recording or transcript of a judicial proceeding, but includes a docket sheet on which a box has been checked indicating that the deportation advisement was given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podoprigora, supra </em>at 929, and cases cited. Moreover, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, </em>429 Mass. 556, 557-558 (1999), we concluded that a docket sheet bearing the notation \u201c[defendant offers to plead guilty \u2014 after hearing,\u201d coupled with a statement by the motion judge, who was not the judge who took the defendant\u2019s plea, that this notation referred to his court\u2019s standard plea colloquy and thus connoted that the defendant had received the deportation advisement, sufficed to \u201creconstitute the record\u201d of the advisement\u2019s having been given, thereby avoiding operation of the presumption of nonadvisement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podoprigora, supra </em>at 930 (in addition to docket entry indicating deportation advisement was given, motion judge stated it was his \u201cstandard practice\u201d to give advisement in plea colloquy). We distinguished the situation in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, supra, </em>from that presented in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 662, where apparently there was no record of what had transpired when the defendant admitted to sufficient facts and the judge who had accepted the defendant\u2019s admission had since retired and was unavailable, thus precluding a reconstruction of the contemporaneous record of the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Our recognition in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, supra, </em>that a reconstructed record of a plea hearing satisfies the \u201crecord\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, comports with our decisions affirming denials of motions to withdraw guilty pleas on the grounds of involuntariness or lack of understanding, where contemporaneous records of the plea hearings have become unavailable due to no fault of the Commonwealth. While acknowledging that the Commonwealth has the obligation to prove that a contemporaneous record<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of a defendant\u2019s plea hearing satisfies certain standards of voluntariness and understanding, we have held that, if that record \u201cis unavailable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>it may be reconstructed through testimony or other suitable proof of what happened in court when the guilty plea was taken.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. 423, 432 (1993), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 108 n.6 (1975), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 145 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 623 (1991). We have expressly recognized in this context that a judge\u2019s \u201crecitation in a memorandum of decision of what he remembers of the plea colloquy . . . even when, as would almost always be the case, the judge recalls only the substance of the colloquy and not the precise words used,\u201d as well as a judge\u2019s reliance on his \u201ccustomary practice in taking guilty pleas,\u201d are legitimate means of reconstructing a record of the plea hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, supra </em>at 432-433 &amp; n.7, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, supra </em>at 145-147. The judge\u2019s recitation of facts and statement of his customary practice in taking pleas need not be in the form of testimony before another judge; rather, a \u201cnontestimonial recitation . . . may properly support the reconstruction of the record\u201d of a plea hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, supra </em>at 434. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, supra </em>at 143-147 (judge\u2019s findings of fact in memorandum of decision as to \u201cwhat most likely occurred during the [defendant\u2019s] pleas\u201d considered, along with defendant\u2019s own prior testimony at another trial, as part of reconstructed record of defendant\u2019s plea hearing, where stenographic notes of hearing had been destroyed). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Napier, </em>417 Mass. 32, 34 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>364 Mass. 193, 198 (1973) (judge\u2019s signed notation that witness did not desire counsel sufficient evidence of waiver of counsel); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boudreau, </em>362 Mass. 378, 382 (1972) (handwritten notation of name of defendant\u2019s counsel on face of criminal complaint sufficient to prove that defendant had counsel for purposes of determining propriety of impeachment by prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In light of these principles, the docket sheet indicating that, on March 27, 1990, the defendant admitted to sufficient facts after a hearing, coupled with the judge\u2019s decision on the motion, which recalled specific details of the defendant\u2019s plea hearing<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and relied on the judge\u2019s customary practice of including the deportation advisement in a plea colloquy, suffice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>reconstruct \u201ca record that the court provided the [deportation] advisement\u201d at the plea hearing. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Indeed, the reconstructed record of the plea hearing in this case is all the more compelling because the motion judge was the same judge who had taken the defendant\u2019s plea at the jury-waived proceeding nine years earlier. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 176 (1999) (deference accorded to views of motion judge who was also trial judge). Accordingly, the statutory presumption of nonadvisement, which is triggered only in the absence of \u201ca record\u201d that the deportation advisement was given, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is not operative here.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">(b) The inapplicability of the statute\u2019s presumption of nonadvisement does not resolve the matter, however, as we must next determine whether the record, as reconstructed, adequately establishes that the judge gave the deportation advisement mandated by statute at the defendant\u2019s -hearing. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D (\u201cIf the court fails so to advise the defendant . . .\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Soto, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 915-916 (1999) (record of plea hearing indicating that deportation advisement was given reviewed to determine whether \u201call three warnings [were] given\u201d). We have already summarized the evidence in the record that tends to prove that the judge included the deportation advisement in the defendant\u2019s plea colloquy. The defendant counters with an affidavit averring, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]t no time during [the March 27, 1990] hearing and admission to sufficient facts was I instructed or advised by the [c]ourt that my admission to sufficient facts could possibly result in my deportation from the United States.\u201d No other evidence was before the motion judge on this issue. A judge is not required to accept as true the allegations in a defendant\u2019s affidavit, even if nothing in the record directly disputes them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martens, </em>398 Mass. 674, 678 (1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1041 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 543, (1971). Moreover, because the motion judge was the same judge who presided over the defendant\u2019s plea hearing, he was in a superior position to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the credibility of the defendant\u2019s claim that the deportation advisement had been omitted from a plea colloquy that occurred more than nine years earlier. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>399 Mass. 165, 167 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986) (within judge\u2019s discretion to determine weight and import of affidavits submitted, especially where motion judge was also trial judge). Accordingly, we conclude that the judge\u2019s finding that the deportation advisement was given at the plea hearing is not clearly erroneous, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 294, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hine, </em>393 Mass. 564, 568 (1984), and, therefore, that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Finally, the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to expand the record to include criminal docket sheets indicating that the defendant received the statutory deportation advisement when entering pleas on three subsequent offenses is denied. While it may be permissible to include in a reconstructed record of a plea hearing such \u201cpost-plea circumstance, so close in time to the [challenged] plea itself as arguably to be essentially contemporaneous,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pingaro, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 47-48 n.9 (1997), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duest, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 625 (1991), these docket sheets relate to plea hearings that took place (in the earliest instance) nine months after the challenged plea and are irrelevant to the issue whether the defendant received the deportation advisement on or prior to March 27, 1990, when he admitted to sufficient facts. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, supra </em>at 558 (record of defendant\u2019s <em>prior </em>plea hearing, showing that he received deportation advisement at that hearing, was \u201ccontemporaneous court record[]\u201d evidencing that defendant .was aware of immigration consequences of conviction when he subsequently offered challenged plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea and vacate the finding of sufficient facts is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, provides, in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u201cThe court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from any defendant in any criminal proceeding unless the court advises such defendant of the following: \u2018If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u2019 The defendant shall not be required at the time of the plea to disclose to the court his legal status in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">\u201cIf the court fails so to advise the defendant, and he later at any time shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty. Absent a record that the court provided the advisement required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required advisement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">For purposes of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, we treat an admission to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt as the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mahadeo, 397 Mass. 314, 316-317 n.2 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 844-846 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The INA provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny <em>alien </em>who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable\u201d (emphasis added). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994). An \u201caggravated felony\u201d is \u201ca crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Recent Federal decisions construing this statutory language hold that the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicating substance satisfies this definition of a violent crime, see <em>Camacho-Marroquin </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>188 F.3d 649, 652 (5th Cir. 1999); In re Magallanes-Garcia, Board of Immigration Appeals, File No. A90219200 (Mar. 19, 1998), and, therefore, suggest that an admission to sufficient facts on this charge could render an alien deportable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The INA defines an \u201calien\u201d as \u201cany person not a citizen or national of the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(3). The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel represented in a reply brief, at oral argument, and in a letter submitted after argument, that the defendant currently is an alien with an application for permanent residency pending. Such unsworn representations by counsel to an appellate court, however, are not evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We note, additionally, that there is no evidence in the record to suggest that this defendant has been taken into custody by the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), is currently in deportation proceedings before the INS, or has even been notified by the INS that he is now subject to deportation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podoprigora, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 n.1 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We therefore express no opinion whether, in the genuine absence of a record (either actual or reconstructed) that the deportation advisement was given, the statutory presumption of nonadvisement which we applied in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661 (1994), operates conclusively or, instead, may be rebutted by the contrary presumption of regularity in court proceedings subsequently articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 661 (1998), which, in the absence of a contemporaneous or reconstructed record of a plea colloquy, puts on the defendant the burden of producing credible evidence that his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

However, because the defendant does not dispute that he did in fact have a hearing before this judge on March 27, 1990, at which he admitted to sufficient facts on the charged offense, and because the alleged factual discrepancy does not bear on the judge\u2019s recollection of having given the deportation advisement as part of the plea colloquy, this minor discrepancy, even if substantiated, would not suffice to invalidate the reconstructed record of the plea hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
