L. c. 66, \u00a7 10,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the report, which resulted in the teacher\u2019s four-week suspension, constitutes part of the teacher\u2019s \u201cpersonnel . . . file[ ] or information,\u201d and is exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">1. On May 8, 1995, the Wakefield Teachers Association (teachers\u2019 association)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a complaint on behalf of the teacher for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to prevent the superintendent from publicly disclosing the report. A judge in the Superior Court issued a preliminary order enjoining the release of the report. The case was then tried on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In July, 1995, the judge issued findings of fact, rulings of law, and an order for judgment. He concluded that the report was not exempt and ordered that it be publicly disclosed, except for those portions of the report or its attachments that contained the names, addresses, or other data that identified any Wakefield student. The teachers\u2019 association appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In an order and unpublished memorandum pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings to allow the trial judge to review the report in camera. <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (1996). In October, 1997, the judge issued further findings of fact, rulings of law, and an order for judgment, once again concluding that the report was a public record not exempt from disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c). Judgment entered on November 18, 1997. The teachers\u2019 association took a second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Appeals Court agreed with the trial judge that the report was subject to public disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, and was not exempt from disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c). See <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 704, 711 (1999). It concluded, however, that all identifying references to both the students and the teacher involved should be redacted. <em>Id. </em>We granted the teachers\u2019 association\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">2. Sometime before March, 1995, the superintendent learned that a male teacher at Wakefield Junior High School had written potentially inappropriate notes on the homework assignments of two female students in his class.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The superintendent conducted an investigation into the allegations, including an interview with the teacher and two union representatives, and wrote a report.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As he later described in a public letter, the superintendent concluded that the teacher\u2019s conduct \u201ccrossed over the line of responsibility a teacher has to a student.\u201d His report describes his decision to impose on the teacher a suspension without pay for four weeks, pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The teacher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>served the four-week suspension before returning to work.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On April 3, 1995, a resident of Wakefield wrote to the superintendent requesting \u201cany information . . . regarding the suspension of a teacher at the Junior High School.\u201d The resident noted that he was \u201cnot interested in either the teacher\u2019s or the student\u2019s name, but rather the nature of the offense for which he was suspended.\u201d On April 7, 1995, the superintendent responded in writing denying the request, and stating he would ask the supervisor of public records (acting supervisor) for further direction regarding the issue. He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">\u201cI am further willing to share with you that a male teacher was investigated and disciplined because of notes he wrote on the homework papers of two seventh grade female students. The teacher claimed that the notes were only a joke and intended to provide positive reinforcement. I judged that the notes were more serious and clearly crossed over the line of responsibility a teacher has to a student. I have every confidence that this teacher is no danger to these children or any other children and should, upon completion of his suspension, return to his teaching position in the district without further sanction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Town counsel requested an advisory opinion from the acting supervisor as to whether the records sought by the resident were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\u201cpublic records\u201d subject to disclosure within the meaning of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. The acting supervisor responded that, in her opinion, \u201cthose portions of the records which identify the suspended teacher and relate to his alleged misconduct are subject to mandatory disclosure upon request.\u201d The superintendent also received several requests from news reporters and others seeking information about the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">3. The question we consider is one of statutory interpretation. The public records statute, G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, requires a custodian<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to make available for inspection and copying any public record on request. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a). \u201cPublic records are broadly defined and include all documentary materials made or received by an officer or employee of any corporation or public entity of the Commonwealth, unless one of [the] statutory exemptions is applicable.\u201d <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>414 Mass. 609, 614 (1993). The Legislature has identified twelve categories of records otherwise public that are exempt from disclosure, including any \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information; also any other materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 431 (1983), we examined the relationship between the clause \u201cthe disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d and the phrase \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information.\u201d We concluded in that case that, based on the structure, language, legislative history, and comparison with the analogous Federal public records exemption on which it is based, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (1994),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Massachusetts exemption, G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), creates two categories of records exempt from public disclosure: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>first \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information\u201d and second \u201cother materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 434. We concluded further that the phrase \u201crelating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d modifies <em>only </em>the second category. <em>Id. </em>at 433 (\u201c[Insertion of a semicolon] by the Legislature in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth [c], manifests a desire to ensure that the [\u2018personnel and medical files or information\u2019] clause would not be subject to the language of the modifying clause\u201d). See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Chief Med. Examiner, </em>404 Mass. 132, 135 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We consider first whether a disciplinary report, such as the one at issue here, falls within the first or second category of that statutory exemption. We have no doubt that such a report is \u201cpersonnel\u201d information as that term is used in the first category of the exemption. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra, </em>makes clear, the Legislature plainly intended that some public records fall within the \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d category, and are distinguishable from \u201cother materials or data relating to a specifically named individual.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986) (court should interpret statutes to give effect to Legislature\u2019s intent). See also 2A NJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 45.12 (5th ed. 1992) (\u201can interpretation which emasculates a provision of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>statute is not preferred\u201d). While the precise contours of the legislative term \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d may require case-by-case articulation, it includes, at a minimum, employment applications, employee work evaluations, disciplinary documentation, and promotion, demotion, or termination information pertaining to a particular employee. These constitute the core categories of personnel information that are \u201cuseful in making employment decisions regarding an employee.\u201d <em>Oregonian Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Portland Sch. Dist. No. 1J, </em>329 Or. 393, 401 <em>(1999).</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It would distort the plain statutory language to conclude that disciplinary reports are anything but \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Chief Med. Examiner, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Numerous courts, both Federal and State, that have considered the question have reached the same conclusion. Interpreting the analogous Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), Federal courts have determined that disciplinary reports are a component of an employee\u2019s personnel records, and should be so regarded in judging whether they are subject to disclosure. See, e.g., <em>Federal Labor Relations Auth. </em>v. <em>United States Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>966 F.2d 747, 761 (3d Cir. 1992) (disciplinary records considered part of personnel records); <em>Schonberger </em>v. <em>National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>508 F. Supp. 941, 943 (D.C. 1981) (information concerning disciplinary action considered part of individual\u2019s personnel file); <em>Associated Dry Goods Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>455 F. Supp. 802, 815 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (employment applications, educational attainments, disciplinary records, work evaluations, and similar material characterized as \u201cessence\u201d of personnel file).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">State courts have also concluded that disciplinary reports are part of an individual\u2019s personnel information. See, e.g., <em>Oregonian Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Portland Sch. Dist. No. 1J, supra </em>(\u201c \u2018personnel files\u2019 would usually include information about a teacher\u2019s education and qualifications for employment, job performance, evaluations, disciplinary matters or other information useful in making employment decisions regarding an employee\u201d); <em>Pivero </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>v. <em>Largy, </em>143 N.H. 187, 189-190 (1998) (\u201c \u2018Personnel file\u2019 means any and all personnel records created and maintained by an employer and pertaining to an employee including and not limited to employment applications, internal evaluations, disciplinary documentations, payroll records, injury reports and performance assessments, whether maintained in one or more locations . . .\u201d); <em>Swinton </em>v. <em>Safir, 93 </em>N.Y.2d 758, 762 (1999) (record of disciplinary charges and their resolution by dismissal considered part of personnel file). To our knowledge no appellate court has reached a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We recognize that some categories of information typically contained in an individual employee\u2019s personnel file that, for purposes of determining exemption under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), do not constitute \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d For example, an employee\u2019s personnel file may contain an employee\u2019s name, home address, date of birth, and social security number. That same information may be maintained by an employer in databases for the ordinary administration of its employees, such as maintaining payroll records. See, e.g., <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812, 818 (1978) (information, such as name, address, base pay, and overtime pay of individual municipal employees, found in payroll records). Such records, even though they are \u201cpersonal\u201d in that they pertain to a particular individual, are not \u201cuseful in making employment decisions\u201d regarding a particular employee, and are more properly considered the type of information that the Legislature had in mind when it identified \u201cother materials or data relating to a specifically named individual.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(c). </em>See, e.g., <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 435 (\u201cNot every bit of information which might be found in a personnel or medical file is necessarily personal so as to fall within the exemption\u2019s protection\u201d); <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, supra </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Information falling within the \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information\u201d category is absolutely exempt from disclosure. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>supra at 434 (\u201cwe should follow the plain language of our exemption and hold that [personnel and medical files and information] are absolutely exempt from disclosure\u201d). Our inquiry, therefore, is limited to \u201cwhether the records sought are or contain [personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>files or information].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431 n.9. Only information that does not permit the identification of any individual is not exempt from disclosure. See <em>id. </em>at 438 (\u201cpersonnel files or information are absolutely exempt. . . where the files or information are of a personal nature and relate to a particular individual\u201d). While the statute does not by its terms limit the exemption for \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information\u201d to those \u201cwhere the files or information are of a personal nature and relate to a particular individual,\u201d <em>id., </em>we added that judicial gloss to explain that the legislation does not exempt from disclosure a personnel record wholly unrelated to any individual\u2019s privacy interest, such as a generic job description or generic qualification requirement for a particular level of position that might constitute part of a personnel record. The report at issue in this case pertains to one teacher only and is absolutely exempt from disclosure under the plain language of the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Bromery, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 661, 662 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The defendants suggest that our cases subsequent to <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra, </em>establish that our judicial statement in that case that \u201cpersonnel [files] or information\u201d must be of a \u201cpersonal nature and relate to a particular individual\u201d to be exempt from disclosure should be interpreted to require that the personnel information concern \u201cintimate details of a highly personal nature.\u201d The defendants misapprehend the law. The defendants would deny exemption from disclosure for <em>both </em>categories of information described in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), except where the information constitutes \u201cintimate details of a highly personal nature.\u201d This would render meaningless the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent to create two distinct categories of information for exemption, with different standards for exemption established for each. Rather, in the case of \u201cpersonnel and medical files or informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>tion,\u201d \u201c[i]t is clear that the Legislature saw the need to establish a more sensitive and particularized balance between the public interest in disclosure and the individual\u2019s interest in personal privacy than is possible under a general exemption.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 437. That judgment rests solely with the Legislature and \u201c[i]t is not within the province of this court to rewrite the statute to strike a different balance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In any event, our decisions do not suggest otherwise. In <em>Pottle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Braintree, </em>395 Mass. 861, 865 (1985), we considered whether the names, home addresses, and job classifications of all school employees should be disclosed. The request was directed at an entire category of employees, not a specific individual, and sought information found regularly within the employer\u2019s payroll database. We correctly applied the standard of review associated with the second category, \u201cother materials or data,\u201d and concluded that the information was not exempt because it would not publicize \u201c \u2018intimate details\u2019 of a \u2018highly personal\u2019 nature.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Our decision in <em>Pottle </em>is consistent with our earlier decision in <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, supra, </em>on which <em>Pottle </em>relied. See <em>Pottle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Braintree, supra </em>at 864. In <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publ. Co., supra </em>at 814-815, we considered a request for \u201cbase salaries and overtime payments\u201d of all categories of city employees. Consistent with our decision today, we viewed that request as one for \u201cother materials or data relating to a specifically named individual,\u201d not as \u201cpersonnel\u201d information, and concluded that release of the employees\u2019 payroll information would not publicize \u201c \u2018intimate details\u2019 of a \u2018highly personal\u2019 nature.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 817-818. See also <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Mass. 281, 284, 293 (1979) (disclosure of reports of discharge of weapons by police officers not exempt from disclosure). Cf. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Bromery, supra </em>at 663-664 (evaluations of instructors by students should be considered part of teacher\u2019s \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d and are exempt from disclosure).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">While we have no doubt this case may be resolved solely on the plain statutory language, our decision is not without regard to the legislative purpose behind the exemption codified at G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c). See 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 45.09 (5th ed. 1992). The Legislature clearly balanced competing public policy considerations that we shall not second-guess. The exemption from disclosure of personnel files and information has, among other benefits, the protection of the government\u2019s ability to function effectively as an employer.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the judge perceptively noted: \u201cIt would not be unreasonable to conclude that disclosure of this sensitive and careful investigation and analysis would make the same kind of investigation and analysis difficult, if not impossible, in the future. An assurance of confidentiality to those who voluntarily participate in such investigations likely produces candor.\u201d Indeed, in this case, the superintendent noted that the teacher \u201ccooperated fully\u201d with the investigation. Were the teacher concerned that his cooperation would result in public disclosure, we question whether his cooperation would have been as forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Rather than adopt the analogous Federal statute, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Legislature determined that the \u201cpersonnel [files] and information\u201d pertaining to an individual would be absolutely exempt from disclosure. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 434 (\u201ccomparison with the Federal exemption is strong evidence that we should follow the plain language of our exemption and hold that [personnel] files or information are absolutely exempt from disclosure\u201d). The Legislature may well have considered what the trial judge described: \u201cin an era where even a hint of impropriety in the relations between teachers and young students may produce a public reaction wholly disproportionate to the actual or suspected nature of the impropriety, forced public disclosure of investigatory reports like this one, regardless of the conclusions and judgments the reports reach, may have a decidedly negative effect on the quality and quantity of student/teacher interactions.\u201d We adhere to the legislative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-18\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number><em>\u201c(a) </em>Every person having custody of any public record, as defined in clause Twenty-sixth of section seven of chapter four, shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it, or any segregable portion of a record which is an independent public record, to be inspected and examined by any person, under his supervision, and shall furnish one copy thereof upon payment of a reasonable fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">\u201c \u2018Public Records\u2019 shall mean all books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the commonwealth, or of any political subdivision thereof, or of any authority established by the general court to serve a public purpose, unless such materials or data fall within the following exceptions in that they are: <em>...(c) </em>personnel and medical files or information; also any other materials' or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Wakefield Teachers Association is an employee organization, G.

There is no indication in the record concerning the third stage, which is to advance the matter to the school committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The superintendent has control over and access to records maintained by the school department of Wakefield, including the report that is the subject of this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The Federal exemption to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (1994), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201c(b) This section does not apply to matters that are: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">\u201c(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>privacy . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd.., </em>388 Mass. 427, 432-433 (1983) (Legislature appears to have considered analogous Federal statute in drafting Massachusetts statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The judge also concluded, correctly, that the report in this case constituted \u201c \u2018personnel information\u2019 as that term is used in the statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Material within the \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d category is not limited to, nor does it extend to, all \u201cfiles or information\u201d that are located physically in an individual employee\u2019s personnel file. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 435 (\u201cthe scope of the exemption tum[s] on the character of the information sought rather than on the question whether the documents containing the information constituted a file\u201d). The judge found that in this case copies of the report, and notice of the suspension were kept in the teacher\u2019s individual personnel file, an investigation file maintained by the superintendent concerning this matter, and an investigation and litigation file maintained by town counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Our interpretation of \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d in this context is consistent with and derives from other Massachusetts legislation. General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 52C, for example, defines a \u201c [personnel record,\u201d as \u201ca record kept by an employer that identifies an employee, to the extent that the record is used or has been used, or may affect or be used relative to that employee\u2019s qualifications for employment, promotion, transfer, additional compensation or disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The teachers\u2019 association points to two other statutes that it claims serve as indicators of the general legislative desire to maintain the confidentiality of personnel matters involving employee discipline: the open meeting law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (2), which exempts from open hearings decisions by public bodies concerning the discipline and dismissal of employees; and G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42C, which requires a teacher to request permission from school officials before accessing his or her own personnel file. Because we hold that the report in this case is exempt from disclosure based solely on G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), we need not address those arguments, except to note that our decision here is consistent with those related legislative determinations to shield from public scrutiny the disciplinary reports of teachers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">For a contrary result as to the home addresses of employees under the cognate Federal statute, see <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Defense </em>v. <em>Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>510 U.S. 487, 489 (1994) (disclosure of home addresses of Federal civil service employees by employing agency pursuant to request made by employees\u2019 collective bargaining representative would constitute \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion\u201d of employees\u2019 personal privacy within meaning of Freedom of Information Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">We recognize that some aspects of our decision in <em>Brogan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westport, </em>401 Mass. 306, 308 (1987), may suggest that we apply the \u201cintimate details of a highly personal nature\u201d standard to the first \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information\u201d category. In <em>Brogan, </em>we held that a school committee was required to release employee absentee records pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. <em>Id. </em>at 307. Employer records that contain an employee\u2019s name, the dates and generic classification of their absences (i.e., sick day, personal day, or vacation day) are properly viewed as payroll records (\u201cother materials or data relating to a specifically named individual\u201d) rather than as \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), even though such data might also be located in an individual employee\u2019s personnel file. See <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of </em>Lynn, 374 Mass. 812, 817-818 (1978), where, consistent with that classification, we determined that the information sought did not constitute \u201c \u2018intimate details\u2019 of a \u2018highly personal\u2019 nature,\u201d and was not exempt from disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The acting supervisor, in her amicus brief, argues that the report in this case is not \u201csufficiently personal\u201d to be exempted from disclosure because, she claims, that \u201c[w]hen a disciplinary action involves an employee placed in an inherent position of public trust and that trust is violated, the details of the action cannot remain private.\u201d We do not agree with the broad proposition that every disciplinary action imposed on a teacher necessarily is not \u201cpersonal\u201d by virtue of the teacher\u2019s position of public trust. The acting supervisor adopts a position that would disclose all disciplinary information on an individual teacher, a policy consideration rejected by the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
