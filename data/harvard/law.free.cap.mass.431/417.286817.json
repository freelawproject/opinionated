L. c. 272, \u00a7 17 (incest statute), based on conduct he allegedly engaged in with his daughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant moved in the Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (c), 378 Mass. 871 (1979), to dismiss the indictments, arguing that, because there was no evidence of penile-vaginal penetration, the grand jury lacked sufficient evidence that he had engaged in \u201csexual intercourse\u201d with his daughter, as required by the incest statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge allowed this motion to dismiss, and the Appeals Court affirmed, on the ground asserted by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 826 (1999). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, although on reasoning different from that relied on by the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">1. <em>Facts and prior proceedings. </em>The charges against the defendant arose from allegations made by his daughter. The Commonwealth presented the grand jury with testimony of the daughter, her boy friend, and State Trooper Leonard C. Coppenrath, to whom the daughter had reported the defendant\u2019s conduct. The daughter testified, in relevant part, that the defendant had fondled her in an inappropriate manner after she was eleven years old and that, after she reached the age of sixteen years, he put his hands down her pants and digitally penetrated her vagina and also had her perform oral sex on him. Her boy friend testified that the daughter reported to him her father\u2019s sexual conduct toward her, in particular the acts of oral sex. The State trooper testified that the defendant, while admitting that he had rubbed sports cream on his daughter\u2019s chest, denied having any further sexual contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the incest indictments, the judge concluded that the alleged acts of digital penetration and oral intercourse did not satisfy the requirement in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d between consanguineous relations. In the absence of a definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute, the judge relied on this court\u2019s construction of this term, and of the related term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse,\u201d in the context of the rape statutes, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 22A, 23. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 584 (1977), construing these terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>within G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, this court concluded that, \u201c[b]y sexual intercourse, the Legislature undoubtedly intended the traditional common law notion of rape, the penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ, with or without emission,\u201d whereas \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse,\u201d by contrast, refers to \u201coral and anal intercourse, including fellatio, cunnilingus, and other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body or other object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body.\u201d Because the incest statute explicitly criminalizes \u201csexual intercourse\u201d but not \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d between consanguineous relations, the judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct with his daughter did not warrant a finding of probable cause that the defendant had committed the statutory crime of incest and, therefore, dismissed the indictments. A panel of the Appeals Court affirmed, for substantially the same reasons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 823-824.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing a judge\u2019s pretrial decision to dismiss indictments against a defendant, we must determine whether the evidence supported the judge\u2019s factual findings and whether the findings warranted his rulings of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>391 Mass. 494, 504 (1984). The Legislature has not explicitly defined the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, and in prior cases brought under the statute we have not been required to determine whether this term extends to forms of sexual conduct other than penile-vaginal penetration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that, but for the Legislature\u2019s post-1974 amendments of statutes in G. L. c. 272 that contain the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and its addition of the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, could properly be construed to encompass the acts here alleged to have been engaged in by the defendant with his daughter. However, in light of that legislative activity, we are compelled to limit the meaning of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, to penile-vaginal penetration, with or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>emission, and to conclude that the incest indictments against the defendant were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In our view, it is too facile to rely directly, as did the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court, on the rape statutes, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 22A, 23, for the meaning of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute. When interpreting undefined terms in a statute, it is certainly permissible to draw on the meaning that has settled on the same language in other legislation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gustafsson, </em>370 Mass. 181, 187 (1976). However, such an interpretive approach is more properly utilized when the legislation that the court consults for guidance is in pari materia with the statute being construed, that is, when the two statutes relate to the same class of persons or things or share a common purpose. Compare 2B N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 51.01-51.03 (5th ed. 1992), with \u00a7\u00a7 53.03, 53.05. When the two statutes are not so related, this approach is, at best, an uncertain means of discerning the intended meaning of statutory language and should be employed cautiously. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 53.05. The rape statutes appear in a chapter entitled \u201cCrimes Against the Person,\u201d G. L. c. 265, whereas the incest statute appears in a chapter entitled \u201cCrimes Against Chastity, Morality, Decency and Good Order.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. L. c. 272. Rape is a violent invasion of personal integrity and dignity committed in a sexual manner, an essential element of which is the absence of the victim\u2019s consent. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 22A. In the case of rape of a child under the age of sixteen years committed without the use of force or threat, such lack of consent is, nevertheless, conclusively presumed by law. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 19 (1985), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roosnell, </em>143 Mass. 32, 36 (1886). By contrast, the crime of incest is committed where persons within a specified \u201cdegree[ ] of consanguinity\u201d engage in sexual intercourse; the consensual or nonconsensual character of the conduct is immaterial. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domaingue, </em>397 Mass. 693, 703 (1986). Moreover, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 583-585, 587-588 &amp; n.13, 590 n.17 (1977), where \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 1, was held to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>refer to penile-vaginal penetration, this court noted that the Legislature\u2019s 1974 amendment of the rape statutes to encompass also \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d reflected a nationwide reform effort that explicitly sought to \u201cbroaden the scope of the crime\u201d to include forms of sexual intrusion that had escaped prosecution as rape under a narrower definition of intercourse. <em>Id. </em>at 588. Our construction of these terms in <em>Gallant </em>was thus influenced by the history of legislative activity specifically aimed at redefining and modernizing the crime of rape. All of this warrants the conclusion that the rape statutes are not in pari materia with the incest statute and that the meaning attributed to \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the context of rape would be inconclusive as to its meaning in the context of incest, absent an indication that the Legislature intended this same meaning to apply to statutes defining and proscribing \u201ccrimes against chastity, morality, decency and good order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In the absence of such an indication, a better interpretive approach would have implemented the following two canons of statutory interpretation: first, \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated,\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975); and second, \u201cthe statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, supra, </em>citing <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). Limiting \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, to penile-vaginal penetration would be appropriate if the sole purpose of the incest prohibition were the prevention of genetic or biological abnormalities in the offspring of incestuous unions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 825 n.5 (1999). However, the plain language of the incest statute indicates that its drafters sought to advance purposes different from, and more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>compelling than, eugenics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the statute does not define the crime of incest exclusively in terms of sexual intercourse between consanguineous relations, but also criminalizes the intermarriage of persons so related. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17. Moreover, the \u201c[p]ersons within the degrees of consanguinity\u201d to whom the statute\u2019s prohibitions of intermarriage and sexual intercourse apply are not limited to blood relations, but include also certain affinal kin as well as stepparents. Compare G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, with G. L. c. 207, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. The Legislature\u2019s purpose in criminalizing incestuous conduct must thus extend beyond the prevention of genetic defects, as this goal would clearly not be advanced by criminalizing marriage itself, without more, between blood relations, and still less by prohibiting coitus between affinal kin who do not share a common bloodline. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 230.2 comment 2(b), at 403; comment 3(b), at 412-413 (1980). Indeed, the scope of the incest statute, as it relates to both conduct and persons, strongly suggests that its framers valued and sought to promote the sanctity and integrity of familial relationships, as well as to protect children within the family from sexual impositions by their elders. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 230.2, comment 2(c)-(e), at 405-407, and authorities cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fouse, </em>417 Pa. Super. 534, 538 (1992). Accordingly, were there no other relevant legislative pronouncement, we would conclude that the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute, interpreted so as to realize all of the statute\u2019s purposes, is not properly limited to heterosexual coitus \u2014 a restrictive definition consistent only with a debatable eugenics rationale \u2014 but instead should be construed according to the term\u2019s ordinary and approved usage, which includes \u201cintercourse involving genital contact between individuals other than penetration of the vagina by the penis.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 1055 (1980 ed.). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 59, 66, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bucuvalas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>439 U.S. 827 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fouse, supra; State </em>v. <em>Butters, </em>527 So. 2d 1023, 1026-1027 (La. Ct. App. 1988). Significantly, this broad construction of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the context of incest is recommended by the drafters of the Model Penal Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">That having been said, however, statutory amendments to G. L. c. 272, the same chapter of the General Laws as the incest statute, that contain the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d compel us to construe this term in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, more narrowly than would otherwise be the case. The term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d also appears in \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4, 6, and 14 of G. L. c. 272.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since its 1974 amendment of the rape statutes, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 22A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>23, which substituted the terms \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d for the archaic \u201cravishes and carnally knows,\u201d see St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, and our decision construing these terms in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra, </em>the Legislature has amended G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6, 14, but has not expanded the scope of the proscribed offenses to include \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the Legislature recently rewrote G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3 (an act criminalizing the overpowering of another by means of an intoxicating substance for sexual purposes), substituting the terms \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse\u201d for the term \u201cunlawful sexual intercourse.\u201d See St. 1998, c. 232, \u00a7 3. This same legislation rewrote G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4, which criminalizes \u2018inducting] any person under 18 years of age of chaste life to have unlawful sexual intercourse,\u201d to revise the penalty provisions, but did not similarly expand the scope of this offense to include \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Assuming, as we must, that the Legislature, in enacting these various amendments, was aware of this court\u2019s prior construction of the terms \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse,\u201d see <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. 670, 677 (1997), quoting <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 309, 313 (1949), we must infer from this legislative activity that it intends these terms to be similarly defined where they appear in G. L. c. 272.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because statutes which relate to a common subject matter \u201cshould be construed together so as to constitute an harmonious whole,\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975), we interpret G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, in conjunction with other statutes in G. L. c. 272 that contain the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d (in particular G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, which also contains the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d), and conclude, regrettably, that the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute excludes such forms of sexual conduct as are encompassed by the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d As the conduct allegedly engaged in by the defendant with his daughter falls within the scope of the latter term, as we have construed it, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>did not err in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the incest indictments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We acknowledge, as did the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court, that the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is shocking and abhorrent in nature. However, as the Appeals Court reasoned, \u201c[w]e have no right to read into the incest statute \u2018a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 826 (1999), quoting <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). While the result in this case undoubtedly offends both common sense and fundamental decency, it is an outcome that is compelled by the Legislature\u2019s choice of language in G. L. c. 272, coupled with the limits on this court\u2019s powers that flow from art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>423 Mass. 534, 539 (1996), cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1131 (1997); <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Kokofsky, </em>373 Mass. 778, 780-781 (1977). Accordingly, if the statutory crime of incest is to encompass the conduct here alleged, it is incumbent on the Legislature to use the terms it has adopted to convey this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We affirm the order of the Superior Court judge allowing the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-16\">he defendant was also indicted for indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years, G.

The defendant was not indicted for rape or statutory rape. The alleged acts of intercourse occurred after the victim had reached the age of sixteen years, thus precluding statutory rape charges.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, criminalizes \u201csexual intercourse\u201d (along with intermarriage and cohabitation) among specified relations who are not limited to blood relatives. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, \u00a7 230.2, at 397 (1980). The drafters\u2019 comments with respect to the intended meaning of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in this context are instructive and directly relevant to this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u201cTo the extent that incest is based on a genetic rationale, it is clear that only normal vaginal intercourse between male and female should be prevented. The other objectives of the law, however, point to a broader concept. For example, the preservation of family unity can be disrupted as much by a father who engages in intercourse per os or per anum with his daughter or his son as by a father who engages in vaginal intercourse with his daughter. Imposition by a dominant parent upon an adopted child has a similar destructive effect independent of the form the intercourse might take. It would seem, therefore, that a strong case could be made for including all forms of intercourse within the incest prohibition, and such is the intent of the Model Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 230.2 comment 4, at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The drafters of the Model Penal Code were, admittedly, influenced partly by their having defined \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in their rape statute to include penetration per os and per anum. See <em>id. </em>at 418 n.78, citing <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 213.0. However, the drafters go on to explain that the various noneugenic purposes served by the incest prohibition (e.g., family unity, reinforcement of community norms, protection of the young) suffice, independently of the rape statute\u2019s definition of \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d to warrant giving this term a \u201cbroad reading ... in the context of incest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418 n.78.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>409 Mass. 284, 286 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 174 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b439-8\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVk\">(concurring). I agree with the court that the revisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 232, \u00a7 3, are additional support for the proposition that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, cannot be applied to the acts of the defendant. However, I also agree with the Appeals Court and the Superior Court that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, even without the guidance of the 1998 amendments to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, did not criminalize the acts in question. The Legislature has defined the terms \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d and does not normally use them interchangeably. We should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>read into a criminal statute with significant penal consequences our view of what the Legislature should have done.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-5\">Ireland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASS\">(dissenting). I write separately because I believe</p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">the court, while correctly acknowledging that the purpose of the incest statute is to \u201cpromote the sanctity and integrity of familial relationships, as well as to protect children within the family from sexual impositions,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 422, fails to interpret the statute to further those purposes. The court\u2019s overly narrow definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d does not accord with a commonsense understanding of the term and leaves the children of the Commonwealth inadequately protected from sexual exploitation by relatives. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">To begin, I agree that the court is not bound by its previous construction of the term \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d as used in the rape statutes, when construing the term as used in the incest statute. <em>Ante </em>at 420. I also agree that it is appropriate for the court to look to other statutes for interpretive guidance when those statutes are in pari materia. <em>Id. </em>I disagree though, that the Legislature, by enacting St. 1998, c. 232, which, in part, rewrote G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, intended to import the Court\u2019s construction of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the context of the rape statutes, into all sections of c. 272. <em>Ante </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">First, the title of the act and its provisions indicates that the legislative purpose was to address the issue of drug facilitated rape and kidnapping.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statutes affected by the legislation seem to be no more in pari materia with the incest statutes than the other rape statutes. Although the court implies that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>statutes amended by St. 1998, c. 232, and the incest statute relate \u201cto a common subject matter,\u201d the court does not identify one, and seems to rest that conclusion on the mere fact that the statutes appear in the same chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Furthermore, and more fundamentally, the court\u2019s interpretation fails to further all of the purposes served by the statute. The Legislature may choose to employ a term differently in two different statutes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>878 F. Supp. 279, 284 (D. Mass. 1995), aff\u2019d, 85 F.3d 713 (1st Cir. 1996) (same term may be employed differently in two different statutes, whether by mistake or intention). In each statute, the term should be construed to effectuate the purposes of that particular statute. The court acknowledges that the plain language of the incest statute indicates that it was intended to \u201cadvance purposes different from, <em>and more compelling </em>than, eugenics,\u201d including the promotion of the family unit and the protection of children (emphasis added). <em>Ante </em>at 421-422. The court also acknowledges that an interpretation of sexual intercourse limited only to \u201cheterosexual coitus\u201d is \u201ca restrictive definition consistent only with a debatable eugenics rationale.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 422. The court proceeds, however, to interpret the statute in such a way to cover only \u201cheterosexual coitus.\u201d This result is in direct contravention to the fundamental principle of statutory interpretation, that is, the court should construe a statute in order to effectuate its purpose or purposes, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983); <em>ante </em>at 421; and disregards dictionary definitions of the term, <em>ante </em>at 422, on which we have traditionally relied to help us determine the ordinary and common usage of a word. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>415 Mass. 697, 700 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977); <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 551 (1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Under the court\u2019s interpretation, a mother who had vaginal intercourse with her son would be committing incest, whereas a father who had anal intercourse with his son or his daughter would not be committing incest. As the Pennsylvania courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>have noted, such a result would be arbitrary, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fouse, </em>417 Pa. Super. 534, 540 (1992), and we should not interpret the statute to lead to such an absurd result. See, e.g., <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996), quoting <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In sum, I dissent because the court\u2019s interpretation does not serve all of the purposes of the incest statute and thus is not consistent with the legislative intent, leads to an unfair and absurd result, fails adequately to protect the children of our Commonwealth from sexual abuse within their families, and, as the court itself acknowledges, \u201coffends both common sense and fundamental decency.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 425.1 would urge the Legislature to act as quickly as possible to correct the situation created by the court\u2019s decision today.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Statute 1998, c. 232, is entitled \u201cAn Act relative to the prevention of drug induced rape and kidnapping,\u201d and in addition to substituting \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse\" for \u201cunlawful sexual intercourse\u201d in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, the act also substantially increased the penalty for violation of that statute, amended G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31, by adding three compounds to class A controlled substances, and created a new crime, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26B (drugging person for kidnapping).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The act also amended the punishment provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4 (inducing person under eighteen to have unlawful sexual intercourse), in order to keep the punishment for that crime the same as it had been before St. 1998, c. 232, was enacted. Prior to St. 1998, c. 232, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4, provided for punishment as stated in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3. Statute 1998, c. 232, significantly increased the penalty for violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3. Statute 1998, c. 232, also rewrote G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4, such that the penalty for it remained the same, after the penalty for G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, was increased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Also, under the court\u2019s reasoning, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 59, 65, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Bucuvalas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>439 U.S. 827 (1978), would be overruled. In that case, which interpreted G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6, a statute prohibiting owners from allowing their premises to be used for \u201cunlawfully having sexual intercourse for money,\u201d the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d was construed to include \u201ca variety of sexual conduct, including the act of fellatio.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">It is trae that penal statutes are to be strictly construed. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 742-743 (1996). The purpose behind the rule of strict construction, however, is to put defendants properly on notice of what types of behavior are criminalized. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 270 (1983). Here, the defendant should have understood that his alleged actions constituted the crime of incest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
