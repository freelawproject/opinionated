It concerns the effect of a manufacturer\u2019s disclaimer of an implied warranty of merchantability on a subsequent purchaser who was unaware of the disclaimer. It also concerns a manufacturer\u2019s liability under agency principles for the actions of the manufacturer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>authorized parts and service dealer, when that dealer is engaged in nonwarranty repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The plaintiff, Theos &amp; Sons, Inc. (Theos), brought an action for damages to its Mack truck engine, against Mack Trucks, Inc. (Mack), a manufacturer of trucks, its distributor, Manchester Mack Sales, Inc. (Manchester Mack), and Vigor Diesel Injection, Inc. (Vigor), an authorized Mack parts and service dealer. A judge in the District Court granted summary judgment for Mack, without detailing his reasons, and entered final judgment as to Mack pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). Theos appealed to the Appellate Division of the District Court, which affirmed the judgment. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. Theos argues two theories of liability. First, Theos argues that Mack breached an implied warranty of merchantability and that Mack\u2019s original disclaimer of this implied warranty is not effective against Theos, a subsequent purchaser unaware of the disclaimer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, Theos argues under agency theory that Mack is vicariously liable for the dealer\u2019s negligent repair of, or failure to repair, the engine and the dealer\u2019s breach of express warranties and violations of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We conclude that Mack\u2019s disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability given to the original truck purchaser may be enforced against a subsequent purchaser without notice, such as Theos. Because Theos presented no genuine issue of Mack\u2019s liability for its dealer\u2019s conduct under an agency or any other theory, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. R 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>See, e.g., <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>418 Mass. 394, 397 (1994). We review the facts under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On August 31, 1989, J.E. Larkin, Inc. (Larkin), purchased from Mack and took delivery of a Mack truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The terms of sale included a \u201cMack Mid-Liner Standard Warranty\u201d (warranty) that covered the truck\u2019s engine for twenty-four months after delivery and a disclaimer of all other warranties, express or implied, including the implied warranty of merchantability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The twenty-four month engine warranty expired on August 31, 1991. On December 17, 1992, Theos bought the truck from Larkin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Theos was neither apprised of, nor provided with, any written copy of the warranty, nor informed of any such disclaimers.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In December, 1993, a Theos driver heard noises coming from the truck\u2019s engine compartment and towed the truck to Vigor for repairs, where it was determined that the engine block was damaged. After Vigor repaired the truck, the Theos driver drove it for a short distance before the same noise was heard again. The truck was brought back to Vigor and, while in Vigor\u2019s possession, the truck\u2019s engine failed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The relationship between the distributor, Manchester Mack, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>and authorized parts and service dealer, Vigor, is outlined in an agreement titled, \u201cAuthorized Parts and Service Dealer Agreement\u201d (agreement). The agreement states that it \u201cis not valid unless and until . . . approved by an officer of [Mack].\u201d The agreement was executed by officers of Manchester Mack and Vigor, and \u201capproved\u201d by two Mack executives. We describe in greater detail in Part 2, <em>infra, </em>additional terms that inform our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The agreement provides that Vigor will render warranty service on Mack vehicles \u201cin accordance with [Mack\u2019s] applicable standard warranty policy,\u201d and only on prior approval for such service from Manchester Mack. Warranty service is to be undertaken using only genuine Mack or Mack-approved parts acquired from Manchester Mack.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">2. <em>Breach of implied warranty claim. </em>We consider first Theos\u2019s contention that Mack is liable for the engine repair because Mack breached an implied warranty of merchantability. In the face of Mack\u2019s written disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability, Theos argues that the contract between Mack and the original purchaser, Larkin, does not bind it, a subsequent purchaser. Theos argues further that, because the implied warranty of merchantability is statutory, and because it is not unforeseeable that a truck may be resold by the original purchaser, Mack should be required as a matter of law to put subsequent purchasers on notice of the disclaimer of such warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a warranty of merchantability is implied in the sale of goods by a merchant unless properly disclaimed. The exclusion of implied warranties is governed by G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-316 (2), which provides in relevant part: \u201cto exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous.\u201d The Appellate Division correctly determined that in this case the implied warranty was properly disclaimed by Mack, as to Larkin, because it was conspicuous and specifically referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the implied warranty of merchantability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Appellate Division also correctly determined that the writing of the disclaimer complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-316, and thus effectively disclaimed all implied warranties. The question is, therefore, whether the disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability is enforceable against Theos, a subsequent purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 2-318, extends all warranties, express or implied, to third parties who may reasonably be expected to use the warranted product.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 2-318 does not provide that subsequent (third-party) purchasers are bound by disclaimers of warranties. A comment to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-318, however, states that \u201cwhere the warranty is properly excluded then [third parties] are bound by the exclusion.\u201d Massachusetts Code Comment, 13 M.G.L.A. 247-248 (West 1999). See 3A R.A. Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-316:168 (3d ed. 1995) (\u201cWhen the express warrantor specifies that a subpurchaser of the goods may apply for a transfer of the express warranty made to the original purchaser, the subpurchaser is subject to any limitation or exclusion contained in the express warranty even though the subpurchaser may not have ever received a copy of it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">While we have not directly addressed this issue, other jurisdictions have reasoned that a subsequent purchaser should be subject to disclaimers or limitations on warranties made to the original purchaser, and should not acquire greater rights than those held by the original purchaser. See <em>Transport Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>International Business Machs., Inc., </em>30 F.3d 953, 959 (8th Cir. 1994) (interpreting U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2-318 and 2-316 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>adopted in Minnesota) (disclaimers of implied warranties are extended to subsequent purchasers); <em>Boston Helicopter Charter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agusta Aviation Corp., </em>767 F. Supp. 363, 376 (D. Mass. 1991) (subsequent purchaser, as an assignee, \u201csteps into the shoes of his assignor\u201d and is subject to any limitations or exclusions contained in the express warranty even though he did not receive a copy of it); <em>Lecates </em>v. <em>Hertrich Pontiac Buick Co., </em>515 A.2d 163, 165-166 (Del. Super. Ct. 1986) (modifications or exclusions of warranty rights are equally operative against subsequent purchasers who claim to be beneficiaries of such warranties); <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Halco Instruments, Inc., </em>124 Ga. App. 630, 634-635 (1971) (same). We agree with the reasoning of those courts that Theos could not possess greater warranty rights as to Mack than the original purchaser, Larkin, and is subject to the same disclaimers or other limitations on an implied warranty of merchantability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The subsequent purchaser bears the burden of ascertaining the existence of any limitations on the implied warranties. As Theos is subject to the disclaimer of implied warranty of merchantability that Mack made to Larkin, its warranty claim fails.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>3. <em>Liability of principal for agent\u2019s actions. </em>Invoking principles of agency law, Theos asserts that Mack is liable for the actions of Vigor because Vigor, as an authorized parts and service dealer, had actual, or at least apparent, authority to work on the truck engine on behalf of Mack. Mack responds that Vigor is an independent contractor for whose malfeasance Mack is not liable. Although the question of agency is usually an issue for the fact finder, the Appellate Division determined that Theos failed to advance specific facts sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to Vigor\u2019s actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of Mack. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">An agency relationship is created when there is mutual consent, express or implied, that the agent is to act on behalf and for the benefit of the principal, and subject to the principal\u2019s control. See <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>393 Mass. 640, 645 (1985), citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958); Restatement (Second) of Agency, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15 comments a, b. See also <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>317 Mass. 721, 723 (1945) (fundamental element of agency relationship is that agent act on behalf and for benefit of principal). The agreement, on the one hand, specifies that Vigor \u201cis an independent contractor.\u201d The agreement further states that Mack is not a party to the covenants between Manchester Mack and Vigor, that it \u201cshall not in any respect make [Vigor] the agent of [Manchester Mack] or of [Mack] to transact any business ... for either of them in any form, nor in the name nor upon the behalf of either of them to make any promises or representations.\u201d On the other hand, the agreement is quite specific in its requirements with respect to warranty work. It also appears to give Mack some control over certain aspects of Vigor\u2019s activities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Based on the undisputed evidence, we shall presume, without deciding, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>principal-agent relationship existed between Mack and Vigor, at least for purposes of doing Mack <em>warranty </em>work.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Even where an agent-principal relationship exists, however, the principal has liability for the agent\u2019s acts toward third par-, ties only if the agent was acting with the actual or apparent authority of the principal in that transaction. See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (1958). Mack would be liable for nonwarranty work performed on Theos\u2019s truck only if Vigor had actual or apparent authority to do such repair work on behalf of Mack. Actual authority, either express or implied,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the agent\u2019s power to affect the principal\u2019s relations with third parties as manifested to the agent by the principal. See Restatement (Second) of Agency, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">c Theos relies principally on the agreement to establish actual authority for Vigor to do this nonwarranty work on Mack\u2019s behalf. The agreement undeniably establishes several minimum requirements when such work is done by Vigor. Such service, for example, must be done in a \u201cprompt and efficient\u201d manner, \u201cin accordance with [Mack\u2019s] policies and standards,\u201d and \u201cexcept with the written consent of [Mack], will utilize . . . only parts manufactured or recommended by [Mack].\u201d These requirements, however, are merely reflective of the ordinary desire of manufacturers to set sufficient minimum performance and quality standards to protect the good name of their trademark that they are allowing another to display. See <em>Oberlin </em>v. <em>Marlin Am. Corp., </em>596 F.2d 1322, 1327 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>Hunter Mining Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Management Assistance, Inc., </em>104 Nev. 568, 570-571 (1988). Cf. <em>Billops </em>v. <em>Magness Constr. Co., </em>391 A.2d 196, 197-198 (Del. 1978) (franchise agreements). They do not establish, without more, the kind of close control over Vigor\u2019s nonwarranty work that would indicate that Vigor was serving as Mack\u2019s agent for the work.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Unlike warranty work, for example, no prior approval is required for nonwarranty work under the agreement. Moreover, although not dis-positive, we consider it not without significance that the agreement expressly states that Vigor is an \u201cindependent contractor . . . not. . . [an] agent\u201d of Mack for the purposes of transacting business in the name of Mack nor for making any promises or representations on behalf of Mack.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In addition, Theos proffers no evidence that Mack knew of, or consented to, the servicing of the truck by Vigor, much less that Mack wanted Vigor to service the truck on Mack\u2019s behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>and authorized Vigor to do so. To the contrary, it is undisputed that Mack did not know of Vigor\u2019s service work on the truck until after it had been completed. We agree with the judgment that Theos did not advance evidence sufficient to raise a question of Mack\u2019s liability under an agency theory premised on actual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Nor did Theos proffer evidence sufficient to raise an issue of vicarious liability premised on apparent authority. Apparent authority, is \u201ccreated as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 27. See <em>Linkage Corp. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>425 Mass. 1, 16, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1015 (1997), quoting <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 450, 457 (1982) (\u201cApparent authority results from conduct by the principal . . .\u201d); <em>DeVaux </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co., </em>387 Mass. 814, 819 (1983). See also <em>Kansallis Fin. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Fern, </em>421 Mass. 659, 665 (1996) (\u201cthere is little fairness in saddling the principal with liability for acts that a reasonable third party would not have supposed were taken on the principal\u2019s behalf\u201d). Apparent authority exists only if the plaintiff reasonably relied on the principal\u2019s words or conduct at the time he entered the transaction that the agent is authorized to act on the principal\u2019s behalf. See <em>Commercial Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Stan Cross Buick, Inc., </em>343 Mass. 622, 626 (1962).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See also <em>Todd Farm Corp. </em>v. <em>Navistar Int\u2019l Corp., </em>835 F.2d 1253, 1256 (8th Cir. 1987) (no apparent authority of equipment dealer to act for manufacturer where, inter alia, no evidence plaintiff aware of manufacturer\u2019s statements when it bought equipment nor reasonably relied on manufacturer\u2019s reputation when it did business with dealer).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As evidence of apparent authority, Theos relied on Mack\u2019s logo on Vigor\u2019s invoices, Mack\u2019s logos displayed at Vigor\u2019s place of business, that Vigor was required to display conspicu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ously Mack-approved service signs provided by Mack, and Vigor\u2019s statement<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to Theos that it was an authorized parts and service dealer of Mack. But the mere use of a trademark and other logos of the defendant is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the defendant cloaked Vigor with apparent authority. See <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Texas Co., </em>340 Mass. 606, 608-609 (I960). See also <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Walgreens Co., </em>878 F.2d 560, 562 (1st Cir. 1989) (franchisee\u2019s mere use of franchisor\u2019s logo, by itself, does not create genuine issue of material fact with respect to apparent authority)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; <em>Malmberg </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>644 So. 2d 888, 891 (Ala. 1994) (apparent authority based on actions of principal not agent; evidence of Honda logos on signs and literature at dealership not alone sufficient to create inference of agency); <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Bransford, </em>648 So. 2d 119, 121 (Fla. 1995) (erroneous to give impression that \u201clogos or other trademark symbols alone can create an apparent agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Similarly, Vigor\u2019s representation of itself as an authorized parts and service dealer of Mack is not a sufficient ground for Theos to reasonably believe that Vigor had apparent authority to act as Mack\u2019s agent for nonwarranty work. See <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number><em>zuki Motor Co., </em>174 Ill. 2d 482, 498 (1996), quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Courtesy Motor Sales, Inc., </em>48 Ill. App. 2d 380, 383 (1964) (\u201cthe term \u2018Authorized . . . Dealer\u2019 is in the nature of a trademark sign, which is used by independent dealers . . . and means nothing more than a dealer who sells [those] products\u201d); <em>Cline </em>v. <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp., </em>690 S.W.2d 764, 769 (Ky. Ct. App. 1985) (simply being \u201cauthorized dealer\u201d is insufficient to establish true agency). See also <em>Todd Farm Corp. </em>v. <em>Navistar Int\u2019l Corp., supra </em>at 1256 (jury could not reasonably find this authorized dealer had apparent authority to act for manufacturer); <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>ICI Americas, Inc., </em>933 F. Supp. 781, 789-790 (S.D. Iowa 1996) (insufficient control by manufacturer over authorized distributors to create question of material fact regarding existence of principal-agent relationship). Theos has established no facts to support a claim that Mack held out Vigor as Mack\u2019s agent, giving Vigor apparent authority to act on its behalf. See <em>Todd Farm Corp. </em>v. <em>Navistar Int\u2019l Corp., supra </em>at 1256; <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Suzuki Motor Co., supra </em>at 498-499.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Moreover, Mack did not represent, persuade or otherwise manifest to Theos that it seek service from Vigor so as to create liability for Mack based on the malfeasance of Vigor. See Restatement (Second) of Agency, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 267 comment a (principal\u2019s liability through apparent authority normally applies where plaintiff submitted himself to care of apparent agent in response to invitation from principal). Theos came forward with no evidence (other than the presence of Mack\u2019s logos) to suggest that Mack influenced Theos, through acts or words, to rely on servicing its truck at Vigor. We express no opinion as to whether an authorized dealer can maintain a separate action against the manufacturer for providing negligent service information. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\">^heos claims that the total destruction of its Mack truck engine and resulting damages were caused by Mack\u2019s breach of implied warranties in the design, development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, and distribution of the engine in the truck, specifically its pistons and liners. The engine apparently failed at the Vigor garage. Theos makes no claim of personal injuries resulting from the engine failure or of damages to other property; damages are apparently based on the costs for repair or replacement of the ruined engine.

The reasoning of <em>Ferragamo </em>is not applicable in an implied warranty contract claim, as here. \u201cWhen a product injures only itself, the reasons for imposing a tort duty are weak and those leaving the party to its contractual remedies are strong.\u201d <em>Bay State-Spray &amp; Provincetown S.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>404 Mass. 103, 109 (1989), quoting <em>East River S.S.

See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The \u201cmiddleman\u201d cases cited by the plaintiff, which hold that \u201ca manufacturer may not disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability to an ultimate consumer by merely including a disclaimer in a contract with a middleman or buyer who holds for resale only,\u201d do not apply here, where there is no evidence that Larkin was such a middleman. <em>Groppel Co. </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>616 S.W.2d 49, 60-61 (Mo. Ct. App. 1981). See <em>Patty Precision Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Sharpe Mfg. Co., </em>846 F.2d 1247, 1252-1254 (10th Cir. 1988). These cases deal with middlemen who purchase products for resale to third parties and thus are not the ultimate users of products whose warranty is disclaimed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">On appeal, Theos does not press a claim of express warranty against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Mack. In any event, such a claim is barred because the two-year express warranty on the engine expired more than two years before the engine\u2019s failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Theos also asserts that Mack engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A for failing to perform or fulfil promises or obligations arising under a warranty. Mack argues that this claim was not preserved on appeal. We need not determine whether Theos waived this claim: because the warranty claim is without merit, the derivative c. 93A claim also fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The agreement requires, for example, that Vigor (1) maintain suitable facilities with adequate and efficient service personnel and equipment; (2) render prompt and efficient service in accordance with Mack\u2019s policies and standards; (3) maintain a stock of genuine Mack parts; (4) utilize only parts manufactured or recommended by Mack in repairing or otherwise servicing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Mack vehicles, except with written consent of Mack; (5) provide a conspicuous written disclosure in specified language to a customer when using a part that is not \u201cMack-approved\u201d in servicing a Mack vehicle; (6) maintain certain tools specified by Mack; (7) conspicuously display Mack-approved service signs; (8) send at least one of every four mechanics employed at the authorized dealer\u2019s facility to the Mack Service Training School at Vigor\u2019s own expense; and (9) use Mack\u2019s trademarks \u201conly in a form and manner specifically approved by [Mack] in writing in advance of such use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Theos does not claim that the work performed by Vigor was under the Mack warranty. The agreement, which dealt in part with Mack warranty service work by Vigor, stated that Mack \u201cdesire[d] to have authorized parts and service dealer facilities for Mack motor vehicles available in the area where [Vigor was] located\u201d; was signed by two of Mack\u2019s vice-presidents; was not valid unless approved by one of Mack\u2019s officers; and had other provisions involving Mack or Mack approvals. Thus, the agreement arguably established mutual consent between Mack and Vigor as to warranty service work. Besides establishing an authorized service dealer in Vigor\u2019s locale, which Mack desired, the agreement benefited Mack by requiring that only genuine Mack or Mack-approved parts acquired from Mack\u2019s distributor be used in warranty service work. The agreement further provided that Vigor could do warranty work for Mack only after prior approval for the warranty service by Mack\u2019s authorized distributor, Manchester Mack, and that such warranty service had to be done in accordance with Mack\u2019s applicable standard warranty policy. Thus, it might be claimed that Mack exerted effective control over the warranty work, establishing the requisite mutual consent, benefit for, and control by, the principal necessary for the establishment of a principal-agent relationship between Mack and Vigor regarding Mack warranty service work. See <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>393 Mass. 640, 645 (1985), quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958). Other courts have held that an agency relationship may exist between a manufacturer and a dealer or authorized dealer for the purposes of performing warranty work. See, e.g., <em>Royal Lincoln-Mercury Sales </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>415 So. 2d 1024, 1028 (Miss. 1982); <em>Zwingman </em>v. <em>Kalhoff, </em>244 Neb. 51, 520 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Actual authority can be express or implied.

In <em>Gizzi, </em>however, there was evidence which was presented to show that Texaco exercised control over the activities of the service station which allegedly caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. In <em>Gizzi, </em>among other facts, in addition to the use of Texaco insignia, there was evidence that Texaco engaged in extensive advertising to promote the impression that Texaco was substantially involved in the sale and service of cars sold and serviced at the station, that the oil company sold its products at the station, that the company owned pieces of equipment in the service station, and that Texaco had a regional office located directly opposite the station.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561-562.
