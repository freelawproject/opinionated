We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and issues on appeal. It is worth noting at the outset, however, that although Battiste-Downie appears <em>pro se </em>in this Court, she was represented by counsel at all relevant times in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We review the imposition of sanctions for \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d and the factual findings made in support of the District Court\u2019s decision for clear error. <em>See S. New England Tel. Co. v. Global NAPs Inc., </em>624 F.3d 123, 143 (2d Cir.2010); <em>see also Sieck v. Russo, </em>869 F.2d 131, 134 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cWe ... prefer to ... provide the teeth to enforce discovery orders by leaving it to the district court to determine which sanction from among the available range is appropriate.\u201d). We have identified the following \u201cuseful\u201d factors in evaluating a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action under Rule 37: \u201c(1) the willfulness of the noncompliant party or the reason for noncompliance; (2) the efficacy of lesser sanctions; (3) the duration of the period of noncompliance, and (4) whether the non-compliant party had been warned of the consequences of noncompliance.\u201d <em>See Agiwal v. Mid Island Mortg. Corp., </em>555 F.3d 298, 302 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted); <em>see also S. New England Tel, </em>624 F.3d at 144 (\u201c[Tjhese factors are not exclusive, and they need not each be resolved against the party challenging the district court\u2019s sanctions for us to conclude that those sanctions were within the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">We have reviewed the record in light of these principles and now affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Battiste-Downie\u2019s action. First, the record amply supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Battiste-Downie\u2019s noncompliance was willful. Battiste-Downie repeatedly defied discovery orders, despite the District Court\u2019s explicit instructions on several occasions that she was to respond to specific discovery demands propounded by defendants or face sanctions. For example, Battiste-Downie does not dispute that she never produced her computer\u2019s hard drive or a consent form that would have allowed for discovery from a third party, despite being ordered to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Second, the efficacy of lesser sanctions to correct such behavior is doubtful, given that Battiste-Downie refused to respond to the discovery demands even after being ordered repeatedly by the District Court to do so. Third, Plaintiff-Appellant persisted in her noncompliance for approximately one year <em>(i.e., </em>beginning with her original response to defendants\u2019 request for documents in July 2009 until her failure to abide by the District Court\u2019s final June 2010 deadline for compliance), resulting in numerous hearings to address the issue. Finally, Battiste-Downie was warned on at least two occasions that she would face the harshest sanction \u2014 dismissal of her claims \u2014 if she failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders. Notwithstanding this, she persistently disregarded the District Court\u2019s orders to fulfill her discovery obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
