The BIA denied that motion as untimely because it was not filed within 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>days of the BIA\u2019s final decision and did not fall within any exception to that time limit. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (\u201c[T]he motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order or removal.\u201d) Zapata does not challenge that conclusion in his brief to this Court, so he has abandoned any argument that the BIA was wrong to conclude that his motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A8_\">. The BIA also found that the motion to reopen was essentially a motion to reconsider. The BIA concluded that if construed as motion to reconsider, it was still untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B). Zapata has not challenged that conclusion either, so he has abandoned any issue about that as well. <em>See Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1145.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
