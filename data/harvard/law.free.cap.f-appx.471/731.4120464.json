R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b761-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-23\">Jashandeep Kaur, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) decision denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003), and we review de novo questions of law, <em>Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1274-75 (9th Cir.2007). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the discrepancy between Kaur\u2019s testimony and her statements to the asylum officer regarding the mistreatment she suffered in detention, and based on the discrepancy between Kaur\u2019s testimony and her declaration regarding the circumstances of her release from police custody. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>(9th Cir.2004); <em>see also Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081, 1089-90 (9th Cir.2005) (listing indica of reliability for an asylum officer\u2019s notes). In the absence of credible testimony, Kaur\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Because Kaur\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found not credible, and she points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not she will be tortured if returned to India, her CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Finally, we reject Kaur\u2019s contention that the IJ was biased, because she has not demonstrated any bias or that the outcome of the proceedings was affected. <em>See Rivera, </em>508 F.3d at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b761-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
