The district court granted a certificate of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>pealability (COA) as to whether Buckenberger was entitled to habeas relief under the Confrontation Clause. We previously denied Buckenberger\u2019s motion to expand the issues on which COA was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The denial of \u00a7 2254 relief under the Confrontation Clause is reviewed de novo because it presents a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See Fratta v. Quarterman, </em>536 F.3d 485, 499 (5th Cir.2008). Because Buckenberger\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim was adjudicated on the merits by the state court, <em>see State v. Buckenberger, </em>984 So.2d 751, 753 (La.Ct.App.2008), the district court was prohibited from granting habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d refers to holdings of the Supreme Court at the time of the state court\u2019s decision. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). An unreasonable application of law differs from an incorrect application; thus a federal habeas court may correct what it finds to be an incorrect application of law only if this application also is objectively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 409-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Buckenberger argues that the arresting officer\u2019s statements as to what the victim told him should have been suppressed because they were not excited utterances and there was no continuing emergency. He also asserts, without support, that the officer and the victim fabricated their stories, that their veracity could have been impeached, that the officer admitted violating the Confrontation Clause, and that the state\u2019s representation that the victim could not be found to testify at trial was false. He contends that there was insufficient evidence as to the victim\u2019s emotional state and that admission of the victim\u2019s statements was not harmless error because it was key to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 54-57, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that out-of-court testimonial statements are barred by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Only testimonial statements \u201ccause the declarant to be a \u2018witness\u2019 within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). The state court correctly identified the governing law in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis, </em>but determined that the victim\u2019s statements were made during an ongoing emergency and were nontestimonial. The victim\u2019s statements were made at the scene, while under the stress of the incident, and while law enforcement was still attempting to resolve the situation and to obtain any needed treatment for the victim. Given these circumstances, which are distinguishable from any controlling Supreme Court precedent at the time of the state court\u2019s decision, the state court\u2019s determination that the statements were nontestimonial is not objectively unreasonable. <em>See Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011); <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Additionally, in light of the eyewitness testimony regarding Buckenberger\u2019s conduct, Buckenberger has not shown that the state court\u2019s determination that any error was harmless involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>Fratta, </em>536 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>at 507-08. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Buckenberger\u2019s motions to supplement his brief and his reply brief, and his motion for judicial notice, are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
