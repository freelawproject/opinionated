We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">The district court did not err in finding that Carderella failed to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination. <em>Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Carderella acknowledges that he has no information regarding the race or national origin of the individuals ultimately selected for the vacant DEO positions. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (holding that to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>VII, an individual must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the position remained open and the employer sought other similarly qualified individuals outside his protected class).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to draw an adverse inference of discrimination against Napolitano as a sanction for the spoliation of the documents. <em>Medical Lab. Mgt. Consultants v. Am. Broadcasting Cos. Inc., </em>306 F.3d 806, 823-24 (9th Cir.2002). The record suggests the employee files may have been lost or destroyed pursuant to the INS\u2019s internal two-year retention policy and therefore were not destroyed in bad faith or in anticipation of litigation, which commenced over a decade after Carderella filed his initial employment discrimination claim with the EEO. <em>See e.g., United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., </em>314 F.3d 995, 1001 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Akiona v. United States, </em>938 F.2d 158, 161 (9th Cir.1991). Regardless, Carderella\u2019s reliance on the spoliated evidence alone would be insufficient to prove a prima facie case of employment discrimination. <em>See Medical Lab. Mgt. Consultants, </em>306 F.3d at 825 (\u201cWhen a party has produced no evidence \u2014 or utterly inadequate evidence \u2014 in support of a given claim, the destruction of evidence, standing alone, is not enough to allow the party to survive summary judgment on that claim.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Finally, Carderella\u2019s request for judicial notice of portions of Rafael Roldan\u2019s deposition is denied. <em>Bias v. Moynihan, </em>508 F.3d 1212, 1225 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
