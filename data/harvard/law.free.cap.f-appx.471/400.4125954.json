Davis was convicted in 2005 of conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tributing cocaine base and was sentenced at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range to 360 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Although application of the amendment at issue would reduce Davis\u2019s base offense level, it would not alter the sentencing guidelines range upon which his sentence was based. Accordingly, because Davis\u2019s sentencing guidelines range would remand unchanged at 360 months to life imprisonment, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s., comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">To the extent that Davis challenges the application of a sentencing enhancement and the determination that he was responsible for 2.7 kilograms of cocaine base, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
