FLETCHER, NOONAN, and PAEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b609-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">Donna Marcelle Zamora appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. We affirm the finding of Zamora\u2019s residual functional capacity for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">The ALJ properly determined Zamora\u2019s residual functional capacity. Dr. Teran opined that Zamora could \u201cfrequently\u201d lift and carry objects weighing less than ten pounds, could \u201coccasionally\u201d lift objects weighing ten pounds, and could lift up to twenty pounds on rare occasions. She further opined that Zamora was capable of standing or walking for approximately four hours per day. The ALJ\u2019s determination that Zamora was capable of light work with a sit/stand option at will was therefore consistent with Dr. Teran\u2019s medical assessment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">The ALJ also properly resolved ambiguities in Dr. Kalman\u2019s opinion. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989). Dr. Kalman opined that Zamora could not perform at a competitive pace but that she was nevertheless capable of following simple job instructions, satisfactorily maintaining her attention for two hours at a time, and sustaining an ordinary routine. These limitations are consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>with the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Finally, the ALJ did not err in discounting Zamora\u2019s credibility due to her failure to attend either of two scheduled consultative evaluations. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
