Sanchez argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a mitigating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 based on his role as a minimal or minor participant in the offense. He argues that he performed menial tasks and was instructed in these tasks by his co-conspirator. Sanchez further notes that he played no part in the actual cooking of the methamphetamine and would not have received any part of the profits from the intended sale of methamphetamine. He argues that the court\u2019s error in this regard affected the choice of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">The determination that a defendant is a minimal or minor participant under \u00a7 3B1.2 is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir. 2005). A defendant was a minimal participant if he was \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group\u201d as evidenced by his \u201clack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.4). A defendant was a minor participant if his role was more than minimal but he was \u201cless culpable than most other participants.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">Sanchez traveled from Los Angeles to Dallas with his co-conspirator. He was present in meetings, booked the hotel room, acted as a driver, assisted in transporting the pot used to cook methamphetamine, and received a truck as payment for his services. Additionally, he admitted to knowing that his co-conspirator was manufacturing drugs. Because his contribution to the illegal activity was more than peripheral, he was not entitled to a reduction for being a minor participant. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204. Further, he has not demonstrated that he was a minimal participant because he fails to show that he was the least culpable by comparing his conduct to that of his coconspirators. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4). The district court did not clearly err in denying Sanchez a mitigating role adjustment pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>suant to \u00a7 8B1.2. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
