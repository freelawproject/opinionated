He argues that the district court procedurally erred by upwardly departing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), based on speculation regarding his family\u2019s future living arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">After Balbuena filed this appeal, he completed the confinement portion of his sentence and was released from custody. He was removed to Mexico on April 25, 2012. As Balbuena challenges only his sentence, his appeal is now moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-15\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
