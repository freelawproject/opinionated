The district court determined that Reed\u2019s challenge to his sentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) could not proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). It determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the claim, and it dismissed the action with prejudice. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-23\">A prisoner can attack the validity of his federal criminal judgment in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). The petitioner bears the burden of affirmatively showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion does not make \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901-02. The fact that future \u00a7 2255 motions will likely be considered successive or untimely is also insufficient to invoke the savings clause. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. Rather, a prisoner who wishes to proceed under the savings clause must make a showing of both actual innocence and retroactivity. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903. A petitioner makes this showing by establishing that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-24\">Reed contends the district court erred in applying this circuit\u2019s test for the savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>clause, as set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena. </em>He argues that the savings clause test for the circuit of conviction (here, the Eleventh Circuit), should instead be applied. The district court did not err in applying <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>which is binding precedent in this circuit. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Further, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction over Reed\u2019s claim, which did not satisfy this court\u2019s savings clause test. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903-04; <em>Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 451-53. However, because the district court lacked jurisdiction, its judgment should reflect that Reed\u2019s claim was dismissed without prejudice. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 454-55. Accordingly, we hereby modify in part the district court\u2019s judgment to reflect that its dismissal was with prejudice as to the jurisdictional issue and without prejudice as to the merits of Reed\u2019s claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Reed contends that the district court erred in denying his request to transfer his petition to the court of proper jurisdiction. In this regard, Reed, who is now incarcerated in Florida, asserts that the Eleventh Circuit permits sentencing claims such as his to proceed under the savings clause. Above all, in light of our conclusion that his claim properly was dismissed without prejudice, he has not established that it was in the interest of justice to transfer the action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">JUDGMENT MODIFIED IN PART; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
