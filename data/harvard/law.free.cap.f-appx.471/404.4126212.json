The 120-month sentence imposed was the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">Tovar argues that the district court erred by determining that it could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>depart below the mandatory minimum sentence, that the court should have granted her motion for downward departure, and that the district court did not engage in individualized sentencing. She also argues that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. We ordinarily lack authority to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart below a statutory minimum, but we may review de novo a district court\u2019s decision that it lacked the authority to do so. <em>United States v. James, </em>468 F.3d 245, 246-47 (5th Cir.2006). The Government did not move for a downward departure based on substantial assistance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), and Tovar was ineligible f\u00f3r a safety valve reduction under \u00a7 3553(f) because she had more than one criminal history point. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(1). Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that it lacked the authority to grant Tovar\u2019s request for a downward departure, and her sentence was therefore not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 411 (5th Cir.2008). To the extent that Tovar argues that the district court should have required the Government to file a \u00a7 3553(e) motion, that argument is without merit because the Government has the discretion, not the duty, to file such a motion, and because Tovar has not argued that the Government\u2019s decision not to file the motion was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
