We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">Soto-Lara contends that the district court erred when it calculated the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines range. In particular, he argues that the district court incorrectly determined that his prior conviction for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5(a) was a felony for purposes of section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Sentencing Guidelines. Therefore, Soto-Lara claims, the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level by 16 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, its factual determinations for clear error, and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rising Sun, </em>522 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">Section 273.5(a) is a wobbler, which means that a violation of the statute may be punished either as a felony or as a misdemeanor. <em>United States v. Denton, </em>611 F.3d 646, 651 (9th Cir.2010). If, according to California law, a person who was convicted of violating the wobbler statute is deemed to have been convicted of a felony rather than a misdemeanor, then the person has been convicted of a felony for purposes of section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Diaz-Argueta, </em>564 F.3d 1047, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2009). Section 17(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the California Penal Code determines whether a conviction for violating a wobbler is a misdemeanor or a felony. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>United States v. Bridgeforth, </em>441 F.3d 864, 870-72 (9th Cir.2006); <em>People v. Perez, </em>38 Cal.App.4th 347, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 112 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Soto-Lara\u2019s prior conviction does not qualify as a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(1). Soto-Lara contends that the state court sentenced him to a jail term for his violation of \u00a7 273.5 and that this proves that he committed a misdemeanor rather than a felony. However, the record shows that Soto-Lara was not sentenced to a jail term. Instead, the state court suspended imposition of sentence, placed him on probation, and ordered that he serve 150 days in county jail as a term of his probation. It is well-settled that a suspension of the imposition of sentence does not constitute a \u201cjudgment imposing a punishment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 17(b)(1), even if the person is placed on probation and one of the terms of probation is serving time in county jail. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)(1); <em>People v. Esparza, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 362, 61 Cal.Rptr. 167, 169 (1967); <em>see also Diaz-Argueta, </em>564 F.3d at 1049; <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>967 F.2d 287, 293 (9th Cir. 1992), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds as recognized in Ortegar-Mendez v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 1010, 1020 (9th Cir.2006). In cases where the court suspends imposition of a sentence, the wobbler conviction may become a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(1) only if the state court subsequently imposes a misdemeanor sentence. <em>See, e.g., Bridgeforth, </em>441 F.3d at 871-72. Because the record here shows that the state court suspended imposition of Soto-Lara\u2019s sentence and did not subsequently impose a sentence, Soto-Lara\u2019s conviction for violating \u00a7 273.5(a) does not qualify as a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The remainder of \u00a7 17(b) also supports the conclusion that Soto-Lara\u2019s prior conviction is a felony. Section 17(b)(2) clearly does not apply here because Soto-Lara was not committed to the Division of Juvenile Justice, which is a requirement of that subsection. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">In addition, \u00a7 17(b)(3) also does not provide any support for Soto-Lara\u2019s claim that his prior conviction was a misdemean- or. In order for a felony to become a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(3), a court must not only grant probation to a defendant without imposition of sentence, but must actually declare the offense to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)(3); <em>Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Robinson, </em>967 F.2d at 293. When there is no evidence in the record to show that the court declared the offense to be a misdemeanor, \u00a7 17(b)(3) does not operate to turn a wobbler offense into a misdemeanor. <em>See Diaz-Argueta, </em>564 F.3d at 1050. Here, there is nothing in the record showing that the court ever declared Soto-Lara\u2019s offense to be a misdemeanor. Accordingly, his violation of \u00a7 273.5(a) may not be considered a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Section 17(b)(4) requires that the prosecuting attorney file a complaint specifying that the offense was misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)(4). The complaint in Soto-Lara\u2019s case specified that the offense was a felony, not a misdemeanor. The minute order from the guilty plea hearing unequivocally shows that he pled guilty to the felony charge listed in this complaint. In addition, the \u201cAdvisement and Waiver of Rights for a Felony Guilty Plea,\u201d signed by Soto-Lara clearly indicates that Soto-Lara was pleading guilty to a felony charge. Accordingly, Soto-Lara\u2019s offense is not a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In order for a wobbler offense to become a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(5), a magistrate must determine, by the time of the preliminary examination, that the offense is a misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)(5). Here, nothing in the record shows that this ever happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Thus, under \u00a7 17(b), Soto-Lara\u2019s prior conviction is a felony, not a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Nevertheless, Soto-Lara argues that his prior conviction must be treated as a misdemeanor because the terms and conditions of his probation prohibited him from possessing firearms for a length of time associated with a misdemeanor. However, the terms and conditions of Soto-Lara\u2019s probation are not relevant under \u00a7 17(b), and we rejected a similar argument in <em>Diaz-Argueta. See </em>564 F.3d at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Finally, Soto-Lara argues that the \u201cWarning To Alien Ordered Removed or Deported,\u201d which was provided to him at the time he was deported, provides evidence supporting his argument that his prior conviction was not a felony. In support of this argument, he notes that this document does not contain a check in the box indicating that the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony. Soto-Lara again fails to explain how this document is relevant under section 17(b). Moreover, a prior conviction may qualify as a felony crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) even if the prior conviction is not an aggravated felony. <em>See Diaz-Argueta, </em>564 F.3d at 1050; <em>see also United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959, 963-64 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">Thus, the district court did not err when it determined that Soto-Lara\u2019s prior conviction was a felony and enhanced the offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
