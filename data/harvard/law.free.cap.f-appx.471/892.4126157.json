The United States Court of International Trade affirmed the final results of the Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d) first administrative review of the anti-dumping duty order levied against appellants, Fischer S.A. Comercio, Industria and Agricultura and Citrosuco North America, Inc. (collectively, \u201cFischer\u201d). Because Commerce abused its discretion in refusing to accept Fischer\u2019s additional evidence regarding its home market prices, we <em>vacate and remand. </em>On all other issues, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">This ease concerns the final results of Commerce\u2019s first administrative review of its antidumping duty order based on Fischer\u2019s export to the United States of certain orange juice from Brazil. To calculate Fischer\u2019s antidumping duty, Commerce compared the price Fischer was charging for orange juice in its home market (the \u201cnormal value\u201d) with the export price of Fischer\u2019s orange juice in the United States. Because Brazilian companies sell orange juice in different units of measure in their home and United States\u2019 markets, Commerce applied a conversion factor called the \u201cBrix level\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to determine Fischer\u2019s normal value. Commerce published a final antidumping duty determination on January 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Fischer requested an administrative review of Commerce\u2019s antidumping duty order on April 27, 2007. The administrative review covered the period between August 24, 2005, and February 28, 2007. After Commerce published its preliminary results of the administrative review, Fischer filed a case brief on issues relating to Commerce\u2019s calculations. Fischer\u2019s case brief contained new evidence regarding the Brix levels for its United States and home market sales, which Commerce rejected as untimely under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301. Commerce published its final review results on August 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Fischer appealed Commerce\u2019s final results to the Court of International Trade, challenging, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept Fischer\u2019s additional materials regarding the Brix levels for its United States and home market sales; (2) Commerce\u2019s calculation of Fischer\u2019s average inventory carrying costs; and (3) Commerce\u2019s application of the \u201c90/60 day rule\u201d under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(e)(2). On April 6, 2010, the court issued a decision affirming Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept Fischer\u2019s additional materials regarding its home market sales, but remanding for Commerce to consider the rejected material regarding Fischer\u2019s United States sales; affirming Commerce\u2019s calculation of Fischer\u2019s inventory carrying costs; and affirming Commerce\u2019s application of the 90/60 day rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">On remand, Commerce determined that the additional material regarding Fischer\u2019s United States sales did not change the antidumping duty calculation, and in a November 23, 2010, decision, the Court of International Trade affirmed. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">We are asked on appeal to review the issues that the Court of International <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Trade affirmed in its April 6, 2010, decision: (1) Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept Fischer\u2019s additional materials regarding its home market sales; (2) Commerce\u2019s calculation of Fischer\u2019s inventory carrying costs; and (3) Commerce\u2019s application of the 90/60 day rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">We review decisions of the Court of International Trade without deference, applying the same standard of review applied by the court in its review of the administrative record. <em>Dongbu Steel Co. v. United States, </em>635 F.3d 1363, 1369 (Fed.Cir. 2011). In doing so, we uphold Commerce\u2019s determination unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">I. Home Market Brix Levels</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Fischer contends that Commerce abused its discretion when it refused to consider Fischer\u2019s additional materials regarding the actual Brix levels of its home market sales. According to Fischer, \u201conce Commerce chose to use, and the [Court of International Trade] upheld Commerce\u2019s use of, actual Brix values as its conversion variable, Commerce was required to use the correct Brix levels of the juice delivered to the customer.\u201d Corrected Reply of Plaintiffs-Appellants (\u201cReply Brief\u2019) at 6. Fischer contends it \u201cprovided the correct actual Brix levels of its home market ... sales in its timely filed case brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. According to Fischer, Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept the corrected home market Brix data distorted the final anti-dumping duty calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">The Court of International Trade did not find credible Fischer\u2019s argument that its original home market Brix data contained errors. Specifically, the court noted that Fischer\u2019s original data showed varying Brix levels for its home market sales, which the court determined belied Fischer\u2019s argument that it had misreported that those sales were based on minimum, rather than actual Brix levels. <em>Fischer S.A. Comercio, Industria &amp; Agricultura v. United States, </em>700 F.Supp.2d 1364, 1378 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 2010). Thus, the court concluded that Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept Fischer\u2019s corrected home market Brix data \u201cwas supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The relevant question, however, is not whether Fischer originally reported different Brix levels for its home market sales, but whether the values Fischer reported were actual Brix levels for those sales. Fischer\u2019s rejected data suggests that at least some of the originally-reported home market Brix levels were not actual Brix levels. <em>Compare </em>Joint Appendix (\u201cJA\u201d) 75-76 (original data reporting certain Brix levels for sale numbers [366] and [432]) <em>with </em>JA 122-123 (sales receipts from Fischer\u2019s rejected materials reporting different Brix levels for those sales). Thus, the court\u2019s conclusion that Fischer could not have originally reported incorrect Brix levels for its home market sales is without adequate support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">On appeal, the Government urges that in light of the varying Brix levels Fischer originally reported, \u201cit was entirely reasonable for Commerce (and the trial court) to conclude that Fischer reported actual brix.\u201d Corrected Brief for Defendant-Appellee United States (\u201cGovernment Brief\u2019) at 19; <em>see also id. </em>at 28 n. 10 (referring to JA 75-76, 148-149, and 159-162 as evidencing \u201cbrix levels that varied from sale to sale.\u201d). But the evidence merely demonstrates that Fischer either reported \u201c[t]he standard ... brix value for Brazil sales\u201d JA 85, or a \u201cminimum\u201d Brix level, <em>see, e.g., </em>JA 149, 11.400 and 460. Thus, Commerce\u2019s conclusion that Fischer had originally reported actual Brix levels for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>its home market sales is not reasonable based on the evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The Government also contends that Fischer is precluded from arguing on appeal that its originally-f\u00edled data did not contain actual Brix levels because Fischer failed to raise that argument at the administrative level. Government Brief at 26 and 28. As we have explained, however, the antidumping laws are remedial, not punitive, and the affected domestic industry is not entitled to a remedy that exceeds the difference between the foreign market value and the domestic price. <em>NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, </em>74 F.3d 1204, 1208 (Fed.Cir.1995). Accordingly, Commerce is obliged to correct any errors in its calculations during the preliminary results stage to avoid an imposition of unjustified duties. <em>Timken U.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>434 F.3d 1345, 1353-1354 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">As discussed above, there was sufficient evidence on the record in this case to suggest that Fischer had not reported actual Brix levels for at least some of its home market sales. Because Commerce\u2019s use of Fischer\u2019s original home market Brix levels may have resulted in an imposition of unjustified duties, the decision to reject Fischer\u2019s corrected data was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">We therefore vacate the Court of International Trade\u2019s decision affirming Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept Fischer\u2019s offer of corrected home market Brix data. On remand, the court shall instruct Commerce to accept for the record Fischer\u2019s evidence of actual Brix levels for its home market sales and, in light of that evidence, determine whether the anti-dumping duty must be recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">II. Inventory Carrying Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Fischer contends that because it reported an average inventory carrying period for worldwide sales rather than home market-specific sales, Commerce\u2019s home market inventory carrying costs calculation was flawed. According to the Government, however, the issue of Fischer\u2019s inventory carrying costs is moot because that calculation did not have any impact on the antidumping duty order. Government Brief at p. 29, n. 11. We agree. Accordingly, we decline to disturb the Court of International Trade\u2019s decision that \u201cCommerce\u2019s calculation of inventory carrying cost ... was supported by substantial evidence in the record and in accordance with law----\u201d <em>Fischer, </em>700 F.Supp.2d at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">III. 90/60 Day Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Fischer contends that Commerce ran afoul of 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.213(e)(l)(ii) by applying the 90/60 window of 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(e)(2) for the purpose of finding a foreign like product sale to match with Fischer\u2019s United States sales. According to Fischer, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.213(e)(l)(ii) does not permit Commerce to rely on a home market sale that occurred two days before the date of suspension of liquidation because that sale was outside the period of review. The Government argues that the period of review provisions of 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.213(e)(l)(ii) only relate to United States sales and, therefore, Commerce was permitted to apply the 90/60 day window of 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(e)(2) to Fischer\u2019s home market sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">The Court of International Trade agreed with Commerce and determined that the agency had \u201cacted within its lawful authority and in accordance with law in its application of the 90/60 day contemporaneity rule.\u201d <em>Fischer, </em>700 F.Supp.2d at 1381. We see no reason to disturb that finding. <em>See Hyatt v. Dudas, </em>551 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\u201cAn agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to substantial deference, and the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>court should give effect to the agency\u2019s interpretation so long as it is reasonable.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); see <em>also Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945) (\u201cthe administrative interpretation ... becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">IV. Zeroing</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Fischer argues in two footnotes that there \u201cwould have [been] no dumping margins ... if [Commerce] had not applied its arbitrary zeroing methodology,\u201d Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellants at p. 9, n. 1 (citing Dongbu); Reply Brief at p. 2, n. 1 (citing <em>Dongbu </em>and <em>JTEKT Corp. v. United States, </em>642 F.3d 1378 (Fed.Cir.2011)), and asks the court to remand in accordance with <em>Dongbu </em>and <em>JTEKT </em>for Commerce to explain why it is using zeroing in certain proceedings (i.e., administrative reviews) but not others (i.e., investigations), Oral Argument at 3:01-3:07 (available at http:// www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argumentrecordings/2011-1152/all).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The Government responds that because this issue was not fully briefed, it is not properly before the court. Oral Argument at 18:00-18:12. Be that as it may, since we are remanding this case for consideration of Fischer\u2019s actual home market Brix data, we also expect Commerce to address on remand \u201cwhy it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute to zero in administrative reviews, but not in investigations.\u201d <em>JTEKT, </em>642 F.3d at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">We vacate the judgment of the Court of International Trade affirming Commerce\u2019s refusal to accept Fischer\u2019s evidence of actual Brix levels for its home market sales, and remand with instructions for Commerce to consider that evidence and if necessary recalculate the antidumping duty accordingly. On remand, Commerce should also provide its reasoning for its continued practice of zeroing in certain proceedings but not others. In all other respects, we affirm the court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Circuit Judge BRYSON dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\">. The Brix level is a measure of the amount of soluble solids, or sugar, in a solution. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.1553.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b926-12\">Bryson, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AiH-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">I respectfully dissent. I would uphold the decision of the Court of International Trade as to the issue of the use of brix levels in making home-market sales calculations, and I would therefore affirm the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Fischer argues that Commerce improperly refused to consider corrected information as to the actual brix levels used for home-market sales. The problem is that Fischer did not proffer the corrected information in a sufficiently clear manner to put Commerce on notice that it needed to correct an error in its calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">In the document on which this issue turns \u2014 Fischer\u2019s May 8, 2008, case brief\u2014 Fischer complained about Commerce\u2019s methodology, but it made a different argument from the one it makes now. In its case brief, Fischer argued that Commerce should have used \u201cstandard brix\u201d levels when calculating prices for purposes of determining the dumping margin, not the actual brix levels at which the product is sold. Using the actual brix levels, Fischer argued, would result in a price distortion with respect to sales that Fischer made to its U.S. customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">Fischer then stated that the \u201csame factor applies to the NFC [not from concentrate] sales in Brazil.\u201d Fischer noted that the \u201cstandard NFC brix value for Brazil sales is 11.5,\u201d and added that a \u201cminimum level is normally provided in the specifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>tion sheet at the level indicated.\u201d At that point, the ease brief cited an exhibit (Exhibit 3) that referred to a minimum brix level, but the brief provided no further explanation of the significance of that number. Fischer closed that section of its case brief by stating that if the Department chose \u201cto convert the gallons and kilograms [of juice] to pounds/solids, the use of standard brix to convert allows a price neutral conversion from gallons eliminating the price distortion that resulted from the application of actual brix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">What Fischer did <em>not </em>say in its case brief was that it had misreported the actual brix levels of products sold to its U.S. customer and that it had reported the minimum brix levels instead. Perhaps Commerce could have divined as much from the materials Fischer provided for it. But to do so would have required Commerce to extrapolate from the reference to the minimum brix level in a single product specification found in Exhibit 3 and to look to other exhibits that were submitted in connection with other, unrelated issues raised in Fischer\u2019s ease brief. At a minimum, Fischer did not clearly present to Commerce the fact that it had erroneously reported minimum brix levels rather than actual brix levels. In fact, Fischer did not raise the issue of its misreporting until its Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record before the Court of International Trade. The trial court made that point, noting that \u201cFischer appears not to have reported the incorrect sales Brix level\u201d to Commerce, and for that reason the court found \u201cno reason to question Commerce\u2019s reliance on the information Fischer supplied during the investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Fischer relies on <em>NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, </em>74 F.3d 1204 (Fed.Cir. 1995), and <em>Timken U.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>434 F.3d 1345 (Fed.Cir.2006), for the proposition that Commerce must accept corrections to errors identified by the respondent in Commerce\u2019s preliminary determinations. Those cases, however, involved errors that were called to Commerce\u2019s attention during the administrative process. In this case, Fischer failed to draw Commerce\u2019s attention to the perceived error until well after the administrative proceedings had become final. As we have explained, \u201cCommerce is not required to correct a final determination reflecting an error made by a private party when that error is not apparent from Commerce\u2019s final calculations ... or from the final determination itself.\u201d <em>Alloy Piping Prods., Inc. v. Kanzen Tetsu Sdn. Bhd., </em>334 F.3d 1284, 1292 (Fed.Cir. 2003) (noting that <em>NTN Bearing </em>recognizes \u201ca strong interest in the finality of Commerce\u2019s decisions [and] does not require correction of errors after a final determination\u201d). Here, Fischer raised the issue of its erroneous reporting of brix levels too late for Commerce to address the matter in its final determination. <em>See Timken, </em>434 F.3d at 1353 (\u201cCommerce is free to correct any type of importer error ... in the context of making an anti-dumping duty determination, provided that the importer seeks correction <em>before </em>Commerce issues its final results and adequately proves the need for the requested corrections.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Because Commerce was not put on adequate notice at any point during the administrative proceedings that Fischer was contending that it had erroneously reported minimum brix levels as actual brix levels, it was not error for the Court of International Trade not to require Commerce to recalculate the antidumping margin based on what Fischer belatedly identified as an error on its part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
