His appointed appellate counsel concluded that the appeal is frivolous and without merit, and moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The defendant-appellant has not accepted our invitation to respond to the motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), we thus confine our review to the potential issues in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief, <em>see United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-26\">In 2000 the appellant pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess more than 50 grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, in exchange for the government\u2019s dismissal of five other pending drug counts. The plea agreement, which was governed by Fed. R.CrimP. 11(e)(1)(C),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> proposed a sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court accepted the agreement and recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tion, and sentenced McNeal to 168 months \u2014 the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission retroactively reduced the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C 226-31 (2008) (\u201cAmendment 706\u201d), and the defendant moved for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). That statute permits a district court to reduce a sentence that is \u201cbased on\u201d a guidelines sentencing range that has since been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court denied the motion on the ground that McNeal\u2019s sentence was based not on the guidelines, but on the stipulated term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Appellate counsel considers one issue: whether McNeal could argue that his sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the guidelines because it falls within the range calculated by the district court. If the term were \u201cbased on\u201d the crack guideline, then the court would have had authority to reduce MeNeal\u2019s sentence. But, as defense counsel observes, that argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ray, </em>598 F.3d 407 (7th Cir.2010). In <em>Ray </em>we recently held that a sentence based on a stipulated term of months under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) is not based on the guidelines, and is therefore not subject to reduction under a guideline amendment. <em>Ray, </em>598 F.3d at 411; <em>see United States v. Franklin, </em>600 F.3d 893, 896-97 (7th Cir.2010). The defendant\u2019s plea agreement does not \u201creflect an intent that the sentence be modified when the Guidelines shift.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>598 F.3d at 411. We agree with counsel that to argue McNeal\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a guidelines range for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) would be frivolous and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-18\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C) has since been renumbered and is now Rule 11(c)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
