In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Yearwood asserted that the motion was timely filed because it was filed within one year of the Supreme Court\u2019s issuance of <em>Yeager v. United States, </em>557 U.S. 110, 129 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>2360, 174 L.Ed.2d 78 (2009), and that he was otherwise entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. The district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief, and granted a certificate of appealability on the <em>Yeager </em>issue. Following our grant of panel rehearing, we have reviewed the record and find that the district court correctly determined that Yearwood\u2019s post-conviction limitations period did not begin to run on the date <em>Yeager </em>issued. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s order, in part. <em>See Year-wood, v. United States, </em>Nos. 1:05-cr00105-RDB-1; 1:09-cv-02809-RDB, 2011 WL 826297 (D.Md. Mar. 7, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The remainder of the district court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 2255 relief is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Yearwood has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Year-wood\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, affirm the district court\u2019s order, in part, and deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal, in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
