After affording liberal opportunity to amend, the district court concluded that Muthukumar\u2019s claims were time-barred, unexhausted, failed to specifically allege discriminatory practices, or were barred by sovereign immunity. We add only a few summary comments to the district court\u2019s careful decision and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">As Muthukumar appeals a motion to dismiss, we accept his factual allegations as true. <em>Morgan v. Swanson, </em>659 F.3d 359, 370 (5th Cir.2011) (en banc). Muthukumar was a graduate student and teaching assistant in UTD\u2019s International Business program. He took a mandatory comprehensive exam approximately thirty months into the program. After UTD informed Muthukumar that he failed the exam, Muthukumar insisted on seeing his grades on the exam, which several professors withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">In response, Muthukumar initiated an internal grievance proceeding within the university. UTD eventually revealed Muthukumar\u2019s results on the exam, but he was required to transfer out of the program (and into the School of Economic, Political, and Policy Sciences) because of his failure. Muthukumar alleges his professors responded in the months that followed by cutting his funding as a teaching assistant, denying him a new teaching as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>sistant position, denying him professional recommendations, and, ultimately, by threatening him with expulsion in November 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Muthukumar filed an Intake Questionnaire with the EEOC on August 24, 2009, alleging UTD discriminated against him in his capacity as an employee. He listed himself as a \u201cstudent/TA-Instructor\u201d as his job title, both at the point he was hired and when he claimed he was discriminated against. He further recounted on the intake form that from January 2005 to the then-present date the faculty \u201crefused to speak with\u201d him and \u201crefused to reveal\u201d his grades. He also listed that, starting in January 2006, his professors \u201ctook away [his] paper and abused [their] authority to harm [his] career.\u201d He noted on the intake form that he wished to file a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Muthukumar brought official employment discrimination charges under Titles VI and VII on November 4, 2009. He listed the earliest date of alleged discrimination as June 1, 2007, lasting through the threatened expulsion on November 10, 2008. As he recounted on his charge, UTD initially informed him of his failure in June 2007, he filed a grievance in September 2007, his salary was reinstated (and thus impliedly cut before) February 2008, and UTD threatened to expel him in November 2008. The EEOC closed his file as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">When Muthukumar filed his federal suit in January 2010, the district court consolidated it with a similar case removed from state court. He sought and obtained leave to amend his complaint thereafter. UTD moved to dismiss all of Muthukumar\u2019s claims in December 2010; the district court granted UTD\u2019s motion, but gave Muthukumar \u201cone final opportunity to state valid claims upon which relief can be granted.\u201d The court directed Muthukumar to avoid incorporating prior complaints by reference and explained in its order granting UTD\u2019s motion why each of Muthukumar\u2019s claims were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Muthukumar filed a Second Amended Complaint in January 2011, largely restating his dismissed complaint, but adding constitutional claims as well. UTD re-urged its motion to dismiss each of Muthukumar\u2019s claims. The district court granted the motion, concluding that: (1) Muthukumar\u2019s Intake Questionnaire constituted an employment discrimination charge, tolling the 300 day requirement under Title VII, but that Muthukumar failed to exhaust his sole timely allegation; (2) Muthukumar failed to allege facts demonstrating discriminatory intent behind specific acts for his Title VI claim; and (3) sovereign immunity barred Muthukumar\u2019s state-law tort, contract, and constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">We review motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. City of Clinton, Ark. v. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>632 F.3d 148, 152 (5th Cir.2010). We review sovereign immunity objections to jurisdiction <em>de novo </em>under Rule 12(b)(1). <em>Lane v. Halliburton, </em>529 F.3d 548, 557 (5th Cir. 2008). Muthukumar raises a variety of meritless challenges against each of the district court\u2019s rulings \u2014 thirteen solely against its conclusion that allegedly discriminatory acts before October 28, 2008 are time-barred. We discuss only those raising some legal argument, and group these together by claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The timbre of Muthukumar\u2019s sole legal argument against the applicability of the Title VII time-bar is that UTD\u2019s actions constituted a \u201cseries of violations]\u201d (or continuing violation) for which prior, time-barred conduct may be considered under <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 113-14, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2072-73, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). This misunderstands <em>Morgan. Morgan </em>expressly enforced the 300-day time-bar for Title VII discrimination claims against \u201c[d]iserete acts such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire\u201d because they are \u201ceasy to identify\u201d and each \u201cconstitutes a separate actionable \u2018unlawful employment practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 122 S.Ct. at 2073. Muthukumar\u2019s alleged harms fall in this category. Each discrete action accrued, and thus commenced his obligation to file no later than 300 days following the date it occurred. Only one, his threatened removal from the university as a student, is arguably within the 300-day statutory period if we construe the Intake Questionnaire, solely for the sake of this argument, as his charge before the EEOC, thus marking the 300-day window. Nevertheless, this allegation fails to establish a Title VII claim, and in any event was not made before the EEOC in the Intake Questionnaire. The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Muthukumar\u2019s Title VI claim fares no better. The district court correctly noted that Muthukumar expressed a generalized accusation of discrimination based on national origin and that he enumerated eight harms which he suspected derived from his national origin, but he failed to articulate anywhere in his Title VI claim a statement that, if true, could prove discriminatory intent. Stating that he was forbidden from retaking an exam \u201cagainst the university\u2019s policy and for discriminatory reasons\u201d is not enough, <em>see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), nor is his claim that a professor \u201charmed my promising career\u201d \u201cin violation of Title VI.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, a conclusional statement that \u201cthe [university\u2019s] threats ... [are] for retaliatory reasons [rather than] genuine disciplinary reasons\u201d will not suffice. <em>Id. </em>These are factually barren and facially insufficient to state a claim of discrimination based on national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Finally, Muthukumar asserts that UTD, the sole defendant, is not entitled to sovereign immunity. Muthukumar is mistaken. UTD is a state institution entitled to sovereign immunity under state law. <em>Cnty. of Cameron v. Brown, </em>80 S.W.3d 549, 554 (Tex.2002). Sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional bar. <em>United States v. Tex. Tech Univ., </em>171 F.3d 279, 285 (5th Cir.1999). As the party invoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction, Muthukumar bore the obligation of demonstrating a plausible basis for the court to adjudicate his <em>claims </em>\u2014 ie. a waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>In re Eckstein Marine Serv., L.L.C., </em>672 F.3d 310, 314 (5th Cir.2012). He has articulated no plausible basis for a waiver of immunity as to his claims, and this court may not proceed without one. Additionally, Muthukumar\u2019s constitutional claims are barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity. The district court correctly dismissed Muthukumar\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
