For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact, including findings on credibility, are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). Legal issues are reviewed de novo, \u201caffording appropriate deference to the [Board]\u2019s interpretation of the [Immigration and Nationality Act] and any attendant regulations.\u201d <em>Li Fang Lin v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 685, 691-92 (4th Cir.2008). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he agency decision that an alien is not eligible for asylum is \u2018conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marynenka v. Holder, </em>592 F.3d 594, 600 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding. We further conclude that Bekelcha failed to present sufficient independent evidence of his family\u2019s persecution, notwithstanding the adverse credibility determination, as discussed in <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004). We therefore uphold the denial of Bekelcha\u2019s requests for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 367 (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ahc\"> Bekelcha has failed to raise any challenges to the denial of his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. He has therefore waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
