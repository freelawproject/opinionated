He argues on appeal that the district court imposed improper conditions of supervised release. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-26\">The eight contested conditions of supervised release include psycho-sexual evaluations, psychological testing, possible sex-offender treatment, restrictions on future employment, and other restrictions on Frashure\u2019s contact with minor children. Because \u201cdistrict courts have broad latitude to impose conditions on supervised release,\u201d this court reviews such conditions only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Armel, </em>585 F.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir.2009). The district court may impose any condition that is reasonably related to the relevant statutory sentencing factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to provide adequate deterrence, the need to protect the public, and the need to provide the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>dant with training, medical care, or treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a); <em>Armel, </em>585 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">After a complete review of the record in this case and meaningful consideration of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>2012 WL 698890 (4th Cir. Mar.6, 2012) (unpublished), we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the challenged conditions of supervised release. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
