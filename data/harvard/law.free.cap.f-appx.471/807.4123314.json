We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo questions of law. <em>Sembiring v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 985 (9th Cir.2007). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">The agency did not abuse its discretion or commit legal error in denying Liu\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that his mistake concerning his hearing date did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l); <em>Valencio-Fragoso v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 1204, 1205-06 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (finding no exceptional circumstances where petitioner misunderstood the time of her hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b838-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
