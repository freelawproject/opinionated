He does not contest the holdings of the BIA that his motion is numerically barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) and, alternatively, that it is time barred pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); rather he argues that the BIA should have afforded him equitable tolling based upon the ineffective assistance that he received from prior attorneys or that it otherwise should have exercised its discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen proceedings on these grounds. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008). We need not address the remainder of Nasir\u2019s arguments pertaining to the merits of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">Nasir\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
