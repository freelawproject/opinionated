We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). Legal issues are reviewed de novo, \u201caffording appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA and any attendant regulations[.]\u201d <em>Li Fang Lin v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 685, 691-92 (4th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacanas, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002). Because the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order and supplemented it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>both decisions are subject to judicial review. <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 511 n. 8 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Aliens who have engaged in terrorist activities or are members of a terrorist organization may be statutorily precluded from seeking several forms of relief from removal, including asylum, withholding from removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) protection in the form of withholding, but remain eligible for deferral of removal under the CAT. <em>See Haile v. Holder, </em>658 F.3d 1122, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing statutory and regulatory regimen).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that the Oromo Liberation Front (\u201cOLF\u201d) was a terrorist organization before, during and after Bekele provided material support. The record does not compel a finding that Bekele showed by a preponderance of the evidence that the OLF ceased its terrorist activities for the brief period it was aligned with the transitional government and while Bekele was a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Bekele was not eligible for asylum, withholding from removal and withholding under the CAT was supported by the record and was not legal error. Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
