He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and his designation as an armed career criminal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-24\">Robinson claims that the affidavit supporting the search warrant application was so \u201cbare bones\u201d that neither probable cause nor a good-faith exception existed to justify the search. We review the validity of a search warrant under the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the issuing judge had a substantial basis for finding probable cause to issue the warrant. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2005). In doing so, we afford great deference to the factual assessments of the issuing judge. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>631 F.3d 164, 173 (4th Cir.2011). When a warrant is based in part on hearsay, the relevant inquiries are the veracity and basis of knowledge of the person supplying the information. <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>354 F.3d 305, 309 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cThe degree to which an informant\u2019s story is corroborated may also be an important factor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We find no error in the probable cause determination here. The warrant application cited the prior reliability of the confidential informant and the informant\u2019s firsthand knowledge of drug distribution from the target property. The informant met with law enforcement officers on multiple occasions, provided information that was confirmed by law enforcement officers, and carried out a drug purchase with law enforcement funds. The affidavit set forth sufficient information to support the finding of probable cause. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Robinson\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Robinson next challenges his sentence, claiming that the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) is unconstitutional and that he was improperly sentenced as an armed career criminal. Robinson\u2019s constitutional argument is foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Presley, 52 </em>F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir.1995). His arguments that his North Carolina conspiracy to assault inflicting serious injury and common law robbery convictions are not predicate \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA are similarly unavailing. An offense need not contain an \u201covert act\u201d element to constitute an ACCA predicate. <em>See, e.g., United States v. White, </em>571 F.3d 365, 370-71 (4th Cir.2009). Thus, Robinson\u2019s argument regarding his conspiracy conviction fails. Likewise, North Carolina common law robbery involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another and therefore is properly considered an ACCA predicate. We find no error in Robinson\u2019s designation as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
