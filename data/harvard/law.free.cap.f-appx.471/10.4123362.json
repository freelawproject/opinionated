KEARSE, WALKER, GERARD E. LYNCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b41-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">Serena Kawache (\u201cMs. Kawache\u201d) and Adam Kawache (\u201cMr. Kawache\u201d) commenced this action in the name of their minor child Miriam Kawache (\u201cMiriam\u201d or \u201cappellant\u201d) pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346 and 2671 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFTCA\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Kiyo A. Matsumoto, /.). Appellant sought damages from the United States for the alleged medical malpractice of its deemed employee, Ahmad M. Jaber, M.D. Specifically, appellant claims that Dr. Jaber deviated from the applicable standard of care when confronted at Miriam\u2019s delivery with Miriam\u2019s condition of shoulder dystocia, a delivery difficulty wherein the infant\u2019s shoulders become trapped between the mother\u2019s pubic and tail bones. The parties agree that the appropriate obstetric response to shoulder dystocia is for the physician to dislodge the shoulders by using a technique known as the McRoberts maneuver and by applying supra-pubic pressure, but that the application of excessive lateral traction to the infant\u2019s head prior to the use of the McRoberts maneuver and application of supra-pubic pressure is not standard and can cause serious injury. Appellant contended at trial that Dr. Jaber did not apply the appropriate maneuvers and instead used excess lateral traction, thus causing Miriam\u2019s permanent brachial plexus injury, which will permanently limit the mobility of her right arm and shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">After a bench trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 52(a), the district court made extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that the appellant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>failed to show (1) that Dr. Jaber had failed to use the appropriate medical maneuvers in response to Miriam\u2019s shoulder dystocia, and (2) that Dr. Jaber\u2019s conduct caused Miriam\u2019s injury. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision, and assume familiarity with the remaining underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">On appeal, the appellant challenges not the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, but its factual findings. The parties agree that New York law applies, and that the law governing medical malpractice under the FTCA is well established. <em>See Molzof v. United States, </em>502 U.S. 301, 305, 112 S.Ct. 711, 116 L.Ed.2d 731 (1992) (describing the application of the FTCA to medical malpractice cases); <em>Berger v. Becker, </em>272 A.D.2d 565, 709 N.Y.S.2d 418, 418 (2d Dep\u2019t 2000) (describing the legal burden that medical malpractice plaintiffs bear). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings after a bench trial for clear error, and reverse only when, after reviewing the evidence in its entirety, we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). As we have previously noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">In reviewing findings for clear error, we are not allowed to second-guess either the trial court\u2019s credibility assessments or its choice between permissible competing inferences. Even if the appellate court might have weighed the evidence differently, it may not overturn findings that are not clearly erroneous. The weight of the evidence is not a ground for reversal on appeal, and the fact that there may have been evidence to support an inference contrary to that drawn by the trial court does not mean that the findings are clearly erroneous. The decisions as to whose testimony to credit and which of permissible inferences to draw are solely within the province of the trier of fact....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\"><em>Ceraso v. Motiva Enterprises, LLC, </em>326 F.3d 303, 316-17 (2d Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Appellant makes three factual arguments: first, that the district court clearly erred in crediting Dr. Jaber\u2019s testimony because the evidence overwhelmingly favors the inference that Dr. Jaber fabricated medical records and provided false testimony during the bench trial; second, that the district court\u2019s failure to fully credit Ms. Kawache\u2019s mother, Rosanne Sinti, was clearly erroneous, as her testimony was especially likely to be accurate and was inconsistent with the conclusion that Dr. Jaber performed the appropriate maneuvers when faced with Miriam\u2019s shoulder dystocia; and third, that the medical literature establishes that permanent brachial plexus injury almost always results from the delivering physician\u2019s failure to comport to the applicable standards of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">None of these arguments survives the standard of review. Dr. Jaber\u2019s contemporaneous notes present creditable evidence that he performed both standard maneuvers in reaction to shoulder dystocia, and contemporaneous nurses\u2019 notes likewise create a plausible inference that other medical staff assisted in performing these maneuvers consistent with Dr. Jaber\u2019s testimony. That Dr. Jaber may have had a motive to falsify medical records or perjure himself does not demonstrate that he did do so. The district court was fully within its discretion to credit Dr. Jaber\u2019s medical records and testimony, especially in light of the fact that the appellant presented no direct evidence to contradict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The argument that Sinti\u2019s testimony should have been given more weight similarly fails. The district court did not discredit Sinti\u2019s testimony, finding instead that it was for the most part consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>with Dr. Jaber\u2019s records and his testimony. Sinti testified that she saw none of the movement associated with the medical maneuvers that the parties agree should be performed when an infant presents shoulder dystocia. But the evidence permitted the district court to conclude that since Ms. Kawache was under a sterile drape, and the maneuvers in question were performed beneath that drape, the precise actions taken in response to shoulder dystocia would not necessarily be observable to a non-expert who stood, as Sinti did, near the delivering mother\u2019s abdomen. Moreover, the district court reasonably found that Sinti\u2019s memory and ability to observe might have been compromised by stresses of the day: In addition to Miriam\u2019s birth, the Kawaches had on the same day a fire in their apartment, where Mr. Kawache and the Kawaches\u2019 older child remained during Miriam\u2019s delivery. The appellant\u2019s unsubstantiated assertion that \u201cit is well known that stress promotes memory formation and recollection,\u201d even if it were true,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would not permit an appellate court to overturn the fact-finder\u2019s credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Finally, the appellant fails to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s thoughtful navigation of conflicting expert testimony was clearly erroneous. Appellant argues that the \u201cmedical literature ... shows with near-certainty that Miriam\u2019s permanent brachial plexus injury could not have occurred other than by the application\u201d of non-standard medical care. Appellant overstates the record evidence. Although appellant\u2019s experts \u2014 Stuart Edelberg, M.D., an obstetrician/gynecologist, and Greg Rosenn, M.D., a pediatric neurologist \u2014 did initially assert this conclusion, both retracted their assertions on cross-examination. Dr. Edelberg admitted that he had, in a similar litigation, allowed that brachial plexus injury can occur during the natural course of childbirth, and further admitted that such may have been true in Miriam\u2019s case. Dr. Rosenn, while forming the same opinion as to the cause of Miriam\u2019s injury, admitted that his medical expertise did not qualify him to reach such a conclusion, as his expertise as a neurologist involves only the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries, not the determination of their cause. He further admitted that it was \u201cdefinitely possible\u201d for a permanent brachial plexus injury to be caused by something other than extreme lateral traction. Given those concessions, it was entirely reasonable for the district court to reject the proffered conclusions of appellant\u2019s experts and to credit the contrary testimony of the defense experts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments, and find them to be without merit. The trial of this matter presented conflicting expert testimony and limited direct testimony as to what occurred in the delivery room. On this rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ord, it was up to the finder of fact to decide whom to believe and what inferences to draw. We thus cannot fault the district court\u2019s conclusion that appellant failed to carry her burden of proof. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">. <em>But see State v. Henderson, </em>208 N.J. 208, 261 (2011) (summarizing social scientific evidence, in the context of eyewitness identification, for the proposition that \"[ejven under the best viewing conditions, high levels of stress can diminish an eyewitness\u2019 ability to recall.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">. Subsequent to the completion of briefing, appellant submitted as supplemental authority the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>Muhammad v. Fitzpatrick, </em>91 A.D.3d 1353, 937 N.Y.S.2d 519 (4th Dep't 2012), arguing that <em>Muhammad </em>should guide our decision in this case. The argument is unavailing. <em>Muhammad </em>holds only that the state trial court did not err in excluding, on the record before it, expert testimony attributing a brachial plexus injury to the normal birthing process. State evidentiary decisions are not binding on this Court. In any event, appellant does not argue that the defense experts' testimony was inadmissible, but rather challenges the district court\u2019s decision to credit that evidence, which, as noted above, is reviewed for clear error. Thus, <em>Muhammad </em>does not bear on the issues presented by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
