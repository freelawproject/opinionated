We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-28\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Singh\u2019s second motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>reopen as numerically-barred and untimely where the motion was filed over six years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Singh failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in India to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time and number limitation for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996-97 (9th Cir.2008) (underlying adverse credibility determination rendered evidence of changed circumstances immaterial). Because Singh\u2019s motion to reopen to seek relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) is based on the same facts as his other claims, we reject Singh\u2019s contention the BIA erred by failing to separately address his CAT claim. Lastly, Singh\u2019s contentions that the BIA applied a higher standard to his motion are belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
