We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Braggs contends that the district court erroneously concluded Braggs was not entitled to equitable tolling. The district court properly rejected Braggs\u2019s equitable tolling arguments because Braggs failed to show that his mental impairment was an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d beyond his control that made it impossible to file a timely federal habeas petition. <em>See Bills v. Clark, </em>628 F.3d 1092, 1099-1100 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Braggs also contends that the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Braggs\u2019s request because Braggs\u2019s allegations that he had a severe mental impairment during the filing period were not supported by the record. <em>See West v. Ryan, </em>608 F.3d 477, 484-85 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">We construe Braggs\u2019s additional arguments as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. So construed, the motion is denied. See 9th Cir. R. 22-1(e); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b723-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
