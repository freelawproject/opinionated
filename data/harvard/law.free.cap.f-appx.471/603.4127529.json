We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Stoot v. City of Everett, </em>582 F.3d 910, 918 (9th Cir.2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Deligiannis\u2019s Fourth Amendment and procedural due process claims on the basis of qualified immunity because, at the time of the incident, it was not clearly established whether Deligiannis was entitled to a warrant or a pre-seizure hearing before defendants seized his vehicle under California statute for failure to pay multiple parking tickets. <em>See Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 243-44, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009); <em>cf. Clement v. City of Glendale, </em>518 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir.2008) (officers entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established at the time of the incident whether pre-towing notice must be given before a car with a valid planned non-operation certificate may be removed from a parking lot matching the owner\u2019s address); <em>Scofield v. Hillsborough, </em>862 F.2d 759, 762-64 (9th Cir.1988) (upholding towing of unregistered vehicle and stating that owner was not entitled to hearing or notice before vehicle could be towed under California statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Deligiannis\u2019s substantive due process claim because Deligiannis failed to establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants\u2019 actions were \u201cclearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.\u201d <em>Hoeck v. City of Portland, </em>57 F.3d 781, 786 (9th Cir.1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Deligiannis\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim because Deligiannis failed to establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether chilling of his political speech was \u201ca substantial or motivating factor\u201d in defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>Mendocino Envtl.
