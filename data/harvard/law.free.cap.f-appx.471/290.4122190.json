The Respondent has filed a motion to dismiss this petition on the ground that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">There is no dispute that Mehmedi-Ajvazoska\u2019s motion to reopen, which was his second motion to reopen, was not filed \u25a0within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.23(b)(4)(ii). In that motion to reopen, Mehmedi-Ajvazoska sought equitable tolling based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. \u201c[A] request for equitable tolling of a time- or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision whether to exercise its discretion to reopen a proceeding sua sponte. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
