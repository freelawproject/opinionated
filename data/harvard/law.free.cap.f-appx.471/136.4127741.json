Based on his previous North Carolina convictions, the district court designated Carter a career offender under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2005). The court imposed within-Guidelines concurrent sentences of 262 and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. Carter appealed and we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>250 Fed.Appx. 543 (4th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-25\">Although our mandate originally issued in 2007, we recently recalled the mandate with the consent of both parties. Carter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>now petitions for panel and en banc rehearing based primarily on our decision in <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>649 F.3d 237 (4th Cir.2011) (en banc). Carter contends that, under <em>Simmons, </em>he has no prior felony convictions. Thus, Carter asserts that his conviction for felon in possession of a firearm should be vacated. Moreover, Carter contends that he is not a career offender for purposes of calculating his Guidelines range for the cocaine distribution offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Under North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme, sentences are calculated based on offenders\u2019 criminal history and whether they fall within the mitigated, presumptive, or aggravated sentencing range. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c)-(d) (2009). To determine whether a North Carolina offense is a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d we focus on the maximum sentence for which the particular defendant was eligible in light of his criminal history, rather than the maximum sentence that could be imposed on a defendant with the worst possible criminal record. <em>Simmons, </em>649 F.3d at 243. <em>Simmons </em>overruled our prior decision in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242 (4th Cir.2005), in which we determined the term for which an offense was punishable by looking at the maximum aggravated sentence that could be imposed upon a defendant with the worst possible criminal history. <em>Simmons, </em>649 F.3d at 241. <em>Harp </em>was in effect at the time of the district court\u2019s 2006 judgment and our 2007 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Carter first raised the argument that his North Carolina convictions were not felonies in his petition for rehearing. Although we generally do not consider issues raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing, we find that the intervening change in the law wrought by <em>Simmons </em>warrants our consideration of that issue on rehearing. <em>See United States v. Pierce, </em>409 F.3d 228, 235 (4th Cir.2005) (remanding for resentencing in light of <em>Booker </em>where <em>Booker </em>issue was raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing); <em>see also United States v. Byers, </em>740 F.2d 1104, 1115 n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1984) (en banc). We therefore turn to an application of <em>Simmons.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Although the state court records are not part of the record before us, the indictment, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2006) notice, and presentence investigation report set forth three prior North Carolina cocaine-related convictions as Carter\u2019s prior \u201cfelonies.\u201d However, based on the sentences actually imposed, under the North Carolina sentencing table it appears that Carter could not have received a sentence of greater than twelve months for any of his prior convictions. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c)-(d). Thus, under <em>Simmons, </em>none of these three convictions were offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year for the purpose of the federal felon-in-possession statute. Similarly, the convictions could not support Carter\u2019s designation as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Accordingly, we reverse Carter\u2019s felon in possession of a firearm conviction. For the reasons set forth in our October 12, 2007 opinion, we affirm Carter\u2019s cocaine distribution conviction, but grant panel rehearing and vacate his sentence for that offense and remand to the district court for resentencing. Because no member of the court has requested a poll, Carter\u2019s request for en banc rehearing is denied. We deny as moot Carter\u2019s motions to vacate and for a briefing order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
