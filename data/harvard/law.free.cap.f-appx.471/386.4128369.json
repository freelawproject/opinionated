After Jackson served her sentence of imprisonment, the district court revoked her supervised release, and it sentenced her to 60 months of imprisonment. Jackson filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district court denied the motion. Jackson now seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Jackson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-23\">Jackson maintains that her original sentence was imposed under a crack to powder ratio of 100 to 1 and that it would be unfair for her not to receive the benefit of the new law lowering the ratio just because she is serving a sentence for the revocation of her supervised release. She argues that the district court did not calculate her guidelines sentence range correctly under the new law and that the district court had the discretion to modify her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-24\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The applicable policy statement prohibits a district court from reducing a term of imprisonment below the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(C), p.s. The commentary states that a defendant may not obtain \u201ca reduction in [any] term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.4(A)). Although the Guidelines are advisory in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>621 (2005), <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 8582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). As Jackson has served her original custodial sentence, the district court had no authority to reduce that sentence or the sentence she received upon revocation of her supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Jackson has failed to raise any nonfrivolous issues for appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
