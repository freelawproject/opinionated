Wade cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and provisions of the Texas Business and Commerce Code/Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). The district court granted summary judgment, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that all Wade\u2019s claims against the Bank of America defendants were barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel; that Wade\u2019s claims that he did not receive service of a summary judgment motion in the state proceeding were without merit because Wade was on notice of the motion and had ample time to respond to it; that because the Bank of America defendants were not state actors, Wade had no claims against them under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985; and that Wade failed to make out a prima facie case of conspiracy as to all the defendants. Wade now appeals. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">When determining the preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent federal action, federal courts apply the preclusion law of the state that rendered the judgment. <em>Black v. N. Panola Sch. Disk, </em>461 F.3d 584, 588 (5th Cir.2006). We review the preclusive effect of a prior judgment and a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Id. </em>We apply the familiar summary judgment standard. Fed. R. Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">All Wade\u2019s claims with respect to the recovery of the Hummer and any purported overpayments are barred by res judicata. <em>See Weaver v. Tex. Capital Bank, N.A., </em>660 F.3d 900, 907 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2103, - L.Ed.2d - (2012); <em>Barr v. Resolution Trust Corp. ex rel. Sunbelt Fed. Savs., </em>837 S. W.2d 627, 630-31 (Tex.1992). The parties are the same or in privity, there was a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the two suits arise out of the same transaction, <em>i.e., </em>the legal relationship between Wade and Bank of America. <em>See Weaver, </em>660 F.3d at 907; <em>Barr, </em>837 S.W.2d at 630-31. In addition, because the issues of Bank of America\u2019s entitlement to the Hummer and whether Wade owed money on it were raised in the prior proceeding, were rejected by the court, and were necessary to the judgment, they are also barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>See Getty Oil Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>845 S.W.2d 794, 801 (Tex.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Wade\u2019s assertion that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, an element of res judicata, is without merit. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 24.007(b). We likewise find no merit in Wade\u2019s contention regarding notice of the summary judgment motion in the state action. He raised this issue before the state court prior to the state court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. His claims of lack of service are barred. <em>See Elliot v. West, </em>No. 01-09-00425-CV, 2011 WL 1233434, at *1 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] Mar. 31, 2011, no pet.) (mem.op.).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Wade has abandoned his civil rights conspiracy claims against all parties because he fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to come forward with any evidence in support of his claims and that his conelusional allegations were insufficient. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dali. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). That determination was, in any event, correct. <em>See Lynch v. Cannatella, </em>810 F.2d 1363, 1369-70 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, we need not reach Wade\u2019s argument that these claims are not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
