June 21, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006). An alien seeking to reopen proceedings is required to file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Wong\u2019s motion to reopen, filed in November 2010, was untimely because the BIA issued a final order of removal in December 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\">Weng contends, however, that her recent conversion to Christianity and church attendance in the United States, coupled with the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on underground churches and unregistered religious groups in Fujian Province, constitutes a material change in country conditions, excusing the untimeliness of her motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). We conclude that the BIA\u2019s denial of Wang\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">As the BIA determined, Weng\u2019s religious conversion and church attendance in the United States constitute self-induced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>changes in personal circumstances, which are insufficient to excuse the untimeliness of her motion to reopen. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. </em>BIA, 437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006). Although Weng argues that the BIA abused its discretion by focusing on her conduct in the United States rather than on conditions in China, the time limitation on motions to reopen may not be suspended entirely because of a \u201cself-induced change in personal circumstances\u201d that is \u201centirely of [the applicant\u2019s] own making after being ordered to leave the United States.\u201d <em>Id,:, see also Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Moreover, the BIA\u2019s determination that Weng failed to establish a material change in country conditions in China is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008). In considering conditions in China, the BIA reasonably relied on evidence in the record at the time of Weng\u2019s merits hearing to conclude that \u201cat best, [there are] continuing problems for unregistered Protestant groups in Fujian Province rather than any changed circumstances there.\u201d <em>In re Yanling Weng, </em>No. A097 743 136 (B.I.A. June 21, 2011). For example, as noted by the BIA, the United States Department of State\u2019s June 2004 report <em>China </em>\u2014 Profile <em>of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions </em>reflects that, at the time of Weng\u2019s merits hearing in 2004, repression of underground churches and unregistered religious groups was widespread, particularly in Weng\u2019s home province of Fujian. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Weng\u2019s argument that the BIA \u201ccherry-picked\u201d evidence in support of its country conditions finding while ignoring other evidence demonstrating a material change in country conditions is without merit. <em>See Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 171. Indeed, many of the very same country conditions materials cited by Weng as evidencing a material change in country conditions also reflect continuing problems for underground churches and unregistered religious groups in China. Given that the task of resolving conflicts in the record evidence lies \u201clargely within the discretion of the agency,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the agency is not required to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 169 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the record does not compellingly suggest that the BIA ignored any evidence, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that the agency is presumed to have \u201ctaken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Although Weng argues that the BIA improperly discounted her letter from a fellow Christian in Fujian Province, which described a July 2010 raid on an underground church, the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence lies largely within the discretion of the agency. See <em>id. </em>at 342. In considering Weng\u2019s letter, the BIA reasonably concluded that, without the inclusion of details such as the frequency with which such raids occur, the letter was insufficient to demonstrate a widespread practice or a material change in country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Because the BIA did not reach the issue of Weng\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief, we decline to consider Weng\u2019s arguments concerning the adequacy of her <em>prima facie </em>showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>tion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
