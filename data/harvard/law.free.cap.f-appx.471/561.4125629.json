Knott brought suit against AM-FEC, Inc., which purchased the assets of the company that manufactured the blender, arguing that AMFEC had a post-sale duty to warn of the dangers involved in cleaning the blender in the manner attempted by Knott. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to AMFEC on the ground \u201cthat the danger posed by cleaning the blender with the safety grate open and the blender in operation was obvious\u201d and that under Minnesota law manufacturers do not have a \u201cduty to warn of a foreseeable danger if the danger would be obvious to anyone using the product.\u201d <em>Knott v. AMFEC, Inc., </em>No. 09-CV-1098, 2010 WL 4116602, at *5 (D.Minn. Oct. 18, 2010); <em>see also Gamradt v. Fed. Labs., Inc., </em>380 F.3d 416, 419 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cUnder Minnesota law, a manufacturer has a duty to warn consumers of reasonably foreseeable dangers. This duty is relieved, however, when the danger the product poses is open and obvious.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Knott now appeals, and, after <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see id., </em>we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">. The Honorable Patrick J. Schiltz, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
