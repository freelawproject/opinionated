The district court denied relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the issues whether (1) Ducros was denied effective assistance of trial counsel because his lawyers prevented him from testifying, and (2) the trial court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-21\">As these claims were adjudicated in a state court proceeding, we evaluate them under the \u201cdifficult to meet\u201d and \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\u201d contained in \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See Clark v. Thaler, </em>673 F.3d 410, 416 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011), and <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-26\">Ducros asserts that his lawyers were ineffective because, when they denied him his right to testify, they precluded the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>from hearing mitigating evidence that would have led to a conviction for the lesser offense of manslaughter. The state court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on this claim is measured against the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which requires that Ducros show both deficient performance by counsel and resulting prejudice. <em>See Clark, </em>678 F.3d at 417-18. A failure to establish either prong defeats the claim. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Ducros has the burden of proof. <em>See Clark, </em>673 F.3d at 416. Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard, we must \u201caffirmatively entertain the range of possible reasons counsel may have had for proceeding as they did.\u201d <em>Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1407. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Ducros\u2019s reliance on the documents he submitted in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and his assertion that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing are misplaced. Our review is \u201c \u2018limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rabe v. Thaler, </em>649 F.3d 305, 308-09 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1398). Nothing in the state record supports Ducros\u2019s assertion that he made his desire to testify known to his counsel. Further, the state habeas court could have concluded that counsel reasonably dissuaded Ducros from testifying. <em>See Clark, </em>673 F.3d at 421. As Ducros thus fails to meet his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel, and he is not entitled to federal habeas relief on this claim. <em>See Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Ducros also claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt was unconstitutional. As asserted, Ducros\u2019s challenges do not entitle him to habeas relief. <em>See Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 16, 20, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994); <em>Williams v. Cain, </em>229 F.3d 468, 477 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The district court\u2019s denial of Ducros\u2019s petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
