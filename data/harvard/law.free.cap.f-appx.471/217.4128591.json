On appeal, Brooks raises two sentencing issues: (1) whether the district court erred by sentencing him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2006); and (2) whether the district court erred by finding that he failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility under U.S. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3E1.1 (2010). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness, applying a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Brooks first claims that he should not have been sentenced as an armed career criminal offender, arguing that his three state drug offenses should have been considered one offense. A defendant is an armed career criminal and subject to a fifteen-year mandatory-minimum sentence if he violates \u00a7 922(g) and has at least three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); see USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(a). We review a district court\u2019s application of a statutory sentencing enhancement de novo. <em>United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 334 (4th Cir. 1995). This claim is without merit as Brooks\u2019 three drug offenses took place on different dates and were not otherwise related. <em>Id. </em>at 334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Next, Brooks argues that he should have received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, because he pled guilty. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err by denying Brooks this reduction. <em>United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 239 (4th Cir.2007) (providing standard of review). The burden was on Brooks to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the adjustment, <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir.1989), and we have previously upheld denial of the reduction where the defendant continued to deal drugs after his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>970 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Finally, we note that Brooks\u2019 sentence was at the bottom of his properly calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, and thus is entitled to an appellate pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>sumption of reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Brooks. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
