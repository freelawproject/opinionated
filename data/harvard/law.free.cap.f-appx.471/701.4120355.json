We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review for an abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court\u2019s abstention decision. <em>Siragusa v. Siragusa (In re Siragusa), </em>27 F.3d 406, 407-08 (9th Cir.1994). We review de novo the BAP\u2019s mootness determination. <em>Nat\u2019l Mass Media Telecomm. Sys., Inc. v. Stanley (In re Nat\u2019l Mass Media Telecomm. Sys., Inc.), </em>152 F.3d 1178, 1180 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-24\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by abstaining from deciding Perry\u2019s unlawful repossession claims because Perry filed a nearly identical action for the repossession which was pending in state court. <em>See In re Siragusa, </em>27 F.3d at 408-09; <em>see also Benedor Corp. v. Conejo Enters., Inc. (In re Conejo Enters. Inc.), </em>96 F.3d 346, 351 (9th Cir.1996) (bankruptcy court\u2019s discretionary decision will be reversed only if based on legal error or if the record contains no evidence on which the court rationally could have based that decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-25\">The BAP properly concluded that Perry\u2019s appeal of the denial of injunctive relief and grant of relief from the automatic stay was moot because the car had been sold to a third party purchaser and effective relief could no longer be granted. <em>See In re Nat\u2019l Mass Media Telecomm. Sys., Inc., </em>152 F.3d at 1179-81 (affirming dismissal of appeal on constitutional mootness grounds where property at issue was sold and court could not grant effective relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-26\">Perry\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AfU\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
