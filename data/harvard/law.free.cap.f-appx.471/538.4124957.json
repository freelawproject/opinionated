Consistent with then-controlling Eighth Circuit precedent, the district court sentenced Stewart in September 2011 to 120 months in prison, the statutory minimum penalty mandated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) at the time of his 2007 offense. However, the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), which took effect in August 2010, increased the threshold quantities that trigger 5- and 10-year minimum penalties for crack offenses. Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 200,124 Stat. 2372 (Aug. 3, 2010). Stewart appeals his sentence, arguing the higher (more lenient) FSA thresholds should apply to his sentence even though he is a pre-FSA offender. In <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>2324-25, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2012), the Supreme Court of the United States agreed. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
