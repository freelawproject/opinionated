Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here. We have jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">\u201c[T]he burden is on the fee applicant to produce satisfactory evidence ... that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.\u201d <em>Christensen v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., </em>557 F.3d 1049, 1053 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984)). The BRB did not err in concluding that Robinowitz failed to meet this burden. <em>See Van Skike v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>557 F.3d 1041, 1045-46 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">The BRB did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to consider the hourly rates of workers\u2019 compensation attorneys in setting Robinowitz\u2019s rate. A major consideration in determining an appropriate fee award under the Longshore Act is the market rate of attorneys employing legal skills similar to those required by Long-shore practice. <em>See Christensen, </em>557 F.3d at 1053. Here, the ALJ considered rates charged by workers\u2019 compensation attorneys in calculating Robinowitz\u2019s hourly rate because the ALJ determined that workers\u2019 compensation practice requires legal skills similar to those required by Longshore practice. Substantial evidence supports this finding. This is especially true because Longshore practice is a form of workers\u2019 compensation practice. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">The BRB did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s refusal to place Robinowitz in the top ten percent of his peers. The ALJ had an opportunity to observe Robinowitz\u2019s filings in the fee proceeding and had access to the record for the case. The record included an order by a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ALJ, which explained that Robinowitz had made \u201csophomoric,\u201d \u201ccareless,\u201d and \u201cegregious\u201d errors in his representation of Eberly-Sherman. While the BRB modified that order, it did not set aside the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding the quality of Robinowitz\u2019s work. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s refusal to place Robinowitz in the top ten percent of his peers. Additionally, the ALJ\u2019s consideration of the quality of Robinowitz\u2019s representation in the case does not violate <em>Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010), because unlike the district court in Perdue, the ALJ in this case considered representation quality only once when determining the reasonable hourly rate. <em>See id. </em>at 1674-76 (holding that the district court erred by enhancing a lodestar award by 75%, based on performance, because the lodestar method incorporates hourly rates based upon attorney market value).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The BRB also did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s consideration of Oregon market rates instead of Portland market rates. An attorney\u2019s fee is \u201ccalculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.\u201d <em>Christensen, </em>557 F.3d at 1053 (quoting <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 895, 104 S.Ct. 1541). \u201cThe relevant community is generally defined as the forum in which the district court sits.\u201d <em>Van Skike, </em>557 F.3d at 1046 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In this case, the district court is located in Portland, Oregon, but its jurisdiction includes the entire state of Oregon. In light of Mr. Robinowitz\u2019s failure to provide satisfactory evidence establishing that the hourly rate for attorneys providing similar services to Longshore Act work is higher in Portland than it is in the rest of Oregon, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Oregon fee rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Finally, because Robinowitz failed to carry his burden to produce satisfactory evidence supporting his requested legal assistant rate, the BRB did not err by affirming the awarded legal assistant rate. <em>See Christensen, </em>557 F.3d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
