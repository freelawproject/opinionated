R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b33-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Tax Court\u2019s decision filed March 9, 2011, be affirmed. The Tax Court properly held that appellant did not meet his burden of proving the Commissioner\u2019s determination of the income tax deficiencies was incorrect. <em>See Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7491(a). Because appellant\u2019s briefs do not address the Tax Court\u2019s decision to impose penalties pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(a), appellant has forfeited any challenge to that ruling on appeal. <em>See Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Mid-Atl. Distrib. Ctr., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>363 F.3d 437, 441 (D.C.Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
