She insists, for the first time on appeal, that the sentence is unreasonable and greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. As Young did not object to the reasonableness of her sentence in the district court, review is restricted to plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); Fed. R.Crim. P. 52(b). Under the plain error standard, Young must show a clear or obvious error that affected her substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). We have discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Young contends that the sentence imposed is unreasonable given the relatively minor nature of the charged violations, despite her use of alcohol, spending time with her girlfriend who is a felon, and failing in court-ordered substance abuse treatment. She asserts that the court should have considered her youth and mental health issues and that a sentence within the advisory range would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The sentence imposed falls within the applicable statutory maximum, and the record reflects that the district court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553 factors, including Young\u2019s personal and criminal history, the circumstances of the underlying offense, and the need for deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3561(c)(1), \u00a7 3565(a); <em>see also Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265 Young\u2019s effort to have us reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is unavailing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Young has not demonstrated any error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265; <em>see also Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
