We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The BIA erred by denying Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen based on its finding that Kaur did not submit evidence that Indian police seek to arrest members of Sikh organizations because of such membership, because the record shows Kaur submitted a letter from the president of the All-India Sikh Student Federation (\u201cAISSF\u201d) that stated police were targeting Sikhs based on their membership in the AISSF and other Sikh parties. <em>See id. </em>at 793 (\u201c[T]he BIA is obligated to consider and address in its entirety the evidence submitted by a petitioner.\u201d). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See Mejia v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 873, 880 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A0-R\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
