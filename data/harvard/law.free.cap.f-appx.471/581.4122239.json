We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(a), <em>Barlow v. Ground, </em>39 F.3d 231, 233 (9th Cir.1994), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">The district court properly dismissed Williams\u2019s claims against defendant Santa Cruz in his individual capacity after the state filed and served notice of Santa Cruz\u2019s death and no party filed a valid motion to substitute his successor. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a)(1). Contrary to Williams\u2019s contention, the district court was not required to substitute a successor for claims against Santa Cruz in his individual, rather than official, capacity. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d)(1) (automatic substitution for public officials sued in their official capacity if they die while action is pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">The district court properly dismissed Williams\u2019s claims for damages against de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fendant Santa Cruz in his official capacity because California did not waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit for money damages under RLUIPA. <em>See Sossamon v. Texas, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 1655, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011) (holding that \u201cStates, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA\u201d); <em>Holley v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>599 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Williams\u2019s remaining contentions, including those regarding defendants Adams and Alameida, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We do not address issues that Williams has not raised on appeal. <em>See Cook v. Schriro, </em>538 F.3d 1000, 1014 n. 5 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
