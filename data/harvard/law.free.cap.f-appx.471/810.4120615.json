We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir.1992) (failure to comply with court orders); <em>Henderson v. Duncan, </em>779 F.2d 1421, 1423 (9th Cir. 1986) (failure to prosecute). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-26\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the action without prejudice because Palmer failed to respond to its order requiring him to provide information to the clerk\u2019s office necessary to effectuate service of process, failed to respond to the court\u2019s order to show cause, and failed to appear at the show cause hearing. <em>See Ferdik, </em>963 F.2d at 1260-61 (listing factors to consider); <em>Malone v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>833 F.2d 128, 132-33 (9th Cir.1987) (consideration of alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>sanctions can include a warning that failure to comply with court order could lead to dismissal); <em>Ash v. Cvetkov, </em>739 F.2d 493, 496-97 (9th Cir.1984) (dismissal for lack of prosecution was not an abuse of discretion even after relatively short period of delay, particularly where the dismissal was without prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We decline to address issues raised for the first time on appeal, including Palmer\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s order directing service of process by the U.S. Marshal. <em>See United States v. Alisal Water Carp., </em>370 F.3d 915, 923 (9th Cir.2004) (noting general rule that courts of appeal will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b840-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
