Briefly, the District Court sentenced Jiang to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, ordered that Jiang\u2019s sentence should run concurrent with a sentence imposed on Jiang in Queens County Criminal Court, and determined that Jiang\u2019s sentence should not be adjusted to account for the period of incarceration that Jiang had already served in connection with the sentence in Queens County Criminal Court. On appeal, Jiang argues that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to adjust his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) for undischarged time on a related state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal determination of whether Section 5G1.3 is applicable, <em>United States v. Brennan, </em>395 F.3d 59, 66 (2d Cir.2005), and its findings of fact in support of that determination for clear error, <em>see United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 923 (2d Cir.1998). We will not disturb a district court\u2019s sentencing decision under \u00a7 5G1.3 absent an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See Brennan, </em>395 F.3d at 66; <em>see also Sims v. Blot, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining the term of art \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-21\">Following this review, we conclude that the District Court did not \u201cabuse its discretion\u201d in sentencing Jiang to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment. Section 5G1.3(b) applies only if \u201ca term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction ... and that was the basis for an increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>in the offense level for the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Jiang\u2019s Queens conviction did not form the basis for the increase in his Guidelines offense level for the instant offense that is the subject of this appeal and, as a result, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) did not apply. The District Court was free to exercise its discretion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) in fashioning a partially concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Moreover, even if Jiang\u2019s Queens conviction were considered an undischarged sentence under \u00a7 5G1.3(b), the District Court was justified in exercising its discretion not to adjust Jiang\u2019s sentence to account for the time Jiang had already served in connection with the Queens conviction. <em>See United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We have considered all of Jiang\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
