We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings and review de novo its legal conclusions. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We grant the petition for review and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-24\">Substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s nexus determination because Haque\u2019s testimony established that he articulated his political opposition to rival party members and that the subsequent attacks and extortion were motivated, at least in part, on account of his political opinion. <em>See Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 735-37 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). Because the agency erred in its nexus determination, it did not fully consider Haque\u2019s claim of past persecution and whether Haque has a presumption of future persecution. <em>See Recinos De Leon v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 1185, 1191-92 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we grant the petition as to Haque\u2019s withholding of removal claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b793-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
