After careful de novo review, we conclude that summary judgment was proper. <em>See Mason v. Corr. Med. Sews., Inc., </em>559 F.3d 880, 884-85 (8th Cir.2009). As to defendant Podrebarac, we agree with the district court that the claims against him are based on Grey-wind\u2019s unsupported disagreement with medical treatment decisions, and that Greywind did not adequately counter defendants\u2019 evidence as to the appropriate treatment for his dental root fracture. <em>See Meuir v. Greene Cnty. Jail Emps., </em>487 F.3d 1115, 1118-19 (8th Cir.2007). And because we conclude that there was no underlying constitutional violation, the claims against the remaining defendants likewise fail. <em>See Morris v. Lanpher, </em>563 F.3d 399, 403 (8th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we deny as moot Greywind\u2019s pending motion for a stay, and we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-20\">. The Honorable Daniel L.
