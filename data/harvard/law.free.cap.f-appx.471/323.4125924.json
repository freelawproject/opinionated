He argues that 30-month below guidelines sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court did not give adequate reasons for the sentence and provided no indication that it actively weighed the grounds that he argued warranted a substantially lower sentence. Because he did not raise these arguments in the district court, he concedes that review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Reyes\u2019s allocution, his counsel\u2019s arguments, the letters submitted on behalf of Reyes, and the Presentence Report. The district court stated at sentencing and in the statement of reasons that a sentence below the guideline range was appropriate based on the need to provide just punishment for the offense and based on Reyes\u2019s history and characteristics, including that he had only one prior conviction that was used to enhance his offense level and to calculate his criminal history category. The district court\u2019s explanation was fact-specific, was consistent with the need to promote respect for the law under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and was adequate to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 474 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 997, 178 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, Reyes has not shown any procedural error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Reyes\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is merely a corollary to his procedural argument that the district court failed to provide adequate reasons for the sentence; because his procedural argument fails, his substantive argument also fails. <em>See United States v. Rhine, </em>637 F.3d 525, 530 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Reyes has not shown that the district court failed to account for a factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an improper factor, or clearly erred in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. Therefore, he has not shown plain error concerning the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
