Ice was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for each offense to be served concurrently. He contends that the district court erred by holding him accountable for all the methamphetamine seized from the residence because his role in the conspiracy was limited to distributing small amounts of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A finding of fact is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the entire record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In the case of a \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d a defendant\u2019s offense level is determined on the basis of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Methamphetamine was stored, packaged, and distributed in the residence Ice shared with his father. Ice\u2019s father supplied Ice with methamphetamine, which Ice sold in small amounts on multiple occasions over a period of time and offered to sell to others. Since Ice\u2019s participation in the conspiracy was not limited to a single transaction or specific quantity of drugs, evidence that he distributed small amounts of methamphetamine in comparison to his father does not compel the conclusion that the scope of his agreement was limited to distributing small amounts. Therefore, the district court\u2019s conclusion that all the methamphetamine found in the residence was within the scope of his agreement was plausible in light of the record as a whole and, therefore, not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>13 F.3d 860, 865 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Even if the scope of criminal activity Ice agreed to undertake was more limited, the district court was permitted to approximate the amount of methamphetamine attributable to Ice. <em>See United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 942 (5th Cir. 1994). Ice provides no argument or basis for determining the portion of the methamphetamine found in the residence that would have been given to him for distribution. Thus, he has failed to show that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that all the methamphetamine found in the residence was within the scope of his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
