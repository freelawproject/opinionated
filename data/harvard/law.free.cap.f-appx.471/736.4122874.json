We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Balean failed to demonstrate the harassment he and his family suffered under the Soviet regime, and the incidents in 2002 and 2007 when they were prevented from holding religious events, rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Balean does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1018. Accordingly, Balcan\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Because Balean failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that he has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Finally, substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Balean failed to establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government of Moldova. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b767-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
