Johnson\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that this appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">An appeal is taken in good faith if it involves legal points that are arguable on their merits and not frivolous. <em>Id. </em>Johnson\u2019s appeal from the 2009 denial of his motion for appointment of counsel is untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). His attempt to appeal from the magistrate judge\u2019s June 17, 2011 denial of his motion for reconsideration is ineffective because he filed this motion two days prior to the magistrate judge\u2019s decision and three days prior to entry of the decision on the docket. <em>Cf. </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(2) (stating that a filing made <em>after </em>the district court issues an order but prior to the entry of judgment is effective) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Johnson\u2019s notice of appeal refers to the district court\u2019s June 6, 2011, denial of his motion for reconsideration. However, the June 6th decision related to the denial of Johnson\u2019s motion to strike the defendants\u2019 motions. Although the notice of appeal is timely as to this order, we lack jurisdiction to address this issue in an interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>appeal. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 &amp; 1292; <em>Will v. Hallock, </em>546 U.S. 345, 349, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006). Because we lack jurisdiction, Johnson has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. See <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
