On appeal, Shippy argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to both offenses, and in imposing a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence based on a drug quantity that was not specifically found by the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having fully considered Shippy\u2019s contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In 2008 and 2009, Shippy came to the attention of law enforcement as a result of an ongoing investigation into the drug trafficking activities of his \u201cdistant cousin\u201d and co-defendant, Kenneth Lee Foster.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September 2008, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agents and local Asheville police targeted Foster for surveillance after Bridget Lee was charged with drug trafficking and identified him as one of her sources. The agents initially confirmed Lee\u2019s information by having her make monitored calls to Foster\u2019s cell phone. Persuaded that her identification of Foster was accurate, the agents then had Lee undertake two controlled buys of crack cocaine from him, on September 9 and September 11. The buys were monitored by audio and (unbeknownst to Lee) video surveillance, and resulted in Lee\u2019s purchase of about 91 grams of crack on each occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">With this and other evidence of Foster\u2019s drug trafficking, agents obtained a warrant authorizing a wiretap to intercept communications to and from Foster\u2019s cell phones. In addition to monitoring Foster\u2019s calls, agents installed a video surveillance camera up the street from Foster\u2019s residence where he carried on his drug trafficking activities. The position of the camera was such that agents could observe only the area in front of the main building entryway; the door to Foster\u2019s unit, or that of any other resident of the building, was not in view.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Agents observed Foster\u2019s building and monitored his phone calls for approximately four months total, from October 24, 2008, through February 24, 2009. During this time, they observed a pattern of behavior by visitors to Foster\u2019s home: a phone call to Foster before an arrival, often a second phone call when the visitor was a few minutes away or had arrived at the residence, and finally a brief, five to ten minute interaction with Foster either in the apartment or from the visitor\u2019s vehicle parked outside the building. As agents observed this conduct, they endeavored to identify the visitors, i.e., Foster\u2019s suspected customers, by running DMV registration records for their cars. Agents also endeavored to corroborate their belief that Foster\u2019s visitors were purchasing crack cocaine from him by undertaking traffic stops after the visitors left his residence. Three such stops effected for this purpose in fact yielded significant seizures of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">On December 8, 2008, agents first observed the man later identified as Shippy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At 2:52 p.m., Foster made an outgoing call to phone number (828) 398-. Foster referred to Shippy as \u201cPete,\u201d and stated that he \u201cgot a hold of a little something.\u201d Shippy asked, \u201cWhat are we talking about ... on a Q.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Supp. J.A. 1. Foster answered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cFive for you but five on the thing but you know a tray [sic] on the Q for you five on the half so....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Foster then noted, as phonetically translated by the monitoring agents, \u201cIt post to be [pretty] nice they say but it ain\u2019t much I just going to be honest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Shippy responded, \u201clet me call you back in a just a few minutes so I can get some funds together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">About an hour later, at 3:49 p.m., Shippy called Foster from the same phone used in the above conversation, saying he was heading to the residence and would see Foster in ten minutes. At 4:01 p.m., 12 minutes later, a Nissan Altima arrived at Foster\u2019s building and Shippy exited. Agents ran the plates of the Altima and discovered that it was registered to Jessica Goodien, at an address in a nearby town. Later investigation revealed that Goodien was Shippy\u2019s live-in girlfriend. Shippy left Foster\u2019s apartment at 4:32 p.m. Foster later called to \u201cverify the quality of the crack cocaine.\u201d J.A. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Several weeks later, agents eventually confirmed (to their satisfaction) that it was indeed Shippy they had observed on December 8 when they observed a car arriving at Foster\u2019s residence after phone calls from the same number that had communicated with Foster on December 8. That car, a late model Mercedes, was registered to Shippy himself. Having determined that Shippy was the person associated with the number, that phone line was ascribed by agents to Shippy for the remainder of the investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">On December 27, agents monitored and recorded another series of calls between Foster and Shippy. During the first call, at 3:41 p.m., Shippy stated to Foster, \u2018You said you was going to get half the whole thing.\u201d J.A. 804. Foster replied, \u201cUh hun[.] Yea you got to check that chicken out too man it cooks pretty good.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Trial testimony explained that \u201cchicken\u201d was code for cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 254. Foster also instructed Shippy, \u201cStay by your phone I am going to hit you back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804. A few minutes later, at 4:03 p.m., Shippy called Foster back, \u201cchecking with ya to see if I could get any kind of help.\u201d Foster replied that they should \u201cmeet in the home front.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Video surveillance of Foster\u2019s building showed that at 4:34 p.m., the Mercedes registered to Shippy arrived at the residence. While the record does not indicate how long Shippy\u2019s car was present, phone records indicate that at 8:08 p.m., Foster called Shippy\u2019s phone, asking, \u201cHow did you like those shoes[?]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806. Shippy replied, \u201cI ain\u2019t slowed down since I left you[. I]t is all well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">Two days later, on December 29, 2008, agents again monitored calls between Foster and Shippy. At 5:23 p.m., Shippy told Foster that he was <em>\u201c2 </em>minutes away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. Video surveillance indicates that at 5:38 p.m., Shippy arrived in his girlfriend\u2019s Altima, entered Foster\u2019s building, and departed soon after. On December 31, Shippy called Foster at 11:58 a.m. Foster told Shippy, \u201cI\u2019m getting you ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>now ... it\u2019s going to take a minute.... But I\u2019m doing it now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808. Shippy answered, \u201cI\u2019ll just hover over here for a minute then,\u201d and Foster ended with, \u201cOk I\u2019ll just give you a yell.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At 12:46 p.m., Foster called Shippy, asking, \u201cwhere you at?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809. Shippy answered that he was right around the corner and Foster said, \u201cAlright come on up man.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Surveillance images showed Shippy arrive in the Altima ten minutes later, at 12:56 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Days later, on January 3, 2009, Shippy and Foster apparently talked again, with Foster saying, \u201cI want you to eat,\u201d and Shippy replying, \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to do is eat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. About ten minutes later, at approximately 12:29 p.m., Foster called Shippy, asking, \u201cwhere you at?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. Shippy replied, \u201cRight down the street, I\u2019ll be there in a second.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A minute or two later, Shippy was observed exiting the Altima and walking towards Foster\u2019s building. On January 8, Shippy was observed outside Foster\u2019s building, in his Mercedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Shippy\u2019s communications with Foster were recorded, and his presence at the residence was captured on camera soon after those conversations, on five more days in January. Of particular note, on January 25 at around 4:00 p.m., Shippy called Foster after a couple of earlier conversations arranging his visit. At the start of this conversation, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">Foster: Yo</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">Shippy: Yeah, I just wanted old boy to know how strict the thing was between me and you</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiy\">Foster: Oh I felt it, I felt it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALI\">Shippy: Oh you know those customers they will wait till the last minute when they get to your door and everything\u2019s backwards</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">Foster: Yeah yeah why you think I went that route though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">Shippy: Yeah</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">Foster: When you said no, I\u2019m down, and I said yeah ok I got ya</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">Shippy: Yeah</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">Foster: I appreciate that hey man do me a favor and go ahead and get that out there right quick to somebody and give me a test run back on that as soon ASAP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-15\">Shippy: Ok but I believe it\u2019s gonna be alright but I\u2019ll go do that now</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 818. Two days later, on January 27, Shippy stated to Foster during a phone call at 12:18 p.m., \u201cI just wanted to remind you about the 14 I\u2019m out here.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 820. A surveillance image was taken of Shippy outside Foster\u2019s building simultaneously at 12:18 p.m. Shippy departed just minutes later, at approximately 12:20 or 12:21 p.m. This was the last interaction between Foster and Shippy presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-18\">As a result of the investigation detailed above, on April 7, 2009, Shippy was indicted in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina on two counts: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1); and (2) use of a communication facility in causing and facilitating that conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). A few months prior, Foster and 14 others had been indicted on the same two charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for conduct during the same period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">After his arrest, Shippy promptly filed a number of pro se motions including \u201cmotions to compel, to appeal the \u2018bond hearing,\u2019 for dismissal, and to suppress,\u201d despite the fact that he was represented by counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 16. The motions were all \u201csummarily denied\u201d on the ground that Shippy must communicate to the court through his attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Notwithstanding the admonishment, Shippy again submitted a pro se motion on May 18, 2009, requesting a separate trial from the nine co-defendants listed on his indictment on the ground that he had \u201cvery little to no acquaintance, relations, or affiliation\u201d with them. <em>Id. </em>at 22. Again the motion was summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The next month, the Government moved for a joint trial of Shippy and the remaining defendants in the earlier Foster indictment. Shippy\u2019s counsel did not object to a joint trial and the motion was granted. A joint trial then proceeded for Shippy, Foster, and Yvonne Marie Fountain, Foster\u2019s girlfriend. <em>See supra </em>n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">At trial, the vast majority of the evidence addressed the conduct of Foster and Fountain, whose conduct was inarguably the subject of greater and stronger direct evidence than that of Shippy. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 322-25 (testimony that a half kilo of powder cocaine and cash were seized in Foster\u2019s apartment); 492-94 (testimony that crack cocaine and \u201caround $21,000\u201d in cash were seized in Fountain\u2019s home). In fact, as Shippy points out, \u201cAgent Daniel Guzzo was the only government witness to mention Mr. Shippy.\u201d Supp. Appellant\u2019s Br. 6. Guzzo testified that agents identified Shippy as the user of the (838) 398 \u2014 phone number by correlating his arrival in the Altima registered to his girlfriend and his own Mercedes to calls made from that number. He further testified, as mentioned above, that conversations between Shippy and Foster included use of code words for the sale of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Under questioning, Agent Guzzo conceded that video surveillance did not actually indicate which apartment Shippy entered during any of his visits to Foster\u2019s building, and the phone number ascribed to Shippy had not been researched as to its registered user nor did it match the cell phone seized from Shippy at the time of his arrest. Moreover, Shippy\u2019s home did not contain any drugs or large amounts of cash at the time it was searched, and no one involved in the investigation \u201cwas familiar with Mr. Shippy.\u201d J.A. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Shippy elected to testify in his own defense. He averred that he was not the person whose voice was recorded from the (838) 398-number. In addition, he explained his presence at Foster\u2019s building as visits to see Foster socially and invite him to church events, and to see a Ms. Lytle, a first-floor resident of Foster\u2019s building, whose kitchen he hoped to renovate through his home maintenance business. Shippy claimed that he was drug\u2014 and alcohol-free (after a prior period of substance abuse) and had never purchased drugs from Foster who \u201chad never even come around me with such,\u201d knowing that Shippy was a recovering addict. <em>Id. </em>at 737. When asked on cross-examination whether his arrival at Foster\u2019s building only minutes after a caller from the (838) 398-number indicated he was right around the corner and would be coming by was \u201cjust coincidence,\u201d Shippy replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know ma\u2019am. I have no idea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">During deliberations, the jury requested the date and time of audio recordings between Foster and the phone number ascribed to Shippy, and indicated they were attempting to correlate this information with the dates for the video images of his presence at Foster\u2019s building. After a to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tal period of approximately four hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts for Shippy, Foster, and Fountain as to the conspiracy offense. Shippy and Foster were also found guilty of the use of a communication facility offense. On the verdict sheet, as to the conspiracy count, the jury made the following specific findings as to Shippy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApE\">As to the charge of conspiracy to possess, with the intent to distribute, cocaine [base] contained in Count One of the Bill of Indictment ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>Guilty</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">1. Do you unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant ... was personally involved with the possession with intent to distribute of 50 grams [sic] or more of cocaine base?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>No</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">2. Do you unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the other members of the conspiracy were involved with the possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and that this involvement was either known to the Defendant or reasonably foreseeable to him and was in the furtherance of the conspiracy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>Yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 822-23. The final section of the verdict sheet directed the jury to indicate the amount of cocaine base attributable to each defendant, from among six choices: less than 50 grams; 50-149 grams; 150-499 grams; 500 grams-1.49 kilos; 1.5 kilos^.49 kilos; or 4.5 kilos or more. As to Shippy, the jury indicated the lowest listed amount, \u201cless than 50 grams cocaine base.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the jury essentially convicted Shippy of a lesser included offense as to count one, namely, conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in an amount less than fifty grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">In advance of sentencing, a probation officer prepared a pre-sentence report (PSR). In response to the draft PSR, Shippy made nine objections, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">[The PSR] should be amended to read that the Defendant was responsible for at most one-half ounce of crack cocaine based on the evidence adduced at trial which equates to 14 grams or at least between 5 and 20 grams of cocaine base. The proposed amendment would support a change to the Guideline calculations to make the Base Offense Level 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 874. The final PSR included revisions to address these objections, ultimately concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-15\">[T]he jury determined the defendant is accountable for less than 50 grams of cocaine base. The investigation determined the defendant and Kenneth Foster had telephone conversations consisting of the defendant\u2019s desire to purchase unknown amounts of crack cocaine. As such, case agents place the defendant\u2019s responsibility in the range of at least 5 grams but less than 20 grams of crack cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 853. The Base Offense Level was therefore computed, in the absence of any applicable adjustments, at 24 for both counts. Review of Shippy\u2019s criminal history yielded 12 criminal history points for a criminal history category of V. These calculations resulted in a guideline term of imprisonment of 92-115 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">The PSR further noted, however, that the statutes applicable at the time provided a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment and eight years of supervised release for a defendant, like Shippy, who has a prior conviction for a felony drug offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the communication fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>cility offense, the PSR noted a maximum sentence of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">At his sentencing hearing, Shippy raised only one additional substantive objection to the PSR, specifically that the imposition of an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence of ten years, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), reflected the 100-to-l cocaine base/powder cocaine disparity and should be varied downward in light of that unfairness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Government replied, \u201c[T]he fact is this is a statutory mandatory minimum. The Court couldn\u2019t vary from if it chose to. So the statutory \u2014 that\u2019s the law right now, so until it\u2019s changed otherwise, it\u2019s 120 months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The district court found that the statutory minimum was applicable, as asserted by the probation officer and the Government, and therefore sentenced Shippy to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and eight years of supervised release for the conspiracy charge, and 96 months, to be served concurrently, for the communication facility charge. <em>Id. </em>at 833. Shippy has timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Shippy first argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal for both charged offenses. Our review of the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal is de novo, under longstanding principles, as we summarized in <em>United States v. Green, </em>599 F.3d 360, 367 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction by determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support the conviction. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, a reviewing court may not assess the credibility of witnesses, but rather must assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in testimony in favor of the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">To obtain a conviction for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base, the Government must prove the following essential elements: (1) an agreement between two or more persons to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy; and (3) the defendant's knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Yearwood, </em>518 F.3d 220, 225-26 (4th Cir.2008). Once the Government proves the existence of a conspiracy, the evidence need only establish a \u201cslight connection\u201d between the defendant and the conspiracy to support the conviction. <em>Green, </em>599 F.3d at 367. Additionally, a defendant may be convicted of conspiracy without knowing all of its details and even if he plays only a minor role, as long as he enters the conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>understanding that it is unlawful and willfully joins in the plan at least once. <em>Id. </em>at 367-68; <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 858 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Shippy argues that the Government failed to produce sufficient evidence of his participation in a conspiracy because, \u201c[a]l-though a conspiratorial agreement need not be proved by direct evidence, there was not even substantial inferential or circumstantial evidence against Mr. Shippy.\u201d Supp. Appellant\u2019s Br. 11. Shippy emphasizes that he was unknown to any of the informant co-conspirators who testified at his trial, he did not have drugs or cash in his home at the time he was arrested, he was not shown to own or have used the phone number ascribed to him, and none of the conversations he allegedly had with Foster involved any quantity of cocaine in any event. <em>Id. </em>at 14. Shippy makes an alternative argument to the effect that at most, the evidence showed that he was merely a buyer of cocaine base for his own personal use and not a knowing member of a distribution conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The Government responds by essentially arguing that Foster\u2019s conduct was robustly proven to comprise drug trafficking and that Shippy\u2019s calls and visits to Foster\u2019s home matched the pattern of Foster\u2019s known customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Under <em>Burgos, </em>a conspiracy may be adequately proven even where it has an \u201celusive quality,\u201d and the defendant has \u201clittle or no knowledge of the entire breadth of the criminal enterprise.\u201d 94 F.3d at 858. \u201cCircumstantial evidence tending to prove a conspiracy may consist of a defendant\u2019s \u2018relationship with other members of the conspiracy, the length of this association, [the defendant\u2019s] attitude [and] conduct, and the nature of the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Collazo, </em>732 F.2d 1200, 1205 (4th Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">We have no hesitation in concluding that the mosaic of evidence described above was sufficient to permit the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Shippy was a knowing member of the Foster drug trafficking conspiracy. The phone calls attributed to Shippy unmistakably suggest drug trafficking transactions to the degree that their content is unusually opaque and seems to involve code words that are consistent with testimony from known buyers. <em>See, e.g., </em>Supp. J.A. 1 (mention of a \u201cQ\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 357 (Agent Guzzo\u2019s testimony that a \u201cQ\u201d indicated a quarter ounce of crack). Shippy\u2019s relatively frequent, brief visits to Foster\u2019s building during the surveillance period also match the pattern of known buyers observed by investigators. While Shippy did attest to visiting another resident who lived in a unit in Foster\u2019s building, the duration of some of his stops was so short that when coupled with the coded language, it reasonably supports the inferences drawn by the jury that the visits involved momentary drug transactions. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 384-86, 820 (testimony that Shippy was parked at Foster\u2019s building, after calling to \u201cremind [him] about the 14,\u201d for two to three minutes). Whether the evidence demonstrated that Shippy was carrying on his own entrepreneurial drug sales business with Foster as his supplier, on the one hand, or was a mere innocent in the wrong place at the wrong time on the wrong cell phone, on the other hand, were quintessentially jury questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Shippy calls our attention to <em>United States v. Hickman, </em>626 F.3d 756 (4th Cir. 2010), as an example of a case where direct evidence of a defendant\u2019s participation in a drug trafficking conspiracy supported denial of a motion for acquittal. Indeed, <em>Hickman </em>involved a defendant whose pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>chase of drugs had been arranged by fairly explicit phone calls monitored by law enforcement, and who in fact was found to have a quantity of heroin in his car when he was eventually stopped and searched. <em>Id. </em>at 761. Shippy, in contrast, was never observed with any drugs, nor were drugs or cash found in his home.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But these obvious differences between the two cases provide no support to Shippy. The absence of any evidence of seizures of drugs, cash or paraphernalia from Shippy or Shippy\u2019s residence does not defeat the Government\u2019s case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The evidence adduced at trial was essentially that Shippy\u2019s conduct of contacting and visiting Foster matched the stark patterns of known customers. Furthermore, corroborating the inference of a drug purchase purpose for his visits most strongly are three particular phone calls in which Foster and Shippy discussed drugs with relative specificity. On December 8, Shippy discussed purchasing a \u201cQ\u201d (i.e., quarter ounce, or 7 grams, of crack cocaine) from Foster. On December 27, Foster told Shippy, \u201cyou got to check that chicken out too man it cooks pretty good.\u201d J.A. 804. From this evidence, and testimony from Agent Guzzo that \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cchicken\u201d both refer to crack, the jury could reasonably infer that Shippy was involved in a conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine base. Approximately one month later, on January 25, 2009, Shippy also referred to \u201cthose customers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 818, a reference that any reasonable juror could conclude was an allusion to <em>Shippy\u2019s customers, not to Shippy himself as a mere customer of Foster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">To summarize, the Government produced evidence at trial that established Shippy\u2019s movements matched those of Foster\u2019s crack cocaine buyers, and his conversations indicated discussion of crack cocaine quantities and arguably his own buyers. While Shippy denied that he was a participant in those calls, and he offered the jury innocent explanations for his intermittent presence at and around the Foster residence, the jury made those relevant findings against him, as it was authorized to do.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of the substantial evidence presented at trial, even if much of it was circumstantial, and deferring as we must to the jury\u2019s role in judging the weight and credibility of the testimony, Shippy has not satisfied his burden to make out a case of evidentiary insufficiency. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>507 F.3d 233, 245 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Shippy also argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal as to his conviction for use of a communication facility in committing, causing, or facilitating commission of a felony under federal drug trafficking law. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). To obtain a conviction for a violation of \u00a7 843(b), the Government must prove that the defendant: (1) used a communication facility (in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>this case, a telephone); (2) to commit, cause, or facilitate the commission of a drug offense; and (3) did so knowingly and intentionally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Shippy asserts that the Government failed to provide sufficient evidence that he did anything more, if he did anything unlawful at all, than purchase an unspecified amount of crack cocaine for personal use, which is not a felony, Supp. Appellant\u2019s Br. 18-19, and which, if true, would not support conviction on the \u00a7 843(b) count. <em>See Abuelhawa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 816, 129 S.Ct. 2102, 2107, 173 L.Ed.2d 982 (2009) (holding that a buyer who uses a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does not \u201cfacilitate\u201d felony drug distribution because the term \u201cfacilitate\u201d is limited to someone other than a principal or necessary actor). But Shippy\u2019s reliance on <em>Abuelhawa </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In essence, Shippy argues before us that even if the Government can show that he purchased crack cocaine from Foster (ironically, a proposition Shippy vigorously disputed in his own testimony at trial), the evidence failed to prove he was involved in the <em>distribution </em>of those drugs to anyone else and in so doing used a telephone. We reject Shippy\u2019s contention. Taken in the light most favorable to the Government, and accepting the jury\u2019s factual findings (i.e., that Shippy and Foster were in fact discussing crack cocaine during their conversations), the evidence indicates the following specific purchase amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Together with the circumstances already described, these quantities could reasonably be inferred to indicate an intent to distribute, even if at a relatively small scale.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It will be recalled also that Shippy made mention of \u201cthose customers.\u201d <em>See supra </em>pp. 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">In sum, for the same reasons we conclude the Government adduced evidence sufficient to show Shippy\u2019s knowing participation in the overall conspiracy, we are satisfied that the jury did not act irrationally in finding that Shippy intended to distribute some if not all of the narcotics he purchased from Foster, and that he used the telephone in the course of his participation in the conspiracy. The amounts discussed above are not so small as to preclude, as a matter of law, a finding of intent to distribute, and circumstantial evidence concerning Shippy\u2019s use of a telephone to arrange drug transactions was rationally interpreted by the jury against him. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the communication count.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Shippy next argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846, the sentences for participants in drug conspiracies are set forth in \u00a7 841(b), which \u201ccreates a three-part graduated penalty scheme for drug distribution offenses, premised on the type and quantity of the drugs involved.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>524 F.3d 549, 557 (4th Cir.2008). We held in <em>Brooks </em>that \u201c \u2018specific threshold drug quantities must be treated as elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>aggravated drug trafficking offenses, rather than as mere sentencing factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 156 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Under the version of \u00a7 841(b) that was in effect both at the time Shippy committed the conspiracy offense and at sentencing, the threshold quantity of cocaine base required for a sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), the section at issue here, was five grams or more.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For the statutory m\u00ednimums of \u00a7 841(b) to apply, the particular threshold drug amount must either be admitted or found by a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, to be reasonably foreseeable to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">As previously mentioned, the verdict sheet directed the jury to indicate the amount of cocaine base attributable to each defendant from among six choices: less than 50 grams, 50-149 grams, 150-499 grams, 500 grams-1.49 kilos, 1.5 kilos-4.49 kilos, or 4.5 kilos or more. As to Shippy, the jury found the smallest listed amount, \u201cless than 50 grams of cocaine base.\u201d Without question, the jury was not offered the opportunity specifically to find that the amount attributable to Shippy was \u201cless than five grams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Thus, as the Government readily concedes, the district court erred, <em>United States v. Collins, </em>415 F.3d 304 (4th Cir. 2005), and, although Shippy failed to object or to bring the requirements of <em>Brooks </em>to the attention of the district court, the error is plain under the applicable standard of review. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (successful plain error review requires a showing that: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights); <em>Foster, </em>507 F.3d at 251 (\u201cIn this case, the jury never determined the individualized quantity of crack attributable to each defendant for the penalty purposes of \u00a7 841(b).... Because the jury was not properly instructed under <em>Collins, </em>the defendants\u2019 jury did not properly determine the statutory threshold quantity of crack attributable to each of them. Accordingly, the first two prongs of <em>Olano </em>(error and plainness) are satisfied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The issue presented is whether the <em>Collins </em>error affected Shippy\u2019s substantial rights and, if so, whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in that it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We are satisfied that the district court\u2019s error did not affect Shippy\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">For reasons similar to those material here, we declined to notice a <em>Collins </em>error in <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>570 F.3d 557 (4th Cir.2009). There, we concluded that although the <em>Collins </em>error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, i.e., he received a sentence 24 months greater than the otherwise applicable maximum sentence, we determined that a failure to correct the error would not affect \u201cthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570. This conclusion was based on our assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>that \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d supported the imposition of the higher sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Although in this case the evidence of Shippy\u2019s involvement with more than five grams of crack cocaine is not properly described as \u201coverwhelming,\u201d it is, nonetheless, considerably compelling. Indeed, we have no hesitation in concluding that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have found a drug quantity of less than five grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The conversations between Shippy and Foster that the jury determined to be drug-related referenced, as noted above, at least three transactions that likely involved 7-14 grams of crack each. Supp. J.A. 1 (referencing a \u201cQ\u201d and \u201ca half\u2019); J.A. 804 (\u201chalf of the whole\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 820 (\u201cthe 14\u201d). To the degree that the jury found Shippy guilty of conspiracy, it is logically necessary to conclude that the jury credited the testimony of Agent Guzzo that the language used during the phone calls was code, and that this code indicated drug quantities. The record plainly indicates that the attributable quantity the district court reached was consistent with (and even potentially more conservative than) the most likely conclusions of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Notably, at sentencing Shippy conceded that the proper quantity of crack attributable to him under the prosecution\u2019s evidence was 5-20 grams, and he requested application of the guideline range for that very amount. Supp. Appellant\u2019s Br. 24; J.A. 874 (objection to the draft PSR noting \u201cthe Defendant was responsible for at most one-half ounce of crack cocaine based on the evidence adduced at trial which equates to 14 grams therefore Mr. Shippy should be responsible for no more than 14 grams or at last between 5 and 20 grams of cocaine base\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 829 (requesting the \u201cactual guideline amount\u201d of imprisonment). This concession was fully justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\">. Shippy also contends that he should have been sentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. Shippy concedes, however, that he makes this argument only to preserve it, as it is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Bullard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>645 F.3d 237 (4th Cir.2011), <em>cert. </em>denied, U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 356, 181 L.Ed.2d 225 (2011), by which this panel is bound. <em>United States v.

As discussed in more detail below, the mandatory minimum applied to an offense involving 5 or more grams of cocaine at the time of Shippy's sentence. In 2010, the provision was revised and the ten year mandatory minimum currently applies to an offense involving 28 or more grams of crack cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b209-13\">.

In addition to its assessment of Shippy's demeanor on the stand, the jury also had the benefit of comparing Shippy\u2019s voice in the recordings to what they heard when he testified.
