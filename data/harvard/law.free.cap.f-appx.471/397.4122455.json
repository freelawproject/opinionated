Ferrel argues that his sentence, which was at the low end of the calculated guidelines range, was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In particular, he argues that the guidelines range failed to account for his strong family ties to the United States, the fact that his age makes him less likely to recidivate, and the likelihood that he will not reenter now that he is aware of the severe punishment for illegal reentry. Ferrel also argues that his within guidelines sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which applies to illegal reentry convictions, is not empirically supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Ferrel\u2019s sentence was within the advisory guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Ferrel challenges the presumption of reasonableness applied to his sentence, but he acknowledges the issue is foreclosed and raises it to preserve the issue for further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">The district court listened to Ferrel\u2019s arguments in mitigation at the sentencing hearing and concluded that a sentence outside of the guidelines range was not warranted. In particular, the district court expressed concern over Ferrel\u2019s criminal history and the fact that he had returned not long after his last removal, which had not resulted in a criminal prosecution. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Ferrel has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb the presumption of reasonableness applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ble to his sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under ble limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
