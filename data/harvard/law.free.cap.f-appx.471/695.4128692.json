We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">Rodriguez contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing when counsel failed to complete his investigation, to submit a sentencing memorandum, or to adequately prepare for the sentencing hearing. We are precluded from reaching the merits of Rodriguez\u2019s claim by a valid appeal waiver in which Rodriguez gave up his right to pursue a direct appeal of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 959 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[ O ]ne waives the right to argue ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing on direct appeal when one waives the right to appeal the sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-25\">In any event, the record is insufficiently developed and Rodriguez\u2019s legal representation was not so inadequate that it can be concluded at this point that he obviously was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See United States v. McKenna, </em>327 F.3d 830, 845 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally inappropriate on direct appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-26\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AXd\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
