We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-23\">The agency found Yu not credible for several reasons, including her inability to recite a hymn she sang during her four years attending church gatherings in China and her inability to remember her pastor\u2019s name. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>at 1045-48 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the REAL ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, Yu\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Because Yu\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and she does not point to any evidence that shows it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to China, her CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
