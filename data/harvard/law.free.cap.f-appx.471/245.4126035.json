Following a successful appeal, in which we affirmed the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tions but vacated the sentence, Ohangbon was resentenced to concurrent thirty-month terms of imprisonment. In this appeal, Ohangbon argues that his \u00a7 922(g) conviction is no longer valid in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>649 F.3d 237, 241 (4th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In <em>Simmons, </em>we overruled <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242 (4th Cir. 2005), and held that a North Carolina state conviction may not be classified as punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year based on the maximum aggravated sentence that could be imposed on a repeat offender if the individual defendant was not eligible for such a sentence. <em>Simmons, </em>649 F.3d at 241, 243-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Ohangbon\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) conviction was supported by his North Carolina conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a class I felony. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 90 \u2014 95(b)(2), 90-94(1) (2011). The record does not include the state court judgment and it is not clear what Ohangbon\u2019s prior record level was at his state sentencing. However, the record does reflect that Ohangbon was ultimately sentenced to a suspended sentence of six to eight months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, it appears that he could not have been sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year because even if he faced a minimum sentence of eight months, Ohangbon was exposed to a maximum term of imprisonment of no more than ten months. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17 (d) (2003). Applying <em>Simmons, </em>it appears that Ohangbon did not have the requisite predicate offense to be convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. We remand to the district court for the appropriate determination regarding this prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Accordingly, we vacate Ohangbon\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) conviction and his sentence and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
