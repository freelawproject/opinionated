We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir. 2008), except to the extent that deference is owed to the BIA\u2019s determination of the governing statutes and regulations, <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-23\">Rodriguez-Roja testified gang members attacked her and demanded money because they knew she had relatives in the United States. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Rodriguez-Roja failed to demonstrate that she is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal based on her membership in a particular social group. <em>See Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1148, 1151-52 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also Barrios, </em>581 F.3d at 856 (evidence supported conclusion that gang victimized the petitioner for economic and personal reasons rather than on account of a protected ground). Accordingly, Rodriguez-Roja\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-24\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of Rodriguez-Roja\u2019s CAT claim because she failed to establish a likelihood of torture by or with the consent or acquiescence of a government official if returned to El Salvador. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
