Klein, </em>264 F.3d 936, 950-51 (9th Cir.2001). Rather than granting summary judgment as \u201ca mere sanction for noncompliance with local rules,\u201d <em>Martinez v. Stanford, </em>323 F.3d 1178, 1182 (9th Cir.2003), the district court reviewed the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the record and determined that defendant Maxum Indemnity Company had met its burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) of demonstrating that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that Maxum was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Cusano, </em>264 F.3d at 950-51; <em>cf. Marshall v. Gates, </em>44 F.3d 722, 725 (9th Cir.1995). The district court was not required to consider whether Re/ Max\u2019s delay in filing constituted \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) because a district court need not consider Rule 60(b) issues <em>sua sponte </em>when the moving party \u201cfailed to advance any argument ... that might conceivably fall within any of the enumerated factors under Rule 60(b).\u201d <em>See Am. Ironworks &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. N. Am. Constr. Corp., </em>248 F.3d 892, 899 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Even if the district court abused its discretion by striking Re/Max\u2019s opposition, any error was harmless because the district court did not rely on any disputed issues of material fact or ignore any meritorious legal arguments in reaching its decision. On the undisputed facts, Re/Max had notice of third-party plaintiff Suk Young Yoo\u2019s letters as of early March 2007 at the latest and yet did not report them until late May at the earliest, almost two months after the thirty-day reporting deadline had passed. Yoo\u2019s letters were claims within the meaning of the policy because they asserted that Re/Max was liable for negligence and fraud, threatened suit, requested mediation, and included a copy of a civil complaint for damages; they therefore constituted written demands for money or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The policy is neither inconsistent nor ambiguous in limiting coverage to claims reported as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty days after notice to the insured. <em>See Pac. Emp'rs Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 1348, 270 Cal.Rptr. 779, 781-83 (1990). Maxum did not waive the thirty-day reporting requirement by failing to mention it when Maxum denied Re/Max\u2019s claim, especially given that Maxum expressly stated it did not intend to \u201cwaive any other rights or privileges under the terms and conditions of [the] policy,\u201d and that Maxum did not know at the time that Re/Max had been on notice of Yoo\u2019s claim since early March. <em>See Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619, 635-36 (1995). Re/Max\u2019s argument based on equitable estoppel also fails because Re/Max has not presented any evidence that Maxum induced Re/Max\u2019s belated reporting or that Re/Max relied to its detriment on Maxum\u2019s initial ground for denial. <em>See id. </em>at 637-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Finally, because Re/Max raised the equitable excuse doctrine and the notice-prejudice rule for the first time in its reply brief, these arguments have been waived. <em>See Liberal v. Estrada, </em>632 F.3d 1064, 1072 n. 6 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Eberle v. City of Anaheim, </em>901 F.2d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
