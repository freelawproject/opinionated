R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Arman Arakelyan, a native and citizen of Armenia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, including credibility findings. <em>Tekle v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008). We grant the petition for review and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the inconsistencies the BIA identified between Arakelyan\u2019s testimony and his documentary evidence regarding the closure of his business and the year his nonprofit joined an opposition alliance do not go to the heart of his claim. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1106, 1108-09 (9th Cir.2006) (inconsistencies in who paid bribe to secure petitioner\u2019s release and number of times petitioner transported protesters did not support adverse credibility finding). Accordingly, we remand Arakelyan\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims on an open record for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Soto-Olarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">We grant Arakelyan\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as attorney of record. The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect that Arakelyan is proceeding pro se. The Clerk shall serve this order on Arakelyan at the address provided in counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw: 1011 Palmer Ave. # 23, Glendale, CA 91205.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
