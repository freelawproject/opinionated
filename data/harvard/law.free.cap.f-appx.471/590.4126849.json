Sousa appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order dismissing on the basis of the applicable statute of limitations his action alleging violations of the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Ventura Mobilehome Cmtys. Owners Ass\u2019n v. City of San Buenaventura, </em>371 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir. 2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">The district court properly concluded that Sousa\u2019s action was barred by the applicable four-year limitations period because Sousa filed it almost ten years after learning that defendant had allegedly miscalculated his seniority date based on his absence for military service. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(a) (setting forth four-year statute of limitation for civil actions arising under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990); <em>Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981) (per curiam) (claim accrues at \u201cthe time of the <em>discriminatory act, </em>not the point at which the <em>consequences </em>of the act become painful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">We do not consider issues and arguments that Sousa raises for the first time on appeal. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">Issues not expressly addressed in Sousa\u2019s opening brief are deemed waived. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">Sousa\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AoVn\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
