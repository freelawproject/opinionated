Reaves appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motions for a stay and to alter or amend the court\u2019s prior order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) civil rights action<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and granting the motions for attorney\u2019s fees filed by several Defendants. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Reaves v. Richardson, </em>No. 4:09-cv-00820-TLW-SVH, 2011 WL 5321013 (D.S.C. Nov. 3, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\"> Because Reaves filed his motion for reconsideration of the court's order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action within the twenty-eight-day time limit for motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), we treat the motion as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment. <em>Katyle v.
