We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-24\">Gwinn contends that the district court abused its discretion by declining to reduce his sentence based on the retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered penalties for crack cocaine offenses. The district court correctly concluded that Gwinn is not eligible for a sentence reduction because he is a career offender who was sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Wesson, </em>583 F.3d 728, 731 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-25\">To the extent that Gwinn raises additional claims to support his request for a sentence reduction, those claims are not cognizable in a motion under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-26\">We decline to consider arguments raised by Gwinn for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>472 F.3d 662, 668 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AHq\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
