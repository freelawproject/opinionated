The Honorable Roger J. Miner, originally a member of the panel, died on February 18, 2012. The two remaining members of the panel, who are in agreement, have determined the matter. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d); 2d Cir. IOP E(b); <em>United States v. Desimone, </em>140 F.3d 457 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-9\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Petitioner Guang Ze Lin, a native and citizen of China, seeks review of a February 2, 2011, order of the BIA affirming the January 20, 2009, decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Philip L. Morace denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Guang Ze Lin, </em>No. A094 934 263 (B.I.A. Feb. 2, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A094 934 263 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 20, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">Lin challenges the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, arguing that he was credible regarding his past harm arising from his practice of Christianity. For asylum applications, such as this one, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d and inconsistencies in his or - her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2006). In this case, inconsistencies and omissions in Lin\u2019s statements support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (providing that, for purposes of analyzing a credibility determination, \u201c[a]n inconsistency and an omission are ... functionally equivalent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">As the IJ found, Lin did not mention any past mistreatment as a Christian during his March 2007 credible fear interview. Indeed, during that interview he stated that he was a Buddhist. The IJ reasonably rejected Lin\u2019s explanation that he described himself as a Buddhist as he had not been baptized at the time of that inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>view, because in his asylum application, he stated that he became a Christian in December 2005. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cA petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be <em>compelled </em>to credit his testimony.\u201d (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted)). Additionally, as the IJ noted, while Lin testified that after he was released from detention government officials searched his house for Bibles, he did not mention that event in his affidavit in support of his asylum application. Together, the omissions and inconsistencies in Lin\u2019s statements provide substantial evidence for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Lin\u2019s argument that the IJ improperly speculated about the plausibility of his November 2006 arrest on rape charges and subsequent escape in making the adverse credibility determination is misplaced as the IJ, in fact, found that Lin\u2019s testimony about the November 2006 events was credible. Lin does not otherwise challenge the agency\u2019s denial of relief based on his allegations of persecution stemming from the false charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Because Lin\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based on his practice of Christianity all rely on the same factual predicate, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination forecloses all relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-56 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
