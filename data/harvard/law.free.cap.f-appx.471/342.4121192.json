Lowe, Jr., alleging constitutional violations in connection with a revocation of Hampton\u2019s parole and denial of a rehearing. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and dismissed the suit. The court also denied Hampton leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith for the reasons set out in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Hampton now moves this court for leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Hampton\u2019s motion constitutes a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cWhen the prisoner opts to challenge the certification decision, the motion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Neither Hampton\u2019s IFP motion nor his supporting brief addresses in any meaningful way the district court\u2019s certification decision, the summary judgment ruling, or the merits of his claims. He makes only a conclusory assertion that he is appealing in good faith. Accordingly, Hampton has failed to address the district court\u2019s certification reasons and to show that his proposed appeal raises a nonfrivolous issue, as he is required to do. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Therefore, Hampton\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">This court\u2019s dismissal of Hampton\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Hampton is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
