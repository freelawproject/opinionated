We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2008), except to the extent that deference is owed to the BIA\u2019s determination of the governing statutes and regulations, <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). We review factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Tellez-Gareia\u2019s withholding of removal claim because Tellez-Garcia failed to establish the harm he suffered, or fears, from criminal gangs in Mexico is on account of his membership in a particular social group. <em>See id. </em>at 856 (evidence supported conclusion that gang victimized the petitioner for economic and personal reasons rather than on account of a protected ground); <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAsylum generally is not available to victims of civil strife, unless they are singled out on account of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>protected ground.\u201d); <em>see also Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, Tellez-Garcia\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
