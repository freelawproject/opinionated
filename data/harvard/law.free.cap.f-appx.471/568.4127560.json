R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b598-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">Manjinder Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>1271, 1274 (9th Cir.2007), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies within Singh\u2019s testimony and between his testimony and a doctor\u2019s letter regarding the treatment he received after his arrest. <em>See id. </em>at 1275 (inconsistencies regarding details of abduction went to the heart of the claim). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings related to Singh\u2019s identity, including discrepancies regarding Singh\u2019s birthdate, age, and father\u2019s name. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding adverse credibility finding where inconsistencies went to key elements of the asylum claim, including identity). Singh\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies and discrepancies do not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). Further, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the IJ\u2019s negative assessment of Singh\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cspecial deference\u201d given to credibility determinations that are based on demeanor). In the absence of credible testimony, Singh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any evidence that shows it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
