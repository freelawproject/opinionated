We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-24\">Valle\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have conducted an independent review of each of the issues for which the district court granted a certificate of appealability, and we conclude that there are no arguable grounds for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-25\">The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the trial court committed harmless error by leaving out the \u201cdistinctively worse\u201d element of the \u201cplanning and sophistication\u201d aggravating factor jury instruction was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-26\">The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Valle\u2019s upper-term and consecutive sentences did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 U.S. 160, 163-64, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517 (2009); <em>Blakely v.
