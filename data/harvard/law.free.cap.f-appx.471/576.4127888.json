We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). We review for clear error the Tax Court\u2019s finding of fraud, <em>Laurins v. Comm\u2019r, </em>889 F.2d 910, 913 (9th Cir.1989), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-21\">The Tax Court did not clearly err in concluding that Robleto\u2019s failure to file his federal income tax return in 2003 was based on the same fraudulent intent that led him to file erroneous returns in 2000, 2001, and 2002 because there was clear and convincing evidence that, during all four years, Robleto engaged in a pattern of conduct that constituted badges of fraud. <em>See id. </em>(setting forth circumstantial evidence, or badges of fraud, from which court can infer fraudulent intent in light of the entire record); <em>see also Bradford v. Comm\u2019r, </em>796 F.2d 303, 308 (9th Cir.1986) (fraud shown where taxpayer, among other things, consistently failed to file tax returns, make estimated payments, maintain adequate business records, report substantial business income, or cooperate with the revenue agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-22\">Robleto\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A1m\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
