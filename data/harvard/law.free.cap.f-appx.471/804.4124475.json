Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>571 F.3d 935, 939 (9th Cir.2009). \u2018\u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the district court, in making a discretionary ruling, relies upon an improper factor, omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight, or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parra v. Bashas\u2019, Inc., </em>536 F.3d 975, 977-78 (9th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">Plaintiff argues that the district court gave too little weight to evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>that Aerotek required all recruiters to complete the same training and obey the same policies, and too much weight to testimony that Aerotek recruiters\u2019 actual work activities varied from recruiter to recruiter. Our cases, however, required the district court to \u201cmake a factual determination as to whether class members are <em>actually </em>performing similar duties.\u201d <em>In re Wells Fargo Home Mortg. Overtime Pay Litig., </em>571 F.3d 953, 959 (9th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks removed; emphasis added), <em>see also Mario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>639 F.3d 942, 948 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Vinole, </em>571 F.3d at 946-47. Evidence of corporate policies and training programs are relevant to this determination, but are not dispositive, for the obvious reason that training and policies may not reflect what the class members actually do. <em>Mario, </em>639 F.3d at 948; <em>Wells Fargo, </em>571 F.3d at 958-59; <em>Vinole, </em>571 F.3d at 946-47. In this case, the district court properly considered both evidence of uniform policies and evidence of diverse work activities. The work activity evidence was important because it showed variations in recruiters\u2019 candidate sourcing techniques, interview styles, authority to recommend candidates, and relationship with supervisors, all of which were relevant to the Administrative Exemption factors in California Industrial Wage Commission\u2019s Wage Order No. 4-2001, \u00a7 1(A)(2), codified at California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 11040. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to afford more weight to this evidence than to the uniform policy evidence was not a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Plaintiffs fault the district court for failing to apply certain federal Fair Labor Standards Act regulations incorporated by reference into Wage Order 4-2001, \u00a7 1(A)(2)(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These regulations establish that routine screening of job applicants according to predetermined criteria does not require \u201cdiscretion and independent judgment,\u201d but that the selection of qualified candidates does. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.207(c)(5) (2001). Since the district court found that some Aerotek recruiters had more authority to select and recommend candidates than others, the regulations do nothing to aid Plaintiffs\u2019 case. To the contrary, the regulations support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiffs\u2019 lack of discretion claim is not well-suited to classwide adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Plaintiffs also argue that the district court\u2019s order failed to explicitly consider whether the variations in recruiter discretion the district court identified concerned \u201cmatters of significance.\u201d <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. 541.207(a) (2001). Plaintiffs, however, give no reason to doubt that they did. The variations the district court found in recruiters\u2019 sourcing techniques, interview styles, and recommendation of candidates, at the very least, were matters of significance to Aerotek\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Similarly, Plaintiffs observe that their claims required an inquiry into whether recruiters \u201cexecute under only general supervision\u201d either \u201cspecial assignments and tasks\u201d or \u201cwork along specialized or technical lines.\u201d Wage Order 4-2001 \u00a7 l(A)(2)(d)-(e). The district court analyzed the questions arising from the \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d component and concluded that they were not predominately common, but it didn\u2019t analyze the nature of the questions raised by the \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cspe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>cialized\u201d work component. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cspecialized\u201d work requirement raised common questions, however, we are not persuaded that those common questions predominated over the individual questions arising from variations in the way Aerotek supervised its recruiters, let alone that they predominated over the individual questions raised by Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as a whole. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s omission of a special/specialized analysis from its order did not \u201comit[] consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight.\u201d <em>Vinole, </em>571 F.3d at 939.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have certified a limited class action to adjudicate Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that class members do not perform \u201coffice or non-manual work directly related to management policies or general business operations.\u201d <em>See </em>Wage Order 4-2001 \u00a7 l(A)(2)(a)(I); Fed. R. of Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (\u2018When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.\u201d). The district court did find that this theory raised predominately common questions, but the nature of that commonality was not in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. Rather, it found that all class members were engaged in \u201cmeeting the needs of Aerotek\u2019s customer companies,\u201d a role that is \u201cdirectly related to ... [Aerotek\u2019s] general business operations,\u201d and therefore exempt. Wage Order 4-2001 \u00a7 l(A)(2)(a)(I). The district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Plaintiffs\u2019 losing theory was not an \u201cappropriate\u201d basis for a Rule 23(c)(4) class action, and Plaintiffs in any case can\u2019t have been prejudiced by the inability to pursue that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-5\">. Wage Order 4-2001 incorporates the federal regulations effective as of the issuance of the Wage Order in 2001. Wage Order 4-2001 \u00a7 1(A)(2)(f). The district court mistakenly quoted from the 2004 federal regulations instead of the applicable 2001 version. The two versions are similar but not identical. <em>Compare </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202(c) (2004) to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.207(a), (e)(l)-(2) (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">. Additionally, Plaintiffs could not have prevailed merely by showing that they didn\u2019t do specialized or special work. Aerotek was entitled to classify them as exempt on the alternate grounds that they \"regularly and directly assisted] a proprietor, or an employee employed in a bona fide executive or administrative capacity.\" Wage Order # 4-2001 \u00a7 1 (A)(2)(c) \u2014 (e) (setting out three alternative conditions which, in contrast to conditions (a),(b),(f), and (g), are stated in the disjunctive). Accordingly, the class can\u2019t have been harmed by the district court\u2019s decision not to certify a class to explore Plaintiffs specialized/special theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
