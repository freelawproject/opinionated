Henry Ekweani and Ijeamaka Ekweani appeal pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging Fourth Amendment and state law violations arising from their arrests. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the Ekweanis\u2019 false arrest claims because defendants had probable cause to arrest the Ekweanis for harassment after they placed numerous calls in two hours to 911 and the sheriffs department\u2019s non-emergency number to demand the return of their missing keys, despite being repeatedly warned that continuing to call 911 regarding their keys could lead to their arrest. <em>See Lassiter v. City of Bremerton, </em>556 F.3d 1049, 1053 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge are sufficient to cause a reasonably prudent person to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>lieve that a crime has been committed.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-2921 (a person commits harassment if, with knowledge that he is harassing another person, he communicates with another person by telephone in a manner that harasses that person).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the Ekweanis\u2019 excessive force claims because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Ekweanis, defendant Campbell\u2019s use of force in arresting and detaining Henry Ekweani was reasonable. <em>See Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (\u201cThe calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We affirm the grant of summary judgment on the Ekweanis\u2019 state law claims for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order entered on May 24, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The Ekweanis\u2019 remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
