She argues that the district court committed errors at trial, such as improperly excluding evidence, and that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Because Mayard has not provided a trial transcript, this court cannot rule on the issues she has raised on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); <em>Schmid v. United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners of Am., </em>827 F.2d 384, 386 (8th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (where pro se appellant did not order transcript of trial proceedings as required by Rule 10(b), court could not rule on issues concerning judge\u2019s alleged bias, exclusion and admission of evidence, and argument that jury verdict was against weight of evidence).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\">. The Honorable John R. Tunheim, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ASr\">. We note, however, that the available information in the record \u2014 including the district court\u2019s order denying Mayard\u2019s motion for a new trial \u2014 strongly suggests that there is no merit to Mayard\u2019s arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
