Rodriquez, </em>553 U.S. 377, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008). When the case was most recently before us, the government argued for the first time on appeal that Rodriquez\u2019s 1986 California conviction for being under the influence of cocaine and heroin qualified as a prior drug offense within the meaning of the Washington State recidivist statute. The government said that Rodriquez\u2019s criminal record, therefore, subjected him to the fifteen-year minimum sentence under the federal Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We remanded for the district court to consider this argument in the first instance. <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>376 Fed.Appx. 748 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Rodriquez now appeals from the district court\u2019s ruling that his 1986 conviction falls under Washington\u2019s recidivist statute and, therefore, all of his three 1995 Washington convictions for delivering a controlled substance were \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under ACCA. The district court sentenced Rodriquez to the fifteen-year minimum required by that statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The district court did not err. On its face, Washington\u2019s recidivist statute applies whenever the defendant has a prior conviction \u201cunder any statute of the United States or of any state relating to narcotic drugs----\u201d Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 69.50.408. Rodriquez primarily argues that his 1986 California conviction should not count because it was only a misdemeanor involving conduct that would not be criminal in Washington. Even if this is true, however, the California conviction \u201crelate[s] to narcotic drugs\u201d and is included by the plain language of Washington\u2019s recidivist statute. <em>See id. </em>Because of the prior California conviction, each of Rodriquez\u2019s three 1995 Washington convictions was subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.50.401, 69.50.408, 9A.20.021(l)(c). This means that they were \u201cserious drug crimes\u201d under ACCA and triggered the fifteen-year minimum. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
