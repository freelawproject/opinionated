We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">In his motion to reopen, Odumakinde provided evidence that there has been an escalation of violence since the time of the merits hearing against his family members and fellow churchgoers in Nigeria because of their Christian religion, including that Muslim extremists doused Odumakinde\u2019s brother with gasoline in an attempt to light him on fire, and cut his head with a machete. We conclude the BIA abused its discretion in denying Odumakinde\u2019s motion to reopen where he provided sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in Nigeria such that he now has a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945-48 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand to the BIA with instructions to reopen. <em>See id. </em>at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b747-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
