Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, including questions pertaining to our own jurisdiction. <em>Tamang v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Ruiz-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1219, 1221 (9th Cir.2004). We dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review Grigoryan\u2019s contention that his untimely asylum application is excused by extraordinary circumstances based on his depression and that he filed his asylum application within a reasonable period of time because it would require us to resolve disputed facts regarding the severity and duration of his illness. <em>See Tamang, </em>598 F.3d at 1088-89 (the court\u2019s jurisdiction extends to questions involving the application of law to undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">We also lack jurisdiction to reach Grigoryan\u2019s unexhausted contention that the IJ failed in her duty to develop the record. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Grigoryan\u2019s contention that the BIA applied the wrong standard of review is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
