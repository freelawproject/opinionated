We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">The district court granted summary judgment because it determined that Lomeli was not deliberately indifferent to Billups\u2019 safety. However, Billups submitted evidence that he and his cellmate told Lomeli that there was a threat to Billups\u2019 safety and that Billups told Lomeli that it could get \u201cdangerous\u201d if Billups was not moved to a different cell. Billups also submitted evidence that the only option Lomeli gave him was to continue insisting on a cell change and that Lomeli threatened to place him in administrative segregation if he continued to violate orders to return to his cell. This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Billups, creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Lomeli acted with deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Berg v. Kincheloe, </em>794 F.2d 457, 460 (9th Cir.1986) (prison officials liable under \u00a7 1983 if they act with deliberate indifference to the prisoner\u2019s plight). Moreover, Lomeli is not entitled to qualified immunity because, at the time of the events at issue, the law was clearly established that the deliberate indifference standard \u201cdoes not require that the guard or official believe to a moral certainty that one inmate intends to attack another at a given place at a time certain before that officer is obligated to take steps to prevent such an assault.\u201d <em>Berg, </em>794 F.2d at 459 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we reverse summary judgment on Billups\u2019 deliberate indifference claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-23\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b810-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
