On June 15, 2006, Griffin was sentenced to sixty-three months imprisonment for one count of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute. On March 6, 2009, that sentence was reduced to the statutory mandatory minimum of sixty months imprisonment. On August 22, 2011, Griffin filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking a further reduction in his sentence. On November 10, 2011, the district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-23\">On appeal, Griffin argues that a reduction in his sentence is warranted in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Our precedent, however, makes it clear that a defendant cannot obtain a sentence reduction under Section 3582(c)(2) if his sentence is already at the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010). Griffin also asserts that the district court should have granted his Section 3582(c)(2) motion by affording him safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). Our precedent also forecloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>this suggestion. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>613 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding that \u201cthe safety-valve is inapplicable to sentence-modification proceedings\u201d under Section 3582(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
