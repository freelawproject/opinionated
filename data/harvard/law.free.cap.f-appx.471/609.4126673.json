We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Knievel v. ESPN, </em>393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir.2005), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">The district court properly dismissed Boyd\u2019s Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims because Boyd failed to allege that his injuries were proximately caused by the defendants\u2019 conduct under an official city policy, custom, practice, or procedure. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690 &amp; n. 55, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (setting forth requirements for a \u00a7 1983 claim of municipal liability and stating that suits against officers in their official capacity are another way of pleading an action against the entity).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">The district court properly dismissed Boyd\u2019s APA claim because Boyd failed to allege that the defendants were, or acted as, federal actors. <em>See Gilliam v. Miller, </em>973 F.2d 760, 764 (9th Cir.1992) (test to determine if a state agency is acting as a federal actor for purposes of being subject to the APA).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">Boyd\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-18\">Boyd\u2019s motion for relief from judgment is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"A5q\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
