Shamburger appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>indifference to his serious medical needs. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, </em>534 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because Shamburger failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Nurse Risenhoover knowingly failed to refer Shamburger to a doctor for, or otherwise treat, his back pain and related symptoms. <em>See id. </em>at 1057 (prison officials act with deliberate indifference only if they know of and consciously disregard an excessive risk to an inmate\u2019s health). Shamburger\u2019s disagreement with defendant\u2019s chosen course of treatment is not sufficient to constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See id. </em>at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Denial of Shamburger\u2019s motion for appointment of a medical expert was not an abuse of discretion because he failed to establish that his sole claim against one defendant involved scientific evidence or complex issues. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Shamburger\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because he failed to establish exceptional circumstances. <em>See Palmer v. Valdez, </em>560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth standard of review and \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Shamburger\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
