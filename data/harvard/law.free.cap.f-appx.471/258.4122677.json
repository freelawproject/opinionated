Litanya argues that he presented evidence of past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution by the Mungiki sect of Kenya that is both subjectively and objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The BIA dismissed Litanya\u2019s asylum application as untimely and, in the alternative, addressed the merits of the asylum application and denied withholding of removal. As Litanya concedes, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision agreeing with the IJ\u2019s assessment of facts and circumstances affecting the timeliness of Litanya\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 595-96 &amp; n. 31 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">To the extent that the BIA alternatively addressed the merits of Litanya\u2019s claim for asylum and denied withholding of removal, we will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual findings if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Silwany-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>975 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). The Attorney General may grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b); <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1135. \u201cThe applicant may qualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). To prevail on a claim of past persecution, an alien must establish that he suffered persecution at the hands of the \u201cgovernment or forces that a government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 113 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien must demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution, and that fear must be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 307 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cPersecution\u201d is defined as the \u201cinfliction of suffering or harm, under government sanction, upon persons who differ in a way regarded as offensive (e.g., race, religion, political opinion, etc.), in a manner condemned by civilized governments.\u201d <em>Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 583 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination that \u201cthe Kenyan government previously outlawed the Mungiki and other militia groups\u201d and that the Kenyan government \u201ccurrently actively targets the Mungiki for the actions they previously committed against citizens.\u201d We cannot conclude that the Kenyan government is unwilling or unable to control the Mungiki. <em>See Adebisi v. INS, </em>952 F.2d 910, 914 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also Kamau v. Holder, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 57, 59 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Omondi v. Holder, </em>332 Fed.Appx. 197, 199 (5th Cir.2009). Litanya has failed to show that the evidence compelled a conclusion other than that reached by the IJ and BIA. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Litanya has abandoned any challenge to the denial of relief under the CAT by failing to argue the issue in his petition for review. See <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
