California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Hernandez has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Hernandez\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Hernandez\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
