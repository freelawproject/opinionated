He argues that his conviction and sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) must be vacated because he does not have a prior conviction that is an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and he challenges a 12-level increase in his offense level, arguing that the Texas conviction used to enhance his sentence is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). He contends that he was wrongly assessed criminal history points for offenses committed more than ten years prior to the instant offense. Finally, he argues that the district court erred by citing conduct for which he was not prosecuted in support of its decision to deny a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">Because Haddad did not challenge his conviction and sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in the district court, his arguments are reviewed for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 133-34, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>No plain error occurred as \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense of illegal reentry. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Haddad has waived any argument based on the contention that the conviction supporting his sentence under \u00a7 1326(b) predates the September 30, 1996, effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act. <em>See United States v. Lindell, </em>881 F.2d 1313, 1325 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The district court did not err in imposing an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Haddad\u2019s Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance is considered a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Marban-Calderon, </em>631 F.3d 210, 212-13 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 129, 181 L.Ed.2d 50 (2011). The sentencing court also did not err in assessing criminal history points for 1996 and 1998 misdemeanor convictions as it is undisputed that they occurred within ten years of Haddad\u2019s unauthorized return to this country. <em>See United States v. Santanar-Castellano, </em>74 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Vargas-Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 345, 349 (5th Cir.2005). We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of a downward departure in this case as Haddad has identified no record evidence \u201cindicating that the district court held an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
