His sentence was. enhanced under the career offender Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because the district court determined, inter alia, that he had at least two prior felony convictions of either a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2. He was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment for count one and 240 months of imprisonment for count three and five years of supervised release for count one and three years of supervised release for count three, all to run concurrently. Holston challenges his sentence, arguing that his 2003 Texas offense of evading arrest or detention using a vehicle in violation of Section 38.04(a) and (b)(1) of the Texas Penal Code was not a crime of violence. The Government moves for summary affirmance, or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-21\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A crime of violence is defined as, inter alia, \u201cany offense ... that ... is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-22\">In <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 532-33, 536 (5th Cir.2009), we held that a \u00a7 38.04(b)(1) offense is a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because \u201cfleeing by vehicle poses a serious risk of injury to others.\u201d Our treatment of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is interchangeable with our treatment of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>635 F.3d 774, 776 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 399, 181 L.Ed.2d 256 (2011). \u201cIt is a firm rule of this circuit that in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court, a panel cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>466 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, absent any change in the law, <em>Harrimon </em>forecloses Holston\u2019s contention that his offense was not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Holston nonetheless argues that <em>Harrimon </em>was incorrectly decided since we employed the categorical approach; he argues that we should instead consider the defendant\u2019s actual conduct in determining whether an offense is a crime of violence. This argument is foreclosed. <em>See Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 181 S.Ct. 2267, 2272, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011); <em>Moore, </em>635 F.3d at 776; <em>Burge, </em>187 F.3d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In addition, Holston argues that the holding in <em>Harrimon </em>should be reconsidered because the Supreme Court in <em>Sykes </em>left open the question whether an offense is a violent felony if the statute in which the offense is contained imposes different penalties depending on the degree of risk posed by the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2277. Because Holston was convicted only of evading arrest or detention by using a vehicle, <em>see </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 38.04(b)(1) (2003), he argues that the elements of his offense did not include any conduct that posed a serious potential risk of harm to another. We remain bound by <em>Harrimon. See Burge, </em>187 F.3d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and, in the alterative, for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
