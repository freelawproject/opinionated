R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Wayne H. Ford appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction his action alleging that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) violated his constitutional rights by failing to pay him interest on an award of retroactive veterans\u2019 disability benefits. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Coyle v. P.T. Garuda Indonesia, </em>363 F.3d 979, 984 n. 7 (9th Cir.2004) (subject matter jurisdiction dismissal); <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) dismissal). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The district court properly dismissed Ford\u2019s action because the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over the VA\u2019s decision regarding the provision of veterans\u2019 benefits, even when couched as a constitutional claim. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a) (VA decides all issues under any law affecting the provision of benefits to veterans); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7104(a) (Board of Veterans Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over VA\u2019s benefits decisions); <em>Tietjen v. U.S. Veterans Admin., </em>884 F.2d 514, 515 (9th Cir.1989) (order) (affirming dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where veteran\u2019s due process claim related to reduced disability benefits because the substance of the claim was the allocation of veterans benefits, not a challenge to the constitutionality of legislation governing VA benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">However, Ford\u2019s claims should have been dismissed without prejudice. <em>See Kelly v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc., </em>377 F.3d 1034, 1036 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore affirm dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but remand with instructions for the district court to enter judgment of dismissal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">Ford\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">Ford\u2019s motion to submit additional opinions is construed as a citation of supplemental authorities under Fed. RApp. P. 28(j), and the cases are duly noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-21\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AeY\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
