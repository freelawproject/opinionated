He was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Despite the waiver, he appealed. The government has moved to enforce the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1328 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">In evaluating a motion to enforce a waiver, we consider: \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Mr. Carr\u2019s lawyer has filed a response in which he says that he \u201ccannot contest the [government\u2019s] [m]otion.\u201d Resp. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Our independent review confirms that the proposed issue for appeal (identified in Mr. Carr\u2019s docketing statement as an appeal of his sentence) falls within the scope of the waiver. The plea agreement clearly sets forth the waiver and states that it was knowing and voluntary, and the district court discussed the waiver and voluntariness at the plea hearing. There is no contradictory evidence indicating that Mr. Carr did not knowingly and voluntarily accept the waiver. Finally, there is no indication that enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice as defined in <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The motion to enforce is GRANTED and this matter is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b853-15\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
