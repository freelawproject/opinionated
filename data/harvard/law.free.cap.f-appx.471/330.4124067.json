Burgos-Rodriguez argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe because the district court (1) did not consider his benign motive for illegally reentering the country, (2) gave too much weight to his remote criminal convictions, and (3) did not consider the unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendants like himself and defendants who are convicted in districts with fast-track sentencing programs. He further contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the drug guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If there is no error or the error is harmless, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">Burgos-Rodriguez does not challenge the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, and his substantive reasonableness arguments are unavailing. When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, we generally will infer that the district court considered all of the fair sentencing factors set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The record reflects that the district court expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as Burgos-Rodriguez\u2019s arguments, for mitigating his sentence but expressly overruled his arguments and concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d considering the circumstances of the case. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we decline Burgos-Rodriguez\u2019s invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">As he concedes, Burgos-Rodriguez\u2019s fast-track argument is currently foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008). His empirical data argument is also foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mondragon-Santi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>ago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67 n. 7. Furthermore, Burgos-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence, which is at the bottom of the guidelines range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766 (5th Cir.2008). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Burgos-Rodriguez cannot demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines 57-month prison term. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
