On appeal, McGee argues that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">McGee urges us to set aside his sentence as proeedurally unreasonable for three different reasons. None has merit. First, McGee argues that the district court made an error in calculating the advisory guidelines range. Specifically, he asserts that the district court erred in finding that the tackle box that he filled with sand and that he placed on the teller\u2019s desk was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2). Although he acknowledges that he portrayed the box as a bomb, he insists that it was not a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">We reject this argument because under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2), an object is a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d if \u201cthe defendant used [it] in a manner that created the impression that [it] was an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 cmt. n. 2 (2010). Here, in light of McGee\u2019s statement to the bank teller that the box could \u201cgo off,\u201d in which case she would be \u201cvisiting Martin Luther King,\u201d we cannot say that the district court erred in finding that the box was a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Second, McGee asserts that the district court did not provide a sufficient explanation for its decision to vary upward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the district court stated that it considered all of the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court also discussed what it said was a \u201ctruly astounding\u201d criminal history, and it indicated that an upward variance was warranted because of the risk of recidivism. This brief explanation, in our view, is \u201ccomplete enough to allow meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Third, McGee asserts that the district court failed to provide notice of its intent to vary upward. He suggests that because a defendant\u2019s criminal history is a ground for an upward departure, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a), notice was required. McGee emphasizes that under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, a district court is generally required to provide notice that it is \u201ccontemplating ... a departure.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). This argument fails because the Supreme Court has held that the notice requirement under Rule 32 does not extend to variances. <em>See Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 715-16, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2203, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Finally, McGee argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. We examine the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 598, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under that standard, we may vacate a sentence only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not \u2014 it bears repeating \u2014 set aside a sentence merely because we would have decided that another one is more appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">McGee argues that the district court erred in varying upward based on his criminal history. McGee suggests that the guidelines adequately accounted for that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>and he emphasizes that the government recommended a sentence within the guidelines range. He also asserts that the district court improperly discounted his acceptance of responsibility, his age, and his mental and physical health. However, bearing in mind the deference that we must accord to the sentencing decisions of the district courts, we cannot say that the sentence here is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">As the district court observed, McGee has an extensive criminal history. The pre-sentence investigation report indicates that McGee had at least thirty prior convictions. In fact, he committed the offense that gave rise to this prosecution while he was on probation as part of five different sentences. Beyond that, a significant number of McGee\u2019s prior convictions did not result in any criminal history points. Even so, he accumulated twenty-four points, considerably more than the thirteen he needed in order to be placed in criminal history category VI. In view of all of this, we cannot say that \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment\u201d in concluding that a five-month variance was needed in order to reflect McGee\u2019s criminal history and the risk of recidivism. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">.
