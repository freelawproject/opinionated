On appeal, Buitre argues his trial counsel was ineffective. Specifically, Buitre claims trial counsel misinformed him about the advisory guideline range, and failed to correct a serious flaw in the government\u2019s memorandum of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Ordinarily, we would not consider an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>United States v. McKenna, </em>327 F.3d 830, 845 (9th Cir.2003). However, the record is sufficiently developed to permit review and determination of the issue. <em>United States v. Daychild, </em>357 F.3d 1082, 1095 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Buitre claims that trial counsel misinformed him and failed to correct errors in the government\u2019s memorandum of plea. Additionally, a scrivener\u2019s error in the government\u2019s \u201cno-plea memo\u201d erroneously referred to a charge of bank robbery. This unusual error had no impact on the outcome of Buitre\u2019s case. Buitre received the statutory minimum sentence of five years for receipt of child pornography. He was informed of the statutory minimum in the draft plea agreement. Therefore, whatever the claimed misrepresentations, Buitre cannot establish prejudice, and his appeal is denied. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Further, a defense counsel\u2019s inaccurate prediction of sentence, without more, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Doganiere v. United States, </em>914 F.2d 165, 168 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The parties agree, however, that Buitre\u2019s conviction of possession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) should be vacated. The docket notation of the change-of-plea hearing states incorrectly that Buitre pled guilty to a charge for receipt of child pornography and also to a charge for possession of child pornography. In fact, Buitre pled only to the receipt charge. Even had Buitre pled to both charges, possession is a lesser included charge of receipt. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>519 F.3d 940, 947-48 (9th Cir.2008). Thus, even if Buitre had pled guilty to both charges, the district court should have vacated the lesser charge and entered final judgment of conviction only on the greater charge \u2014 receipt. <em>United States v. Maier, </em>646 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Therefore, we reject Buitre\u2019s ineffective assistance appeal and AFFIRM his conviction for receipt of child pornography and his five year sentence. However, we REMAND with instructions to vacate the conviction and sentence for possession of child pornography.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b805-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
