We affirm, as Brown\u2019s applicable Guidelines range was not lowered by the amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (eligibility for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by amendment that lowers applicable Guidelines range); <em>United States v. Tolliver, </em>570 F.3d 1062, 1066-67 (8th Cir.2009) (where applicable Guidelines range was not lowered by amendment, district court lacked authority to reduce sentence). To the extent Brown has raised arguments that are not based on a Guidelines amendment, those arguments are not properly raised in a section 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-22\">The judgment is affirmed.
