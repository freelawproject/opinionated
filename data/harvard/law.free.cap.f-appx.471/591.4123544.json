Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">1. We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Petitioner\u2019s application for cancellation of removal because her 1998 conviction for welfare fraud under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.Code \u00a7 10980 is an aggravated felony covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Any crime that involves fraud or deceit where the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000 is an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Petitioner concedes that her crime involved fraud, and Petitioner agreed in 1998 to pay $18,594 in restitution as part of her probation. While Petitioner\u2019s conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor in 2007, there is no evidence that the conviction was reduced because the loss to the victim was found to be lower than originally thought. We therefore find that Petitioner\u2019s stipulation to pay restitution proves that the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000. <em>See Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 2303, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">2. We retain jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and CAT protection. <em>See Bromfield v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1071, 1075 (9th Cir.2008). However, Petitioner\u2019s claims fail on the merits. There is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner is ineligible for withholding of removal because she failed to establish a clear probability of future persecution in Mexico. We affirm the denial of Petitioner\u2019s application for CAT protection for similar reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"ANJ\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
