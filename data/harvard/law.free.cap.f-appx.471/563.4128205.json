For reversal, he argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his supervised release, that the court abused its discretion in denying his request to present witnesses at the revocation hearing, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-25\">We reject these arguments. The district court had jurisdiction to revoke Love\u2019s supervised release because the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Love had violated several of his supervised-release conditions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Further, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s request for additional time to obtain witnesses and prepare for the hearing: counsel had stated that morning that Love was prepared to admit the violations; counsel did not indicate upon making the request why he had been unable to prepare, who was needed to testify, or what their testimony would be; and he was able to cross-examine the supervising officer. <em>See United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 513-14 (8th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>1996). Finally, the ineffective-assistance claim is undeveloped and not properly before us. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Love\u2019s appellate motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-17\">.
