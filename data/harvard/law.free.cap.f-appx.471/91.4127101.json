The District Court issued an order directing Piekering-George to complete an in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) application or pay the filing fee within 21 days, warning that failure to do so would result in dismissal of the case (the \u201cfee order\u201d). Piekering-George failed to comply with the fee order, and the District Court dismissed the case without prejudice by order entered July 1, 2010. On August 23, 2010, Piekering-George filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that he did not receive the fee order. The case was reassigned to Judge Leonard P. Stark on August 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-21\">In January 2011, Piekering-George filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court, complaining about the District Court\u2019s \u201cfailure to respond\u201d to his motion for reconsideration. Subsequent to the filing of his mandamus petition, the District Court granted Pickering-George\u2019s motion for reconsideration, permitting him to pay the filing fee or submit an IFP application within 21 days. Piekering-George complied with that order and filed an IFP application. The District Court granted that application by order entered March 4, 2011. Because the District Court has provided the relief that Piekering-George sought in his mandamus petition, we will deny that petition as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
