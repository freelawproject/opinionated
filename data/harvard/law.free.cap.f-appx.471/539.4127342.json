Having conducted de novo review of the record, and having considered the parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, we find no basis to conclude that the district court committed error (1) in dismissing some defendants prior to service pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>see Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999); (2) in dismissing other defendants and claims upon these parties\u2019 motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), <em>see McAdams v. McCord, </em>584 F.3d 1111, 1113 (8th Cir. 2009) ; and (3) in granting summary judgment against Hill on his claims against the remaining defendants, <em>see Schoelch v. Mitchell, </em>625 F.3d 1041, 1045-46 (8th Cir. 2010) (8th Cir.2010). The district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-15\">.
