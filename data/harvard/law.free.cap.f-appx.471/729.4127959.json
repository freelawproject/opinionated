We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo the agency\u2019s application of a statute. <em>Cervantes-Gonzales v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2001). We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-19\">The agency properly determined that Kaur is inadmissible to the United States under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00a9 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act because she made willful misrepresentations at the airport by presenting someone else\u2019s passport and green card as her own, and she failed to timely and voluntarily retract those misrepresentations. <em>See Cervantes-Gonzales, </em>244 F.3d at 1004; <em>cf. Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 759, 772, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988) (whether a misrepresentation is material depends on \u201cwhether it had a natural tendency to influence the decisions of the [INS].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Kaur failed to demonstrate that her uncle mistreated her on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>account of a protected ground. <em>See Ayala v. Holder, </em>640 F.3d 1095, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (even if an asserted social group is cognizable, the petitioner must show she was persecuted on account of her membership in that group). Accordingly, Kaur\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Finally, substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Kaur failed to establish that it is more likely than not she will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government of India. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b760-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
