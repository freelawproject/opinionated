Because the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards and because there is substantial evidence to support the decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">Ms. Roberson applied for SSI in October 2008, alleging that she was disabled because of back problems and blindness in one eye. The Social Security Administration denied her application initially and upon reconsideration. Ms. Roberson then requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Following the hearing, the ALJ found that Ms. Roberson\u2019s impairments were severe but that she nevertheless had sufficient functional capacity to perform the requirements of her previous work \u2014 as a motel housekeeper, kitchen helper, and cashier. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision after the Appeals Council denied Ms. Roberson\u2019s request for review. The district court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner. Ms. Roberson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-23\">Ms. Roberson contends on appeal that (1) the ALJ overestimated her residual functional capacity under step four of the sequential analysis used for evaluation of disability benefit claims; and (2) the ALJ failed to consider her impairments in combination. We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision only to ascertain whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards in evaluating the evidence. <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 447 (5th Cir.2007). We may not re-weigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner, even if the evidence weighs against the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-24\">The ALJ followed the proper sequential analysis in determining Ms. Roberson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>not entitled to SSI. In so doing, she found that Ms. Roberson testified to performing daily activities \u2014 sitting, walking, and doing light household chores for much of the day \u2014 that were not limited to the extent one would expect, given her complaints of disabling pain and weakness. She found further that Ms. Roberson had not received the degree of medical treatment or presented the kind of clinical abnormalities one would expect, were her functioning as limited as she alleged. Although Ms. Roberson\u2019s treating physician noted in April 2009 that she was \u201cdisabled at this time,\u201d such declarations are not determinative, particularly when considered in the light of the clinical findings. <em>See Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 620 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cAmong the opinions by treating doctors that have no special significance are determinations that an applicant is \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work.\u2019 \u201d). Based on our review of the record, the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Next, the ALJ\u2019s decision reflects that she did consider Ms. Roberson\u2019s impairments in combination. The decision references \u201cimpairments\u201d in several places. It also includes a thorough discussion of Ms. Roberson\u2019s medical history and the symptoms of both her back and vision problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Ms. Roberson has submitted to our court, as she did to the district court, medical records not included in the administrative record. We agree with the district court\u2019s ruling that this evidence is not material and thus does not warrant remand. <em>See Latham v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 482, 483 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cFor new evidence to be material, there must exist the reasonable possibility that it would have changed the outcome of the [Commissioner\u2019s] determination.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, Ms. Roberson does not show good cause for not presenting this evidence to the ALJ. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">We conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and resulted from application of the correct legal standards. Accordingly, the decision of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits is</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
