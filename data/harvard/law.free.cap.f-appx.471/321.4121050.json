Harris\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-200 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Harris does not challenge, and has no nonfrivolous basis to challenge, the district court\u2019s determination that he was fired some time before December 2008 and thus his complaint was barred by Texas\u2019s two year statute of limitations. <em>See Whitt v. Stephens Cnty., </em>529 F.3d 278, 282 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe limitations period for a [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 action is determined by the state\u2019s personal injury limitations period, which in Texas is two years.\u201d) (citations omitted). Nor has he shown that he presented to the district court exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 213 (5th Cir.1982). The appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The IFP motion is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
