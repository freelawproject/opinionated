Hurd, a former California state prisoner, appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that defendants violated his constitutional rights. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Jones v. Blanas, </em>893 F.3d 918, 926 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Hurd\u2019s due process and equal protection claims. As to due process, Hurd failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the prison lockdown imposed an \u201catypical and significant hardship on [him] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>see also Hayward v. Procunier, </em>629 F.2d 599, 601-03 (9th Cir.1980) (no due process violation where lockdown instituted for attacks on inmates). As to equal protection, Hurd failed to raise a triable dispute as to whether the race-based security measures were narrowly tailored and implemented to accomplish the compelling government interest of restoring prison security and discipline following the race-based riots and violence. <em>See Johnson v. California, </em>543 U.S. 499, 509-15, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 160 L.Ed.2d 949 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">However, summary judgment on Hurd\u2019s Eighth Amendment lack-of-outdoor-exercise and failure-to-protect claims, and First Amendment retaliation claims was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">As to the lack of outdoor exercise, although segregated outdoor exercise during a lockdown is not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional, <em>see id. </em>(racial segregation in prisons is not unconstitutional if necessary for prison security and discipline), there is a triable dispute as to why segregation was used during the lockdown for some aspects of the modified programming but was not used as a means of providing outdoor exercise for inmates, <em>see Richardson v. Runnels, </em>594 F.3d 666, 672 (9th Cir.2010) (noting that exercise is one of the basic human necessities protected by the Eighth Amendment and that claims involving a prisoner\u2019s right to exercise require a full consideration of context and a fully developed record).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">As to the failure to protect, defendants knew through a confidential informant that Hurd was at risk of being attacked, and there is a triable dispute as to why defendants transferred Hurd to Facility C rather than into administrative segregation. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 842, 848-49, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (inmate\u2019s failure to notify prison officials of risk of harm or concern for safety is not dispositive; whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk may be shown through the \u201cfact that the risk was obvious\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">As to retaliation, there are triable disputes as to (1) whether defendants Price\u2019s and Anti\u2019s threats, the circulation of the program sheet demonstrating that Hurd would have the opportunity to assault an African-American inmate, and the transfer of Hurd to Facility C rather than into administrative segregation were adverse actions; (2) whether these actions were taken because of Hurd\u2019s First Amendment activities of filing complaints, grievances, and legal actions; (3) whether these actions chilled Hurd\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights; and (4) whether the actions reasonably advanced a legitimate correctional goal. <em>See Rhodes v. Robinson, </em>408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>see also Brace v. Ylst, </em>351 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[P]rison officials may not defeat a retaliation claim on summary judgment simply by articulating a general justification for a neutral process, when there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the action was taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">As defendants concede, the district court erred to the extent that it substituted Warden Giurbino for former Warden Gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>cia on claims brought against Garcia in her individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Hurd\u2019s remaining contentions, including those concerning the district court\u2019s discretionary discovery decisions, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We decline to reach the question of qualified immunity. <em>See Richardson, </em>594 F.3d at 672 (question of qualified immunity should be addressed in the first instance by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">We strongly recommend that the district court appoint counsel to represent Hurd on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">This panel retains jurisdiction over any future appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
