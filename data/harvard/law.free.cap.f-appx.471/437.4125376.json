WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Petitioner-Appellant Eric Cook appeals the judgment of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">On November 23, 2003, Petitioner Cook was working as a nursing assistant at Par-ma Community General Hospital (\u201cPCGH\u201d). Around four a.m., Marlene Taylor, a patient in the skilled-nursing unit at PCGH, soiled herself and required assistance. Cook, the primary care nurse\u2019s assistant (\u201cPCNA\u201d) assigned to Taylor, responded and cleaned Taylor. About twenty minutes later, Taylor again soiled herself; this time, nursing assistant Pamela Peoples responded because Cook was busy with another patient. Peoples testified that as she was cleaning Taylor, Cook walked in, and Taylor became \u201chysterical,\u201d screaming for Cook to get out. According to Peoples, Cook then stepped closer to Taylor\u2019s bed and appeared aggressive, at which point Taylor stopped talking. Peoples informed her supervisor. Don Dietzeel, the R.N. assigned to Taylor, overheard a conversation about the incident and confirmed with Taylor that she did not want Cook in her room.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">Around noon, Taylor\u2019s daughter, Georgia Gassi, visited and noticed that her mother had not eaten her lunch and appeared \u201creal edgy\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d Gassi asked her mother what was wrong, and Taylor responded that a male nurse had inserted a finger into her vagina as he cleaned her. Gassi informed the attending nurse, Diane Placko, who in turn contacted the supervising nurse that day, Doris Schoenbeck. Schoenbeck testified that Taylor told her that Cook had been \u201crough when cleaning her during the night\u201d and that Cook \u201chad put his finger in her vagina while cleaning her up.\u201d Schoenbeck documented the incident; informed Cook that he could not return to work; and, since PCGH is a mandatory reporter, reported Taylor\u2019s allegations to the police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">Officer Tom Desmarteau responded to the complaint. He testified that Taylor repeated her allegations against Cook to him and that Taylor seemed upset, embarrassed, angry, and \u201cvery concerned as to what took place.\u201d Detective Daniel Ciryak took over the investigation and interviewed Cook on November 28, 2003. In a signed statement, Cook stated that he did not know why Taylor yelled at him, but that he heard that Taylor had complained that he had cleaned her between her private area and her buttocks too hard. Cook confirmed that he had cleaned Taylor on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>night in question. He asserted that although there was fecal matter in her vaginal area, he did not open her vagina \u2014 or insert a finger into her vagina \u2014 because the fecal matter was only on top of her vagina. Cook\u2019s story changed, however. Captain Robert DeSimone interviewed Cook a second time, and took a statement, signed by Cook, in which Cook explicitly recanted his previous statement that he had not inserted a finger into Taylor\u2019s vagina. Cook disclosed that he had inserted three to four fingers \"wrapped in pericare cloth about a quarter of an inch into Taylor\u2019s vaginal canal area while he was cleaning her. Cook stated that this method of cleaning was approved by PCGH.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On July 7, 2004, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Cook with one count of rape and one count of patient abuse. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2907.02, 2903.34. Cook pleaded not guilty and elected to be tried by a jury. Taylor died prior to the trial, and Cook filed a motion asserting that the admission of Taylor\u2019s hearsay statements would violate his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. The trial court denied Cook\u2019s motion. At trial, Cook\u2019s counsel continued to object, but the court allowed Gassi, Schoenbeck, and Desmarteau to testify about Taylor\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The jury convicted Cook on both counts. The trial court found Cook to be a sexual predator and sentenced him to eight years\u2019 incarceration for the rape conviction and six months\u2019 incarceration for the patient-abuse conviction, to be served concurrently. Cook timely appealed to the Ohio Court of Appeals, raising several issues, including the two he presses here. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, and Cook sought review by the Ohio Supreme Court, which summarily dismissed his case as raising no substantial constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">Cook then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Northern District of Ohio, asserting two grounds for relief: (1) Cook\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to confront the witnesses against him were violated when hearsay testimonial statements of a deceased witness were used against him; and (2) the state failed to present sufficient evidence to prove all elements of rape beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of Cook\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The parties consented to having the matter decided by a magistrate judge, who denied Cook\u2019s petition and also denied a certificate of appealability. Cook sought to appeal, and we granted a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">In a federal habeas appeal, this court reviews legal conclusions and mixed questions of fact and law de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>Ruelas v. Wolfenbarger, </em>580 F.3d 403, 408 (6th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant habeas relief only if the state court\u2019s judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aod\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 783-84, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). A decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if the state court reaches an opposite conclusion than the Supreme Court on a question of law or decides a case differently on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <em>Stallings v. Bobby, </em>464 F.3d 576, 580-81 (6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Cir.2006) (citation omitted). A state court unreasonably applies federal law if the court identifies the governing legal principle, but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Cook contends that Officer Desmarteau\u2019s testimony about statements Taylor made during the investigation violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Since the Warden does not dispute that Officer Desmarteau\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, the only issue is whether the violation was harmless. <em>See Vasquez v. Jones, </em>496 F.3d 564, 574 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cConfrontation Clause errors are subject to harmless-error analysis.\u201d) (internal citation omitted). Harmless-error review inquires whether the constitutional violation \u201chad a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Ruelas, </em>580 F.3d at 411 (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)). Our review is guided by the <em>Van Arsdall </em>factors. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). Courts consider \u201cthe importance of the witness\u2019[s] testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, ... and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431. Neither side has the burden of proving the error is harmless, and when the matter is so evenly balanced that we have \u201cgrave doubt\u201d about whether the error had an effect on the jury\u2019s verdict, the error is not harmless. <em>Fulcher v. Motley, </em>444 F.3d 791, 809 (6th Cir.2006) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The Ohio Court of Appeals and the magistrate judge both concluded that the Confrontation Clause violation was harmless. We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Taylor\u2019s hearsay statements admitted through the testimony of Officer Desmarteau were cumulative and added nothing to the statements introduced through other witnesses, the admission of which are not challenged here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Schoenbeck and Gassi both testified that Taylor told them Cook penetrated her vagina while he was cleaning her, and Schoenbeck read the medical records documenting Taylor\u2019s allegation. The truth of the hearsay statement to which Officer Desmarteau testified is not seriously in dispute: Captain De Simone read Cook\u2019s statement that he <em>did </em>penetrate Taylor\u2019s vaginal canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Cook contends that in <em>Fulcher </em>the evidence was even stronger than the evidence here, and yet this court granted habeas relief. 444 F.3d at 809-11. In <em>Fulcher, </em>the court evaluated the evidence against the defendant without the testimonial statements and found the remaining evidence was very suspect, noting that, apart from the statements that violated the Confrontation Clause, \u201call of the remaining witnesses had a motive to lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. Here, the remaining witnesses against Cook had no motive to lie, and Cook\u2019s reliance on <em>Fulcher </em>is misplaced. We are satisfied that Desmarteau\u2019s hearsay testimony had little, if any, effect on the verdict. Accordingly, the Confrontation Clause violation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Cook next contends that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence of the elements of rape under Ohio law, and therefore the conviction violates due process. U.S. Const, amend. V, XIV. A federal court reviewing a habeas petition based on insufficiency of the evidence proceeds in two steps. First, without reweighing the evidence or substituting its judgment for that of the jury, the court must determine whether, \u201cviewing the testimony and exhibits in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any rational trier of fact </em>could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Brown v. Konteh, </em>567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original). Second, even if the court finds that no rational jury could have convicted the defendant, the habeas court must \u201cstill defer to the <em>state appellate court\u2019s </em>sufficiency determination as long as it is not unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original); <em>see also Pordash v. Hudson, </em>388 Fed.Appx. 466, 467 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Cook contends that the prosecution did not prove the element of force or threat of force. O.R.C. \u00a7 2907.02(A)(2) makes it illegal for a person to \u201cengage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d Force need not be \u201covert or physically brutal\u201d and can be established by showing that \u201cthe rape victim\u2019s will was overcome by fear or duress.\u201d <em>State v. Eskridge, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304, 306 (1988) (citation omitted); <em>State v. Arias, </em>No. 04CA008428, 2004 Ohio 4443, at *31-32, 2004 WL 1882631 (Ohio Ct.App. Aug. 25, 2004). In the absence of physical force, force is established if the defendant \u201ccreates the belief that physical force will be used if the victim does not submit.\u201d <em>State v. Schaim, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 51, 600 N.E.2d 661, 665 (1992); <em>see also State v. Rupp, </em>No. 05MA166, 2007 Ohio 1561, at *30, 2007 WL 969069 (Ohio Ct.App. Mar. 27, 2007); <em>Pordash, </em>388 Fed.Appx. at 468. A \u201cthreat of force can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Schaim, </em>600 N.E.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The Ohio Court of Appeals found that Taylor\u2019s age and infirmity, and Cook\u2019s status as caregiver, supported an inference of a threat of force and, therefore, the prosecution had submitted sufficient evidence of force; the magistrate judge agreed. Cook complains that this holding is based almost exclusively on statements made in <em>Eskridge, supra, </em>a case in which a father raped his four-year-old daughter. <em>Eskridge </em>creates an \u201calmost automatic finding of force or threat of force\u201d in the context of child-rape cases, based on a child\u2019s age and strength, as well as an adult\u2019s authority. <em>See, e.g., Rupp, </em>2007 Ohio 1561, 2007 WL 969069, at *31. The Ohio Supreme Court limited the rationale of <em>Eskridge </em>in <em>Schaim: \u201cState v. Eskridge </em>is based solely on the recognition of the amount of control that parents have over their children, particularly young children.\u201d <em>Schaim, </em>600 N.E.2d at 665; <em>cf. State v. Dye, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 323, 695 N.E.2d 763, 766 (1998) (\u201c[W]e recognized <em>Eskridge\u2019s, </em>continuing application in cases involving young children.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The Warden concedes that the prosecution was required to make <em>some </em>showing that during the incident, Cook overcame Taylor\u2019s will by fear or duress: \u201cIn order for a defendant to overcome his victim\u2019s will by fear or duress, the defendant would have had to engage in sufficient behavior toward the victim.\u201d <em>Rupp, </em>2007 Ohio 1561, 2007 WL 969069, at *41; <em>Pordash, </em>388 Fed.Appx. at 468. Cook argues that there was no evidence that he used physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>cal force or engaged in conduct while he was cleaning Taylor that would have overcome her will by fear or duress. Ohio courts look at the \u201ctotality of facts and circumstances existing at the time of the alleged rape.\u201d <em>Rupp, </em>2007 Ohio 1561, 2007 WL 969069, at *41. Here, there was very little testimony regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding Cook\u2019s conduct during the cleaning incident. There was testimony, however, that Taylor reported to Schoenbeck that Cook had been rough with her when he was cleaning her and that he had put his fingers in her vagina while cleaning her. This testimony, taken together with Cook\u2019s aggressive manner with Taylor, which led to her silence after being hysterical, could reasonably be seen as sufficient to establish that Cook achieved penetration of Taylor by being rough with her and overcoming her will by fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In order for a habeas petitioner to be entitled to relief, a state-court decision must not only be erroneous, but also objectively unreasonable. In <em>Davis v. Lafler, </em>the en banc Sixth Circuit explained that a state court\u2019s decision in a federal habeas sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge receives \u201cdouble deference\u201d \u2014 first, deference to the jury\u2019s verdict, and second, deference to the state court\u2019s consideration of the verdict. 658 F.3d 525, 581-35 (6th Cir. 2011). Thus, in a sufficiency challenge, this court must stay its hand unless the state-court decision is \u201cfar out of line with the very general standard set forth in <em>Jackson v. Virginia.\" Id. </em>at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">There are no Ohio cases addressing the proofs required to establish the element of \u201cforce or threat of force\u201d or the inferences permitted in judging whether a victim\u2019s will was overcome by fear or duress in the context of a caretaker\u2019s sexual assault of an elderly and infirm victim. Considering the uncertainty in Ohio law regarding the permissible inferences in such cases, the presence of some testimony at trial that could support the required finding, and our limited review under AEDPA, we cannot say that the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 sufficiency determination is so far out of line that it is objectively unreasonable. Accordingly, although we are troubled by the dearth of evidence presented, we must reject Cook\u2019s due-process claim and AFFIRM the denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\">. The prosecution also called Carolyn Homo-la, an eighty-two-year-old woman who testified that Cook, while working at a different nursing facility in 1997, penetrated her vagina with his finger as he bathed her. Defense counsel objected to this testimony as impermissible \"other acts\" evidence, Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), but the trial court allowed the evidence. Cook does not contest this ruling in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. The Ohio Court of Appeals' harmless error decision is itself entitled to deference under AEDPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\">. Although he did so in the state appeals court, in this appeal Cook does not challenge the admission of Gassi\u2019s and Schoenbeck\u2019s testimony regarding Taylor's statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
