The judgment was entered pursuant to a written ruling dated May 5, 2011, granting defendant-appellant John Connelly\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that he was absolutely immune from suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. See Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, </em>672 F.3d 155, 156 (2d Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thorough and carefully-considered ruling of May 5, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">Lawlor\u2019s main claim is that Connelly withheld exculpatory evidence from the investigatory grand jury. This Court has repeatedly held, however, that a prosecutor is absolutely immune from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for his conduct before a grand jury. <em>See Bernard v. Cnty. of Suffolk, </em>356 F.3d 495, 505 (2d Cir.2004) (prosecutor immune from suit for alleged misconduct in the presentation of evidence to grand jury); <em>Hill v. City of New York, </em>45 F.3d 653, 661 (2d Cir.1995) (prosecutorial immunity covers virtually all acts associated with prosecutor\u2019s function as an advocate); <em>see generally Burns v. Reed, </em>500 U.S. 478, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Moreover, this Court has specifically held that a prosecutor is immune from \u00a7 1983 liability for withholding exculpatory evidence from a grand jury. <em>See Hill, </em>45 F.3d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">Lawlor also argues that when Connelly submitted the application for the grand jury \u201cupon oath,\u201d he acted as a fact witness, and is therefore not entitled to absolute immunity. In support of this argument, Lawlor relies heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kalina v. Fletcher, </em>522 U.S. 118, 118 S.Ct. 502, 139 L.Ed.2d 471 (1997). That case, however, is distinguishable from this one. In <em>Kalina, </em>the Court held that the prosecutor was not absolutely immune from liability because she acted as a witness rather than an advocate. <em>Kalina, </em>522 U.S. at 130-31, 118 S.Ct. 502. Specifically, the prosecutor had sworn to an affidavit that could have been sworn to by \u201cany competent witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, Connelly was required by statute to certify the application to the grand jury. <em>See </em>Conn. Stat. \u00a7 54-47c. No \u201cwitness\u201d was permitted to do so. Therefore, Connelly did not act as a witness, but rather in his capacity as an advocate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-18\">The fact that the grand jury was an \u201cinvestigatory\u201d grand jury \u2014 a unique feature of Connecticut law \u2014 is of no import. Indeed, the same immunity principles apply to a prosecutor\u2019s actions before a Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>necticut \u201cinvestigatory\u201d grand jury as apply to a prosecutor\u2019s actions before a grand jury that has the power to indict. <em>See Powers v. Coe, </em>728 F.2d 97, 104 (2d Cir.1984). In light of these principles, the district court correctly concluded that Connelly\u2019s actions were protected by absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We have considered Lawlor\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-14\">. Indeed, as the parties agree, the witness from whom the exculpatory evidence was purportedly available \u2014 Lawlor\u2019s partner \u2014 testified at the grand jury hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
