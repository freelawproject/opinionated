We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of asylum because TincopaSanchez failed to establish the harm he suffered, or fears, from the Shining Path is on account of an imputed political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812 (\u201c[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d); <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1030 (9th Cir.2000) (police officer threatened by Shining Path guerrillas because they believed he was an informant did not establish persecution on account of an imputed political opinion). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Tincopa-Sanchez\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Because Tincopa-Sanchez failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Finally, Tincopa-Sanchez failed to raise any substantive challenge to the denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not addressed in the argument portion of a brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
