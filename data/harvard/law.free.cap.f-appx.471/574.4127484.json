We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1050 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-26\">Gantumur was harmed by her employer when she refused his demand to falsely claim she embezzled funds. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Gantumur did not demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1052 (personal retribution by a prominent politician was not persecution on account of a protected ground); <em>Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhistleblowing against one\u2019s supervisors at work is not, as a matter of law, always an exercise of political opinion.\u201d). Accordingly, Gantumur\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
