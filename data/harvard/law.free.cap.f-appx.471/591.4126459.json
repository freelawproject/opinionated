We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">The district court concluded that Huynh failed to allege any injury. However, in his second amended complaint, Huynh alleges that after he tested positive for tuberculosis, defendants refused to administer a preventative tuberculosis treatment in a proper manner, and, as a result, he is now at a high risk of developing active tuberculosis and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. At this early stage of the proceedings, we cannot say that these allegations fail to state an Eighth Amendment injury. <em>See Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 32-35, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993) (Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim can be based on threat of future harm). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">Huynh shall bear his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-24\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AUQ\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
