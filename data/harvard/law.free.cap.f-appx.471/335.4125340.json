He explains that he instead sought this court\u2019s stay to support a coram nobis motion currently pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. <em>See Woldegiorgise v. Thaler, </em>No. 4:12-CV-1318 (S.D.Tex. Apr. 24, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Woldegiorgise seeks relief from the district court and raises arguments before this court that have not yet been addressed by the district court. We lack jurisdiction and DISMISS his appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292 (limiting our jurisdiction over district court orders to final judgments and some interlocutory orders); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(C) (instructing us to treat appeals from coram nobis motions under the rules for civil appeals). The Government\u2019s motion is therefore MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AEx\">. This court previously denied Woldegiorgise\u2019s motion for a stay in this case but granted him leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
