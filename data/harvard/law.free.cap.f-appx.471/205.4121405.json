Because the district court erroneously classified Williams as a \u201cthree-striker\u201d for purposes of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), we vacate the orders and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-20\">Under the PLRA, a prisoner who brings a civil action or an appeal who has had three or more actions or appeals dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim may not proceed without prepayment of fees unless he is under \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2006). The dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim that is without prejudice, however, does not count as a strike under the PLRA. <em>McLean v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 391, 395-98 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">Only two of the three cases the district court relied on to deny Williams\u2019s PLRA motion constituted strikes for purposes of the PLRA. <em>See Williams v. Vliet, </em>No. 3:05-cv-00621 (E.D. Va. June 8, 2006); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Williams v. Cavedo, </em>No. 3:05-cv-00842 (E.D.Va. Feb. 23, 2006). While the third case was dismissed based on the district court\u2019s conclusion that Williams failed to state a claim for relief as to each of his claims, the dismissal was without prejudice. <em>Williams v. City of Richmond, </em>No. 3:04-cv-00747 (E.D.Va. Aug. 17, 2005). Accordingly, pursuant to <em>McLean, </em>we conclude that <em>City of Richmond </em>does not count as a qualifying strike for purposes of the PLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s orders and remand for further consideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
