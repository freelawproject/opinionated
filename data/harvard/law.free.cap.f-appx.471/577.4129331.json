We have jurisdiction under 28 U.SC. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Knievel v. ESPN, </em>393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005), and may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, </em>534 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Dismissal of Packnett\u2019s claims for damages against state officials in their official capacity was proper under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Flint v. Dennison, </em>488 F.3d 816, 824-25 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The district court properly dismissed Packnett\u2019s conspiracy claim against defendants in their individual capacity because Packnett failed to allege that they entered into an agreement to interfere with his legal mail. <em>See Ivey v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Alaska, </em>673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir.1982) (vague and conclusory allegations of official participation in civil rights violations are not sufficient to withstand dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">The district court properly dismissed Packnett\u2019s access-to-courts claim against defendants in their individual capacity because Packnett conceded that he did not suffer any injury. <em>See Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918, 936 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">However, dismissal of Packnett\u2019s denial-of-mail claims against defendants in their individual capacity was improper because Packnett sufficiently alleged that defendants opened various pieces of his legal mail outside his presence in violation of state regulations and the First Amendment. <em>See </em>Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15 \u00a7 3143; <em>see also Sherman v. MacDougall, </em>656 F.2d 527, 528 (9th Cir.1981) (remanding for a hearing the inmate\u2019s claim that defendants opened mail from his attorneys outside his presence in violation of the First Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">Dismissal of Packnett\u2019s retaliation claim against defendants in their individual capacity was also improper because Packnett alleged that his First Amendment rights were chilled when defendants searched his cell, seized his property, and otherwise retaliated against him for filing grievances. <em>See Rhodes v. Robinson, </em>408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir.2005) (elements of retaliation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">Arguments raised for the first time on appeal, including whether Packnett satisfied the claims presentation requirement, are deemed waived. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">We decline to address issues that may benefit from further development of the record, including whether defendants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>entitled to qualified immunity and whether certain defendants were not personally involved in any alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On remand, the district court should decide whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in Packnett\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
