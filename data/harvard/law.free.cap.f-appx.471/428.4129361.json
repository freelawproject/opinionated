He argues that the sentences imposed are substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-22\">This court reviews sentences for reasonableness by engaging in a bifurcated review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). First, we must ensure that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>Because Salazar\u2019s sentence falls within the applicable guidelines range, it \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). However, as he concedes, we review his sentence only for plain error because he failed to object to it in the district court. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">This court has rejected Salazar\u2019s arguments that sentences determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 are unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically grounded and because prior convictions may count toward both offense level and criminal history category calculations. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). With regard to his contention that the district court failed to account sufficiently for his particular circumstances in its 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, he brought these circumstances to the attention of the district court, and this court recognizes that \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Whether or not we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Finally, as Salazar concedes, his argument that his inability to participate in a fast-track program creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
