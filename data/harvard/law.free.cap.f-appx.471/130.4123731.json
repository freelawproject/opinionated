We have reviewed the administrative record and Luo\u2019s claims and find no abuse of discretion in the denial of relief on his motion. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c) (2011). We accordingly deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Luo </em>(B.I.A. Sept. 12, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
