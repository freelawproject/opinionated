We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">We review orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cIn determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201c[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>shita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">On appeal, Zuk argues that the District Court erred when it granted summary judgment on his Title VII national-origin discrimination claim, which was premised on his allegations that, due to his Brazilian national origin, he was disciplined more severely than other similarly situated employees. We have conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of the above standards and now affirm for substantially the same reasons set forth by the District Court in its September 30, 2010, decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Zuk\u2019s national-origin discrimination claim is governed by the familiar burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under this scheme, a plaintiff must first satisfy the minimal burden of making out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing that \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he held; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the adverse action took place under circumstances giving rise to the inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Cnty. of Rockland, </em>609 F.3d 486, 492 (2d Cir.2010). \u201cA showing of disparate treatment \u2014 that is, a showing that the employer treated plaintiff \u2018less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside his protected group\u2019 \u2014 is a recognized method of raising an inference of discrimination for purposes of making out a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>Mandell v. Cnty. of Suffolk, </em>316 F.3d 368, 379 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Graham v. Long Island R.R., </em>230 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir.2000)). In order to raise an inference of discrimination by showing that he was subjected to disparate treatment, however, \u201cthe plaintiff must show [ ]he was \u2018similarly situated in all material respects\u2019 to the individuals with whom []he seeks to compare h[imjself.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>230 F.3d at 39 (quoting <em>Shumway v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>118 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir.1997)). In this analysis, there must be an \u201cobjectively identifiable basis for comparability\u201d between the plaintiff and the comparator employee, <em>id. </em>at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted), which includes an assessment of \u201cwhether the conduct for which the employer imposed discipline was of comparable seriousness,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In his brief, Zuk argues that he was the only Onondaga County Sheriff\u2019s Office (\u201cOSCO\u201d) employee \u201csingled out and disciplined for allegedly turning in two time sheets late,\u201d and asserts that another employee, Lieutenant Walter Rys, \u201cnever received formal discipline for late or missing time sheets.\u201d This argument both understates the reason for Zuk\u2019s reprimand and overstates the usefulness of Rys as a comparator. First, Zuk was not issued a written reprimand simply for turning in two time sheets late, but also, and more significantly, for disregarding a direct order from his superior to submit his time sheets in a timely fashion. Indeed, Onondaga County Sheriff Kevin Walsh affirmed that it was Zuk\u2019s failure \u201cto abide by an order to turn in his time sheets in a timely fashion\u201d that led him to approve the written reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Second, Zuk has not shown that he was \u201csimilarly situated in all material respects\u201d to Rys. <em>Graham, </em>230 F.3d at 39 (quotation marks omitted). In his affidavit, Rys affirmed that he had received \u201c2 counseling memo[s] for late time sheets.\u201d Even assuming that a \u201ccounseling memo\u201d is the same as the Supervisor\u2019s Memorandum Zuk received, there is no indication in the record that Rys, in those counseling memos, was ever specifically ordered, as Zuk was in his November 2003 Supervisor\u2019s Memorandum, to submit his time sheets in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>a timely fashion. Thus, without evidence that Rys failed to comply with the order of his superior, there is no \u201cobjectively identifiable basis for comparability\u201d between Rys and Zuk because it cannot be assessed whether the conduct for which OCSO imposed discipline on Zuk, and not Rys, \u201cwas of comparable seriousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We have considered all of Zuk\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
