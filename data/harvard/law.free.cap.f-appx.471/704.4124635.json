We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Eneh v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 943, 946 (9th Cir.2010). We grant the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-26\">Bal, a Sikh from the Punjab, fears being tortured if he returns to India because he killed a cow, a sacred religious symbol for Hindus, and because of his activities in support of a Sikh political party. The record indicates that Bal came to the attention of the police only after he killed the cow, and he immediately fled, never returning to his home or village. In analyz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ing Bal\u2019s CAT claim, the BIA mischaracterized the 2006 country report when it discounted evidence of torture as occasional acts of rogue agents committed without government acquiescence. The BIA also failed to take into account Bal\u2019s evidence that he is subject to one or more outstanding warrants and charges in India. Accordingly, we remand for the BIA to assess Bal\u2019s CAT claim properly in light of his undisputed testimony regarding the authorities\u2019 interest in him and the record evidence regarding the prevalence of torture by the authorities. <em>See id. </em>at 947-48 (remanding where agency\u2019s reasoning appeared to be at odds with aspects of case); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-84 (9th Cir.2001) (remanding for agency to consider probative evidence of country conditions confirming widespread torture of Tamil males).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
