Ross appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>view de novo, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Ross\u2019s deliberate indifference claims because Ross failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants knew of and consciously disregarded his serious medical needs related to his shoulder injury and pain. <em>See id. </em>at 1057-58, 1060 (deliberate indifference is a high legal standard; mistakes, negligence, or malpractice by medical professionals are not sufficient to constitute deliberate indifference, nor is an inmate\u2019s difference of opinion with the physician regarding the appropriate course of treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">To the extent that Ross contended that defendant McGuinness violated Ross\u2019s constitutional rights in reviewing and responding to Ross\u2019s grievance about his medical care, the district court properly granted summary judgment because such allegations cannot give rise to a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Ramirez v. Galaza, </em>334 F.3d 850, 860 (9th Cir.2003) (\u00a7 1983 claim based on the processing of inmate appeals has no constitutional foundation because inmates lack a constitutional entitlement to a specific prison grievance procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Ross\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Ross\u2019s request for appointment of counsel, set forth in his opening brief, is denied. <em>See Palmer v. Valdez, </em>560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement for appointment of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b638-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
