Louther, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his answer and claim for lack of standing and denying leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal. He also seeks to challenge the court\u2019s decree and judgment of forfeiture. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-29\">Louther filed a timely notice of appeal designating only the court\u2019s order denying leave to proceed IFP on appeal as the order he sought to appeal. We confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Louther\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s disposition, Louther has forfeited appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>review of this order. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying IFP status.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Turning to the remaining order and judgment Louther seeks to appeal, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Louther\u2019s answer and claim for lack of standing was entered on the docket on September 7, 2011, and the decree and judgment of forfeiture was entered on the docket on October 13, 2011. The notice of appeal was filed on February 13, 2012.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Louther failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Louther failed to notice an appeal of the district court's underlying substantive orders. While we may construe Louther\u2019s informal brief on appeal as \u201cthe functional equivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal, <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248-49, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), Louther failed to file his brief within the sixty-day appeal period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
