We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>349 F.3d 634, 639 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cheesman\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims because Cheesman failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether AmeriTitle\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Cheesman was pretextual. <em>See id. </em>at 640-42 (circumstantial evidence of pretext must be specific and substantial); <em>see also Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., </em>104 F.3d 267, 270-71 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201c[Wjhere the same actor is responsible for both the hiring and the firing of a discrimination plaintiff, and both actions occur within a short period of time, a strong inference arises that there was no discriminatory motive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cheesman\u2019s harassment claim because Cheesman failed to raise a triable dispute as to whether the alleged conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive work environment. <em>See Vasquez, </em>349 F.3d at 642 (listing elements of a hostile work environment claim, discussing factors for determining whether conduct is severe or pervasive, and requiring that the work environment be both subjectively and objectively abusive).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cheesman\u2019s wrongful termination claim because Cheesman failed to raise a triable dispute as to whether her \u201cpublic-policy-linked conduct was a substantial factor\u201d in AmeriTitle\u2019s decision to terminate her. <em>Little v. Windermere Relocation, Inc., </em>301 F.3d 958, 971 (9th Cir. 2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (elements of wrongful discharge claim under Washington law).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief, nor arguments and allegations raised for the first time on appeal, including those concerning defendant\u2019s alleged exploitation of Cheesman, defendant\u2019s interviewing practices, and Cheesman\u2019s productivity compared to all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>employees. <em>See Padgett v.
