May 25, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We review for abuse of discretion the fact-finding that supports a denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Luna v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 85, 102-03 (2d Cir.2011). In May 2010, He moved to reopen proceedings with the BIA, based on changed country conditions. For such motions, there is no time or numerical limitation if the alien establishes materially \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The BIA must consider \u201crelevant evidence of country conditions,\u201d and when it does, \u201cwe review the BIA\u2019s fact-finding only for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">He, a Catholic and father of three United States citizens, claimed that country conditions in China had changed in two material ways: (1) greater likelihood of sterilization and large fines for parents of three foreign-born children; and (2) greater persecution of practicing Catholics.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">First, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that He failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility that national or local enforcement policies would subject him to forced sterilization on removal to China. Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to credit two purported Fujian Regulations submitted without authentication by He, based on legitimate concerns about He\u2019s credibility. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 148 (2d Cir.2007). Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in rejecting He\u2019s claim of economic persecution based on those purported regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Second, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that He failed to establish material changed country conditions with respect to the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of practicing Catholics. As the BIA noted, the 2009 State Department Religious Freedom Report for China (\u201cReport\u201d) states that China allows the practice of Christianity, although some members of unsanctioned Christian churches reportedly have been detained and harassed. However, the Report also notes that \u201c[i]n some places, government supervision of unsanctioned religious activity is minimal.\u201d Absent reliable and objective evidence specific to He\u2019s circumstances, He has not demonstrated a reasonable possibility that he would be persecuted because of his religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">Lastly, the BIA did not err in declining to discuss three unpublished decisions that He submitted because unpublished BIA decisions are not binding and lack precedential weight. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. He\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
