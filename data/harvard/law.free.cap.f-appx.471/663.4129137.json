Reviewing the district court\u2019s order de novo, <em>see Alpha Delta Chi-Delta Chapter v. Reed, </em>648 F.3d 790, 796 (9th Cir.2011), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Phillippi argues that as a result of the implantation of a Stryker pain pump, he suffered chondrolysis, the complete or nearly complete loss of cartilage, in his shoulder joint. However, as the district court found, Phillippi provided insufficient evidence to raise a known or knowable risk of chondrolysis at the time of Phillippi\u2019s surgery such that Stryker had a duty to warn. <em>See Brown v. Superior Court, </em>44 Cal.3d 1049, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470, 475-76 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Phillippi also argues that the district court erred in excluding the declaration of Dr. Younger. Because the district court clearly found that the declaration was self-serving and lacking foundation, we hold that its exclusion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See ACLU of Nev. v. City of Las Vegas, </em>333 F.3d 1092, 1097 (9th Cr. 2003) (holding that evidentiary rulings made in the context of summary judgment are reviewed for an abuse of discretion); <em>see also FTC v. Publ\u2019g Clearing House, Inc., </em>104 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cA conclusory, self-serving affidavit, lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
