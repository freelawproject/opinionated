We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion the denial of leave to amend, <em>Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>656 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir.2011), and the denial of a motion for disqualification, <em>Milgard Tempering, Inc. v. Selas Corp. of Am., </em>902 F.2d 703, 714 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint on the grounds of futility and for failure to comply with the local rules. <em>See Cervantes, </em>656 F.3d at 1043 (upholding denial of leave to amend where motion was \u201cprocedurally improper and substantively unsupported,\u201d and noting that plaintiffs had failed to comply with local rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Palmer\u2019s motion for disqualification because all of the incidents complained about in Palmer\u2019s motion \u201coccurred in the course of judicial proceedings, <em>and </em>neither (1) relied upon knowledge acquired outside such proceedings nor (2) displayed deep-seated and unequivocal antagonism that would render fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 556, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-25\">Although Palmer\u2019s notice of appeal indicated that he was also appealing the denial of his motion for reconsideration and the entry of summary judgment, Palmer did not brief these issues on appeal and they are accordingly deemed waived. <em>See Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, </em>520 F.3d 1024, 1033 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AxL\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
