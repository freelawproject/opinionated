FEMA awarded Carraway $382.40 for loss to personal property but denied him further relief. Carraway subsequently sued FEMA, seeking additional relief funds. On July 9, 2010, 2010 WL 2737161, the district court granted FEMA\u2019s motion to dismiss Carraway\u2019s claims, holding that the claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. On August 26, 2010, Carraway filed a request for leave to file an out of time motion for reconsideration, which the district court granted. On October 12, 2010, Carraway filed a \u201cMotion for New Trial/Reconsideration\u201d and several other post-judgment motions, including a motion to waive the appeal deadline for the judgment of dismissal, a motion requesting that the court file a waiver of sovereign immunity, and a motion for entry of default judgment against the government. The district court denied Carraway\u2019s motions in orders dated October 20 and 28, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">On November 22, 2010, Carraway filed a pro se handwritten notice of appeal. The notice, however, did not indicate the judgment or order Carraway sought to challenge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1)(B), a \u201cnotice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d \u201cRule 3\u2019s dictates are jurisdictional in nature, and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review.\u201d <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) (citing <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 316-17, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988)). Although we may \u201cpermit] imperfect but substantial compliance \"with [the] technical requirements]\u201d of Rule 3, we may not \u201cwaiv[e] the requirements] altogether.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>487 U.S. at 315-16, 108 S.Ct. 2405. In reviewing Carraway\u2019s notice of appeal, we conclude that it was not merely \u201ctechnieal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ly at variance with the letter of [Rule 3],\u201d but it instead completely failed to comply with the rule\u2019s requirements. <em>Smith, </em>502 U.S. at 248, 112 S.Ct. 678 (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>cf. Bailey v. Cain, </em>609 F.3d 763, 766-67 (5th Cir.2010) (ruling that where \u201cthe district court had entered four orders and a final judgment,\u201d a motion that lacked \u201ca specific reference to the judgment or order from which appeal was taken ... did not meet the requirement of filing a timely notice of appeal\u201d). Therefore, we DISMISS Carraway\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
