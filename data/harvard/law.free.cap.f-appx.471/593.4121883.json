We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">The district court properly dismissed Gaona\u2019s action for failure to state a claim because Gaona failed to allege facts showing that defendants acted with deliberate indifference in the treatment of his infection with Valley Fever. <em>See Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1060 (9th Cir.2004) (deliberate indifference is a high legal standard; malpractice or negligence does not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gaona leave to amend his third amended complaint, where it had previously provided notice of the complaint\u2019s deficiencies and granted leave to amend. <em>See Chodos v. West Publ\u2019g Co., </em>292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth standard of review and noting that court\u2019s discretion is particularly broad where it has already granted leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-26\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gaona\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because Gaona failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Palmer v. Valdez, </em>560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth standard of review and requirement of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for appointment of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-27\">Gaona\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"Adc\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
