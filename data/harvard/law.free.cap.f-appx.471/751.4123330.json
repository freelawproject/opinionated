We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Sandoval-Magana contends that the district court committed procedural error by imposing his sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. Specifically, he contends that the court failed to consult U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 and its application notes; failed to consider the alleged sentencing disparities created by fortuities in the timing of federal and state prosecutions; failed to consider the alternative of a partially concurrent sentence; and relied upon speculation in imposing a consecutive sentence. The record belies Sandoval-Magana\u2019s contention that the district court relied on speculation at sentencing. As to his other contentions, absent some indication in the record to the contrary, we assume that district courts know and apply the relevant law. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Moreover, the record reflects that the district court\u2019s decision was reached after deliberation and was within its discretion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. As such, Sandoval-Magana cannot show that his substantial rights were affected by the alleged errors. <em>See United States v. Waknine, </em>543 F.3d 546, 551 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
