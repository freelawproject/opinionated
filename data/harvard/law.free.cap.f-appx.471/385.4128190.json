California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Hurtado-Valois has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Hurtado-Valois\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment with respect to the statute of conviction cited for count five. The judgment should be corrected to reflect that Hurtado-Valois was convicted of illegal entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-22\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
