We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-21\">Because Upton challenges the validity of his parole revocation, and has since been released from prison, he must demonstrate continuing collateral consequences to avoid mootness. The possibility that Upton\u2019s prior revocation, or the allegedly false and misleading information in his parole violation report, will be used against him in subsequent parole proceedings is too speculative to satisfy the case or controversy requirement. <em>Cf. Spencer v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (declining to find collateral consequences of a prior parole revocation because, <em>inter alia, </em>under Missouri law a single parole revocation \u201c \u2018[does] not render an individual ineligible for parole[,] [but is] simply one factor, among many, that may be considered by the parole authority in determining whether there is a substantial risk that the parole candidate will not conform to the reasonable conditions of parole\u201d) (quoting <em>Lane v. Williams, </em>455 U.S. 624, 633 n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 1322, 71 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Upton asserts that the use of the allegedly false information in future parole hearings is \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d Even assuming the one-year maximum term of any return to custody Upton might suffer as the result of future parole violations, <em>see </em>Cal.Code Regs. tit. 15, \u00a7 2635.1(c), is a short enough period to satisfy the \u201cevading review\u201d prong, <em>see Tyars v. Finner, </em>709 F.2d 1274, 1280 (9th Cir.1983), Upton has not shown a reasonable expectation that the Board will use the allegedly false information against him in subsequent parole proceedings. <em>See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 109, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (the capable-of-repetition doctrine generally applies only where the named plaintiff \u201ccan make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality\u201d). Upton\u2019s single parole revocation does not create a reasonable expectation that he will again come before the Board, or that, if he does, his parole officer will submit the same information again. <em>Cf Foster v. Carson, </em>347 F.3d 742, 748 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cPlaintiffs do not establish a reasonable expectation that they will be subjected to the challenged action again in the future. The only fact in the record before us that supports this claim is that it happened once.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Nor has Upton demonstrated a reasonable expectation that, should he come before the Board again, it would rely on the allegedly false information in making its determination. <em>See </em>CaLCode Regs. tit. 15, \u00a7 2636(a) (a parole violation report is required each time a suspected parole violation is reported to the Board); \u00a7 2643(d) (at a revocation hearing, a parolee may request the presence of witnesses and may request subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum); \u00a7 2665 (\u201call evidence relevant to the charges or disposition\u201d is admissible in parole revocation proceedings); <em>cf. Foster, </em>347 F.3d at 748 (\u201cThe mere fact that a similar order ... <em>might </em>someday issue does not establish a \u2018reasonable expectation\u2019 that such an order <em>will </em>issue. We have held that a mere possibility that something <em>might </em>happen is too remote to keep alive a case as an active controversy.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b777-22\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
