We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Deng\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent and inconsistent with his application regarding whether his mother had ever met the man who introduced Deng to a Christian home church. <em>See id. </em>at 1040-44 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the REAL ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d). In the absence of credible testimony, Deng\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Because Deng\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the agency found not credible, and he does not point to any evidence that shows it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
