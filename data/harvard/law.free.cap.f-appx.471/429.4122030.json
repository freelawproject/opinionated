R.App.P. 24; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 487-488 (5th Cir.2010). In particular, Palacio challenges the 120-month sentence imposed in connection with his conviction for attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity. Palacio argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>district court abused its discretion in denying his petition for writ of audita querela and should have resentenced him with credit for time spent in federal custody while awaiting trial. He acknowledges that he previously sought relief through a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>petition and was denied because his state sentence was credited for his time in federal custody. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.App. P. 22. Nevertheless, Palacio argues that the district court should have modified his sentence and applied a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Palacio is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues and is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Palacio\u2019s challenge to his sentence and the denial of credit for time served is not a legal defense that arose after the judgment. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2010). Additionally, equitable grounds will not justify a writ of audita querela. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the district court correctly denied Palacio\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In light of the foregoing, Palacio\u2019s IFP motion fails to show error in the district court\u2019s certification decision and fails to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, Palacio\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2 (\u201cIf upon hearing of any interlocutory motion ..., it appears to the court that the appeal is frivolous and entirely without merit, the appeal will be dismissed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We deny Palacio\u2019s IFP motion, and we dismiss his appeal. Accordingly, we deny Palacio\u2019s accompanying motion for appointment of counsel as moot because, given our disposition with respect to Palacio\u2019s appeal, there are no issues before us at this time. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599; <em>see, e.g., Cantu-Tzin v. Johnson, </em>162 F.3d 295, 299-300 (5th Cir.1998). DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
