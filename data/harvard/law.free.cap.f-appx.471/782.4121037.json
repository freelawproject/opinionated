Because we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was based on the correct legal standards and supported by substantial evidence, <em>Pagter v. Massanari, </em>250 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">1. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), whose decision the Commissioner affirmed, articulated specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the opinion of Dr. Riley, Fuller\u2019s treating physician. <em>See Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 632 (9th Cir.2007). The ALJ noted that specialists who examined Fuller disagreed with Dr. Riley\u2019s conclusion that she was disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(5). Dr. Lee noted that Fuller\u2019s myeloproliferative disease did not cause symptoms and that she felt well; Dr. Lipschultz noted that Fuller\u2019s lungs were generally clear and that she stabilized nicely with medication; and Dr. Dilla analyzed an MRI of Fuller\u2019s back and concluded that she was not disabled. The ALJ also observed that Dr. Riley\u2019s opinions were conclusory and did not provide supporting evidence. <em>See Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1045 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-23\">2. The ALJ did not err in failing to explicitly state Fuller\u2019s mental limitations in his assessment of her residual functional capacity. None of Fuller\u2019s mental limitations was inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that she was able to perform unskilled, \u201csimple, repetitive work.\u201d <em>See Bray v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1228-29 (9th Cir.2009). Dr. George noted that \u201cthe test results do not suggest difficulties to function on a job\u201d; Dr. Waldman found Fuller \u201ccapable\u201d; and Dr. Berman rated Fuller \u201cunlimited\u201d in most categories of job skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-24\">3. The ALJ made \u201cspecific findings stating clear and convincing reasons\u201d for rejecting Fuller\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996). Fuller\u2019s subjective com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>plaints were contradicted by the medical record, including the testimony of treating physicians, who concluded that she was not seriously impaired, and clinical observations of her sensation, strength, gait, reflexes, and range of motion. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1161 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">4. The ALJ\u2019s use of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines (the \u201cGrids\u201d) was not improper. Fuller\u2019s non-exertional limitations were not \u201csufficiently severe so as to significantly limit the range of work permitted by [her] exertional limitations.\u201d <em>Hoopai v. Astrue, </em>499 F.3d 1071, 1075 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the ALJ did err in applying the Grids for \u201clight,\u201d rather than \u201csedentary,\u201d work, this error was harmless. <em>See Strauss v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>635 F.3d 1135, 1138 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b812-25\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
