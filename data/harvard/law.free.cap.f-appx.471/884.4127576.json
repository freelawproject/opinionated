O\u2019Kelley, Birmingham, AL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b915-7\">Before EDMONDSON, MARCUS and MARTIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b915-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Johnny Lee Snyder appeals his conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), for which he was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Snyder challenges the validity of the search warrant used to search his home. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Based on information received from a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), Officer Christopher Murphy prepared an affidavit in support of a search warrant. The affidavit stated that the Cl had observed personally a black male known as \u201cBlack\u201d in possession of drugs packaged for sale at Black\u2019s home at <em>\u201c19Jf2 </em>Queen City Avenue.\u201d The affidavit then contained detailed directions to <em>\u201c1921/, </em>Queen City Avenue,\u201d describing the residence as a white two-story house with black trim and with the numbers \u201c1924\u201d on the right side of the front door. Based on Officer Murphy\u2019s affidavit, a search warrant issued authorizing a search of 1924 Queen City Avenue. When agents executed the search warrant at 1924 Queen City Avenue \u2014 Snyder\u2019s home \u2014 they discovered, among other things, the firearms underlying Snyder\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">Before trial, Snyder filed a motion to suppress evidence seized during the search of his home, arguing that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. Following a hearing, the district court denied the suppression motion. The court concluded that it was \u201cobvious there [was] a scrivener\u2019s error in the affidavit\u201d and that the error did not render the warrant invalid. The court also determined that the discrepancies between the physical descriptions of Black and Snyder were not pertinent to determining whether probable cause existed to search 1924 Queen City Avenue.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Snyder pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, but reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">In considering the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review fact determinations for clear error and application of law to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1105 (11th Cir.2003). And we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">Although the affidavit mentioned \u201c1942 Queen City Avenue\u201d once, it provided detailed directions to 1924 Queen City Avenue and provided a clear description of that house, including that it had the number \u201c1924\u201d by the front door. Construing these facts in the light most favorable to the government, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that the affidavit\u2019s singular reference to \u201c1942 Queen City Avenue\u201d was a typographical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Having resolved the affidavit\u2019s conflicting house numbers, we conclude that the affidavit contained sufficient facts to establish probable cause to search Snyder\u2019s home. \u201cIt is critical to a showing of probable cause that the affidavit state facts sufficient to justify a conclusion that evidence or contraband will probably be found at the premises to be searched.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[T]he affidavit should establish a connection between the defendant and the residence to be searched and a link between the residence and any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reading the affidavit\u2019s reference to \u201c1942 Queen City Avenue\u201d to mean \u201c1924 Queen City Avenue,\u201d the affidavit established clearly both that the Cl observed drugs at 1924 Queen City Avenue and that 1924 Queen City Avenue was Black\u2019s home. Because the facts in the affidavit supported a conclusion that contraband would probably be found at 1924 Queen City Avenue, it established probable cause to search the house. <em>See id. </em>That the affidavit\u2019s physical description of Black did not match exactly Snyder\u2019s physical description does not change our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We also reject Snyder\u2019s argument that the search warrant failed to describe the premises with sufficient particularity. A search \u201cwarrant need only describe the place to be searched with sufficient particularity to direct the searcher, to confine his examination to the place described, and to advise those being searched of his authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Burke, </em>784 F.2d 1090, 1092 (11th Cir.1986). Here, the search warrant itself contained no reference to \u201c1942 Queen City Avenue.\u201d Instead, the warrant indicated unambiguously that the house to be searched was 1924 Queen City Avenue, and provided directions to the house and a physical description of the house, the accuracy of which are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Because the search warrant was supported by probable cause and described the place to be searched with sufficient particularity, the district court denied properly Snyder\u2019s motion to suppress. As a result, it is unnecessary for us to address whether the good faith exception established in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-11\"> The affidavit described Black as being about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing between 200 and 210 pounds, while Snyder was 6 feet tall and weighed about 270 pounds when he was arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
