We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-18\">Halbert first contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to appreciate its discretion to vary from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range on policy grounds, and by failing to explain why it rejected his policy arguments. The record belies these contentions. The court considered Halbert\u2019s arguments and explained the sentence sufficiently to permit meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>649 F.3d 955, 964 (9th Cir. 2011) (\u201c[District courts are not obligated to vary from the child pornography Guidelines on policy grounds if they do not have, in fact, a policy disagreement with them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-19\">Halbert next contends that the district court erred by imposing a vulnerable victim adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), because the adjustment should not apply in a possession of child pornography case. His contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>636 F.3d 1127, 1139 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-20\">Halbert finally contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We consider policy arguments like Halbert\u2019s within the context of the reasonableness of the final sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>States v. Barsumyan, </em>517 F.3d 1154, 1158-59 (9th Cir.2008). The record reflects that Halbert\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
