Izurieta argues that there is insufficient evidence that she violated a condition of her probation by importing misbranded food. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">In October 2010, Izurieta agreed to plead guilty to breaking a U.S. Customs seal, fastening, or mark, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 549, in exchange for the dismissal of two charges that she had conspired to remove and that she had removed merchandise within the custody and control of customs agents, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 371, 549. A video recording of the crime depicted Izurieta in a warehouse directing her three sons, the owner of the merchandise, and another cohort to remove from a refrigeration cooler a pallet of hard cheese that had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and replacing the pallet of hard cheese with containers of soft cheese that Izurieta had brought to the warehouse. The recording also depicted Izurieta and her cohorts removing carefully the shrink wrap bearing the customs seal and reassuring the owner of the warehouse that the pallet would be \u201cput ... back exactly how [it was] found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">On December 9, 2010, the district court accepted Izurieta\u2019s plea and sentenced her to two years of probation. A condition of Izurieta\u2019s probation required that she \u201cnot commit another federal, state, or local crime.\u201d During the period of probation, the district court permitted Izurieta to continue importing food products through her company, Naver Trading Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">On December 23, 2010, Giddel Casadesus, a customs agent, inspected at the Port of Miami a shipment of cheese imported by Naver Trading. Although the entry pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>perwork declared a shipment of 240 boxes of soft cheese and dairy spread, Casadesus discovered that the shipment contained 398 boxes of hard cheese. Casadesus released the shipment \u201cconditionally,\u201d and the shipment was transported by truck to a refrigerated warehouse. Casadesus followed the delivery truck and saw Izurieta arrive at the warehouse with one of her sons. As Casadesus \u201cwas coming into the warehouse,\u201d he saw Izurieta \u201csitting on the steps.\u201d After Casadesus saw that the doors to the truck had been opened and some boxes had been placed on the floor of the truck, Casadesus seized the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In March 2011, a grand jury charged Izurieta and her husband with one count of conspiring to smuggle goods into the United States, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 371, and six counts of smuggling into the country dairy products and bread that customs officials had earlier marked for \u201cexport[ ] and destruction] with FDA supervision,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 545. The indictment stated that Izurieta and her husband committed ten overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, which included \u201cimporting] and caus[ing] to be imported a shipment with entry number BYV-0004551-4 ... [o]n or about December 18, 2010,\u201d and \u201carriv[ing] at a refrigerated warehouse to distribute 158 boxes of dairy products from shipment BYV-0004551-4 without declaring them on entry paperwork and without making them available for an FDA examination ... [o]n or about December 23, 2010.\u201d On May 11, 2011, a jury found Izurieta and her husband guilty of conspiring to smuggle into the United States the 398 boxes of hard cheese. The jury also found Izurieta and her husband guilty of smuggling into the country five other shipments of dairy products and bread, including a shipment of dairy products delivered in July 2010 and not destroyed by December 7, 2010. In the meantime, Izurieta\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court to revoke Izurieta\u2019s probation based on a new federal offense. The petition to revoke alleged that Izurieta had \u201ccommitted the offense of the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded, with the intent to defraud or mislead, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) and 333(a)(2).\u201d At a hearing on the petition to revoke, Casadesus testified that he had inspected the shipment of cheese because, based on the size of the container and the weight of the boxes, \u201cit almost seemed like the container was half empty.\u201d Casadesus explained that the bill of lading declared a shipment of 44,000 pounds of merchandise, but that was considerably heavier than the usual weight of 240 boxes of soft cheese. On cross-examination, defense counsel suggested that Izurieta should have been permitted to amend the entry paperwork, but Casadesus responded that customs regulations allow an importer to make \u201cminor adjustments\u201d to correct only \u201cminor clerical issues.\u201d Casadesus testified that Izurieta had arrived at the warehouse about 10 to 12 minutes after the delivery truck and that her husband had \u201cshowed up later.\u201d Casadesus stated that he did not see who had opened the truck, but that when he had entered the warehouse, the cargo doors of the truck had been opened and Izurieta had been sitting alone on a nearby set of steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Casadesus\u2019s testimony suggested that Izurieta attempted to smuggle the shipment into the United States because she knew it would not pass an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration. Casadesus testified that, in July 2010, Naver Trading received a shipment of cheese from supplier Cooproleche that customs agents seized after determining that the cheese was tainted with salmonella, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>later the Administration sent a refusal notice to Naver Trading and instructed Izurieta to destroy the July shipment by December 7, 2010. Notwithstanding this problem, Izurieta again ordered cheese from Cooproleche. Casadesus testified that the cheese seized on December 23, 2010, contained \u201cvery high levels of E. Coli and staph.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Izurieta\u2019s husband, Yuri, testified and assumed responsibility for the July and December shipments. Yuri said that he had received the refusal notice for the July shipment, but he did not tell Izurieta about the notice \u201cbecause [he] [did]n\u2019t want her to get involved in the same situation that she had before.\u201d With respect to the December shipment, Yuri testified that he waited at the warehouse for the shipment of hard cheese to arrive and accepted the shipment. Yuri made conflicting statements about his access to the shipment of cheese. Yuri first testified that, after he accepted the shipment, he opened the doors of the delivery truck and cut the seal on the pallet of cheese, but Yuri later testified that he was denied an \u201copportunity to inspect the contents of the trailer.\u201d Yuri stated that Izurieta arrived at the warehouse \u201cno more than 20 to 25 minutes after [he] opened the trailer\u201d and \u201cwas asked to get out of the car and moved ... [to] the back of the trailer by one of the agents.\u201d Yuri also testified that the customs regulations provided 20 days to amend entry paperwork for shipments, but neither he nor Izurieta were \u201callowed to make that amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Izurieta also introduced an acknowledgement dated January 23, 2011, by the owner of Cooproleche, Roberto Carlos Mora Valle. Valle stated, \u201c[b]y means of [his] letter, [he] acknowledge^] [his] responsibility in the misunderstanding and lack of communication with my client Anneri Izurieta.\u201d Valle then explained that, \u201c[o]n December 9,\u201d he had changed the shipment to Izurieta without her knowledge or permission. Valle stated that Izurieta had not known about the modification of the shipment because Valle had encountered \u201ccommunication problems due to the distance in as much as an ideal communication infrastructure does not exist where , we are located, the Internet is accessed by means of a cellular service which when the signal is weak, [and] there is much difficulty in getting connected because the service fails.\u201d In closing, Valle \u201cask[ed] for forgiveness for the lack of communication and ... making a decision that has affected my client Anneri Izurieta (Naver Trading) ... [and] ask[ed] that Mrs. Izurieta be relieved of any responsibility for the inconveniences caused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The district court revoked Izurieta\u2019s probation. The district court, \u201chaving considered the record and having heard argument of counsel, ... [found] that [Izurieta] [had] violated the terms and conditions of Probation.\u201d The district court sentenced Izurieta to ten months of imprisonment, followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">\u201cProbation revocation is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d and \u201c[o]nly upon a clear showing of abuse of that discretion will the district court\u2019s decision be disturbed.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>893 F.2d 1244, 1245 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cFurther, in evaluating the decision to revoke probation, we will accept all findings of fact made by the district court unless we determine they are clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>United States v. Holland, </em>874 F.2d 1470, 1473 (11th Cir.1989), \u201cwhether those findings are based on witness testimony or on documentary evidence,\u201d <em>Stano v. Butterworth, </em>51 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.1995). When \u201cthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tween them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 578, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Izurieta argues that there is insufficient evidence to establish that she violated a condition of her probation. Izurieta contends that she was unaware that the contents of the shipment differed from her entry paperwork and she was denied the opportunity to amend that paperwork. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">A district court has the authority to revoke probation whenever it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of her probation. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 1800, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). \u2018\u201cThe burden of showing something by a preponderance of the evidence ... simply requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence ....\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Trainor, </em>376 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Prods, of Cal., Inc. v. Constr. Laborers Pension Trust for S. Cal., </em>508 U.S. 602, 622, 113 S.Ct. 2264, 2279, 124 L.Ed.2d 539 (1993)). \u201cEvidence of a probation violation presented by the government must \u2018reasonably satisfy the judge that the conduct of the probationer has not been as good as required by the conditions of probation; evidence that would establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required.\u2019\u201d <em>Holland, </em>874 F.2d at 1472-73 (quoting <em>United States v. Rice, </em>671 F.2d 455, 458 (11th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Izurieta was charged with violating her probation by committing an offense punishable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act prohibits \u201c[t]he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, tobacco product, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a), which if committed \u201cwith the intent to defraud or mislead,\u201d provides a punishment of \u201cnot more than three years [of imprisonment],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 333(a). \u201cA food ... [is] deemed to be misbranded ... [i]f ... its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 343(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">The district court did not clearly err when it found that Izurieta imported cheese that she knew to be misbranded. Izurieta submitted entry paperwork declaring a lesser quantity and different type of cheese than what was imported. Izurieta\u2019s witnesses attributed the disparities to mistakes and to a lack of communication, but the district court was entitled to discredit that testimony. Just a few months earlier, the district court had accepted Izurieta\u2019s plea of guilty to removing from a shipment a seal designating that the shipment had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Izurieta\u2019s husband, Yuri, suggested that Izurieta would be likely to commit a similar misdeed. Yuri testified that he withheld from Izurieta information that one of her shipments had been refused entry \u201cbecause [he] [did]n\u2019t want her to get involved in the same situation that she had before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Although Izurieta submitted an acknowledgement in which her supplier accepted responsibility for the disparities, the district court was entitled to discredit the acknowledgement. <em>See Stano, </em>51 F.3d at 944; <em>see also Meader ex rel. Long v. United States, </em>881 F.2d 1056, 1061 n. 12 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cA fact-finder does not have to accept unrebutted evidence as correct, but can instead draw his own conclusions from such evidence.\u201d). Izurieta obtained the acknowledgement for purposes of the hearing and, although the supplier stated that he experienced \u201ccommunication problems,\u201d he did not state that those problems thwarted entirely his ability to contact Izurieta. The district court reasonably could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>have found unbelievable that a supplier would ship an entirely different product to a customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Izurieta argues that she was entitled to amend her entry paperwork, but the district court did not clearly err in rejecting that argument. Although Yuri testified that customs regulations allowed an importer 20 days to amend shipping paperwork, the district court reasonably could have found more credible Agent Casadesus\u2019s testimony that customs regulations allow an importer only to make \u201cminor adjustments\u201d to correct \u201cminor clerical issues.\u201d Izurieta cites, for the first time on appeal, a regulation about correcting entry documents, but the regulation does not provide for an importer to revise entry documents to reflect that a shipment contained an entirely different product. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it revoked Izurieta\u2019s probation. The mislabeling of the shipment, Izurieta\u2019s recent criminal activity, and the testimonies of Izurieta\u2019s husband and Agent Casadesus, established by a preponderance of the evidence that Izurieta, acting \u201cwith the intent to defraud or mislead,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(a), had \u201cdelivered] for introduction into interstate commerce ... [a shipment of cheese that was] misbranded,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 331(a). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that it was more probable than not that Izurieta committed a new crime and, in so doing, violated a condition of her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">We AFFIRM the revocation of Izurieta\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
