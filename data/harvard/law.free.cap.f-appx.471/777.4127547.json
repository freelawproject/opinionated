We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo claims of due process violations due to ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-20\">Contrary to the BIA\u2019s determination, petitioners were prejudiced by their former counsel\u2019s failure to present an asylum claim based on past harm to members of Rani\u2019s husband\u2019s family because petitioners had a plausible claim that this harm was on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 794 (prejudice is established when counsel\u2019s errors \u201cmay have affected the outcome of the proceedings\u201d) (citation omitted). It follows that the BIA abused its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. We therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA with instructions to reopen and remand the case to the immigration judge for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>In light of our disposition, we need not address petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b808-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
