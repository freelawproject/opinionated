Robinson, an Ohio resident proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals a jury\u2019s verdict rendered against him in his civil rights action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">On April 16, 2008, two security officers employed by Health Alliance of Greater Cincinnati observed Robinson walking through an area on the Health Alliance campus marked \u201cno trespassing.\u201d The officers instructed Robinson to stop. Once stopped, Robinson became defiant and began cursing at the officers. The officers ordered Robinson to the ground. He com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>plied. As the officers attempted to handcuff Robinson, he moved his arm in what the officers perceived to be a threatening manner. Consequently, both officers deployed their tasers. After having been tased, Robinson became compliant and was ultimately charged with resisting arrest, obstructing official business, and disorderly conduct. In July 2008, Robinson was found not guilty on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In March 2009, Robinson filed a complaint against the defendants pursuant to \u00a7 1983. After a seven day trial, a jury entered a verdict in favor of all the defendants. On appeal, Robinson argues that he was denied a fair trial because 1) the jury ignored the evidence, 2) the district court incorrectly decided the facts, and 3) the district court erred in denying his challenge under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">As the appellant, Robinson must \u201corder from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as [he] considers necessary.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(1)(A). Robinson ordered only an excerpt of the transcript from the second day of trial, which contains the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s opening statement. This excerpt provides no support for any of Robinson\u2019s claims. Consequently, we are left with no basis on which to conduct a meaningful review. Therefore, Robinson\u2019s claims raised on appeal are deemed waived. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2); <em>Hawley v. City of Cleveland, </em>24 F.3d 814, 820-22 (6th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
