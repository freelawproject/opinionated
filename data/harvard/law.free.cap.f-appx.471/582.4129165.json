We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Luchtel v. Hagemann, </em>623 F.3d 975, 978 (9th Cir.2010). We affirm summary judgment for defendants for the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation entered on March 29, 2010, and adopted by the district court in its order entered on May 24, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McCulley\u2019s motion for reconsideration, because McCulley provided no basis for reconsideration. <em>See Barber v. State of Hawaii, </em>42 F.3d 1185, 1198 (9th Cir.1994) (setting forth standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-26\">We decline to consider McCulley\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that his arrest constituted a denial of a public benefit under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. <em>See Peterson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>Highland, Music, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 1313, 1321 (9th Cir.1998) (noting general rule against entertaining arguments on appeal that were not developed before the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">McCulley\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">McCulley\u2019s letter received on January 3, 2012 is construed as a supplement to his reply brief, and has been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
