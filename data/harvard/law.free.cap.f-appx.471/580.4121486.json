Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singhkaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Manaseryan\u2019s inability to adequately explain his job functions at the nuclear power plant at which he allegedly worked, <em>see id. </em>at 1153 (approving agency\u2019s finding that an applicant\u2019s testimony was suspicious given its lack of specificity), and based on Manaseryan\u2019s failure to provide corroboration after being given an opportunity to do so, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2001). In the absence of credible testimony, Manaseryan\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-25\">Because Manaseryan\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Armenia, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Finally, to the extent Manaseryan raises translation or transcription issues related to his hearing, we lack jurisdiction to review his claim because Manaseryan did not exhaust it before the agency. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
