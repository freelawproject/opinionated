Kim was sentenced principally to 41 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of this case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">On appeal, Kim argues that (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove that she had knowledge that the prostitutes were transported across state lines; and (2) the jury instructions regarding the \u201cmotive\u201d for the interstate transportation of the prostitutes constituted plain error. We consider each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Kim\u2019s Knowledge of the Interstate Travel of the Prostitutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">First, Kim argues that there was insufficient proof of her knowledge that a coconspirator, Tae Hoon Kim (\u201cTae Hoon\u201d), transported women across state lines to her brothels in Connecticut and Washington, D.C. \u201cIn challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support [her] conviction, a defendant bears a heavy burden,\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>334 F.3d 170, 179 (2d Cir.2003), as the standard of review is \u201cexceedingly deferential,\u201d <em>United States v. Hassan, </em>578 F.3d 108, 126 (2d Cir.2008). In evaluating a sufficiency challenge, \u201cwe must credit every inference that could have been drawn in the government\u2019s favor, and affirm the conviction so long as, from the inferences reasonably drawn, the jury might fairly have concluded guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Reifler, </em>446 F.3d 65, 94 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">At trial, the government presented substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the women were transported in interstate commerce for the purpose of working as prostitutes in Kim\u2019s brothels. For example, the E-Z pass records introduced at trial chronicled Tae Hoon\u2019s transportation of a woman known as \u201cJin-Oh\u201d from Queens, New York to Washington, D.C. on February 19, 2006. During a series of telephone conversations on February 18 and 19, 2006, Kim confirmed that there was an opening in the D.C. brothel, emphasized to Tae Hoon that she needed to fill the vacancy immediately, and asked him to drop by the \u201csauna\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Su Jung Sauna in Flushing-while \u201con the way\u201d to the D.C. brothel. In other telephone calls, Kim repeatedly asked for women to \u201cgo to\u201d Connecticut or \u201cgo to\u201d Washington, D.C. From these and similar conversations, we conclude, as the District Court did, that there was \u201cample evidence from which a reasonable jury could ... find proof of the knowledge element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. An Soon Kim, </em>No. 11 Cr. 74(DLC), 2011 WL 3045230, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2011) (denying Kim\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Second, Kim argues for the first time on appeal that the District Court committed reversible error by omitting the words \u201cdominant\u201d or \u201cpredominant\u201d from the jury instructions on the \u201cmotivating purpose\u201d of the interstate travel of the prostitutes. Because there was no objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tion to the instructions below, we review the charge only for \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). To show plain error, a defendant must establish that \u201c(1) there is an \u2018error\u2019; (2) the error is \u2018clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u2019; (3) the error \u2018affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means\u2019 it \u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u2019; and (4) \u2018the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010) (quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Kim\u2019s plain error argument fails for the simple reason that there was no error. With respect to the purpose of the interstate travel, the District Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">It is not necessary for the government to prove that a person\u2019s sole purpose in transporting a woman across a state line was to have that woman engage in prostitution. A person may have several different purposes or motives for transporting a woman across state lines, and each may prompt in varying degrees the person\u2019s actions. The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, however, that a <em>significant or motivating purpose </em>of the transportation across a state line was that a woman would engage in prostitution. In other words, that activity must not have been merely incidental to the transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">A 554-55 (emphasis added). These instructions are legally sound. Neither \u201cdominant\u201d nor \u201cpredominant\u201d appear in the statutory language. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 (\u201cWhoever knowingly transports an individual in interstate ... commerce ... with intent that such individual engage in prostitution ... shall be [guilty of a crime].\u201d). Although we have previously approved a jury charge that included the phrase \u201cone of the dominant purposes,\u201d <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>148 F.3d 207, 211-13 (2d Cir.1998), we have never required such language to appear in a jury charge on \u00a7 2421. Indeed, Judge Sand recommends excluding the word \u201cdominant\u201d entirely from the charge so as to avoid confusion. <em>See </em>3 Leonard B. Sand <em>et al, Modem Federal Jury Instructions-Criminal, </em>\u00b6 64.01, Instr. 64^4, Comment (\u201cNote that the distinction between \u2018a dominant motive\u2019 and \u2018the dominant motive\u2019 is likely to confuse the jury, so the word \u2018dominant\u2019 is avoided completely in favor of the clearer terms \u2018sole purpose\u2019 and \u2018significant or motivating purpose\u2019 which are easier to understand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The charge given by the District Court, which closely tracks the charge outlined by Judge Sand, accurately and thoroughly conveyed the second element of the crime. Accordingly, we find no error, much less plain error, in the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">We have considered all of Kim\u2019s other arguments on appeal and conclude that each of them is without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
