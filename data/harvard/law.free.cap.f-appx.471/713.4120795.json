We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Telesaurus VPC, LLC v. Power, </em>623 F.3d 998, 1003 (9th Cir.2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-24\">The district court properly dismissed Sheikh\u2019s procedural due process claim because the process Sheikh was afforded, which included a full hearing before an administrative law judge, and the California statutory scheme under which she was afforded that process, provided a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (\u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-25\">Sheikh\u2019s remaining contentions, including those concerning the authority of the magistrate judge, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>We do not consider Sheikh\u2019s arguments that were not raised before the district court, including that the medical board proceedings violated the Eighth Amendment and that she was improperly removed from her residency program. <em>See Cold Mountain v. Garber, </em>375 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir.2004) (an appellate court will not consider arguments not raised before the district court absent exceptional circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The district court did not mention Sheikh\u2019s petition for writ of review in the order granting the motion to dismiss. We deem that the district court denied supplemental jurisdiction over the petition for writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Sheikh\u2019s motion for judicial notice over the Medical Board membership list and Sheikh\u2019s letter to the Medical Board is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b743-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
