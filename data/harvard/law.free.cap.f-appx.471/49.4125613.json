MacEntee, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s judgment granting Appellee International Business Machines\u2019s (\u201cIBM\u201d) motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) to dismiss her complaint, which alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to accommodate and harassment under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112 <em>et seq., </em>and discrimination under New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 290-97, all arising out of her disability-in the form of depression. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002); <em>see also Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). <em>Scherer v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, </em>347 F.3d 394, 397 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, we have long held that \u201cwhen [a] plaintiff proceeds <em>pro se, </em>... a court is obliged to construe his pleadings liberally,\u201d <em>Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, </em>537 F.3d 185, 191 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>McEachin v. McGuinnis, </em>357 F.3d 197, 200 (2d Cir.2004)), and must interpret them \u201cto raise the strongest arguments that they suggest,\u201d <em>Brownell v. Krom, </em>446 F.3d 305, 310 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, </em>351 F.3d 46, 50 (2d Cir.2003) (citation omitted)). Indeed, \u201c[t]his is particularly so when the <em>pro se </em>plaintiff alleges that her civil rights have been violated.\u201d <em>Sealed Plaintiff, </em>537 F.3d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Here, while MacEntee\u2019s failure to follow the rales of this Court in preparing her briefs and appendix have made appellate review of her claims challenging, we nonetheless proceed to consider the merits of her appeal. <em>See id. </em>In that regard, a review of the record and relevant case law leads us to conclude that the district court properly dismissed MacEntee\u2019s complaint, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in its thorough and well-reasoned decision. <em>See MacEntee v. IBM, </em>783 F.Supp.2d 434 (S.D.N.Y.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">As noted by the district court, all of MacEntee\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law. With respect to MacEntee\u2019s failure to accommodate claim, IBM accommodated her disability, and following transfer to a different department, MacEntee continued to be accommodated. Thus her claim fails as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Rodal v. Anesthesia Group of Onondaga, P.C., </em>369 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.2004) (the <em>prima facie </em>burden for a discrimination claim under the ADA requires, <em>inter alia, </em>a showing that the employer refused to make a reasonable accommodation such that plaintiff could not perform essential job functions).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">MacEntee\u2019s retaliation action fails as a matter of law because the alleged retaliatory actions \u2014 close supervision of her time entries and workplace conduct \u2014 are not cognizable \u201cadverse employment actions.\u201d As for her harassment claim, the single, derogatory remark that she claims was directed at her is not sufficiently severe to \u201cto make out a case of employment discrimination.\u201d <em>Danzer v. Norden Sys., Inc., </em>151 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">We have considered MacEntee\u2019s other arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED. It is further ORDERED that MacEntee\u2019s motion to amend her appendix to include certain papers that she filed in district court is DENIED as moot, as she filed an earlier, substantially identical motion that we have already granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
