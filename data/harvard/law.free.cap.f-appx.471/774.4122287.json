As the facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here except as necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-25\">Manuelito argues that the self-defense jury instruction was erroneous because it did not explicitly state that the government has the burden of disproving each of the three elements of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The government first contends that Manuelito waived this argument under the \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine because he requested the model jury instruction that the court provided to the jury. <em>See United States v. Guthrie, </em>931 F.2d 564, 567 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cWhen the defendant himself proposes the jury instruction he later attacks on appeal, review is denied under the \u2018invited error\u2019 doctrine.\u201d). We disagree. The invited error doctrine only applies if the defendant was aware that he was relinquishing a known right. <em>See United States v. Romm, </em>455 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>F.3d 990, 1004 n. 17 (9th Cir.2006). There is no evidence in the record that Manuelito\u2019s trial counsel believed that the model jury instructions were flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">As to the merits of Manuelito\u2019s argument, we agree with the government that the trial court properly instructed the jury. The trial court used this circuit\u2019s Model Criminal Jury Instruction 6.7, which states that the government \u201cmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in reasonable self-defense.\u201d In <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>537 F.3d 1075, 1083 (9th Cir.2008), we stated that this model jury instruction \u201cproperly informed the jury that the government bore the burden of disproving [the defendant\u2019s] defense.\u201d Manuelito relies on <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>254 F.3d 872 (9th Cir.2001) and <em>United States v. Sanehez-Lima, </em>161 F.3d 545 (9th Cir.1998), in which we reversed convictions because of improper self-defense jury instructions. However, those cases are inapposite because they involved an older version of the self-defense model jury instruction that did not specifically instruct the jury that the government had the burden of disproving self-defense. Indeed, in <em>Pierre, </em>we stated that the revised jury instruction, used in Manuelito\u2019s case, \u201chas been amended to reflect the holding in <em>Sanchez-Lima.\u201d </em>254 F.3d at 876, n. 1. Accordingly, the jury instruction was appropriate, and we affirm Manuelito\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b804-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
