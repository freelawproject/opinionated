Trudeau, Jr., appeals from the district court\u2019s oral ruling of March 22, 2012, denying Trudeau\u2019s Motion to Review Revocation of Defendant\u2019s Bond. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-20\">\u201c[Ujnless we believe that the findings of the district judge were clearly erroneous or that [s]he committed an error of law,\u201d we will affirm the revocation of bail. <em>United States v. LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Gotti, </em>794 F.2d 773, 778 (2d Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-21\">The district court found probable cause to believe that Trudeau had committed four crimes while on release. Furthermore, the district court found that Trudeau had failed to rebut the presumption that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions of release\u201d would assure that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>would not \u201cpose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b). Neither of these findings was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Trudeau argues principally that the four crimes were only minor economic crimes that did not warrant revocation of bail. Even assuming that they were minor economic crimes, the district court acted within its discretion when it found that a person who apparently had committed four additional crimes while on bail posed a danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Trudeau also argues that the length of his pre-trial detention is excessive. Much of the delay, however, is attributable to Trudeau himself. Indeed, Trudeau failed to find new counsel in a timely manner (after declining the trial court\u2019s offer to appoint one), and he also declined the government\u2019s offer to advance the trial date. The record reflects no intentional or unwarranted delay by the prosecution. Nonetheless, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision without prejudice to Trudeau filing a motion in this Court to recall the mandate and reinstate his appeal if there are further substantial delays not attributable to him. <em>See United States v. Salameh, </em>84 F.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir.1996) (holding that \u201ca court of appeals always has authority to restore appellate jurisdiction over a case that has been remanded to a district court\u201d through grant of a motion to recall mandate).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We have considered Trudeau\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
