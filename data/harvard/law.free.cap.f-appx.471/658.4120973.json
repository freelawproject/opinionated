We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-21\">Fischer contends that the district court abused its discretion by imposing the mandatory condition of drug testing, and by imposing a number of special conditions of supervised release. Because Fischer did not object at sentencing, we review his contentions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>545 F.3d 743, 747 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-22\">The district court did not err in imposing a drug testing condition diming Fischer\u2019s supervised release because drug testing is a required condition of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Further, the district court did not err when it imposed a condition requiring Fischer to perform 20 hours of community service. <em>See Vega, </em>545 F.3d at 748-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">The district court plainly erred, however, by imposing supervised release conditions relating to alcohol use and participation in a substance abuse treatment programs, because there was no evidence at the time of sentencing that Fischer had an alcohol or substance abuse problem. <em>See United States v. Betts, </em>511 F.3d 872, 877-79 (9th Cir.2007). As a result, we vacate that portion of the sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-24\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Aqd\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
