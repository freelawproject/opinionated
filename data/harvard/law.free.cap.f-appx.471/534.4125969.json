See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because the amendment did not lower Broadwater\u2019s guidelines range, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Broadwater was convicted by a jury of two counts of distributing crack cocaine and one count of possessing crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Broadwater within his applicable guidelines range to three concurrent 300-month sentences. We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Broadwater, </em>65 Fed.Appx. 571 (7th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">In 2009 Broadwater moved under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on amendments 706 and 713 to the guidelines, which retroactively reduced from 34 to 32 the base offense level for the amount of crack cocaine for which he was held responsible (321.2 grams). U.S.S.G.App. C, Vol. Ill 226-231, 253 (2011). The district court granted the motion and reduced his sentence to 236 months, the middle of the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">In 2011 Broadwater again moved under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence, this time based on amendment 750, which altered the drug quantity tables based on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. U.S.S.GApp. C, Vol. Ill 391-98, 416-21. But the district court denied Broadwater\u2019s motion after concluding that the amendment did not lower his guidelines range any further, and thus he was not eligible for a reduction in his sentence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">On appeal Broadwater contends that the district court erred in finding that amendment 750 did not reduce his guidelines range. His argument is difficult to follow, but he seems to suggest that amendments 706 and 750 in tandem qualify him for a further reduction in his sentence than he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-15\">Broadwater misapprehends how \u00a7 3582(c)(2) operates. A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if an amendment to the guidelines lowers the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2688-89, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). But this was not the case with Broadwater. His base offense level had already been lowered to 32 by amendment 706 and could not be reduced further by amendment 750, which assigns the same base offense level of 32 to defendants like Broadwater who are responsible for between 280 to 840 grams of crack cocaine. Because his guidelines range did not change, the district court could not further reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
