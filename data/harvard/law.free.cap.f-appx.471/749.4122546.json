Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Even assuming that Hart-well\u2019s indications triggered his counsel\u2019s duty to consult, the Nevada state court could reasonably conclude that Hartwell was not deprived of an appeal, given that the Nevada Supreme Court directed the state trial court to consider all of Hart-well\u2019s \u201cdirect appeal\u201d claims even if it determined that counsel was not ineffective; Hartwell argued his claims to the state trial court with the assistance of counsel; the state trial court rejected those claims on the merits; and the Nevada Supreme Court rejected the only claim Hartwell elected to raise on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We also reject Hartwell\u2019s argument that the Nevada sentencing court violated his federal due process rights by enhancing his sentence under Nevada\u2019s habitual criminal statute, and therefore need not reach the question whether this claim was exhausted in state court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2). The Nevada Supreme Court could reasonably determine, pursuant to state law, that Hartwell effectively stipulated to at least five prior felony convictions. <em>See Hodges v. State, </em>119 Nev. 479, 78 P.3d 67, 70 (2003). Moreover, even if the Nevada Supreme Court erred, an error of state law such as this one, which does not rise to the level of a federal due process violation, cannot serve as the basis for federal habeas relief. <em>See Swarthout v. Cooke, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 859, 861, 178 L.Ed.2d 732 (2011); <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
