R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b784-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Kevin Falcon appeals from the 110-month sentence imposed on remand following his guilty-plea conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C: \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Falcon argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, in light of both his poor health and the relative seriousness of his offense. A correctly-calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range is \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d for sentencing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As no basis appears in the record for the district court\u2019s selection of a base offense level of 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), and as it seems likely, instead, that Falcon\u2019s base offense level should have been assessed as 14, under section 2K2.1(a)(6), we cannot conclude that the 110-month sentence was either procedurally or substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">We are in receipt of Falcon\u2019s pro se motion to obtain new appellate counsel. In view of our decision to remand, we deny that motion as moot. In his motion, Falcon asserts that Judge Haddon is biased against him. We find no basis in the record for Falcon\u2019s assertion and, therefore, decline to reassign the case to another judge on remand. This panel retains jurisdiction over any future appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A4t\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
