Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-24\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Uzzhina\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because Uzzhina filed her motion more than three years after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, and she did not establish that her motion is subject to any exceptions to the filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Uzzhina\u2019s due process contentions are therefore not persuasive. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority. Mejia<em>-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 824 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-26\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Uzzhina\u2019s unexhausted contention that equitable tolling should apply in her case. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Ami1\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
