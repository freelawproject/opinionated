Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-22\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b521-23\">Fernando Martinez-Bravo, who is represented by counsel, petitions for review of a final order by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA dismissed his appeal from the decision of an Immigration Judge (IJ) who denied his request for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-24\">Martinez-Bravo is a native and citizen of Mexico who has been present in the United States since at least 2000. In 2006, the government issued a notice to appear, charging Martinez-Bravo with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(I). Martinez-Bravo conceded removability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sought cancellation of removal. Following a hearing, the IJ denied Martinez-Bravo\u2019s application and ordered him removed to Mexico. The IJ found that Martinez-Bravo failed to demonstrate that his removal would result in the requisite hardship to his family. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). On appeal, the BIA dismissed the case on the sole ground that Martinez-Bravo failed to establish the requisite hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Generally, the Attorney General has discretion to cancel the removal of a non-permanent resident alien if, among other things, the alien \u201cestablishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a qualifying relative. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Although federal courts are divested of jurisdiction to review decisions concerning cancellation of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I), an alien may seek judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). An alien may also seek judicial review of a claim that the BIA departed from its own precedent in denying discretionary relief. <em>Ettienne v. Holder, </em>659 F.3d 513, 517 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Martinez-Bravo claims that the BIA departed from its own precedent in dismissing his appeal. He asks us to compare the facts of his case with those of the precedential decisions cited by the BIA. Although a claim of departure from agency precedent is subject to judicial review, we lack \u201cjurisdiction over claims that can be evaluated only by engaging in head-to-head comparisons between the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case and those of precedential decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Martinez-Bravo also claims that the BIA violated his due process rights by finding that he failed to demonstrate the requisite hardship. However, Martinez-Bravo has no protected liberty interest in obtaining discretionary relief. <em>Ukpabi v. Mukasey, </em>525 F.3d 403, 408 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The petition is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
