He argues that the district court erred by failing to strictly comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 as to his 2009 state court conviction of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver before using that conviction to enhance his mandatory minimum sentence to 20 years of imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). Parra-Perez next argues that the district court erred by basing its determination that he had incurred a prior conviction for a felony drug offense entirely on the presentence report (PSR) and the enhanced felony information, without reference to the kinds of documents required by <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). He further contends that his criminal history score was incorrect if the enhancement conviction was not properly proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">None of the contentions raised on appeal were raised in the district court. Those contentions therefore are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>491 F.3d 237, 244 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2007). To establish reversible plain error, a defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the defendant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">Here, appellate counsel concedes that trial counsel was provided with copies of the indictment and judgment relevant to Parra-Perez\u2019s 2009 Texas conviction, and that those documents prove the conviction alleged in the Government\u2019s enhanced penalty information. We treat counsel\u2019s concessions as judicially binding admissions of fact. <em>See Campbell v. Sonat Offshore Drilling, Inc., </em>979 F.2d 1115, 1119 (5th Cir.1992); <em>City Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, </em>907 F.2d 536, 544 (5th Cir.1990). Parra-Perez thus cannot demonstrate that he could have raised a successful challenge to the use of the 2009 Texas conviction, and he cannot demonstrate that reliance on the PSR and enhanced penalty information affected his substantial rights. He therefore cannot demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Mata, </em>491 F.3d at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
