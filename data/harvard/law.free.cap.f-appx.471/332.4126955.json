In this appeal, he argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because his history and circumstances counsel in favor of a lesser sentence. Because Hernandez-Ochoa did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, we review this argument for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-21\">Our review of the record, the parties\u2019 filings, and pertinent jurisprudence establishes that Hernandez-Ochoa has not shown error, much less plain error, in connection with this challenge to his sentence. This is because his arguments on this issue do not establish that the district court gave too little weight to an important sentencing consideration or gave too much weight to an unimportant consideration. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Rather, his contentions amount to no more than a disagreement with the propriety of the sentence, which does not suffice to show error concerning it. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Additionally, Hernandez-Ochoa\u2019s arguments may fairly be read as a request that this court reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. This request should be denied. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Finally, Hernandez-Ochoa\u2019s challenge to the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-guidelines sentence is, as he concedes, unavailing under our precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
