Arzola-E spinoza contends that the district court erred in calculating his guidelines range of imprisonment when it applied a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 based on its finding that he used minors during the commission of his offense. He claims that his children were merely present and that alone their presence was insufficient to support the enhancement. The government counters that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We have held that a guidelines calculation error may be harmless even when the district court has not considered the correct guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 716-18 (5th Cir.2010). First, \u201cthe [g]overnment must convincingly demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a sentence outside the correct Guidelines range for the same reasons it gave for imposing a sentence outside the miscalculated Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718-19. Second, the government \u201cmust show that the ... sentence the district court imposed was not influenced in any way by the erroneous Guidelines calculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The government has met this burden in the instant case. The district court would have found that without the enhancement the guidelines range was inadequate for the same reasons that it found that with the enhancement the higher guidelines range was inadequate. Further, it is apparent from the record that any erroneous guidelines computation did not influence the sentence. Immediately after overruling Arzola-Espinoza\u2019s objection to the enhancement during the sentencing hearing, the district court explained to counsel that the sentence \u201cwill be the sentence with or without the guideline whichever I fashion in this case.\u201d The district court explained that (1) it was imposing the non-guideline sentence because the guidelines calculations accounted for only one of ArzolaEspinoza\u2019s imported loads, and (2) statements given by Arzola-Espinoza and his wife corroborated that the instant offense involved his tenth load. As there is evidence in the record that the district court would have imposed \u201cthe very same sentence\u201d regardless whether the two-level enhancement was applied in error, any error was harmless. <em>Ibarrca-Luna, </em>628 F.3d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
