Haider maintains that the BIA erred in finding that he failed to establish changed conditions in Pakistan material to his application for asylum and withholding of removal under 8 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2007) or under the Convention Against Torture. Haider claims that he provided the BIA with evidence that members of his political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), faced increased violence in Pakistan because of their membership in the PPP.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">An alien, like Haider, may move to reopen his immigration proceedings \u201c[t]o apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality ... if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(H); <em>see Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 631 (5th Cir.2005). The evidence submitted by Haider, however, did not show a change in conditions in Pakistan since the time of his exclusion hearing. <em>See In re S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 253 (BIA 2007). Although the evidence showed that violence and political unrest were common in Pakistan, it did not show that PPP members were subject to violence based on their PPP membership or that the PPP had lost control of the Pakistani government.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">Because the BIA\u2019s finding that Haider had not established changed country conditions material to his applications for relief is supported by substantial evidence, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Haider\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 631-33. Accordingly, we de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>cline to address Haider\u2019s arguments that he established prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
