Andrade-Bolanos (Andrade), a native and citizen of Mexico, challenges the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that affirmed the denial of his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief by the Immigration Judge (IJ) under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). <em>See </em>108 Stat. 382, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 136 Cong. Rec. S17,491-92 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18 (CAT implementation). Andrade challenges the IJ\u2019s ruling denying relief on the basis of an adverse credibility determination, but he fails to brief any argument regarding the IJ\u2019s alternative ruling that Andrade\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal must be denied even if his testimony were considered credible because Andrade\u2019s evidence failed to show that he was entitled to such relief. Thus, he has abandoned any challenge to the IJ\u2019s alternative denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">Similarly, Andrade fails to challenge the determination by the BIA and the IJ that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>no evidence establishes that Andrade faces a clear probability of torture in Mexico \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to the denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
