Amendment 750 lowered the crack cocaine base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1. The Amendment became retroactive on November 1, 2011. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (2011). Because Rutherford was sentenced for committing offenses involving crack cocaine, he argues that he should be resentenced so that he may benefit from Amendment 750. After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-22\">In 1995, a jury convicted Rutherford of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1); possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 2); and distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 3). Because he had at least two prior felony controlled-substance convictions, Rutherford was sentenced under the career offender guideline \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-23\">A district court is not authorized to grant a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cwhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based....\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-24\">The district court did not have authority to reduce Rutherford\u2019s sentence because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range for career offenders. Amendment 750 only changed the base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1. Although Amendment 750 would have reduced Rutherford\u2019s adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 by six levels, the district court sentenced him as a career offender, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, the changes enacted in Amendment 750 have no effect on Rutherford\u2019s applicable sentencing range, and he cannot obtain relief from a motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
