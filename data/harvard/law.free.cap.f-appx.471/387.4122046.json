Youree argues that he is actually innocent of the career offender enhancement on account of the vacatur of his 1972 predicate conviction for voluntary manslaughter. This argument was unsuccessfully raised in his untimely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Youree v. United States, </em>Nos. 5:09-CV-90062 HL, 5:02-CR-62 HL, 2009 WL 6338019 (M.D.Ga. Sept.17, 2009) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief. Youree\u2019s argument that his actual innocence claim is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition is foreclosed by <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000), which held that a petitioner\u2019s argument that he is actually innocent of being a career offender is not the type of argument that warrants review under \u00a7 2241 because the petitioner is not asserting that he is actually innocent of the underlying crime for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ment\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
