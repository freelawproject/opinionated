He contends that the government\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). It is undisputed that McGinty is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of the EAJA, having secured a reversal of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and a remand. <em>See Gutierrez v. Barnhart, </em>274 F.3d 1255, 1257 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">\u201cThe decision whether to award fees under the EAJA, including the district court\u2019s conclusion that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258. The government\u2019s position was substantially justified if it had \u201ca reasonable basis both in law and in fact.\u201d <em>Meinhold v. United States Dep\u2019t of Def., </em>123 F.3d 1275, 1277 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>131 F.3d 842 (9th Cir.1997). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201csubstantially justified\u201d does not mean \u201c \u2018justified to a high degree,\u2019 but rather [means] \u2018justified in substance or in the main\u2019 \u2014 that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). And \u201c[t]he term \u2018position\u2019 includes the underlying agency action and the legal position of the United States during litigation.\u201d <em>Andrew v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 875, 878 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Here, the government had the burden of demonstrating that its position was substantially justified with respect to (1) the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination regarding McGinty\u2019s subjective symptom testimony and (2) the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the written statement and hearing testimony of McGinty\u2019s lay witness. The ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on two specific grounds. First, the ALJ found that there were \u201cvery few clinical findings\u201d to support McGinty\u2019s subjective symptom testimony. Second, the ALJ found that McGinty\u2019s daily activities were inconsistent with this testimony. Moreover, these two grounds also supported the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ALJ\u2019s rejection of the testimony and statement of McGinty\u2019s lay witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Those grounds have a reasonable basis in law because a lack of medical evidence and a claimant\u2019s daily activities are both factors that an ALJ can take into account when making a credibility determination. <em>Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 681 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 346 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc). And both grounds have a reasonable basis in fact because they find support in the record. <em>See Hardisty v. Astrue, </em>592 F.3d 1072, 1080 (9th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2443, 179 L.Ed.2d 1215 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Moreover, because the ALJ rejected the lay witness testimony for the same reasons he rejected McGinty\u2019s testimony, the finding that the lay witness testimony was entitled to \u201clittle weight\u201d is also substantially justified. <em>See Valentine v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>574 F.3d 685, 694 (9th Cir.2009) (indicating that third-party testimony can be rejected for the same reasons provided for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the government had met its burden of establishing substantial justification and in thus denying McGinty\u2019s EAJA petition. Because McGinty is not entitled to EAJA fees, it is not necessary to reach the question McGinty raises of how such fees should be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b710-16\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
