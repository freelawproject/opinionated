He contends that the district court imposed the statutory maximum revocation sentence based on his need for mental health treatment in violation of <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), which provides that a prison term may not be lengthened for the purpose of providing rehabilitation. We disagree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">We will not disturb a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release that is within the prescribed statutory range and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437-39 (4th Cir.2006). In making this determination, we first consider whether the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438. \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>initial inquiry takes a more deferential appellate posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of discretion than reasonableness review for [Guidelines sentences.\u201d Uni<em>ted States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Although a district court \u201cultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum,\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements in the federal Sentencing Guidelines manual, as well as the statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Citing <em>Tapia, </em>Everett contends that his sentence is plainly unreasonable because the district court improperly considered his need for mental health treatment. Although counsel argued extensively about Everett\u2019s mental health concerns, noting that Everett\u2019s \u201cmental health situation seems to be driving this case to a very large extent,\u201d our review of the revocation hearing transcript leads us to conclude that the district court did not rely on Everett\u2019s need for mental health treatment in determining the appropriate sentence. Rather, the district court considered Everett\u2019s history of angry outbursts when frustrated or when told what to do, his difficulties accepting the authority of the court or the probation officer, his prior violations for which he was allowed to continue on supervision, and the \u201cpatterns and practices\u201d that Everett exhibited from an early age. The court did not mention Everett\u2019s need for treatment in connection with the imposition of the 24-month sentence, but rather stated that it considered the mental health issue \u201cin mitigation.\u201d Only after the court imposed sentence and in response to Everett\u2019s attorney\u2019s request, the court recommended that Everett be imprisoned at FCI Butner and that he be given a mental health evaluation. We conclude that the 24-month revocation sentence does not run afoul of <em>Tapia. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the revocation judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
