Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Sowe v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1285 (9th Cir.2008). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-25\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Drammeh\u2019s request for a humanitarian grant of asylum because he did not raise this claim to the agency. <em>See Rodas-Mendoza v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1237, 1240 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-26\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Drammeh failed to establish that his experiences in Sierra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Leone rose to the level of persecution, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003), or that he was targeted on account of a protected ground, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Drammeh failed to establish a future fear of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1018 (possibility of future persecution too speculative). Accordingly, Drammeh\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Because Drammeh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b771-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
