Peterson argues that the district court improperly determined that his prior Oregon state convictions for vehicle flight pursuant to Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 811.540(l)(b)(A) were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under the modified categorical approach of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">In <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), the Court held that Indiana\u2019s felony vehicle flight statute categorically qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Because cases interpreting the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d are controlling as to whether a particular offense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines as well, <em>see United States v. Coronado, </em>603 F.3d 706, 709 (9th Cir.2010), and because we have held that there is no material distinction between the Indiana and Oregon vehicle flight statutes, <em>United States v. Snyder, </em>643 F.3d 694, 699 (9th Cir.2011), we must affirm Peterson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Imposing a career offender sentence does not violate Peterson\u2019s due process right, even though he was not on notice that his prior convictions were categorically crimes of violence at the time he committed the underlying offense in 2006. In 2006, the law put him on notice that his conduct subjected him to the career offender enhancement under the <em>modified </em>categorical approach. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>422 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.2005). Because our decision today \u2014 that the categorical approach applies \u2014 is not so materially different as to be prejudicial to Peterson in formulating a defense at sentencing, affirming his sentence is not a violation of due process. Peterson\u2019s request to remand this case to the district court for resentencing and consideration of a downward departure is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b597-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
