Ramos-Marrufo\u2019s total offense level was enhanced by 16 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on the district court\u2019s determination that his prior Illinois conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance amounted to a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months of imprisonment. The presentence report (PSR), to which Ramos-Marrufo did not object and which the district court adopted, provided that in 2003, Ramos-Marrufo was convicted in Illinois of one count of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance and one count of criminal drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">For the first time on appeal, RamosMarrufo argues that the district court erred by relying solely on the PSR to conclude that his prior unlawful delivery of a controlled substance conviction was a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because the Illinois statute under which he was convicted prohibits the unlawful delivery of controlled substances, their analogs, or counterfeit substances. Because he failed to object to the 16-level enhancement in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.2009). When those elements are shown, we have the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government has supplemented the record on appeal with an indictment and judgment documenting Ramos-Marrufo\u2019s prior delivery and conspiracy convictions. \u201cTherefore, we must determine whether the district court plainly erred in imposing the sentence enhancement based on the record before us as supplemented with the state court documents concerning [Ramos-Marrufo\u2019s] conviction[s].\u201d <em>Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Ramos-Marrufo\u2019s state court papers reveal that although his prior delivery conviction involved either cocaine or its analog, his prior conspiracy conviction involved actual cocaine. He was sentenced to eight years and six months of imprisonment on both counts. Because RamosMarrufo\u2019s prior conspiracy conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months,\u201d he has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred by applying the 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>level enhancement. See <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
