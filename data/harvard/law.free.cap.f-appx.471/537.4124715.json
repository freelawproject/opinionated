She also appeals the tax court\u2019s denial of her motion, under Tax Court Rule 162, to vacate its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">After careful review, we agree with the tax court\u2019s decision upholding Hyde\u2019s 2006 liabilities. <em>See Campbell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>164 F.3d 1140, 1142 (8th Cir.1999) (tax court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo). We also find no abuse of discretion in the tax court\u2019s imposition of the section 6673 penalty, <em>see May v. Comm\u2019r, </em>752 F.2d 1301, 1304-05 (8th Cir.1985) (standard of review), or in the tax court\u2019s denial of her Rule 162 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-18\">. The Honorable David Laro, United States Tax Court Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
