Because we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not based on legal error and was supported by substantial evidence, <em>Bray v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir.2009), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Conley argues that the ALJ \u201cerred as a matter of law in its credibility analysis as to Conley herself.\u201d The ALJ found that Conley suffers from systemic lupus erythematosus and fibromyalgia, both of which could reasonably produce the symptoms complained of, and that there was no evidence of malingering. An adverse credibility finding must therefore be based on clear and convincing reasons. <em>See Carmicke v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996)). In making the credibility determination, the ALJ may consider \u201cinconsistencies between the claimant\u2019s testimony and ... her conduct, daily activities, and work record.\u201d <em>Bray, </em>554 F.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">In finding that Conley was \u201cnot entirely credible,\u201d the ALJ pointed to specific evidence for rejecting Conley\u2019s subjective complaints, including that Conley was not forthcoming about providing regular care for three of her grandchildren, two of which are toddlers and require significant attention. The ALJ also cited Conley\u2019s ability to care for her personal needs, take care of her dog, visit with her mother and friends daily, perform household chores, watch up to four hours of movies per day, and swim on a regular basis in the summer of 2007. Although the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Conley\u2019s swimming is questionable, because he cited to several clear and convincing reasons for finding Conley\u2019s testimony not entirely credible, the ALJ did not err in discounting Conley\u2019s subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">Conley next contends that the ALJ committed legal error because he failed to properly defer to the medical specialty expertise of Dr. Van Belois, diminished Dr. Van Belois\u2019s contribution and expertise by dissecting the evidence, and mischaracterized medical evidence such that it contributed to the diminution of Dr. Van Belois\u2019s specialty. The ALJ is responsible for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>solving conflicts in the medical record. <em>Carmickle, </em>588 F.3d at 1164. In general, opinions of a treating physician should be given substantial weight, <em>Bray, </em>554 F.3d at 1228, because she has a \u201cgreater opportunity to know and observe the patient,\u201d <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ may reject the contradicted opinion of a treating or examining physician only by providing \u201c \u2018specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u2019\u201d <em>Widmark v. Barnhart, </em>454 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The ALJ credited Dr. Van Belois\u2019s early opinions with only \u201cminimal to middle weight\u201d because the treatment had just begun, her statements were brief and conclusory, and the opinion was based, in part, on Conley\u2019s own subjective complaints, which the ALJ found to be not entirely credible. <em>See Bray, </em>554 F.3d at 1228; <em>Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir.2005). The ALJ discounted Dr. Van Belois\u2019s later statements because they conflicted directly with Conley\u2019s claimed daily activities and were again heavily based on Conley\u2019s subjective complaints. Because the ALJ cited to specific and legitimate reasons for discounting Dr. Van Belois\u2019s opinion, he did not commit legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Relying almost exclusively on her previously rejected claim that the ALJ erred in not according \u201cgreater weight\u201d to Dr. Van Belois\u2019s opinion, Conley also argues that the ALJ failed to consider the record as a whole and thus erred in calculating her residual functioning capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). As explained above, we think that the ALJ properly discounted Conley\u2019s subjective complaints and the opinion of Dr. Van Belois. We therefore hold that the ALJ did not err in determining that Conley\u2019s RFC was something other than what Dr. Van Belois suggested. Rather, because the evidence as a whole \u2014 including medical evidence, evidence of Conley taking care of her grandchildren for several hours a day, and other evidence of her daily activities \u2014 could lead a reasonable mind to accept the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Conley had an RFC to perform at least light work, we do not find any legal error or that the evidence was insufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a); <em>see also </em>Social Security Ruling 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184, at *2 (July 2,1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
