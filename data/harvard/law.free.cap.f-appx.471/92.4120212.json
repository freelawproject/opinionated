The District Court certified for appeal two ineffective assistance of counsel claims and one sentencing issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Walker also claims on this appeal that his new sentence is unreasonable. This issue was not covered by the certificate of appealability. Nevertheless, we will permit the review of the newly imposed sentence because otherwise Wilson would have no opportunity to have it reviewed. <em>See United States v. Hadden, </em>475 F.3d 652, 664 (4th Cir.2007) (holding that, on appeal of a \u00a7 2255 order, to the extent that a claim is made that the newly imposed sentence is not in conformity with the Constitution or Sentencing Guidelines, then the prisoner \u201cis appealing a new criminal sentence and therefore need not obtain a COA under \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a) and 1291.\u201d); <em>United States v. Futch, </em>518 F.3d 887, 894 (11th Cir.2008). For the reasons discussed below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On May 16, 2001, a grand jury issued a superseding indictment charging Walker and two co-defendants with seven counts arising from their participation in a shootout at the Lebanon Village Apartments with a rival drug gang from New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Walker pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In the midst of trial, Walker\u2019s co-defendants entered into guilty pleas with the government. After the guilty pleas were entered with the trial court, Walker\u2019s trial counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing that no curative instruction would adequately address why Walker remained in the courtroom and that the testimony of two witnesses would not have been admitted had Walker been the only defendant. The trial court denied the motion but gave the jury a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">During the trial, Dennis Rittle also twice stated in his testimony that Walker had been shot, despite the District Court\u2019s pretrial ruling that any reference to an unrelated shooting in which Walker had been injured was inadmissible. Rittle\u2019s statements were brief and addressed the injury Walker sustained during the July 21, 2000, shooting. The government did not improperly elicit this testimony and, in response, sought to avoid drawing further attention to the testimony by directing Rittle to other subjects. Walker\u2019s trial counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Rittle\u2019s two references to Walker\u2019s shooting injuries were inappropriate. The trial court denied Walker\u2019s motion. Walker\u2019s counsel did not seek a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The jury found Walker guilty on all counts. The District Court sentenced Walker to 681 months\u2019 imprisonment. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>appeal, we vacated his sentence in part and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>136 Fed.Appx. 524, 526 (3d Cir.2005). On remand, the District Court reduced Walker\u2019s sentence to 622 months. In a subsequent appeal, we affirmed Walker\u2019s second sentence. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>251 Fed.Appx. 735 (3d Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied Walker v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 1137, 127 S.Ct. 2984, 168 L.Ed.2d 713 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Walker then filed a <em>pro se </em>habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging fourteen claims of error including ineffective assistance by trial and appellate counsel. The court held an evidentiary hearing on April 20, 2010, and permitted Walker to file a supplemental post-hearing brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">During the evidentiary hearing, Walker\u2019s trial counsel testified that he had moved for a mistrial \u2014 rather than requesting a curative instruction \u2014 after the co-defendants pleaded guilty and were excused from the trial because he \u201cbasically[] didn\u2019t think the curative instruction was adequate \u2014 [he] didn\u2019t think the curative instruction would suffice.\u201d With respect to Rittle\u2019s statements about Walker\u2019s gunshot wound, although he \u201c[had] no independent recollection of what [he] was thinking at that time\u201d because the trial occurred eight years before, counsel stated that he did not seek a curative instruction concerning those statements because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to cause it anymore \u2014 give anymore importance to it or bring it up again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The court granted in part and denied in part Walker\u2019s habeas petition, vacated his conviction as to Count 4, and resentenced him to 289 months imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to the curative instruction related to the co-defendants\u2019 absence, the court noted that \u201cit certainly would have been preferable for the court to have explicitly stated that the absence of other defendants should not be held against Walker, rather than simply stating that the reasons for their absence was not a matter for the jury\u2019s concern,\u201d but ultimately concluded that the district court\u2019s instruction was not so \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d as to call the proceedings into question. As for the shooting incident, the court found that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to request a curative instruction was \u201cthe sort of strategic decision made by trial counsel that falls well within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">We have appellate jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2255(d). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to the District Court\u2019s factual findings in a habeas proceeding. <em>United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 258 (3d Cir.2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">To succeed on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, Walker must demonstrate (1) that trial counsel\u2019s performance was unconstitutionally deficient and that (2) such performance prejudiced Walker\u2019s defense. <em>Boyd v. Waymart, </em>579 F.3d 330, 350 (3d Cir.2009) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686-87, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). We agree with the District Court\u2019s determinations on both claims of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>As for his sentence, Walker first contends that it was unreasonable because it should have been reduced by six months for time served on a related state offense. We have determined, however, after our review of the record that the six months imprisonment in question was served on an unrelated aggravated assault offense. Thus, the District Court did not err in failing to credit Walker for that period. As to the claim that the sentence was unreasonable, our review also convinces us that, in imposing the below-the-guidelines sentence, the District court listened carefully to Walker and his counsel and considered their contentions and the applicable \u00a7 3553 factors. <em>See United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 569 (3d Cir.2009). We conclude that the greatly reduced sentence was reasonable and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We will therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010), Walker withdrew his application for certificate of appealability on the sentencing issue. (Appellant Br. at 16 n. 10.) We therefore do not have jurisdiction to consider this issue. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">. Walker was charged with six counts: (1) conspiracy to possess, use, carry, brandish, and discharge firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and (o); (2) possessing, brandishing and discharging a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking on March 13, 2000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); (3) possession of firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking on July 12, 2000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); (4) possessing, brandishing and discharging a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking between July 18, 2000, and July 21, 2000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); (5) criminal conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, cocaine hydrochloride and heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; and (6) distribution and possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, cocaine hydrochloride, heroin, and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). (Dkt.48.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. The District Court granted Walker\u2019s motion as to his claim that the trial court erred when it imposed two consecutive sentences for possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking. Relying on <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>592 F.3d 467, 475 (3d Cir.2010), the District Court held that because there was no way of knowing which predicate offense was associated with which \u00a7 924(c) charge, it could not \"simply assume that the \u00a7 924(c) charges were tied to the separate predicate offenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
