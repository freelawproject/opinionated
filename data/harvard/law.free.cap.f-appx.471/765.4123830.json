We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Sisavath contends that the state appellate court erred in holding that statements admitted during his trial in violation of the Confrontation Clause were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, under <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). We agree with the district court, for the reasons described in greater detail in that court\u2019s order, that the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law as determined by the United States Supreme Court, nor was it based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts, in view of the other evidence supporting Sisavath\u2019s conviction. Because Sisavath failed to satisfy the standard set by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), his petition was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Sisavath moves to expand the certificate of appealability to include two issues not certified by the district court. We decline to expand the COA to include these issues because Sisavath has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as to those claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 9th Cir. R. 22-l(e). Sisavath\u2019s motion, filed on June 7, 2010, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
