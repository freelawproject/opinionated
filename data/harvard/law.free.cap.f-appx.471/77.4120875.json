(together, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), appeal from an order of the District Court entered March 31, 2011, granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Lakeland Central School District (\u201cthe District\u201d) on Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for tuition reimbursement under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400, <em>et seq. </em>In the District Court, Plaintiffs sought review of decisions by an Impartial Hearing Officer (\u201cIHO\u201d) and a State Review Officer (\u201cSRO\u201d) each denying their claim for tuition reimbursement for the private school in which they enrolled A.S. after unilaterally determining that the District had failed, in its Individualized Education Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) for A.S., to offer a free appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d), as required under the IDEA. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment by a district court in an IDEA case. <em>A.C. ex. rel. M.C. v. Bd. of Educ. of Chappaqua Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>553 F.3d 165, 171 (2d Cir.2009). In doing so, we recognize that \u201cthe role of the federal courts in reviewing state educational decisions under the IDEA is \u2018circumscribed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>489 F.3d 105, 112 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Muller v. Comm. on Special Educ., </em>145 F.3d 95, 101 (2d Cir.1998)). \u201cAlthough the district court must engage in an independent review of the administrative record and make a determination based on a \u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 ... such review \u2018is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cerra v. Pawling Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>427 F.3d 186, 191-92 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Mrs. B. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Milford Bd. of Educ., </em>103 F.3d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982)). We are thus required to \u201cgive \u2018due weight\u2019 to [the administrative] proceedings, mindful that the judiciary generally *lack[s] the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.\u2019\u201d AC <em>ex rel. M.C., </em>553 F.3d at 171 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Gagliardo, </em>489 F.3d at 113). This is especially true where the decisions of the IHO and SRO have been thorough and careful, and when the district court\u2019s decision is based solely on the administrative record. <em>See Walczak v. Fla. Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>142 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Having undertaken a <em>de novo </em>review of the record in this case, as well as the arguments of the parties, we affirm the judgment of the District Court for substantially the reasons stated in its Memorandum and Order of March 30, 2011. <em>See R.S. &amp; S.S. o/b/o A.S. v. Lakeland Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>No. 09 Civ. 9874, 2011 WL 1198458 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.30, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We have considered all of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
