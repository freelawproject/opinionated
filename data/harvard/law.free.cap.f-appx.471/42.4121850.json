Apr. 27, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A098 994 590 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 1, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-22\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see <em>also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>584 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, such as the application in this case, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements and other record evidence, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 168-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In finding Tian not credible, the IJ reasonably relied in part on Tian\u2019s hesitant and unresponsive demeanor while testifying. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). The IJ\u2019s demeanor finding was further supported by specific examples of contradictory testimony. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cWe can be still more confident in our review of observations about an applicant\u2019s demeanor where, as here, they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony.\u201d). Indeed, the IJ reasonably found discrepancies between Tian\u2019s testimony and a letter from his mother, for which Tian was unable to provide a compelling explanation. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. Thus, we find no error in the IJ\u2019s denial of Tian\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on credibility grounds. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
