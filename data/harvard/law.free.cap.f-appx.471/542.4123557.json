Upon careful review of the entire sentencing record, we conclude that the court committed no significant procedural error, adequately explained the reasons for the sentence, and imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>557 F.8d 919, 922 (8th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>526 F.3d 1107, 1110-11 (8th Cir.2008). We also conclude the court did not err by reimposing the schedule for his restitution payments: the court was aware of his financial history, the monthly payments are not especially high, and Larew never sought to modify the payment schedule. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k); <em>cf. United States v. Johnson, </em>327 F.3d 758, 759 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\">.
