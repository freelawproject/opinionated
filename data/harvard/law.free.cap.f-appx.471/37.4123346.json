On appeal, Darien contends that the District Court erred in concluding that Darien failed to allege a claim for breach of Article 4.4 of the Dealer Agreement; in determining that no cause of action for breach of contractual duty to negotiate in good faith exists under Connecticut law; and, finally, in concluding that Darien\u2019s claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should be dismissed because Darien failed adequately to allege that JLRNA acted in bad faith. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, \u201caccepting all factual claims in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Famous Horse Inc. v. 5th Ave. Photo Inc., </em>624 F.3d 106, 108 (2d Cir.2010). In order to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is hable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Darien contends, first, that the district court erred in dismissing its claim for breach of Article 4.4 of the Dealership Agreement because the Complaint adequately alleged that JLRNA breached Article 4.4 by failing to approve a relocation request that was allegedly \u201cin the best interest of [Darien] and of Jaguar owners in the area in which [Darien] is located.\u201d Article 4.4 provides, however, that the question whether a relocation is in the best interest of Darien and the Jaguar owners in its area is committed to the exercise of JLRNA\u2019s \u201cgood faith business judgment.\u201d Article 4.4 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">Dealer understands that in evaluating any proposed site [for relocation], the Company will consider various factors, including, but not limited to, the adequacy of the site for a dealership of the size contemplated, the convenience and accessibility of the site to existing and potential Jaguar owners and the type and quality of the residential buildings and commercial enterprises located in the geographic area adjacent to and surrounding the site.... The Company will approve the proposed relocation only if, based upon all the relevant factors, the Company <em>in the exercise of its good faith business judgment </em>considers the proposed relocation to be in the best interests of Dealer and of Jaguar owners in the area in which Darien is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Thus, by the terms of the Dealership Agreement, Darien was required to allege more than a mere failure by JLRNA to agree that Darien\u2019s relocation request was in the best interests of the relevant parties, but a failure, instead, to have done so \u201cin the exercise of its good faith business judgment.\u201d Moreover, contrary to Darien\u2019s claim, JLRNA was permitted, in making such a judgment, to take into account \u201crelevant factors,\u201d including, as the district court determined, whether the parties could successfully negotiate a new Performance Agreement under Article 4.3 of the Dealer Agreement, pursuant to which Darien would undertake renovations and alterations to the facilities at the new location. Shorn of its conclusory assertions, the Complaint simply fails to allege facts sufficient to state a plausible claim that JLRNA did not exercise good faith business judgment in declining to permit the relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Darien argues next that the district court erred in dismissing its claim that JLRNA breached Article 4.3 of the Dealership Agreement because, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, claims for failure to negotiate in good faith are permitted under Connecticut law. We need not address this question, however, because we conclude that even assuming such claims are recognized in Connecticut, Darien has not sufficiently alleged that JLRNA breached Article 4.3 of the Dealership Agreement by \u201crefusing] to engage [Darien] in any meaningful negotiation of the Performance Agreement and ... mandating] a one size fits all boilerplate agreement....\u201d Article 4.3 expressly provides that \u201cDealer agrees that its upgraded Dealership Facilities must meet the Company\u2019s Facilities/Personnel Guide for a dealership of the size contemplated and must be designed and decorated in a style consistent with that of other dealership facilities constructed or renovated in accordance with a Company-approved Upgrade Program.\u201d The provision requires the parties to negotiate a suitable Performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Agreement and, in so doing, to give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to the economic consequences of an upgrade on Darien. Even drawing all permissible inferences in Darien\u2019s favor, the Complaint here alleges no more than the parties\u2019 failure to agree on terms for renovations at the proposed new location for Darien\u2019s franchise. This is simply not enough to allege a breach of Article 4.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">As for Darien\u2019s claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, we agree with the district court that Darien has failed to allege bad faith on the part of JLRNA. Darien essentially alleges that JLRNA acted in bad faith in assessing Darien\u2019s relocation request because it demanded that JLRNA \u201cperform unreasonable facility upgrades\u201d as a condition of approving the relocation. While Darien asserts that JLRNA acted unreasonably in requiring those upgrades, Darien fails to allege \u201cfraud, misrepresentation, or improper motive on the part of\u2019 JLRNA, as required to assert a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Connecticut law. <em>See Keller v. Beckenstein, </em>117 Conn. App. 550, 979 A.2d 1055, 1064 (2009). These claims too, then, were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We have considered all of Darien\u2019s remaining arguments and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
