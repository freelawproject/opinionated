We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, because Hou was never given an opportunity to explain the omission from his asylum application of the specific harms he suffered during his detention. <em>See SotoOlarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1091-92 (9th Cir.2009) (petitioner must be given an opportunity to explain perceived inconsistencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">Accordingly, we grant the petition as to Hou\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims, and remand to the BIA on an open record for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Soto-Olarte, </em>555 F.3d at 1095-96.</p>\n<p id=\"AkA\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED. REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
