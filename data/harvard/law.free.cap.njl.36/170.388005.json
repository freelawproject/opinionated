upon the owners of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the lands and real estate intended to be benefited, in proportion as nearly as might be, to the advantage each was deemed to have acquired, the report amounts to nothing more than that the assessment is justly and equitably made by the commissioners, and according to the best of their skill and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It may perhaps be gathered from this report, that the-assessment in question was made upon the owners of all the lands and real estate intended- to be benefited, but it nowhere appears that the owners were assessed in the proportion required by the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The commissioners are bound in such a case, to exercise their judgment in order to determine the advantage or benefit to each particular owner, and their report must show that the assessment has been made upon each owner, as nearly as might be, in proportion to the benefit received. <em>State </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>399; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>2 <em>Ib. </em>444; <em>State </em>v. <em>City of Hudson, </em>3 <em>Ib. </em>214; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>4 <em>Ib. </em>500; <em>State </em>v. <em>City of Hudson, </em>5 <em>Ib. </em>105; <em>State </em>v. <em>Town of Bergen, </em>1 Vroom 307; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gardner et al., 5 Ib. </em>327.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">It has been suggested on the part of the city that although the objection just considered might have prevailed prior to-the act of April 6th, 1871, relative to the writ of certiorari, it is otherwise since the passage of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The part of the act referred to is the second section, which provides that it shall be the duty of the court in any <em>certiorari, </em>&amp;c., to determine disputed questions of fact as well as law, and according to the justice of the case to reverse or affirm, in part or in the whole, any tax or assessment, &amp;c, and to inquire into the facts by deposition, &amp;c. <em>(Laws, </em>1871, <em>pp. </em>124, 125.) _</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">_ Without undertaking now to decide, whether the radical defect in this report might have been supplied by evidence under the provisions of the act of 1871, it is sufficient to say that nothing of the kind has been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">No testimony has been laid before us intended to show that the assessment was in fact made as the charter requires. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>There is no disputed question of fact in the case as it is now before us. The assessment is therefore to be dealt with precisely as if the act of 1871 had not been passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">It is further objected to this assessment, that it does hot appear by the report that the commissioners by whom it was made, were all disinterested freeholders of said city, residing in different wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The charter requires the common council to appoint five disinterested freeholders of the city, residing in different wards, commissioners to make any such assessment as the one now before the court, <em>(Laws, </em>1857, <em>p. </em>167, \u00a7 106,) and it must appear on the face of the proceedings that the commissioners possessed the required qualifications. <em>The State, Durant, pros., </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>310.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">This appears as to all the commissioners originally appointed. But one of these having resigned, Mr. Sayer was appointed in his place, and he having died, Mr. Lord was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by his death. How while it does sufficiently appear by the resolution appointing Mr. Lord, that he\" was at that time a resident of the city, and of a different ward from any of the others, it does not appear, either from the report or from any part of the proceedings before us, that ho was a disinterested freeholder, This is a fatal omission. <em>State </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>399.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Assessment set aside, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Cited in <em>State, Harris, pros., </em>v. <em>Jersey City, 9 Vr. </em>55; <em>State, Ryerson, pros., </em>v. <em>Passaic, </em>9 <em>Vr. </em>171.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
