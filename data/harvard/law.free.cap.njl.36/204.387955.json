That the beginning of the road is not described with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">2. That the damages are not properly assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The road is described as \u201c beginning near the New Jersey Central Railroad depot, at Roselle, on the northerly side of said depot, and in a line of a road known as Chestnut street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">This does not define the beginning with requisite certainty. <em>Griscom </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>105; <em>State </em>v.
