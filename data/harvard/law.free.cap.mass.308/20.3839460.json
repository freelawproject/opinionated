The prayers are for an accounting, for the determination of the amount of the fund or pool with which the defendant is chargeable and of the awards or dividends to which the plaintiff and others similarly situated are entitled, that payment thereof be ordered, and for other incidental relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Several persons have filed intervening petitions as parties plaintiff. No question has been raised as to the propriety of an equity suit in a case of this kind or as to the propriety of allowing ticket holders other than the original plaintiff to intervene. The original plaintiff and the interveners are hereinafter referred to as the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The case was heard upon agreed facts supplemented by evidence. Among the facts agreed were these: The defendant was licensed under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 128A, inserted by St. 1934, c. 374, \u00a7 3, to conduct horse racing meetings and to conduct and supervise \u201cthe pari-mutuel or certificate system of wagering on the speed or ability of horses.\u201d c. 128A, \u00a7 5. At the races on July 18, 1935, the plaintiffs and various other patrons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>wagered that in the \u201cdaily double\u201d the horse \u201cArgoan\u201d would win the first race and the horse \u201cSte. Louise\u201d the third race. In fact \u201cSte. Louise\u201d did win the third race, and no issue is raised concerning that race. But in the first race a horse named \u201cMasked Gal\u201d crossed the finish line first and was \u201cofficially\u201d declared the winner. \u201cArgoan\u201d crossed the finish line second and was \u201cofficially\u201d declared second. The decision as to the winner was made by the \u201cplacing judges\u201d, and \u201cconfirmed by the Stewards,\u201d whereupon \u201cthe number of the winner was flashed in electric lights on a board in view of the public and a red light also flashed on said board under the word \u2018result.\u2019\u201d Upon the result of the third race being declared \u201cofficial,\u201d the defendant immediately began payment of the entire \u201cdaily double\u201d pool, less the deductions permitted by law, to patrons wagering that \u201cMasked Gal\u201d and \u201cSte. Louise\u201d would win their respective races. On the evening of the same day \u201ca protest was made\u201d (but not, so far as appears, by any of the plaintiffs or by any ticket holder) that \u201c\u2018Masked Gal\u2019 had not been eligible to enter said first race by reason of the fact that said horse had won three races, and that, therefore, its entry did not comply with the conditions of the race in so far as said conditions provided that said race was for nonwinners of more than two races.\u201d On July 19 \u201cthe Stewards . . . found that the allegations of the protest were correct, and took away the purse money which had been awarded \u2018Masked Gal\u2019 as the winner, and awarded said purse money to \u2018Argoan, \u2019 which had finished second.\u201d The purse money is not part of the pool formed by the wagers- of patrons, but is provided by the licensee (the defendant) and only the owners of competing horses participate in its distribution. There \u201cis no way to determine how much persons wagering that \u2018 Argoan \u2019 would win the first race would be entitled to if 'Masked Gal\u2019 had not been in the race.\u201d One hundred thirty \u201cdaily double\u201d tickets were sold \u201con the combination of 'Masked Gal\u2019 and \u2018Ste. Louise,\u2019\u201d and two hundred four \u201con the combination of \u2018Argoan\u2019 and \u2018Ste. Louise.\u2019\u201d If the \u201cdaily double\u201d pool had been distributed to patrons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>who bet on the combination of \u201cArgoan\u201d and \u201cSte. Louise\u201d instead of to those who bet on the combination of \u201cMasked Gal\u201d and \u201cSte. Louise,\u201d each holder of a $2 winning ticket would have received $87.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">A copy of the \u201cOfficial Program\u201d introduced as an exhibit contains, under the heading \u201cFirst Half of Daily Double First Race\u201d and over the list of horses entered, several lines, mostly in small type, apparently descriptive of the terms upon which the race was to be run. These lines begin \u201cfor two-year-olds. Non-winners of More Than Two Races.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The question to be decided is whether it was the defendant\u2019s duty to distribute the \u201cdaily double\u201d pool to the purchasers of wagering tickets on the basis that \u201cMasked Gal\u201d won the first race, as had been \u201cofficially\u201d declared by the \u201cplacing judges,\u201d \u201cconfirmed by the Stewards,\u201d and \u201cflashed on . . . [the] board\u201d after the race and before the defendant began to distribute the pool, or on the basis that \u201cArgoan,\u201d which actually came in second, won the first race because on the next day, after distribution of the pool, the \u201cStewards\u201d upheld a protest against the eligibility of \u201cMasked Gal\u201d on the ground that the race was for horses which had not previously won more than two races and that \u201cMasked Gal\u201d had won more than two races, and so awarded the purse money to \u201cArgoan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">It may be well to preface our discussion with a few words as to what we conceive the function of the court to be in a case of this kind. It is common knowledge that at formal horse races there are persons in attendance who are charged with the duty of determining which horses are the winners under the terms and conditions under which a race is being conducted, much as at football or baseball games or other public contests persons are provided to act as referees or umpires. Purchasers of race tickets must be held to know this and to consent to be bound by the judgment of those regularly charged with the duty of decision. At least in cases where as here there is no charge of bad faith, it cannot ordinarily be the duty of a court either to determine the eligibility of entries or to decide which horse won a race. There is nothing in the statute itself to suggest that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Legislature intended to impose upon courts any duty of decision in these matters. On the other hand, since the statute has expressly made wagering legal at racing meetings held in accordance with its provisions, we find it difficult to discover any good reason why the law should refuse, a remedy for the recovery of the \u201caward or dividend\u201d due under \u00a7 5 to those who have been determined by the duly constituted authorities of the race to be the \u201cwinning patrons.\u201d No argument has been made against the existence of a remedy. In <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Association, Inc. </em>303 Mass. 602, a winning patron was allowed to recover in an action of contract against the \u201cassociation.\u201d In the present case the plaintiffs have brought a bill in equity on the theory that the defendant became a \u201ccustodian\u201d or \u201cdepository\u201d under \u00a7 5, and no objection has been made to the form of procedure on the ground that it is in equity instead of at law. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>22 Pick. 231, 237. <em>Dearth </em>v. <em>Hide &amp; Leather National Bank, </em>100 Mass. 540, 543. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Grow, </em>265 Mass. 578, 580, 581. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>297 Mass. 198, 202. Under the circumstances we think that the Superior Court rightly proceeded to a decision of the case upon the merits whether the relation of the defendant to winning patrons was that of a trustee or of a debtor. What the relation was we need not determine in this case. But the issue to be decided by the court is not whether \u201cArgoan\u201d or \u201cMasked Gal\u201d really won the first race. The issue to be decided is whether the plaintiffs have proved that the duly constituted officials at the race whose duty it was to judge the race have made a decision as a result of which the plaintiffs became \u201cwinning patrons,\u201d entitled to share in the distribution of the fund contributed by those who bought tickets for the \u201cdaily double,\u201d and this in turn depends upon whether the plaintiffs' standing is to be deemed fixed by the decision made by the \u201cplacing judges\u201d and \u201cconfirmed by the Stewards\u201d immediately after the race, upon which decision the \u201cpay-off\u201d to ticket holders was actually made, or by the decision of the \u201cStewards\u201d the next day sustaining the protest upon \u201cMasked Gal\u201d and awarding the purse to \u201cArgoan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>We construe the agreed facts hereinbefore stated as indicating that the original decision that \u201cMasked Gal\u201d was the winner was made by the officials whose duty it was to make such decisions, and we assume in favor of the plaintiffs that the \u201cStewards\u201d had power the next day, upon sustaining the protest, to award the purse to \u201cArgoan,\u201d although it may be pointed out here that a decision as to the rights of horse owners in the purse is not in and of itself a decision as to the rights of ticket holders in the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">There are reasons which lead us to the conclusion that the defendant was justified in distributing the pool immediately in accordance with the original announcement of the winner notwithstanding the later protest and the decision the following day. It is common knowledge that these racing meetings are attended by great numbers of persons, many of whom come from long distances; that they place their wagers by buying tickets for cash, very often in small amounts; that they are attracted by the interest aroused by seeing the races and learning whether they have won or lost; that often large numbers of patrons wager upon the same race (in this instance three hundred thirty-four $2 tickets on only two of the many possible combinations); and that the \u201cassociation\u201d has no means of communicating with them after the races are over for the day and they have left the grounds. We think that patrons reasonably expect to know the results immediately after the race and to receive then* money, if they have won, before leaving the premises and without the necessity of returning at some later time to collect a sum which may be too small to justify the effort. It would seem that a great part of the interest and excitement which racing meetings are designed to stimulate and upon which they exist would be lost if the final decision and the \u201cpay-off\u201d could be delayed by somebody\u2019s protest, the investigation of which might take days or possibly weeks. The practical reasons for immediate action that apply to the \u201cpay-off\u201d to ticket holders do not apply to the award of the purse to horse owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">There are some indications in the statute itself that the Legislature intended an immediate adjustment of the \u201cpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>off\u201d to ticket holders. Section 5 of c. 128A provides for payment by the licensee to the racing commission of one half of the \u201cbreaks,\u201d calculated upon the winnings, upon the day following each day of a racing meeting. The same section also now provides that race tracks \u201cshall be equipped with automatic betting machines capable of accurate and speedy determination of award or dividend to winning patrons, and all such awards or dividends shall be calculated by a totalisator machine or like machine, except at state or county fairs.\u201d Although this last provision was inserted by St. 1935, c. 454, \u00a7 1, enacted a few days after July 18, 1935, we think, nevertheless, that it has some tendency to show that speedy ascertainment of the winnings was intended from the beginning. Of weight also is the fact that it is impossible to put patrons who wagered upon \u201cArgoan\u201d to win the first race in the same position in which they would have been if \u201cMasked Gal\u201d had not run, because it has been agreed that there is no way to determine how much they would have been entitled to- in that event. The race cannot be made over by calculation into the equivalent of a race in which \u201cMasked Gal\u201d did not take part.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">We do not intimate that the authorized judges could not correct an error discovered before the \u201cpay-off,\u201d nor do we undertake to determine either the time or the manner in which they should perform their duties. We hold that the plaintiffs in this case as ticket holders have not shown that they are not bound' by the original decision upon the basis of which the \u201cpay-off\u201d was made, and that they have not shown that they acquired any legal rights through the subsequent protest and the change in the award of the purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In their briefs both sides have laid stress upon rules of the State racing commission. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 128A, \u00a7 9, as amended. A purported copy of these rules was handed to us at the argument in this court. We cannot discover that the rules were introduced in evidence at the hearing in the Superior Court, or that they became in any manner a part of the record. In the facts agreed it was stated that the defendant was- \u201csubject to the supervision, rules and regulations\u201d of the commission, but the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>themselves were not set forth or incorporated. During the hearing in the Superior Court a suggestion was made that the judge might \u201clike to see the rule book.\u201d Counsel for the defendant thereupon stated that he had \u201cno objection to his Honor seeing the rule book,\u201d but that he \u201cdid not want any unnecessary amount of rules that had no bearing on the case.\u201d Whether or not the judge saw the \u201crule book\u201d does not appear. At any rate the record does not show that it was received in evidence. We cannot take judicial notice of the rules of the racing commission. We are not inclined towards a narrow and illiberal application of the doctrine of judicial notice, but a mere inspection of the book shown to us at the argument, purporting to contain three hundred twenty-nine rules of a highly technical character, doubtless changed from time to time, demonstrates the unfairness and impracticability of a system that would permit parties to reserve such a mass of material pertaining to a peculiar and highly specialized field to be presented for the first time to an appellate court, or of expecting any court on its own initiative and responsibility to discover and analyze it. Such rules of this kind as may be pertinent to a case should be formally placed, before the trial court at the trial by some one of the recognized methods by which facts may be agreed upon or evidence introduced. They may then in due course become part of the record on appeal. No hardship will result. Certified copies, if insisted upon, can readily be obtained from the secretary of the commission. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 76; c. 6, \u00a7 48, as added by St. 1934, c. 374, \u00a7 2. This is in accord with our previous decisions in analogous instances. . <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>158 Mass. 218, 219. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>184 Mass. 598. <em>Brodsky </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>263 Mass. 51, 54. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>273 Mass. 557, 564. <em>Wolbarsht </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>291 Mass. 229, 233. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>299 Mass. 353, 355. See <em>Roden </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co. </em>113 Conn. 408, 413-416; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, </em>222 U. S. 506; <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>145 Fed. 302, 306; Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 2572. It is of course settled that we do not consider fact or evidence of which we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>take judicial notice and which has not been properly incorporated in the record. <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>130 Mass. 5. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>242 Mass. 262, 264-265. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>268 Mass. 497, 504. <em>Abeloff </em>v. <em>Peacard, </em>272 Mass. 56, 59. <em>Carilli </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>299 Mass. 139, 145. The provisions of the rules have not been considered and do not enter into our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">The plaintiffs further contend that they are entitled to recover because they relied upon \u201cthe printed conditions contained in the official program.\u201d We suppose that the plaintiffs use the word \u201cconditions\u201d as meaning the statement to which reference has already been made, \u201cfor two-year-olds. Non-winners of More Than Two Races.\u201d Not only did the judge find as a fact that the plaintiffs did not so rely, but even if they did rely upon the program, any claim of liability based upon an error or false statement is beyond the scope of the bill and of the intervening petitions. None of these mentions the program or sets forth any cause of action for errors in it or for real or constructive fraud or deceit in any form. <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>225 Mass. 89, 95. <em>National Rockland Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>299 Mass. 156, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">There can be no appeal from an order for a decree or from a specific finding of fact as such. <em>Graustein </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>282 Mass. 579, 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>Appeals from orders and findings dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with a single bill of costs to the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
