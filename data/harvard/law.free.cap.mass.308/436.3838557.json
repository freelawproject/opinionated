The evidence is reported. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 24. Rule 76 of the Superior Court (1932). The judge made findings of fact, and, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>his order, a final decree was entered adjudging that the fund in question-, which had been paid into court under the terms of an interlocutory decree, was the property of the defendant executor of Moore\u2019s will, and ordering that the fund be paid accordingly. It is for this court to examine the evidence and decide the case according to its own judgment as to the facts as well as the law, giving due weight to the findings of the trial judge. But his findings as to facts, either expressly made or necessarily implied from his disposition of the case, will not be reversed unless plainly wrong. <em>White Tower Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Taglino, </em>302 Mass. 453, 454, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">Tate and Moore were friends for many years. Moore died on February 1, 1926. Some time in the latter part of January, 1926, he was at the Tate home and, after he left, Mrs. Tate showed her husband a bank book which represented the deposit in question. Tate never saw the book again until after the death of his wife and had no conversation concerning it. After her death on December 10, 1939, he found the book among her effects. It still stood in Moore\u2019s name, no interest had been added, and there was no change whatsoever in the amount of the deposit, which was $3,065.98. There was oral testimony of a sister of Mrs. Tate to the effect that the latter, in 1936, on two occasions had referred to the \u201cbank book that Dave Moore gave to me.-\u201d Moore\u2019s will, made on September 2, 1922, gave $5,700 to relatives, and, according to the inventory, his estate consisted of savings bank deposits, a small item of cash, and an item due for salary. There remained, over and above the total amount of legacies, $3,427.07 undisposed of. These are substantially the findings of fact that were made by the trial judge. The ultimate finding was that there was not sufficient evidence to show that Moore made a delivery of the bank book to Mrs. Tate with the intention of making a gift, \u201cand did not make an effective transfer of said deposit to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">If Moore delivered the bank book to Mrs. Tate with the intention of making a gift to her, this would constitute an effective transfer of the deposit represented by the book, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>when accepted by her. <em>Busteed </em>v. <em>Cambridge Savings Bank, </em>306 Mass. 9, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\">Tate contends that the finding of the judge is based upon two assumptions, both of which are wrong. One is that there was no evidence, except that of the sister, to support the contention of a gift, and Tate contends that thereby the judge ignored altogether other testimony disclosing circumstances that bore upon the significance to be attached to the possession of the bank book by Mrs. Tate. The other assumption is that the sister had a strong interest, and Tate contends that it was upon this assumption that the judge found \u201cthe effect of strong interest\u201d in the testimony' of Mrs, Tate\u2019s sister \u201cwhich affected her credibility.\u201d In short, Tate contends that the judge based his decision entirely upon the testimony of this sister. We are of opinion, however, that this contention ought not to prevail. It is true that after a statement of findings, substantially as hereinbefore set out, the judge did say, in effect, that the only evidence that was offered \u201cin support of the contention that the gift had been made\u201d was the testimony of the sister. We are of opinion, however, that by this statement, the judge had in mind that there was no other testimony as to what took place at the time it was contended that the bank book must have been delivered to Mrs. Tate. We think his statement that he found there was not \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to establish a gift indicates a consideration of the evidence as a whole, and that his ultimate finding was not based solely upon the testimony of Mrs. Tate\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">As to the other assumption, it is urged that the sister had no interest in the sense that she would not share in the distribution of her sister\u2019s estate. We are of opinion, however, that it does not follow from the statement of the judge that he had this sort of interest in mind. Her testimony appears in the record, but, of course, this cannot show her appearance and attitude as a witness. We cannot say that the judge, from what he saw of her, may not have reasonably concluded that her very relationship was enough to warrant his statement, nor that his conclusion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>not warranted that her credibility as a witness was affected thereby. See <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Ripka, </em>199 Mass. 359, 361; <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Studley, </em>294 Mass. 193, 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">From an examination of the entire record, it cannot be said that the judge\u2019s findings are plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
