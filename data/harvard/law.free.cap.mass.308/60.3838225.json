To other interrogatories asking how the horse and vehicle were fastened \u201cbetween deliveries,\u201d the defendant answered that the horse and wagon were \u201cnot fastened.\u201d These answers add nothing of consequence to the plaintiff\u2019s case. The word \u201cdeliveries\u201d as used in the interrogatories refers, we think, to the several series of acts of the driver in leaving his wagon, entering upon the premises of customers, depositing milk there, and returning to the wagon. Obviously failure to fasten the horse and wagon \u201cbetween deliveries\u201d was not evidence of negligence, since fastening them at such times would render them wholly useless for distributing milk. As to leaving horses unhitched in general see <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>O\u2019Riordan, </em>211 Mass. 477, and <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>260 Mass. 110, 115. We cannot read the word \u201cbetween\u201d as if it were \u201cduring,\u201d even if it seems fairly clear that the plaintiff should have used in his interrogatories the latter word instead of the former. The two words have very different significations. A party has the privilege of framing his own interrogatories, and he should be careful to ask for what he wants. The party interrogated may answer the questions as they are propounded to him. He is not obliged to surmise that his opponent meant something different from that which he expressed. The answers are to be construed with reference to the questions. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ant has not answered that its horse and wagon were not fastened during deliveries but has answered only that they were not fastened between deliveries. It cannot be bound to that which it has not stated. <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>R. F.
