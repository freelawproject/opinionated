Locks of hair to be curled were drawn through the slits and wound around leather bound steel spindles and fastened. A piece of tin foil was put over each curl. At no time did the plaintiff come in contact with the spindles. The pads were between the spindles and the plaintiff\u2019s scalp. The spindles were then attached to the \u201cpermanent wave machine.\u201d When the electricity was turned on \u201cthere was a flash at the bottom of the machine, somewhere near the floor,\u201d where the plug goes into the socket in the wall. The plaintiff \u201ccouldn\u2019t really see\u201d whether the flash was in the machine. All she saw was the flash. After the flash the heat was turned off, and \u201cthe barber\u201d \u201cfixed whatever was wrong.\u201d The \u201cheat or electricity\u201d was then applied for the second time. At first the heat \u201cfelt even over the plaintiff\u2019s scalp just as it did in similar treatments the plaintiff had had before.\u201d After about a minute the plaintiff felt a burn on the left side of her temple. She called the attendant, who used a \u201chand blower\u201d at the spot complained of. This drove cold air on the plaintiff\u2019s scalp. It was applied three or four times and relieved the pain temporarily. \u201cThe sensation of pain from the burn revived however after each application of the blower had ceased.\u201d After about ten minutes the electricity was shut off. It was then discovered that two \u201clocks\u201d of hair \u201cnext to where\u201d the plaintiff was burned were not curled. Two other spindles were applied to these two \u201cstrands,\u201d and after ten minutes more of heat they were curled.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">From this evidence the jury could find that the defendant had complete control of the machine, of the method of applying it to the plaintiff\u2019s head, of the placing and arrangement of the pads and spindles, and of the turning on and off of the \u201cheat.\u201d They could infer that a burn for which they deemed the sum of $1,000 reasonable compensation was not a normal accompaniment of a \u201cpermanent wave.\u201d They could find that the flash near the floor had no relation to what occurred afterwards, and that in any event it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tend to absolve the defendant from responsibility. They could find it more probable that the plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted from improper adjustment of the heating or the protective appliances or from too great or too prolonged application of heat than from some other cause not disclosed by the evidence. And they could further find that there would have been no improper adjustment or improper application of heat, if the defendant had exercised the degree of skill and care which it engaged itself to exercise when it invited the public to patronize its place of business. The case is within the authority of <em>Gavin </em>v. <em>Kluge, </em>275 Mass. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
