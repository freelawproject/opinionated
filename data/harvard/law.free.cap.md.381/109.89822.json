His name appeared as such on the birth certificate. The Child\u2019s biological parents were not married at the time, nor did they marry subsequently. On 14 January 2003, Brendin D. Tarpley (\u201cthe Father\u201d), Appellee, filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a Petition for Name Change seeking to change the surname of the Child from Dorsey to Dorsey-Tarpley. Appellant, Dea Michelle Dorsey (\u201cthe Mother\u201d), opposed the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">A hearing was held on 2 April 2003. Counsel argued, but no evidence was adduced. The Petition was granted and an Order for Change of Name was entered on 15 April 2003, changing the Child\u2019s name from Alexander Craig Dorsey to Alexander Craig Dorsey-Tarpley. The Mother, on 22 April 2003, filed a Motion for New Trial or, in the alternative, to Alter or Amend Judgment. The Circuit Court denied the motion, and the Mother appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court, on its own initiative and before any further proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, issued a writ of certiorari. 378 Md. 617, 837 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>A.2d 928 (2003). Appellant framed the following issue for appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Whether the lower court erred in granting the father\u2019s petition to change the child\u2019s surname since the parents had agreed prior to the child\u2019s birth [to] his surname and the father failed to meet his burden of proof that the change was in the best interest of the child and that extreme circumstances warranted a change? <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">It is obvious that Alexander\u2019s parents presently disagree over the proper surname for him. Apparently they also disagree about whether there was an agreement regarding his surname at his birth. Unfortunately, despite the latter disagreement, there was no fact-finding by the hearing judge on this pivotal factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The Mother contended that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">[e]ven though the Father was the biological father of the Child, they had agreed prior to the Child\u2019s birth that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>would [bear] the last name of the Mother, irrespective of her marital status. The Father had acknowledged their agreement at the time their son was born. He was present at the birth and acquiesced to the Mother\u2019s maiden name as the Child\u2019s surname on the birth certificate. The Father never contested the Child\u2019s surname until he was two and a half years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Specifically, in her opposition to Petition for Name Change filed in the Circuit Court, Appellant alleged that the Father \u201csigned the minor child\u2019s birth certificate and acknowledgment of parentage with this understanding in mind at the time the child was born.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">To the contrary, the Father contended that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">[a]t the time of the child\u2019s birth, [the Mother] insisted that [the Father\u2019s] last name (Tarpley) would only be given to their son if [the Father] promised to marry [the Mother].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">For a myriad of difficult and emotional reasons, this promise could not be made by [the Father] at that time. The parties could not agree on the last name for their child, emotions were high and members from both sides of the family were present. No agreement could be reached on the last name. Over [the Father\u2019s] objection, [the Mother] used her last name (Dorsey) as the child\u2019s last name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWX\">The Mother also argued in her trial court pleadings and papers that the Father was happy with the Child\u2019s surname until the Child was two and half years old and that the name modification was sought to harass, annoy, and embarrass her. In addition, she pointed to bank accounts and assets, such as stocks, bonds, and life insurance, which had been established previously with the Child\u2019s surname of \u201cDorsey\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">At the hearing in the Circuit Court no witnesses testified and no documentary evidence was offered. The hearing judge, at the outset of the 2 April 2003 hearing, questioned the attorneys about the case, based on the pleadings, and what they contended represented a disposition in the best interests of the child. The hearing, therefore, proceeded as oral argument by counsel. Approximately two-third\u2019s of the way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>through the comparatively short proceeding, the Father\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">\u201cAnd what I would like to <em>reiterate </em>\u2014 and <em>if Your Honor wants to resolve the factual differences in this case, then I think perhaps the Court would want to hear testimony on it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cBut there is a difference of opinion as to whether or not there was an agreement reached when the child was born on what the child\u2019s last name would be. They say there was an agreement. My client says there was not an agreement. From our position, if there had been an agreement, we would not be here today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">(Emphasis added). Unwilling to press the point about adducing evidence in support of his representations, the Father did not mention again the notion of receiving evidence. The Mother likewise did not press this point. The court apparently did not recognize any need to resolve the apparent evidentiary dispute. The hearing proceeded with more argument by counsel, leading to the court\u2019s announcement of its oral ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The hearing judge concluded that it would best serve the interest of the Child to allow the name change. He reasoned that, although the law states that the court should be reluctant to change a name, in this Child\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201c[H]e is not in school yet. He is young, and it is a name that he is going to use the rest of his life. And I don\u2019t think it goes back to whether there was or was not an agreement when this child was born____But the bottom line on this is that ... if I allow him the addition and the change of name \u2014 and it is really an addition of a name \u2014 then both parents are represented. And there is some appeal to me\u2014 although certainly counsel\u2019s argument is sound that most people have one family name. But on the other hand, here in a circumstance where there is at least a separation, the child should at least carry the tradition of both families.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">\u201cAnd it really comes down to how you all as parents handle this child the rest of his life, and I don\u2019t think, frankly, in the long run, whether I do this or don\u2019t do it, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>going to have great impact on his ultimate well-being. But I do believe that it is in his best interest to carry the name of both parents under the circumstances where there is a separation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201cBut as I told you before, I am one judge that is asked to make a decision. I have made it, I guess based upon what I believe is in the best interest of the child and what factually is described to me, but it is not a decision that is the same decision that some other judge might not make.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The trial judge based his decision on the young age of the Child and, when the parents are separated, the Child\u2019s general interest in having the name of both parents. The Mother contends on appeal that the hearing judge was in error in concluding that these circumstances alone justified a change of name. For reasons we shall explain, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for an evidentiary hearing and fact-finding before the court may decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In general, parents are said to enjoy the right jointly to adopt any surname for their child they wish to chose, \u201cjust as they determine what shall be a child\u2019s given name.\u201d <em>Lassiter-Geers v. Reichenbach, </em>303 Md. 88, 94-95, 492 A.2d 303, 306 (1985). Neither parent, however, \u201chas a superior right to determine the initial surname their child shall bear.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Unlike in the case where no initial surname is given a child at birth, the rule in a change of name case is to \u201clook at what is in the best interests of the child before determining if a name change is warranted.\u201d <em>West v. Wright, </em>263 Md. 297, 299, 283 A.2d 401, 402 (1971), and cases cited therein. Other than in the case of adoption proceedings, there is a presumption against granting such a change except under \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We have said that there are two paramount factors to consider when determining the existence of \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d First, the court is to consider any evidence of misconduct by a parent that could make the child\u2019s continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>use of the parent\u2019s surname shameful or disgraceful. <em>West, </em>263 Md. at 300, 283 A.2d at 403. Second, the court is to consider whether the parent wilfully abandoned or surrendered his or her natural ties to the child. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Although the parties in the present case pled and argued a factual dispute as to whether a consensus existed as to the Child\u2019s surname at birth, there was no effort made by the hearing judge to resolve this dispute. Based on the virtual absence of a proper evidentiary record, coupled with the absence of judicial fact-finding, this case may not be categorized for analysis at this stage as either a \u201cno initial name\u201d or a \u201cchange of name\u201d case. The parties must adduce evidence in support of their respective factual contentions and, assuming that admissible evidence presents the dispute the parties argue existed at the Child\u2019s birth, the Circuit Court needs to resolve whether such an agreement existed between the Mother and Father at birth, i.e., to give the Child the surname of Dorsey. Relevant evidence bearing on that, it seems to us, might be found in, among other places, the presence or absence of the Father\u2019s signature on the birth certificate or so-called \u201cacknowledgment of parentage,\u201d the Mother\u2019s testimony, the Father\u2019s testimony, and/or the testimony of any relatives or other witnesses who were present during any discussion about naming the Child at birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">If there was an agreement to name the Child at that time, then, under our caselaw, the petitioning parent, the Father in this case, must satisfy, by admissible evidence, the \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d standard in order to generate a prima facie case for the name change he seeks. <em>West, </em>263 Md. at 300, 283 A.2d at 403. In, \u201cchange of name\u201d cases, as noted previously, abandonment and serious misconduct disgracing an existing surname are of paramount importance because \u201cthey epitomize the sort of exceedingly negative behavior by a parent that will justify changing the child\u2019s surname, when the parents gave the child that parent\u2019s surname at birth.\u201d <em>Schroeder v. Broadfoot, </em>142 Md.App. 569, 584, 790 A.2d 773, 782 (2002). The focus in Maryland \u201cchange of name\u201d cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>involving minors is often on the \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d of profoundly bad parental behavior. No profoundly bad behavior by the Mother has been alleged yet in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">If there was no agreement regarding the name of the Child at birth, then, under our caselaw, the Father must demonstrate that the desired name change is in the Child\u2019s best interest. <em>Lassiter-Geers, </em>303 Md. at 95, 492 A.2d at 307 (when there is no agreement between the parties about what the initial surname of a child should be, the test is what is in the best interest of the child). When parents have not agreed upon their child\u2019s surname, there are a multitude of factors that usually are considered in deciding what is in the child\u2019s best interest. While these factors also may include abandonment and serious misconduct, these two touchstones are not primary or determinative in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In <em>Lassiter-Geers, </em>we adopted a pure best interests standard for \u201cno initial name\u201d cases. <em>Lassiter-Geers, </em>303 Md. at 94, 492 A.2d at 306. The factors to consider, when they exist and are appropriate in a given case, in deciding what surname will serve the best interests of the child are: 1) the child\u2019s reasonable preference, if the child is of the age and maturity to express a meaningful preference; 2) the length of time the child has used any of the surnames being considered; 3) the effect that having one name or the other may have on the preservation and development of the child\u2019s mother-child and father-child relationships; 4) the identification of the child as a part of a family unit; 5) the embarrassment, difficulties, or harassment that may result from the child\u2019s use of a particular surname; 6) misconduct by one of the child\u2019s parents disparaging of that parent\u2019s surname; 7) failure of one of the child\u2019s parents to contribute to the child\u2019s support or to maintain contact with the child; and 8) the degree of community good will or respect associated with a particular surname. <em>Schroeder, </em>142 Md.App. at 588, 790 A.2d at 785, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In the present case, the hearing judge concluded that he did not \u201cthink it goes back to whether there was or was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>agreement when this child was born.\u201d He was mistaken. The hearing judge then based his decision to grant the change of the Child\u2019s surname on the young age of the Child and the Child\u2019s general interest in having the name of both parents because the parents were not living together. This is a misapplication of the law. Accordingly, we shall vacate the court\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. If, based on the evidence, it is found that there was no parental mutual agreement to name the child \u201cDorsey\u201d at birth, the Circuit Court should be guided by the appropriate best interest of the child factors set out above. If the court determines, however, that an agreement existed at birth, the court, before granting a name change, must be satisfied that \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d justify that decision. In any event, an evidentiary hearing and fact-finding by the court are necessary before that decision is ripe to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">DECREE OF 2 APRIL 2003, CHANGING THE CHILD\u2019S NAME TO ALEXANDER CRAIG DORSEY-TARPLEY VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\">. As directed in Maryland Rules 2-201 and 15-901, the case in the Circuit Court was captioned \u201cIn Re: Alexander Craig Dorsey.\u201d On appeal, the parties and various court administrative personnel inconsistently captioned the case as either <em>\u201cDea Dorsey v. Alexander Craig Dorsey \u201d </em>or <em>\"Dea Dorsey v. Brendin Tarpley.\u201d </em>We believe, according to Rule 8-111(a), that the more appropriate caption on appeal is as we reflect on the cover sheet of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\">2. Although presenting a single question for review, Appellant\u2019s brief quixotically offers four assertions under a section entitled \"Questions of Fact Presented.\u201d Three of these assertions break into its constituent parts the question for review and suggest conclusions favorable to Appellant, while the fourth statement claims \"the father\u2019s petition should be denied due to the doctrine of laches.\u201d After carefully reading Appellant\u2019s brief, we found only a single, short reference to the doctrine of laches buried in a paragraph on page 11. A review of the Record Extract revealed no argument or assertion of laches, as such, before the Circuit Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">The scope of appellate review is governed by Maryland Rule 8-131. That rule provides in part: \"(a) Generally. \u2014 ... Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d Our review of \"arguments not raised at the trial level is discretionary, not mandatory.\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 188, 638 A.2d 107, 113 (1994). As this case is being remanded for other reasons, Appellant will have the opportunity to raise and flesh out in the Circuit Court her new argument about the doctrine of laches: thus, we shall not address it here.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
