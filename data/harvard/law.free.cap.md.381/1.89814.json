Fenner, petitioner, was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Frederick County and was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. On May 9, 2002, the trial judge sentenced petitioner to twenty years of incarceration for the distribution of cocaine conviction and a concurrent sentence of twenty years for the conspiracy to distribute cocaine conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Petitioner then filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s rulings. Petitioner filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to this Court and on December 11, 2003, we granted the petition. <em>Fenner v. State, </em>378 Md. 613, 837 A.2d 925 (2003). In his brief, he presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">\u201c1. Whether inculpatory statements made at a bail review hearing by a defendant who is unrepresented by counsel and who is not given any <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>[1]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>advisements are admissible against the defendant at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">\u201c2. Whether the trial court\u2019s admission of a redacted version of the statement made at the bail hearing was error where the redaction rendered the statement vague and misleading.\u201d (Footnote added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We hold that, in the context of petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing, the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>did not apply because, although he was in custody at the time, petitioner cannot be said to have been \u201cinterrogated\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>Thus, petitioner\u2019s inculpatory statement at the bail review hearing was properly admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">We also hold that, because petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing was not a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the pretrial proceedings, <em>i.e., </em>it was not an adversary judicial criminal proceeding, petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel had not yet attached. Therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing into evidence his inculpatory statement, which was made at the bail review hearing when petitioner was unrepresented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>We further hold that the redacted version of the inculpatory statement, as it was read to the jury, was not so vague and misleading as to have made its admittance a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court. It was unquestionably relevant and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">On January 9, 2001, officers with the Frederick Police Department arranged to have a confidential informant at the time, Brett Hann, make a controlled purchase of narcotics in a \u201ctargeted area,\u201d namely, the John Hanson Apartment Building. After being searched to make sure that he did not have any controlled dangerous substances in his possession, Hann was fitted with a body wire for the purpose of recording and informing the police of any drug transaction that might occur. The police also gave Hann drug-purchase money and recorded the serial numbers of that money.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Upon entering the \u201ctargeted area\u201d at approximately 10:50 p.m., Hann first encountered John Walter King, whom Hann knew from prior drug related matters. King asked Hann what he was looking for and Hann replied that he wanted fifty dollars worth of crack cocaine. King asked Hann to give him the purchase money, but Hann declined to do so because the police had told Hann not to \u201cfront the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">According to Hann, King then motioned for an individual, later identified as petitioner, to come over so that Hann could conduct a \u201cface-to-face\u201d deal. Petitioner did so but initially refused to engage in any kind of transaction until King \u201cvouched for\u201d Hann. After King vouched for Hann, petitioner asked Hann what he wanted. Hann again stated that he wanted fifty dollars worth of crack cocaine. Hann gave petitioner fifty dollars, and petitioner then gave Hann three pieces of crack cocaine. King took one of the pieces as payment for assisting in the deal. Following this exchange, Hann said \u201csee you later,\u201d which was a prearranged code phrase used to alert the police that the transaction was complete. Petitioner was arrested at the scene. The officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>testified, variously, that they observed Harm, King and petitioner via binoculars and/or listened to the transaction via the body wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On January 10, 2001, the day after petitioner\u2019s arrest, and after his appearance before a District Court commissioner,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he appeared before the Honorable Frederick J. Bower of the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Frederick County for a bail review hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this hearing, petitioner was read a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>statement concerning the charges that were pending against him and was told that his preliminary hearing had been scheduled for February 8, 2001. Judge Bower then asked petitioner the following question: \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to tell me about yourself, sir?\u201d In response, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: For all the yes, activities, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about over there. (Indiscernible.) I ain\u2019t gonna, I mean I gonna (indiscernible.) I can\u2019t get no help on that, you know, they try to give you help. That\u2019s all they going to do is call and put me in jail and (indiscernible). I ain\u2019t playing it with the big boy, know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. (Indiscernible), Officer, what else is there for me to do? Whenever I get, whenever I get caught with a little charge they never catch a large amount of drugs on me so, according to the amount of (indiscernible) drug (indiscernible), you know what I\u2019m saying, I mean (indiscernible) so I think like they just (indiscernible). Whenever they catch, they probably catch me with one or two pills, Your Honor, this is just for me to make ends meet, to make money for me to be able to get by. They never caught me that (indiscernible) amount of drugs on me. You know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. I mean I\u2019m not denying what happened but when they caught me, they didn\u2019t catch me with nothing but that $50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">THE COURT: Sir, you need to have a lawyer just as soon as you can. I\u2019m going to leave the bond (indiscernible) to say I\u2019ll allow 10% to be paid to, for your release, okay, your preliminary hearing is February the 8th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">[PETITIONER]: Thank you sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Prior to trial, petitioner moved to suppress the statements he made during the bail review hearing in the District Court. At the suppression hearing before the Honorable John H. Tisdale of the Circuit Court for Frederick County, he argued that the statements should not be admitted at trial because they were made pursuant to a custodial interrogation without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and at a time when he was not represented by counsel. Judge Tisdale denied petitioner\u2019s motion, finding that although he was in custody when he made the inculpatory statement, he was not being interrogated within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>Judge Tisdale then ruled that the portion of petitioner\u2019s statement in which he said, \u201cI\u2019m not denying what happened,\u201d would be admissible, but that the remainder of the statement (that which was discernible) would be excluded because it contained \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. Petitioner\u2019s counsel and the prosecutor both expressed concern about putting the statement, \u201cI\u2019m not denying what happened,\u201d in context. Judge Tisdale then convened a chambers conference in an effort to have the parties craft an appropriate stipulation pursuant to his ruling. Eventually, while petitioner reserved his objection to any admission, it was agreed that the statement would be admitted via this stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">\u201cThe parties agree that the evidence would show that the Defendant, Donald Fenner, appeared before the Honorable Judge Frederick J. Bower of the District Court of Frederick County, Maryland and in response to questioning at his bail hearing made the following statement: \u2018I\u2019m not denying what happened.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Petitioner\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial and he was retried on March 20 and 21, 2002. At retrial, the parties agreed that the suppression court\u2019s prior ruling concerning the statement petitioner made at the bail review hearing was binding. The Honorable G. Edward Dwyer, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Frederick County presided, with a jury, over the trial. The final piece of evidence the State wanted to adduce at trial was the stipulation crafted pursuant to Judge Tisdale\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress. The parties agreed that Judge Dwyer should follow Judge Tisdale\u2019s earlier ruling, and, to preserve the issue on appeal, petitioner reaffirmed his objection to that earlier ruling, which Judge Dwyer overruled. The stipulation was thereafter read to the jury. On March 21, 2002, petitioner was found guilty of both the charge of distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>bution of cocaine and the charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">A. Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment <em>Miranda </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Petitioner contends that inculpatory statements made by an accused at a bail review hearing where the accused was not given any <em>Miranda </em>advisements should be inadmissible at trial. The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">\u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\"><em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Thus, in order for the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards to take effect, there must first exist \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d We must therefore examine whether the District Court judge\u2019s questions of petitioner at petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing, at which he made inculpatory statements, constituted a \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">\u201cCustodial interrogation,\u201d was described in <em>Miranda </em>to \u201cmean questioning <em>initiated by law enforcement officers </em>after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is clear that petitioner was in custody at the time of his bail review hearing. The real point of contention between petitioner and respondent, however, is whether the District Court judge\u2019s question, \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to tell me about yourself, sir?,\u201d can be said to constitute an \u201cinterrogation\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">In <em>Hughes v. State, </em>346 Md. 80, 695 A.2d 132, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 989, 118 S.Ct. 459, 139 L.Ed.2d 393 (1997), we had the opportunity to examine when a question posed to a defendant by a law enforcement officer can be said to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tute an \u201cinterrogation\u201d in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>In <em>Hughes, </em>we adhered to the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), a standard focusing on whether the law enforcement officer knew or should have known that the questioning was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. We explained in <em>Hughes </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As_\">\u201cAssessment of the likelihood that an otherwise routine question will evoke an incriminating response requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances in each case, with consideration given to the context in which the question is asked. The fact that the <em>answer </em>to a booking question assists the prosecution in proving its case is not determinative of whether a standard booking <em>question, </em>when posed, was <em>likely </em>to elicit an incriminating response. A benign question in one case may amount to \u2018interrogation,\u2019 for which <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required, in another case. Therefore, \u2018courts should carefully scrutinize the factual setting of each encounter of this type,\u2019 ... keeping in mind that the critical inquiry is whether the police officer, based on the totality of the circumstances, knew or should have known that the question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><em>Hughes, </em>346 Md. at 95-96, 695 A.2d at 140 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We do not find that the District Court judge\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> question, \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to tell me about yourself, sir?,\u201d was reasonably likely to elicit an inculpatory response from petitioner. Just as an arrestee may give what turns out to be an inculpatory response to a routine booking question, as described above in <em>Hughes, </em>petitioner gave what turned out to be an inculpatory response to a routine question posed by the District Court judge at petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 759, 679 A.2d 1106, 1124 (1996), Williams, after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, blurted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>out two incriminating statements as officers were conducting his processing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cAs the officers began to gather their papers, one of the officers told Williams to remove his earring and Williams mumbled under his breath, \u2018you can\u2019t get me. I\u2019ll just say a girl gave me the card [the victim\u2019s ATM card].\u2019 After this second statement, Detective Zywiolek testified that he commented that \u2018[t]his is going to work\u2019 and reiterated to Williams that he was being charged with the murders of Gilbert and Trias. At that point, Williams made a third statement: T know I\u2019m never getting out.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In holding that the second and third statements were admissible, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cHence, the question before us is whether the police continued to interrogate Williams after he invoked his right to remain silent and requested an attorney....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201cThus, we must decide whether the words and actions of the detectives were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses from Williams. We conclude that they were not.... These were routine procedures that the officers could hardly be expected to anticipate would prompt an incriminating statement---- We cannot conclude that the trial judge erred in finding that these [the officers\u2019] innocuous comments were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Williams.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 760-61, 679 A.2d at 1124-25 (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">In our earlier case of <em>State v. Conover, </em>312 Md. 33, 35-37, 537 A.2d 1167,1168-69 (1988), we stated the issue as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">\u201cThe question presented by this appeal is whether the actions of the police in reading a statement of charges to the Respondent, and handing to him copies of the charging document and the application upon which it was based, constituted, under the circumstances here present, the func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tional equivalent of questioning, and thereby deprived Respondent of his Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present at a custodial interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u201cOne of them [the police officers] read the Statement of Charges to Respondent and handed him copies of the Statement of Charges and the Application, suggesting that he \u2018read them, look at them, if you have any questions ask them.\u2019 ... Respondent then asked a number of hypothetical questions, in the vein of \u201cwhat if or \u2018suppose this,\u2019 and also uttered the statement that the State later used against him at trial: \u2018you can\u2019t put me with that .38.\u2019 \u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We answered the question, by holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201cPrior to the decision in <em>Innis, </em>we considered the application of <em>Miranda </em>to the routine processing of an arrested defendant, and concluded that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\u2018There seems to be a general agreement ... that <em>Miranda </em>does not apply to \u201cadministrative questioning,\u201d the routine questions asked of all arrestees who are \u201cbooked\u201d or otherwise processed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\"><em>Vines v. State, </em>285 Md. 369, 376, 402 A.2d 900 (1979).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">\u201cWe infer no sinister motive from the fact that police provided Respondent with a copy of the Application as well as a copy of the Statement of Charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">\u201cThe police acted reasonably and lawfully, and the Respondent was not subjected to compelling influences, psychological ploys, or direct questioning. His volunteered statement was properly admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-11\"><em>Conover, </em>312 Md. at 39-45, 537 A.2d at 1170-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">While the present case is somewhat different from the setting in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Conover, </em>in that the blurted statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>occurred in open court in a District Court bail review hearing conducted by a District Court judge, the general routine question by the judge to which petitioner responded was much less likely to elicit an incriminating statement than the statements and actions of the officers in <em>Conover </em>and <em>Williams. </em>In the case at bar, there was less likelihood that petitioner was subjected to \u201ccompelling influences, psychological ploys\u201d and he was not subjected to direct questioning in respect to the offenses for which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We have never directly opined on these issues in the context of routine questions, and answers given in response to those routine questions, that occur during bail review proceedings conducted, not by law enforcement officers, but by District Court judges. The Court of Special Appeals, however, has directly addressed the issue in a case in which we denied a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Schmidt v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 86, 481 A.2d 241 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 131, 486 A.2d 173 (1985), dealt with a defendant making an inculpatory statement at his bail hearing. In <em>Schmidt, </em>the defendant was charged with, <em>inter alia, </em>second degree rape and burglary. During his bail review hearing the judge asked Schmidt if he knew the alleged victim and Schmidt replied, \u201cAt the time, no sir, I didn\u2019t. I was drunk. I didn\u2019t know who it was.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 93, 481 A.2d at 244. At trial, Schmidt\u2019s defense was that he knew the victim and that they had engaged in consen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>sual sexual intercourse. Schmidt moved to suppress the statement, but the motion was denied. He was thereafter convicted in the circuit court of second-degree rape, second-degree sexual offense and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Schmidt argued that inculpatory statements made by an accused at a bail review hearing should be excluded under all circumstances. The intermediate appellate court disagreed and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cWe see no need for the <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule urged by appellant. If an accused who is represented by counsel and who is made aware of his fifth amendment right volunteers a statement deemed helpful to his position at a bail hearing, there is no logical reason why that statement could not be used against him at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\"><em>Schmidt, </em>60 Md.App. at 95, 481 A.2d at 245. <em>See also United States v. Dohm, </em>618 F.2d 1169, 1171 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cWe disagree with [defendant\u2019s] contention that statements made by an accused while seeking bail are necessarily involuntary and coerced.\u201d) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">In the alternative, Schmidt argued that his inculpatory statements were inadmissible because they were made in response to a custodial interrogation without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the bail review proceeding. The Court of Special Appeals agreed that Schmidt was in custody, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">\u201cSchmidt was unquestionably in custody when he appeared before the District Court judge for a bail hearing. He had been arrested and charged; the very purpose of the hearing was to determine whether or under what circumstances he might be released from custody. With respect to the custody aspect, the fact that Schmidt was in a courtroom rather than the stationhouse is of no significance. Custodial questioning can occur in settings other than the police station....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\"><em>Schmidt, </em>60 Md.App. at 97-98, 481 A.2d at 246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">While the intermediate appellate court did agree that Schmidt was in custody, it did not agree with Schmidt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>contention that the bail review judge\u2019s questioning amounted to an interrogation triggering additional <em>Miranda </em>safeguards.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In explaining this view, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201cNot all questions asked of a prisoner or suspect while he is in custody constitute a \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 for purposes of requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As Judge Orth noted for the Court in <em>Vines, </em>it is generally agreed that <em>Miranda </em>does not apply to \u2018administrative questioning,\u2019 the routine questions asked of all arrestees while being processed or \u2018booked.\u2019 Such routine questioning is conducted for purposes unrelated to evidence gathering and prosecution, so the questions are general in nature rather than specifically directed to any criminal offense. <em>Similarly, any questions asked of an arrestee at a bail hearing should normally be general and unrelated to evidence gathering or prosecution.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 99, 481 A.2d at 247 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The question asked of petitioner in the case <em>sub judice, </em>when compared to the question asked in <em>Schmidt, </em>is considerably less pointed. We hold that petitioner was not subject to \u201cinterrogation\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>Here, the District Court judge merely asked him if there was anything he would like to tell about himself. There is absolutely no indication that the District Court judge\u2019s question was designed to elicit an incriminating statement. As we stated, <em>infra, </em>this was a routine, general question not designed to elicit any information about the specific criminal offense. It was an innocuous question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, it was a proper ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tion to ask in determining an appropriate amount of bail. Maryland Rule 4-216 (2004) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cRule 4-216.

If that were to be the case, any voluntary statement or blurt given while a person is in custody, unless it were immediately preceded by new <em>Miranda </em>warnings, would be excludable. That is not the law. <em>Miranda </em>warnings were designed to advise a defendant that anything he said might be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In <em>Schmidt, </em>the Court of Special Appeals further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201cSchmidt\u2019s anxiety to be released on bail does not amount to coercion to incriminate himself. Indeed, he was clearly acting under far less compulsion than if he had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, a situation that does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 579-80, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1777-78, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976). In that case ...' the Court [stated]: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u2018Those <em>[Miranda] </em>warnings were aimed at the evils seen by the Court as endemic to police interrogation of a person in custody. <em>Miranda </em>addressed extrajudicial confessions or admissions procured in a hostile, unfamiliar environment which lacked procedural safeguards. The decision expressly rested on the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination; the prescribed warnings sought to negate the \u201ccompulsion\u201d thought to be inherent in police station interrogation. But the <em>Miranda </em>Court simply did not perceive judicial inquiries and custodial interrogation as equivalents. \u201c[T]he compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.\u201d \u2019 <em>[Miranda], </em>384 U.S. at 461 [86 S.Ct. at 1621].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><em>Schmidt, </em>60 Md.App. at 100, 481 A.2d at 248 (some alterations added). <em>See also Roberts v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 560, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 1364, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980) (stating that the <em>Miranda </em>\u201cexception does not apply outside the context of the inherently coercive custodial interrogations for which it was designed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We hold that nothing in the setting of petitioner\u2019s January 10, 2001 bail review hearing can be said to have coerced him into making his inculpatory statement. The question posed, \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to tell me about yourself, sir?,\u201d was a routine question to ask in a setting such as a bail review hearing. Questions posed to an arrestee by a judge regarding matters relevant to bail, asked in the setting of a bail review hearing, do not normally amount to an \u201cinterrogation\u201d requiring that the arrestee be again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in order that his responses may be later admitted into evidence at his merits trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This necessarily leads us to petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>next argument as to why his inculpatory statement should have been declared inadmissible \u2014 his lack of counsel at the bail review hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Lack of Counsel at the Bail Review Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We first note that there was no indication in the record that petitioner requested the presence of counsel at his bail review hearing and been denied counsel. As noted previously, he was not being interrogated in the sense contemplated by <em>Miranda. </em>Nonetheless, petitioner contends that the Circuit Court judge erred in allowing his statement to be admissible at trial due to his lack of legal counsel at the bail review hearing. For the reasons set forth below, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, serves \u201cto assure aid at trial,\u201d <em>United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 188, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2298, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984), and therefore attaches at the commencement of adversary judicial criminal proceedings. <em>See McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 175, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 2208-09, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); see <em>also Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1239, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977) (stating that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered \u201cat or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated ... \u2018whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>682, 689, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1882, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972)). Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights also guarantees criminal defendants the right to assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 695 n. 3, 496 A.2d 1074, 1079 n. 3 (1985) (stating \u201c[t]his Court has not distinguished between the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and the right provided by Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d) An accused\u2019s right to counsel, however, extends only to those \u201ccritical\u201d proceedings in which \u201c \u2018the accused [is] confronted, just as at trial, by the procedural system, or by his expert adversary, or by both\u2019 ... in a situation where the results of the confrontation \u2018might well settle the accused\u2019s fate and reduce the trial to a mere formality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. at 189, 104 S.Ct. at 2298 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Petitioner\u2019s appearance before a District Court judge for the purpose of setting the appropriate amount of bail pursuant to Md. Rule 4-216 is not such a \u201ccritical\u201d stage of the proceedings requiring that counsel be provided. <em>See Hebron v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 134, 140, 281 A.2d 547, 550 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 748 (1972) (\u201c[w]e do not feel that the proceeding to set bail ... was a critical stage of the criminal proceedings within the constitutional concept of that term contemplated by <em>Coleman [v. Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970)].... We conclude that the assistance of counsel was not constitutionally mandated.\u201d); <em>United States v.

Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 227, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1932, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1157 (1967)); <em>Ex parte Stewart, </em>853 So.2d 901, 904 (Ala.2002) (holding, in the context of an initial appearance at which bail was set, that \u201cthe fact that the court may determine or evaluate the conditions for release does not create an adversarial proceeding or a \u2018critical stage.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In <em>Coleman v. Alabama, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the assistance of counsel at a <em>preliminary hearing </em>was constitutionally mandated. Here, petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing occurred on the day after his arrest (January 10, 2001), but some two months prior to his preliminary hearing (March 20, 2001), and three months before the criminal information was filed (April 18, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In <em>Hebron v. State, supra, </em>the Court of Special Appeals had the opportunity to address the issue now before this Court, <em>i.e., </em>whether the constitutional right to provided counsel applies at the bail hearing stage, an issue we have not addressed prior to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coleman, </em>the intermediate appellate court held that an independent bail hearing was not, in and of itself, a \u201ccritical stage of the criminal proceedings within the constitutional concept of that term contemplated by <em>Coleman.\u201d Hebron, </em>13 Md.App. at 140, 281 A.2d at 550. In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\"><em>\u201cColeman </em>held that the assistance of counsel at a preliminary hearing such as conducted in Maryland was constitutionally mandated. The rationale of the holding was set out in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in announcing the judgment of the Court. Noting that the principle of <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45[, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932),] and succeeding cases requires that the Court scrutinize any pretrial confrontation of the accused to determine whether the presence of his counsel is necessary to preserve the defendant\u2019s basic right to a fair trial as affected by his right meaningfully to cross-examine the witnesses against him</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and to have effective assistance of counsel at the trial itself, he concluded that the guiding hand of counsel at the preliminary hearing was essential to protect the indigent accused against erroneous or improper prosecution. He spelled out the reasons, <em>[Coleman, </em>399 U.S. at 9, 90 S.Ct. at 2003]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">\u2018First, the lawyer\u2019s skilled examination and cross-examination of witnesses may expose fatal weaknesses in the State\u2019s case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over. Second, in any event, the skilled interrogation of witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses at the trial, or preserve testimony favorable to the accused of a witness who does not appear at the trial. Third, trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the State has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial. Fourth, counsel can also be influential at the preliminary hearing in making effective arguments for the accused on such matters as the necessity for an early psychiatric examination or bail.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">It was the inability of the indigent accused on his own right to realize these advantages of a lawyer\u2019s assistance which compelled the conclusion that the preliminary hearing was a \u2018critical stage\u2019 of the criminal process at which the accused is as much entitled to aid of counsel as at the trial itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cExcept that counsel may be influential in making effective argument as to the necessity of bail, we do not see how the other reasons set out in <em>Coleman </em>apply to a hearing the purpose of which is only to set bail and at which, as here, no witnesses were offered as to the substantive offense who could be examined or cross-examined, either to expose a fatal weakness in the State\u2019s case or to fashion a vital impeachment tool at trial or to preserve testimony favorable to the accused and no case was offered by the State for the accused\u2019s counsel to discover and prepare for. We do not believe that the absence of counsel for Hebron at the hearing derogated from his right to a fair trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>Hebron, </em>13 Md.App. at 138-40, 281 A.2d at 549-50 (alterations added) (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We are not prepared, in circumstances such as those existing here, to hold that a bail review hearing is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of criminal proceedings, at which provided counsel is required. Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Hebron, </em>as it pertains to the right to counsel in the setting of a bail review hearing in the nature of that held in the case at bar, and hold, generally, that there exists no Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel during a bail review hearing, the only purpose of which is to ascertain the appropriate amount of bail pursuant to Md. Rule 4-216.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Our holding is also bolstered by the language of Md. Rule 4-213(a), which governs the procedure that a \u201cjudicial officer\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> must follow during an accused\u2019s \u201cinitial appearance.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing occurred shortly after his initial appearance before a District Court commissioner on the morning of January 10, 2001. The Rule, in respect to the duties of a District Court commissioner at an initial appearance, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201cRule 4-213. Initial appearance of defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">(a) In District Court following arrest. When a defendant appears before a judicial officer of the District Court pursuant to an arrest, the judicial officer shall proceed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeb\">...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">(2) Advice of right to counsel. The judicial officer shall require the defendant to read the notice to defendant required to be printed on charging documents in accordance with Rule 4-202(a), or shall read the notice to a defendant who is unable for any reason to do so. A copy of the notice shall be furnished to a defendant who has not yet received a copy of the charging document. The judicial officer shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>advise the defendant that if the defendant appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that the defendant waived counsel and proceeded to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACl\">...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">(4) Pretrial release. The judicial officer shall comply with Rule 4-216 governing pretrial release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As is made plainly clear in Md. Rule 4-213(a)(2), while the judicial officer presiding over the accused\u2019s initial appearance <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> shall make the accused aware of his right to counsel and that counsel will be provided to him if he cannot afford private counsel, which the District Court commissioner in this case presumably did,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> nothing in the Rule suggests that this right to provided counsel attaches at either the initial appearance or a later bail review hearing. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner was not unconstitutionally denied his Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel when he appeared at a bail review hearing. The bail review hearing was not a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings at which the Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">C. Admission at Trial of the Redacted Version of the Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Petitioner argues that the trial court\u2019s admission of his statement at the bail review hearing, in which he stated, \u201cI\u2019m not denying what happened,\u201d was improper because it was \u201ctoo vague and misleading to the trier of fact.\u201d In its decision, the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthe suppression court did not err in finding that the stipulation based upon the edited statement was admissible at trial. Although the statement was edited, the meaning of the statement was not so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>vague or altered that the jury would be unable to understand its meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">It is well established in Maryland that the admission of relevant evidence, the admissibility of which is not prohibited by a specific rule or principle of law, is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404-05, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997) (stating that, \u201c[o]nce a finding of relevancy has been made, we are generally loath to reverse a trial court unless the evidence is plainly inadmissible under a specific rule or principle of law or there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> All relevant evidence is generally admissible. To be relevant, evidence must have a \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401; <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 5-402 (stating that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by constitutions, statutes, or these rules, or by decisional law not inconsistent with these rules, all relevant evidence is admissible.\u201d) We have also stated, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201cA finding by the trial judge that a particular piece of evidence is relevant, however, does not mean that evidence is automatically admissible. Even relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice---- As with the trial court\u2019s relevancy determination, a decision to admit relevant evidence over an objection that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 737, 679 A.2d 1106, 1113 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court found that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI\u2019m not denying what happened,\u201d was relevant and let it be read to the jury. We do not believe that this decision by the trial court amounted to an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d Although the statement was edited, we cannot say that the remaining portion read to the jury was so vague or misleading as to have made the statement inadmissible at trial. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the statement, as admitted, was in some way ambiguous, any ambiguity went to the weight of the statement itself and not to its admissibility. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the stipulation containing the inculpatory statement to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We hold that the District Court judge\u2019s question to petitioner at his bail review hearing, asking him \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to tell me about yourself, sir?,\u201d did not amount to a \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d and, therefore, was not in violation of the requirements of <em>Miranda. </em>The question posed to petitioner was a general question appropriate at a bail review hearing and not designed to elicit any information from him about the specific criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We also hold that there existed no Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel at petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing. A bail review hearing, such as the one that took place here, is not normally a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of trial. We do not find that a proceeding, the purpose of which was merely to review bail and inform petitioner of the scheduled date for his preliminary hearing, was an \u201cadversary judicial criminal proceeding\u201d that would require the aid of provided counsel. Because petitioner\u2019s bail review hearing was not a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the merits trial, there existed no Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Lastly, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing an edited segment of petitioner\u2019s inculpatory statement, in which he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t deny what happened,\u201d to be read to the jury. The statement was unquestionably relevant and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>not so vague or misleading as to be unfairly prejudicial to petitioner. Therefore, the trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion when it allowed the stipulation, which contained the statement, to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

In <em>Drury v.

Due to the rather vague and often disjointed nature of petitioner\u2019s statement at the bail review hearing, we are not entirely certain that petitioner's statement was a <em>response </em>to the District Court judge\u2019s question at all.

We would urge trial judges, however, as a matter of good practice and policy, to advise defendants at initial bail hearings and bail review hearings that an inculpatory statement made at that hearing may be used against him or her at trial.
