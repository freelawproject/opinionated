Zdravkovich,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was admitted to the Maryland Bar on 1 November 1981. The Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d), acting through Bar Counsel, filed a petition for disciplinary action against Respondent on 8 August 2002 after learning that he allowed his escrow account balance to drop below the value of the funds he had received and placed in trust in the account. The Commission alleged that Zdravkovich violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.4,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.15, 8.1, 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d), as well as Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, and Maryland Rule 16-607.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Michael E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Loney of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, to whom we assigned this matter for hearing, made the following relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law (footnote renumbered):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">\n<em>Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201cAlthough Respondent was accused of violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct arising out of a Complaint filed by Milton E. Siegert, Jr., no evidence was presented by Petitioner in that regard. However, the evidence presented indicates that during the investigation of the Siegert Complaint, Bar counsel learned as a result of examination of Respondent\u2019s subpoenaed bank records, of Respondent\u2019s apparent misappropriation of funds held by him on behalf of Charles Hunter, III. Petitioner requested Respondent to provide bank records regarding funds deposited by Hunter, but Respondent failed to respond. Thereafter, Petitioner subpoenaed the bank records. Since no complaint had been made by Hunter, but rather Hunter had been contacted by Petitioner in the course of a related investigation \u2014 Respondent moved to dismiss the Petition, which was held under advisement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201cThe facts of the Hunter problem arise out of a very routine occurrence. On October 28, 1999, Hunter went to the Harley Davidson of Annapolis motorcycle dealership to take delivery of a new 2000 concord purple Harley Davidson FXDWG Wide Glide motorcycle, which he had ordered in July 1999. Hunter was prepared to pay the anticipated balance of the sales price in cash. Hunter indicated that he was an Oregon resident and that he should not pay Maryland sales tax. However, he declined to permit the sales personnel to photocopy his Oregon driver\u2019s license and the dealership refused to sell the motorcycle to him. Hunter protested loudly, refused to leave, and was arrested for trespassing after police were called. Such was the state of affairs when Hunter contacted Respondent \u2014 the employer of Hunter\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 for professional representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201cAfter an initial consultation, it was agreed that Respondent would represent Hunter. The focus was on three matters. First, Respondent would defend Hunter on the criminal trespass charges in the District Court of Maryland. Second, Respondent would attempt to persuade the Harley Davidson dealership to complete the transaction and sell the motorcycle to Hunter and/or would file suit against the dealership for specific performance. Third, if successful in the defense of the criminal case, Respondent would file suit on behalf of Hunter against the Harley Davidson dealership for malicious prosecution. No written fee agreement was prepared. However, Respondent followed up with a letter on November 5, 1999, which outlined the strategy and anticipated fee. In brief, Respondent stated that he agreed to represent Hunter for fixed fees of $1,500.00 in the criminal matter, $3,500.00 in the specific performance case, and $5,000.00 for the malicious prosecution case. No specifics were discussed and no agreement was made with regard to payment of costs. Hunter never signed the letter or any other fee agreement. However, at that time, Hunter paid $1,500.00 to Respondent for representation in the criminal case and $15,552.00 (which represented Hunter\u2019s assertion of the balance of the price of the motorcycle), which was deposited in Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\u201cRespondent immediately took action on behalf of Hunter. He entered his appearance in the criminal case and communicated with the Harley Davidson dealership through counsel in an effort to complete the transaction and offered to pay the $15,552.00 which was represented to be in his escrow account. Thereafter, he promptly filed suit for specific performance on November 30, 1999, paid the filing costs, and continued negotiations on behalf of Hunter. Respondent did not keep time records or otherwise document the sequence of his representation of Hunter. The efforts to negotiate the purchase were not successful and eventually Respondent petitioned the [Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County] to deposit Hunter\u2019s $15,552.00 with the Clerk of Court (which was denied). Respondent later refunded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>$15,552.00 to Hunter. Thus, he never received a fee for services rendered in the specific performance case or for costs advanced by him. Respondent represented Hunter in the criminal trial before the District Court, which resulted in a probation before judgment being entered, which was accepted by Hunter.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">\u201cIn the course of its examination of Respondent\u2019s trust account records regarding the Siegert Complaint, Petitioner observed the deposit of $15,552.00 which was made on November 6,1999. It was apparent that almost immediately thereafter the balance in the trust account was reduced substantially below the amount which had been deposited by Hunter. It was apparent that Respondent had invaded the account and that $9,292.11 may have been misappropriated. Subsequently, deposits were made to the account as a result of a check from Respondent\u2019s son in the amount of $8,000.00 on April 1,2000 and from Respondent\u2019s operating account in the amount of $1,400.00 on April 13, 2000. A check for $15,552.00 was disbursed to Hunter on April 12, 2000. <em>See </em>Exhibits 15 and 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201cIn this case, no complaint was made by a victim to the Attorney Grievance Commission. The investigation of Respondent with regard to Hunter came about because Petitioner was in the process of investigating a prior complaint from Siegert and bank escrow records indicated a large deposit \u2014 later determined to be that from Hunter \u2014 and an apparent immediate diminishment of those funds. For that reason, Respondent argues that the matter should be dismissed as to him. Rule 16-704(b) provides that Bar counsel shall \u201cinvestigate all matters involving possible misconduct called to his attention whether by complaint or otherwise.\u201d Under the Rule, Bar counsel had the authority to investigate possible misconduct from whatever source and had the duty to do so when confronted with an apparent violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the Rules of Professional Conduct while in the process of investigating another complaint against the same attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">\u201cRespondent did not adequately explain the terms of the fee arrangement to his client and did not prepare a written fee agreement, which contributed to the eventual breakdown of confidence in Respondent by his client and the eventual termination of the attorney/client relationship. That is regrettable because Respondent did perform professional services for Hunter. He expended time and effort in the representation of Hunter in the criminal matter, which resulted in a disposition of probation before judgment, which was accepted by Hunter. The fee of $1,500.00 for representation in the criminal matter was reasonable, was agreed to by the client, and was earned by Respondent. Respondent also used his efforts to attempt to accomplish the purchase of the motorcycle on behalf of Hunter although he was not successful in persuading the dealership to complete the transaction. It is evident that the behavior of Hunter at the dealership and the manner of negotiation persuaded the dealership not to change its mind in its decision not to do business with Hunter. In addition, Respondent was diligent in promptly filing suit for specific performance on behalf of Hunter. The complaint was filed promptly and capably. Hunter was competently represented by Respondent in the matter. In hindsight, it is clear that Respondent did not adequately communicate with Hunter to explain the cause of action available to him and to discuss reasonable expectations. Thus, it was in March <em>2000 </em>that Hunter terminated Respondent\u2019s representation of him notwithstanding the fact that Respondent had provided professional services to Hunter, had expended costs on his behalf, and had not been paid for his representation in the civil matter. In short, after five months, Hunter was dissatisfied because he had not yet won and fired his attorney. His expectations were not reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201cFrom the evidence, the Court concludes that the parties agreed to a fee of $1,500.00 for representation in the criminal case and that Hunter\u2019s $15,552.00 would be placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Respondent\u2019s trust account to be used to complete the purchase of the motorcycle. The $15,522.00 was intended solely for that purpose. It was offered to the Harley Davidson dealership and subsequently Respondent offered to pay it into Court. Notwithstanding the fact that the $15,522.00 was to be used for that purpose, Respondent\u2019s bank records show that the funds were improperly diminished and were not available when offered by Respondent on behalf of his client to the dealership and to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">\u201cIt is, based upon the facts set forth above, the conclusion of this Court that the Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cRule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201cAn applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">\u201c(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">\u201cWhen Respondent came under suspicion in the course of the Siegert investigation, Bar counsel requested him to provide [ ] information regarding the trust account. Respondent did not respond. He did nothing. As a result, Bar counsel issued an appropriate subpoena to Respondent\u2019s bank and completed the investigation by acquiring records of the account, which indicated an invasion of Hunter\u2019s escrowed funds (Exhibit 15). Respondent now argues that he refused because Hunter had not filed a complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\u201cRule 8.1(b) provides an exception to that rule where disclosure of information is otherwise protected by Rule 1.6: Confidentiality of information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">\u201cRule 1.6(b)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201c(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">\u201c(3) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, or to establish a defense to a criminal charge, civil claim, or disciplinary complaint against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved or to respond to allegations in any proceedings concerning the lawyer\u2019s representation of the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cAt the December 17, 2003 evidentiary hearing, Charles Hunter, III testified he was not waiving his attorney-client privilege. No evidence was presented that justified a basis for refusing to provide the requested information based on Rule 1.6. Therefore, the Court ruled that Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the Hunter matter would not violate the attorney-client privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.1(b) by knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority. The Court further finds that it was appropriate for Bar counsel to investigate under such circumstances \u2014 when presented with an apparent violation of professional conduct while in the process of investigating a complaint by another client of the same attorney. To have done otherwise would have been to ignore an apparent violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">\u201cRule 1.15 Safekeeping Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEW\">\u201c(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.

Funds of a client or beneficial owner may be pooled and commingled in an attorney trust account with the funds held for other clients or beneficial owners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cThe trust account records are persuasive and clearly show what happened to the Hunter funds. Very soon after they were deposited in Respondent\u2019s trust account, disbursements were made from the account on other unrelated matters, which caused the balance to be reduced to $6,259.89. Thus, when Respondent wrote to the Harley Davidson dealership on behalf of Hunter and offered to pay $15,552.00 for the motorcycle, Respondent did not have that amount in his escrow account. Likewise, when he petitioned the Court to deposit the funds on behalf of Hunter, he did not have them in his account. When things turned sour between Respondent and Hunter, Respondent obtained funds from his son ($8,000.00) and deposited $1,400.00 of personal funds, which enabled him to refund the escrowed funds to Hunter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cRespondent now argues that he made a mistake when he inadvertently overpaid on a claim from the trust account to Erma Assberry, Esq. ($1,000.00) on behalf of another client. More importantly, he now contends that he had authority from Hunter to withdraw the funds to pay fees owed to him for professional services rendered on behalf of Hunter whenever Respondent believed that they were due and owing. According to Respondent, he could draw from Hunter\u2019s $15,552.00 escrow funds whenever he wanted because of the fee agreement that he had with Hunter. Hunter unequivocally denies and disputes any such agreement or authorization. He confirms and the Court finds that the $15,552.00 was to be used solely for the purchase of the motorcycle. As indicated above, no such agreement was reduced to writing or adequately agreed to by Respondent and Hunter. It was the duty and responsibility of Respondent to clearly articulate the fee arrangement with his client and to insure that it was agreed to an understood by both parties. He failed to do so and failed to keep separate the funds of himself and his client. Thus, Respondent invaded the escrowed funds of his client and used them for purposes other than the client\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. 1.15(a), (b), 8.4(b), (c), (d), Md.Code Ann., Bus.

The hearing judge was not convinced by any of the scant evidence Respondent presented that this understanding was altered at any time or that the money was meant originally to be used for some other purpose. Generally we defer to the hearing judge on questions of witness credibility. We see no reason to do otherwise here.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Given the finding that the $15,552.00 remained Hunter\u2019s property until it was returned to him, Respondent\u2019s escrow account bank records serve as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of misappropriation. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 472, 671 A.2d 463, 475 (1996) (\u201cThe mere fact that the balance in an attorney trust account falls below the total amounts held in trust supports a <em>prima facie </em>finding of violation of the rule.\u201d). Those records indicate that the escrow account balance dropped to $6,259.89 just prior to Respondent returning Hunter\u2019s money to him, and that Respondent replaced the missing $9,292.11 by depositing a check for $8,000 from his son and another for $1,400 from his operating account. Respondent did not provide a satisfactory explanation for why his escrow account balance fell below the level of the funds that were to be held in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The balance in Respondent\u2019s escrow account, which was $5,500.08 just before Respondent deposited Hunter\u2019s $15,552.00 check on 6 November 1999, initially dropped to $14,552.08 on 12 November 1999 when Respondent disbursed $6,500 to Erma Assbury. Respondent testified that he made a $1,000 mistake by that disbursement; rather, he owed her only $5,500 on an unrelated matter. According to Respondent, this $1,000 error should not be regarded as misappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ation or, if it were deemed such, it was not intentional. This argument indicates initially some confusion about the meaning of the word misappropriation. \u201cMisappropriation is any unauthorized use by an attorney of a client\u2019s funds entrusted to him or her, whether or not temporary or for personal gain or benefit.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 484, 671 A.2d at 481. The testimony, if believed, that the $1,000 over-disbursement was unintentional, and that Respondent did not benefit personally, does not negate the fact that Respondent committed misappropriation by allowing his escrow account balance to drop below the value of the funds to be held in trust therein. We have held, however, that unintentional or negligent misappropriation is a less grievous offense than intentional misappropriation. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cafferty, </em>376 Md. 700, 724-5, 831 A.2d 1042, 1057 (2003). The record is silent as to any evidence contradicting Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the Erma Assbury disbursement. The hearing judge reported Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the Erma Assbury disbursement, but made no findings of fact specific to that disbursement and did not indicate whether he found Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the Erma Assbury disbursement to be credible or not. Thus, for the purposes of determining the proper sanction <em>infra, </em>we shall consider this $1,000 misappropriation to be an unintentional, negligent one, rather than intentional misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Respondent\u2019s subsequent disbursements, which reduced the funds held in the escrow account to $6,259.89 by 1 April 2000, cannot be accounted for similarly. The bulk of those withdrawals came in the form of a series of transfers of funds in amounts between $1,000 and $2,000 to Respondent\u2019s law firm operating account. For example, the last of these was a transfer of $1,000 from the escrow account to the operating account that Respondent authorized by telephone on 25 February 2000. After that withdrawal, the amount held in trust in the escrow account never rose aboye $6,300, with the exception of three days in March 2000 when Respondent deposited and then withdrew $50,000 from the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Respondent\u2019s explanation for the $1000 to $2000 withdrawals is that he and Hunter agreed that the $15,552.00 was held in the nature of a retainer, and that those withdrawals were money Respondent earned by representing Hunter in the various matters. The hearing judge, however, apparently credited Hunter\u2019s testimony that they had never come to such an understanding. As previously noted, we are loath generally to override a hearing judge\u2019s determination regarding the credibility of witnesses. We do not do so here. Moreover, Respondent\u2019s claim is inconsistent with his further testimony. Respondent repaid Hunter the $15,552.00 when requested to do so. An attorney who had earned the funds as fees, which he had withdrawn from the account, very likely would have attempted to keep what he had earned. We conclude that Respondent intentionally misappropriated those funds when he transferred them to his operating account without Hunter\u2019s permission. We deny Respondent\u2019s exceptions numbered one through four.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Exception Five</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Respondent argues that, \u201cin the absence of a complaint by Hunter, the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s actions in this case were improper.\u201d Respondent does not argue that the Commission lacked the ability to investigate him even though no complaint was filed, acknowledging that \u201cBar Counsel, subject to supervision by the Commission, is to investigate all matters involving possible misconduct called to his attention by complaint <em>or otherwise.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>claims, however, that the Commission committed three improper actions: (1) breaching the confidentiality of the investigation by speaking to Hunter; (2) allowing the Commission\u2019s investigator, rather than Bar Counsel, to request information from Respondent and Respondent\u2019s bank; and (3) requesting Respondent\u2019s bank information and then obtaining it by subpoena before filing a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The argument that the Commission breached the confidentiality of the investigation by speaking to Hunter is spurious. The Commission\u2019s work must be kept confidential. Rule 16-723. <em>See also </em>former Rule 16-708 (repealed 30 November 2000, effective 30 June 2001). Respondent seems to suggest that each time an investigator asks questions of a witness the investigator breaches these confidentiality requirements. Such a rule would limit seriously Attorney Grievance investigations and was not what this Court intended when it adopted Rule 16-723 or former Rule 16-708. The Commission did not disclose any confidential information to Hunter. Hunter merely was asked questions about the trust funds. The fact that he may have drawn the inference that Respondent was under investigation does not render the Commission\u2019s investigation a breach of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Respondent argues that \u201c[t]he investigator for Bar Counsel, not Bar Counsel, made the request for the Respondent\u2019s escrow account bank records\u201d and that Respondent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>therefore not required to comply. Bar Counsel is explicitly authorized to \u201cemploy attorneys, investigators, and staff personnel as authorized by the Commission at the compensation set forth in the Commission\u2019s budget.\u201d Rule 16-712(b)(9). <em>See also </em>former Rule 16-704(b)(iv) (repealed 30 November 2000, effective 30 June 2001). Nothing in the Maryland Rules prohibits Bar Counsel from delegating appropriate authority to his investigatory employees. Respondent did not respond to the request made by the investigator employed by the Commission, nor did he make any attempt to determine whether the investigator was acting as the agent of Bar Counsel or of the Commission. Respondent may have been entitled to request confirmation that the investigator\u2019s request was a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority, but he was not entitled to ignore it altogether. <em>See </em>MRPC Rule 8.1. <em>See also </em>the discussion of exception seven, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">As previously noted, the Commission first became aware of potential problems related to Respondent\u2019s representation of Hunter during the course of its investigation of a complaint filed by a Mr. Siegert. Hunter did not file any complaint, nor was any complaint ever filed in reference to the funds held in trust for Hunter. Respondent claims that the Commission should not have issued a subpoena to his bank without a complaint specific to the conduct, related to Hunter, that it was investigating at the time. He bases this argument on former Rule 16-704(c), governing subpoenas: <em>\u201cAfter a complaint has been filed, </em>and with the prior written approval of the Chair or Acting Chair of the Commission, Bar Counsel may issue a subpoena to compel the production of designated documents or other tangible things at a time and place specified in the subpoena.\u201d Former Rule 16-704(c)(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Respondent was aware that the Siegert complaint had been filed against him. He also was aware that the Commission was investigating the Hunter matter because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Commission earlier requested, in a 22 November 2000 letter to him, the precise information that it later received from the bank. Respondent has not alleged any prejudice from the Commission\u2019s action in this regard. If Respondent objected to the Commission\u2019s subpoena of his bank records, the proper time for action was in November 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">We deny Respondent\u2019s exception five.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Exception Six</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Respondent alleges that the hearing judge was biased against him. He bases this on the fact that the hearing judge \u201cconsidered <em>ex parte </em>the Petitioner\u2019s Requests for Admissions and accepted verbatim the allegations of Bar Counsel in both the Siegert complaint and the Hunter matter\u201d and \u201cthe Hearing Judge gives no credence to the Respondent\u2019s testimony, the documentary evidence and the record that shows a total absence of any intent to misappropriate [Hunter\u2019s] money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The hearing judge accepted the Commission\u2019s requests for admissions <em>ex parte </em>on 18 December 2002 because Respondent chose to walk out of those proceedings. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>375 Md. 110, 118, 825 A.2d 418, 422 (2003). It is pure chutzpah for Respondent to complain now that the hearing judge did not hear him out on that occasion. The fact that the hearing judge found Respondent\u2019s testimony not to be credible, and found the evidence presented by the Commission to be credible, is no basis for a finding that the hearing judge was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">We deny Respondent\u2019s exception six.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Exception Seven</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Respondent\u2019s seventh exception is \u201cthere was no violation of Rule 8.1.\u201d Respondent failed to respond to the Commission\u2019s request for his escrow account bank records. His responses to the Commission\u2019s previous requests for information had been, in the words of the Assistant Bar Counsel assigned to the case, \u201cflagrantly devoid of any information upon which I might draw to reach any conclusions about the allegations against you.\u201d Letter from John C. Broderick, Esq., Assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Bar Counsel, to Dushko S. Zdravkovich (12 April 2002) (admitted before the hearing judge as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Respondent argues now that any disclosure on his part would have harmed materially his client, Hunter. Respondent does not explain how this disclosure would have harmed Hunter\u2019s interests. Respondent was aware that a failure to disclose the information could lead to the issuance of a subpoena to his bank. If, in fact, some harm could have come to Hunter through the disclosure, then Respondent had a duty to inform the Commission of that fact so that some alternative method could have been crafted for determining whether misappropriation had occurred. Respondent waived the argument by failing to respond in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We deny Respondent\u2019s exception seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Exception Eight</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Respondent argues that \u201cthe charges of ethical violations in the Hunter matter should be dismissed in the absence of a client complaint to the Attorney Grievance Commission and when there is no waiver by the client of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d As already noted, <em>supra, </em>in the discussion of his fifth exception, Respondent recognizes that the Maryland Rules empower Bar Counsel to investigate \u201call matters involving possible misconduct called to his attention by complaint or otherwise.\u201d The absence of a client complaint alleging the specific misconduct for which the Commission seeks to sanction Respondent is no basis for the dismissal of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Escrow account bank records are not subject to the confidentiality requirements of MRPC Rule 1.6 or to the attorney-client privilege. In <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. 1, 602 A.2d 1220 (1992), we explained that the attorney-client privilege does not normally bar disclosure of attorney fee payment information related to an attorney\u2019s former clients.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also In re Criminal Investigation No. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>1/296X, </em>336 Md. 1, 646 A.2d 389 (1994) (extending the same rule to current clients of the attorney). \u201cThe overwhelming weight of authority holds that the attorney-client privilege is generally not violated by requiring disclosure of the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.\u201d <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. at 7, 602 A.2d at 1222. Bank statements, which are not communications between an attorney and a client, merely provide the type of attorney fee payment information that we have held to be exempt from the attorney-client privilege and MRPC Rule 1.6. That certain types of financial records are subject to disclosure to the Commission is evidenced by Maryland Rules 16-610(b)(1)(E) (requiring banks to \u201c[ajllow reasonable access to all records of an attorney trust account if an audit of the account is ordered\u201d) and 16-722 (providing for audits of an attorney\u2019s financial records). <em>See also </em>former Rule 16-718 (repealed 30 November 2000, effective 30 June 2001) (providing for audits similar to those currently allowed by current Rule 16-722). The disclosure of Respondent\u2019s escrow account records was not a breach of the confidentiality requirements of MRPC Rule 1.6 or of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We deny Respondent\u2019s exception eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">After reviewing the record, we find sufficient evidence to support, by a clear and convincing standard, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Hunter testified that he gave Respondent the $15,522.00 to hold in trust and to use as the purchase price for a motorcycle. The escrow account records demonstrate that Respondent repeatedly invaded Hunter\u2019s funds held in trust and then scrambled to add, at the eleventh hour, enough cash to the escrow account to allow him to return Hunter\u2019s money to him. Respondent provided no adequate explanation for these actions. This conduct amount<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ed to intentional misappropriation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> misuse of trust funds, and commingling of funds in direct violation of MRPC Rule 1.15, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, and Maryland Rule 16-607. Intentional misappropriation is also a violation of MRPC Rules 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Herman, </em>380 Md. 378, 402, 844 A.2d 1181, 1196 (2004). When asked to supply bank records and other information to the Commission, Respondent violated MRPC Rule 8.1 by at times giving insufficient responses and at other times failing to respond at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Having concluded that Respondent violated MRPC Rules 1.15, 8.1, 8.4(b), 8.4(c) and 8.4(d) as well as Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, and Maryland Rule 16-607, we must determine the proper sanction. Under the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, the purpose of attorney discipline is not to punish the lawyer, but to deter misconduct and to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Post, </em>379 Md. 60, 70, 839 A.2d 718, 724 (2003). \u201c[T]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Although in this case the client suffered no actual financial loss, \u201cmisappropriation is a most egregious violation even without actual loss, because the failure to keep client funds separate subjects the funds to the claims of creditors of the lawyer. The rule is concerned with the risk of loss, not only the actual loss.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 489, 671 A.2d at 483. Intentional misappropriation of funds entrusted to an attorney\u2019s care \u201cis an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and, in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568, 810 A.2d 487, 491-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>92 (2002). <em>See also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001). We find no such compelling extenuating circumstances here. Respondent, who has in previous cases been reprimanded and indefinitely suspended by this court, <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. 1, 762 A.2d 950 (2000), presented no plausible evidence of mitigating circumstances.

We infer from each party\u2019s use of the former rules no longer in effect that this case was before one of those bodies prior to the cut-off date, and that therefore the former rules continue to apply.
