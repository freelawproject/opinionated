This case comes to us by a Certified Question from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12-601 through 12-613 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>8-305.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the Certification Order, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized the circumstances giving rise to the question now before us: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>turn, was a contractor working for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (\u201cWMATA\u201d), which owned the site.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Appellant Joao Rodrigues-Novo was injured in a construction accident while working at the Branch Avenue Metro Station in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. At the time of the accident, Rodrigues-Novo was employed by Pessoa Construction, Inc. (\u201cPessoa\u201d). Pessoa was a subcontractor of appellee Recchi America, Inc. (\u201cRecchi\u201d). Recchi, in</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Appellant Rodrigues-Novo and his wife filed suit in the District of Columbia Superior Court against Recchi [and] WMATA ... alleging negligence in the supervision, maintenance, and inspection of the loader and construction site, which negligence they claimed caused their damages. The trial court granted summary judgment to both defendants, on the ground that under the Maryland law of workers\u2019 compensation they were \u201cstatutory employers\u201d and hence immune from suit. An appeal has been taken to [the District of Columbia Court of Appeals] challenging that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The answer to this question of law will be determinative of th[e] appeal and it appears to [the District of Columbia Court of Appeals] that as to WMATA, there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute in Maryland. Furthermore, the issue is one of general importance, given the extensive ongoing activities of WMATA in Maryland. Accordingly, pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 11-723(h) (2001), the Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 12-601 et seq. (2002 Repl.), and Rule 8-305 of the Maryland Court of Appeals, we hereby respectfully certify to the Maryland Court of Appeals the following question of law: Whether, in the circumstances of this case, WMATA was a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and hence immune from suit alleging negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>For the following reasons, we hold that, under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, WMATA was a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of Rodrigues-Novo at the time of his injury. Therefore, WMATA is immune from Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s claim of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On July 15, 1999, Rodrigues-Novo was working on the construction project at the Branch Avenue Metro Station in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. While using a Toyota SDK-8 Loader to break up a driveway that had been built incorrectly, Rodrigues-Novo sustained a serious injury leading to the loss of his lower right leg. At the time of the accident, WMATA had a contract relationship with Recchi, in which Recchi had agreed to construct an extension of WMATA\u2019s subterranean \u201cGreen Line,\u201d including the Branch Avenue Station. To complete the work, Recchi had entered into a subcontract with Pessoa, which promised to complete certain road construction and other concrete work at the Station. Rodrigues-Novo worked for Pessoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Shortly after his injury, Rodrigues-Novo applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. When WMATA\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., learned of Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s application, it notified the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission that WMATA\u2019s \u201cwrap-up\u201d workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> covered the claim. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>wrap-up insurance carried by WMATA provides compensation benefits for all workers on Metro construction projects, including those who are employed by companies that contract with WMATA to carry out work on those projects. <em>See WMATA v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 925, 929-30, 104 S.Ct. 2827, 2830, 81 L.Ed.2d 768, 774 (1984) (discussing the origin and purpose of WMATA\u2019s wrap-up workers\u2019 compensation insurance). Rodrigues-Novo has received some benefits from WMATA\u2019s wrap-up insurance coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">B. The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (hereinafter the \u201cAct\u201d), which is currently codified under Maryland Code, Sections 9-101 to 9-1201 of the Labor and Employment Article (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), was first enacted in 1914, as its title suggests, to compensate employees who were injured on the job. <em>Harris v. Board of Education of Howard County, </em>375 Md. 21, 28-29, 825 A.2d 365, 370 (2003); <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>278 Md. 453, 454, 365 A.2d 287, 288 (1976) (hereinafter <em>\u201cHonaker </em>I\u201d); <em>see also Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 496, 520 A.2d 717, 723 (1987); <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 222-23, 401 A.2d 1013, 1016-17 (1979) (hereinafter <em>\u201cHonaker II\u201d). </em>The Act was designed as a delicate balance: on one hand, the Act took away employees\u2019 rights to sue employers for negligence, yet, on the other hand, it ensured employees the \u201cright to quick and certain compensation for injuries sustained during the course of their employment, regardless of fault.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 496, 520 A.2d at 723 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Mountaire Farms, </em>305 Md. 246, 250, 503 A.2d 708, 710 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Accordingly, with exceptions not relevant here, the Act provides the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy for an injured employee against his or her employer, as set forth in Section 9-509 of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">(a) <em>Employers. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this title, the liability of an employer under this title is exclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">(b) <em>Covered employees and dependents. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this title, the compensation provided under this title to a covered employee or the dependents of a covered employee is in place of any right of action against any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Whether an employee-employer relationship exists in the context of workers\u2019 compensation depends typically on the common law rules of the \u201cmaster\u201d and \u201cservant\u201d relationship. <em>See Brady, </em>308 Md. at 499, 520 A.2d at 724 (citing <em>Edith </em>A. <em>Anderson Nursing Homes, Inc. v. Walker, </em>232 Md. 442, 444, 194 A.2d 85, 85-86 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">When certain conditions are met, however, the Act broadens the definition of employer to cover principal contractors that ordinarily would not be considered the worker\u2019s employer under the common law rules of \u201cmaster\u201d and \u201cservant.\u201d <em>See Brady, </em>308 Md. at 499-500, 520 A.2d at 724. To that end, Section 9-508(a) of the Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A principal contractor is liable to pay to a covered employee or the dependents of the covered employee any compensation that the principal contractor would have been liable to pay had the covered employee been employed directly by the principal contractor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">(1) the principal contractor undertakes to perform any work that is part of the business, occupation, or trade of the principal contractor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">(2) the principal contractor contracts with a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of all or part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">(3) the covered employee is employed in the execution of that work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We used the term \u201cstatutory employer\u201d in <em>State, to Use of Hubert v. Bennett Building Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 162, 140 A. 52, 53 (1928) to describe the impact of these provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">The effect of this provision, when brought into operation through the designated state of circumstances, is to impose the absolute liability of an employer upon the principal contractor, when he was not in law the employer of the injured workman. The result then is that where the prescribed conditions exist, the principal contractor becomes by the act the statutory employer of any workman employed in the execution of the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Therefore, an injured worker\u2019s exclusive remedy against a principal contractor is the compensation available under the Act. <em>See Para v. Richards Group of Washington L.P., </em>339 Md. 241, 253-54, 661 A.2d 737, 744 (1995) (\u201cIn return for providing workers\u2019 compensation coverage, the principal contractor is immune from civil liability for injuries suffered by covered employees.\u201d); <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 502, 520 A.2d at 726 (stating that \u201cthe injured worker\u2019s exclusive remedy against [a statutory employer] is under the [Act]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Principal contractors who do not meet the requirements of Section 9-508 are not \u201cemployers\u201d and, as a result, do not benefit from the tort immunity created by the Act. Controversies over whether a principal contractor meets the requirements of Section 9-508, therefore, commonly arise when an injured worker seeks to bring a claim for negligence against a principal contractor rather than seek compensation under the Act. <em>See </em>Richard P. Gilbert &amp; Robert L. Humphreys, Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 3.3-1 (2d. ed.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In order to determine whether one qualifies as a statutory employer under the Act, this Court has separated the requirements of Section 9-508 into four elements. As we first expressed in <em>Honaker I, </em>the entity seeking tort immunity must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">(1) a principal contractor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">(2) who has contracted to perform work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>(3) which is a part of his trade, business or occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">(4) who has contracted with any other party as a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 459-60, 365 A.2d at 291; <em>see also Para, </em>339 Md. at 249, 661 A.2d at 741-42; <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 503, 520 A.2d at 726-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We have interpreted these requirements to mean that there must be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">two contracts, one between the principal contractor and a third party whereby it is agreed that the principal contractor will execute certain work for the third party, and another between the principal contractor and a person as subcontractor whereby the subcontractor agrees to do the whole or part of such work for the principal contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao\"><em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291. In more recent opinions, we have used the terms \u201cantecedent undertaking,\u201d \u201cantecedent contract,\u201d or \u201cprincipal contract\u201d to refer to the contract between the principal contractor and a third party. <em>Para, </em>339 Md. at 250, 661 A.2d at 742; <em>Lathroum v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., Inc., </em>309 Md. 445, 449, 524 A.2d 1228, 1230 (1987); <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 504, 520 A.2d at 727. The \u201csubcontract\u201d is the contract that the principal contractor enters into with another entity for that entity to \u201cdo the whole or part\u201d of the work that the principal contractor has an obligation to complete. <em>See Brady, </em>308 Md. at 504, 520 A.2d at 727; <em>see Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., Inc. v. Imbraguglio, </em>346 Md. 573, 599, 697 A.2d 885, 898 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">C. Relationship of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Several documents govern the relationships of the parties, define WMATA\u2019s role in the construction of the Branch Avenue Station, and otherwise shed light on whether WMATA was a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of Rodrigues-Novo. These documents, which we discuss individually, include: (1) the WMATA Compact; (2) the Fifth Annual Capital Contributions Agreement (hereinafter \u201cICCA 5\u201d); (3) the WMATA-Recchi Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tract (hereinafter the \u201cRecchi Contract\u201d); and (4) the Recchi-Pessoa Contract (hereinafter the \u201cPessoa Contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">1. WMATA Compact</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In 1966, the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Virginia created WMATA by entering into an interstate compact called the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact (hereinafter the \u201cCompact\u201d). <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 9-1107.01 (2003) (containing the current provisions of the Compact); 80 Stat. 1324 (1966). One purpose of the Compact was \u201cto create a regional instrumentality ... empowered ... to plan, develop, finance and cause to be operated improved transit facilities.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>art. II, cl. 2. The Compact also provides that WMATA may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">(d) Construct, acquire, own, operate, maintain, control, sell and convey real and personal property and any interest therein by contract, purchase, condemnation, lease, license, mortgage or otherwise but all of said property shall be ... necessary or useful in rendering transit service or in activities incidental thereto ... [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">(f) Enter into and perform contracts, leases and agreements with any person, firm or corporation or with any political subdivision or agency of any signatory party or with the federal government, or any agency thereof, including, but not limited to, contracts or agreements to furnish transit facilities and service----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\"><em>Id. </em>art. V, cl. 12(d) &amp; 12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The Compact further authorizes WMATA to develop a plan for the regional mass transit system, which must include plans for \u201ctransit facilities,\u201d such as the \u201clocations of terminals, stations, platforms,, [and] parking facilities.... \u201d The plan also must designate \u201cthe design and location\u201d of the transit facilities, whether the facilities are to be \u201cconstructed or acquired by lease, purchase or condemnation,\u201d as well as \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>timetable for the provision of such facilities.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>art. VI, cl. 13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In furtherance of the regional plan, WMATA is directed to \u201cprepare and adopt a plan for financing the construction, acquisition, and operation\u201d of any planned facilities. <em>Id. </em>art. VII, cl. 17(a). Financing of work on the Maryland portions of WMATA\u2019s mass transit system (hereinafter \u201cMetro\u201d) must comply with the Compact, as set forth in Section 18(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT4\">Commitments on behalf of the portion of the Zone located in Maryland shall be by contract or agreement by the Authority with the Washington Suburban Transit District, pursuant to which the Authority undertakes to provide transit facilities and service in consideration for the agreement by said District to contribute to the capital required for the construction and/or acquisition of facilities specified in a mass transit plan ... and for meeting expenses and obligations incurred in the operation of such facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\"><em>Id. </em>art. VII, cl. 18(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">2. Fifth Interim Capital Contributions Agreement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">In 1992, WMATA entered into the Fifth Interim Capital Contributions Agreement (hereinafter the \u201cICCA 5\u201d) with the Washington Suburban Transit District and numerous political subdivisions around the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Agreement provides that WMATA\u2019s funding \u201cfor [the] accomplishment of the construction program and related activities of the Metrorail System\u201d comes from contributions from the political subdivisions as well as grants made by the Federal Transit Administration. In addition to the funding provisions, the ICCA 5 states that WMATA \u201cwill proceed with all practical dispatch to accomplish the construction program and related activities____\u201d Under the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the ICCA 5, the construction of the Metrorail System includes the construction of four new line segments, one of which is \u201cBranch Avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The ICCA 5 allows the political subdivisions certain control over the management of the construction projects. For example, WMATA annually must submit a proposed rail construction budget to the political subdivisions, and a political subdivision \u201cmay recommend a change in station facilities (i.e. the size of a parking lot or structure or the size of a rail station bus facility or kiss-and-ride lot) within that [political subdivision] so long as the recommended change does not change the adopted regional alignment.\u201d Furthermore, the ICCA 5 provides remedies for the political subdivisions should the construction of the Metro not occur according to the agreed schedule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">In the event that the Federal Transit Administration does not approve a real estate, design, or construction project ... or a project is significantly delayed for reasons beyond the control of any [political subdivision] and cannot be initiated in the year in which its commencement is scheduled in Exhibit 1, then the funds allocated for such project may be reassigned to any other project within the affected revenue producing line; alternatively, upon approval of the [WMATA] Board of Directors, funds may be advanced on an interim basis for [other projects] to other [political subdivisions] on such terms as the affected [political subdivision] may agree.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Similarly, WMATA has certain rights under the ICCA 5 if any political subdivision does not provide the promised funding for a project. In particular, WMATA may \u201csuspend or terminate any project or activity\u201d if a political subdivision does not commit funds for that project or if the political subdivision \u201cdoes not perform its obligation under its [Local Funding Agreement].\u201d WMATA enters into such Local Funding Agreements with political subdivisions to \u201cestablish arrangements for their commitment to pay local contributions\u201d to WMATA construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Exhibit 1 of the ICCA 5 is entitled \u201cWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Rail Construction Program.\u201d That Exhibit provides for the construction of the F Route of the Metrorail System (Branch Avenue) in Prince George\u2019s County, the part of the Metrorail System that Rodrigues-Novo was working on when he was injured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">3. Recchi Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">On February 16, 1996, WMATA and Recchi executed an agreement, under which Recchi would provide: \u201c[c]onstruction of the Branch Avenue Station and 7,710 Lineal feet of line Section including 2,620 feet of precast segmental single box girder aerial section and 5,090 feet of retained-cut, retained fill and at-grade section; and at-grade parking for 3,370 vehicles.\u201d The section of the Recchi Contract entitled \u201cConcrete Pavement\u201d \u201cspecifies providing portland cement concrete pavements, plain or reinforced, on a prepared subgrade or base for vehicular traffic and parking in conformance with the sections to lines and grades as shown.\u201d The Recchi Contract also contains a section providing details of the construction of \u201cCurbs, Gutters, and Walks,\u201d including the materials and mixes to be used as well as for the execution of all concrete work.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">4. The Pessoa Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">To complete the concrete paving according to its agreement with WMATA, Recchi engaged Pessoa, Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s immediate employer, to furnish the necessary labor, equipment, and supplies. The contract between Recchi and Pessoa, which refers specifically to the Recchi contract with WMATA, explains Pessoa\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the removal of any of its work that does not meet certain specifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApM\">[Recchi] and Engineer shall have the right to inspect [Pessoa\u2019s] Work and fabrication of materials at the Project, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Subcontractor\u2019s plant, or elsewhere. Within twenty-four (24) hours after written notice from [Recchi], [Pessoa] shall proceed promptly to take down all portions of work and remove from the Project all materials, whether worked or unworked, which Engineer condemns or fails to approve and shall promptly make good all such work and all other work damaged or destroyed in removing or making good the condemned or unapproved work, all at no additional cost to [Recchi].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Rodrigues-Novo was injured while attempting to remove a section of concrete that Pessoa previously had incorrectly installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Our resolution of the present controversy is informed by the four elements set forth in <em>Honaker I </em>for determining statutory-employer status. As we discussed above, to meet the definition of a statutory employer under Section 9-508, WMATA must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">(1) a principal contractor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">(2) who has contracted to perform work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(3) which is part of his trade, business or occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">(4) who has contracted with any other party as a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-11\"><em>Honaker I, 278 </em>Md. at 459-60, 365 A.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">WMATA asserts that it is a statutory employer under the Act because all of the elements of Section 9-508 of the Act are met. WMATA argues that it is a principal contractor that entered into a contract, the ICCA 5, to perform the construction of the Branch Avenue Station. The ICCA 5, in WMA-TA\u2019s view, was more than a funding agreement because WMATA had obligations to perform construction that were contingent on payment by the political subdivisions. In addition, WMATA contends that construction of Metrorail facilities is part of its \u201ctrade, business or occupation.\u201d To support this claim, WMATA points to the WMATA Compact, which creat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ed WMATA \u201cto plan, develop, finance, and cause to be operated improved transit facilities.\u201d WMATA further argues that its contract with Recchi constitutes a \u201csubcontract\u201d in which Recchi would execute by itself or subcontract \u201cthe whole or part\u201d of the construction of the Branch Avenue Station. According to WMATA, Recchi then subcontracted with Pessoa, Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s employer, for work in executing parts of the Recchi contract for the Branch Avenue Station, including the work during which Rodrigues-Novo was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Rodrigues-Novo claims that WMATA was not his statutory employer because WMATA has not satisfied the elements of Section 9-508 of the Act. Rodrigues-Novo disputes that the ICCA 5 constitutes a principal contract under which WMATA was obligated to perform construction of the Branch Avenue Station. Rather, according to Rodrigues-Novo, the ICCA 5 merely provides funding to WMATA and does not require WMATA to perform actual construction work. Rodrigues-Novo also claims that WMATA is a public utility and that its responsibilities regarding Metro development arise by legislative mandate, not by contract as required by Section 9-508. Moreover, Rodrigues-Novo takes the position that WMATA\u2019s \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d is providing transportation services to the public, which does not entail constructing Metrorail facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">A. Principal Contractor Who Has Contracted to Perform Work</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We begin our analysis by examining whether WMATA entered into a \u201cprincipal contract\u201d as contemplated by the first two elements of the test set forth in <em>Honaker I. </em>To meet these elements, WMATA must be a \u201cprincipal contractor\u201d \u201cwho has contracted to perform work\u201d for a third party. <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 459-60, 365 A.2d at 291. This Court explained how the existence of the principal contract affects one\u2019s status as a statutory employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">Although acting independently of the other, the principal contractor and the subcontractor, with his workmen employed in the execution of the work, were each, in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>separate capacity, co-operating toward the execution of the whole of a particular work which the principal contractor had promised to perform; and the liability of the principal contractor to pay compensation to the employees of the subcontractor is confined to only these employees who were actually engaged in the execution of the whole or a portion of that one piece of work at the time of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">It is this necessary employment of the employee of the subcontractor upon the piece of work which the principal contractor has agreed to perform that forms the basis of the statutory relation between the workman and the principal contractor____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Hubert, </em>154 Md. at 166, 140 A. at 54-55. Again, in <em>M.A. Long Co. v. State Accident Fund, </em>156 Md. 689, 645, 144 A. 775, 778 (1929), we described what is meant by a \u201cprincipal contractor\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">The meaning of [the predecessor of Section 9-508] is that, in order to create a principal contractor the statutory employer of a workman of a subcontractor, the subcontractor must be engaged in the work or a portion of the work which the principal contractor agreed to perform. Or, in other words, to create the principal contractor a statutory employer he must have contracted in the first instance to do the work himself, and subsequently sublet the whole or a portion of it to someone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In a number of cases, we have examined whether a party seeking statutory-employer immunity has entered into the necessary \u201cprincipal contract.\u201d <em>Warren v. Dorsey Enterprises, Inc., </em>234 Md. 574, 579, 200 A.2d 76, 78 (1964) involved a worker who was injured while starting a stock car race at a raceway owned by Dorsey Enterprises. The worker\u2019s employer had contracted with Dorsey to conduct races at the track. <em>Id. </em>We held that Dorsey was not a principal contractor because \u201cDorsey did not contract to produce or stage stock car races.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, because Dorsey did not have a contractual obligation to conduct the races, there was no principal contract and Dorsey was not a statutory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>We held, in <em>Honaker I, </em>that a development company was not a statutory employer because the company had not provided evidence of a principal contract. 278 Md. at 463, 365 A.2d at 293. The A.N. Miller Development Company owned property on which it was erecting a house. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 365 A.2d at 289. Miller enlisted the services of Orndorff and Spaid, Inc. to complete various parts of the house construction, including roof installation. Honaker, one of Orndorffs employees, was injured while working to install the roof. <em>Id </em>at 456-57, 365 A.2d at 289. Honaker and his wife filed a tort action against Miller, but the trial court granted summary judgment to Miller, concluding that Miller was a statutory employer and immune from suits alleging negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 457, 365 A.2d at 289-90. We reversed, holding that, because Miller did not present evidence of a contract to build the house, he was not a statutory employer. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">What is missing in the case <em>sub judice </em>is a contract on the part of Miller to build the house. It is true that Miller contracted with Orndorff for Orndorff to install the roof, but that work was not part of any work which Miller had, in the words of the statute, \u201ccontracted to perform.\u201d Thus, the contract between Miller and Orndorff was not a subcontract. The contract did not assign to Orndorff some of the obligations of another contract; it was not an agreement to perform a specified part or provide specified materials required for the completion of another contract; it was not a contract under or subordinate to a previous or prime contract. As Miller did not owe labor or services under another contract for the work Orndorff agreed to execute, Miller was not \u201ca principal contractor\u201d and Orndorff was not \u201ca subcontractor\u201d with respect to the contract between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 463, 365 A.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Honaker\u2019s case reached this Court again after being remanded for further proceedings in the trial court. <em>See Honaker II, </em>285 Md. at 218, 401 A.2d at 1014. While on remand, Miller presented evidence that it had entered into a \u201ccustom building contract\u201d with the two individuals \u201cfor whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>house was being built.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 401 A.2d at 1018. In light of this evidence, we held that Miller, indeed, was a statutory employer under the Act and immune from Honaker\u2019s tort suit. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 401 A.2d at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In <em>Pam, </em>we concluded that a land owner and developer had formed the requisite antecedent contract under Section 9-508. 339 Md. 241, 661 A.2d 737 (1995). Para was injured while working for Razzano <em>&amp; </em>Fohner, a company that had contracted to perform excavation and trenching for a construction project of The Richards Group of Washington, Limited Partnership. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 661 A.2d at 739. The Richards Group was developing a subdivision of homes, and, before Para sustained his injury, had entered into a contract for the sale of one of the lots. Para\u2019s relatives sued The Richards Group for damages, claiming that the company was not a statutory employer because there was no antecedent contract. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 661 A.2d at 740. We held that the contract for the sale of the lot, even though it had been executed after the subcontract, constituted a principal contract under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 661 A.2d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In <em>Brady, </em>we decided that the Mass Transit Administration (hereinafter the \u201cMTA\u201d) was not entitled to statutory-employer tort immunity because it had not presented evidence of an antecedent contract. 308 Md. at 505-06, 520 A.2d at 727-28. The MTA, an instrumentality of the Maryland Department of Transportation, entered into a contract with Hensel-Phelps Construction Company, which agreed to provide services for the construction of a subway station. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 520 A.2d at 720. Hensel-Phelps subcontracted with a sheet-metal company, whose employee died while working on the project. The employee\u2019s family sued MTA, but the trial court found that MTA was a statutory employer and entered summary judgment in its favor. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 520 A.2d at 722. We disagreed that MTA was a statutory employer because \u201cit never entered into a principal or antecedent contract with a third party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 520 A.2d at 727. We concluded: \u201cBorrowing words of our predecessors, MTA never \u2018contracted in the first instance to do the work\u2019 itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In a footnote, we mentioned that MTA had attempted, at oral argument, to present evidence of an alleged antecedent contract. <em>Id. </em>at 505 n. 22, 520 A.2d at 727 n. 22. We rejected MTA\u2019s attempt to present the evidence because it was not contained in the \u201crecord transmitted from the court below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, having \u201cno knowledge of what the contract contained,\u201d we refused to consider whether the evidence, a capital grant contract between the Maryland Department of Transportation and the United States, fulfilled the requirement of an antecedent contract. <em>Id. </em>We noted \u201cparenthetically,\u201d however, that \u201ca mere financing agreement, which grants funds for a construction project, between an owner or contractor and a third party will not give rise to an antecedent contract unless the agreement also requires that the owner or contractor perform work or services for the third party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In <em>Lathroum, </em>we refused to extend the tort immunity provided by the Act to cover the Potomac Electric Power Company (hereinafter \u201cPEPCO\u201d), a regulated public utility and supplier of electricity that had contracted with the injured worker\u2019s employer \u201cto provide labor and miscellaneous services for several of PEPCO\u2019s power facilities.\u201d 309 Md. at 446, 524 A.2d at 1228. PEPCO argued that the required antecedent contract arose from its contractual relationship with the public to perform work or service. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 524 A.2d at 1230-31. We dismissed this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">[W]e have never remotely recognized the type of relationship PEPCO contends is sufficient to give rise to an \u201cantecedent undertaking\u201d or \u201cprincipal contract.\u201d In our view, the legislature never intended a \u201cprincipal contract\u201d to arise where there is a statutory duty on the part of a public utility to provide a regulated commodity to the public. Our cases make clear that the \u201cprincipal contract\u201d contemplated by the legislature is one in which a contractor agrees for stated consideration to perform some work or service according to plans, specifications or directions of a third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 450-51, 524 A.2d at 1230. Explaining why PEPCO\u2019s obligation to serve the public did not give rise to an antecedent contract, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Clearly, PEPCO\u2019s alleged contractual relationship with the public fails to meet this definition. PEPCO is not performing any work or service according to customer specifications or direction; it is merely providing a regulated commodity pursuant to statutorily mandated requirements. If indeed there is a contract in this case, it is more akin to a contract for the sale of a product, which this Court has concluded is not within he contemplation of the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 524 A.2d at 1231 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In the instant case, WMATA submits the ICCA 5 as evidence of an antecedent contract for the construction of the Branch Avenue Station. Rodrigues-Novo argues that both <em>Brady </em>and <em>Lathroum </em>support his position that no antecedent contract existed. Seizing on the footnoted language in <em>Brady, </em>Rodrigues-Novo contends that the ICCA 5 is a mere funding agreement and not a principal contract under which WMATA is obligated to perform work. Additionally, Rodrigues-Novo emphasizes our opinion in <em>Lathroum </em>to argue that there was no antecedent contract because, like PEPCO in <em>Lathroum, </em>WMATA is a regulated utility, providing services to the public under a statutory mandate. We disagree with Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s reliance on the footnoted discussion in <em>Brady </em>misses the mark because the ICCA 5 is more than a funding agreement. WMATA concedes that one of the purposes of the ICCA 5 is to arrange for funding the continued development of the Metrorail system. The ICCA 5, however, also makes clear that WMATA has an obligation to perform actual work and services and that one of its obligations included the construction of the Branch Avenue station. The parties incorporated into the ICCA 5 an exhibit entitled \u201cWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Rail Construction Program,\u201d which sets forth a schedule for the extension of the \u201cF Route (Branch Avenue).\u201d The ICCA 5 requires WMATA to \u201cproceed with all practical dispatch to accomplish the construction program and related activities in the sequence identified\u201d in that exhibit. The ICCA 5, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>provides for more than just the funds for the extension of the \u201cF Route,\u201d which includes the Branch Avenue Station. It also obligates WMATA to perform the necessary work or services to construct the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We also reject Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s other argument that our opinion in <em>Lathroum </em>compels a result in his favor because WMATA, like PEPCO, is a public utility. Although WMATA is a quasi-governmental entity, its quasi-govemmental character, alone, does not render Section 9-508 inapplicable. Rather, the specific terms of a contract and the rights and responsibilities of the parties to the contract determine whether it should be deemed a \u201cprincipal contract\u201d under the Act. When a contractor and a third party enter into a contract in which the contractor \u201cagrees for stated consideration to perform some work or service according to plans, specifications or directions of a third party,\u201d that contract constitutes an antecedent contract, regardless of whether the contractor is a government instrumentality. Similarly, the fact that the third party is also a governmental entity does not, itself, deny the contractor the immunity available under Section 9-508.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Furthermore, contrary to Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s suggestion, the ICCA 5 is not a legislative mandate. We held that PEPCO\u2019s obligation to provide electricity was \u201cstatutorily mandated\u201d because PEPCO was not \u201cperforming any work or service according to customer specifications or direction.\u201d <em>Lathroum, </em>309 Md. at 451, 524 A.2d at 1231. This is not the situation in the present case. The ICCA 5, which governs the funding and construction of Metro facilities, unlike the statutory mandate to provide electricity, reflects a \u201cgive and take\u201d that distinguishes a contractual agreement. The parties to the ICCA 5 have independent rights and responsibilities to ensure the completion of the construction program according to the balance of interests contemplated by the agreement. On one hand, the political subdivisions have some control over the construction outlined in the ICCA 5; WMATA must submit a budget annually to the political subdivisions and the WMATA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Board of Directors, which consists of six directors, two of whom have been appointed by Maryland\u2019s Washington Suburban Transit Commission. In addition, the political subdivisions may recommend changes to the station facilities as long as those changes comply with the overall regional plan, and, if a project is significantly delayed for reasons beyond the control of the political subdivision, funds for that project \u201cmay be reassigned to any other project.\u201d Balancing the rights of the political subdivisions, on the other hand, is WMATA\u2019s power under the ICCA 5 to suspend or terminate a particular project if a political subdivision has not submitted the required funding. WMATA\u2019s obligations to perform construction of Metrorail facilities, therefore, are different from PEPCO\u2019s statutorily mandated obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We conclude that the first two elements of the <em>Honaker I </em>test have been satisfied in the present case because WMATA had entered into a principal contract to perform work or services needed for the construction of the Metrorail extension, the project on which Rodrigues-Novo was working at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">B. WMATA\u2019s Trade, Business, or Occupation</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Under Section 9-508, not only must a contractor show that it entered into a principal contract to perform work or service, but the work or service called for also must be part of the contractor\u2019s \u201ctrade, business or occupation.\u201d <em>See Honaker II, </em>285 Md. at 225, 401 A.2d at 1017-18. Rodrigues-Novo maintains that WMATA does not meet this criterion because, in Rodrigues-Novo\u2019s view, WMATA is in the business of operating mass transit, not constructing facilities. Rodrigues-Novo views the construction of Metrorail facilities as an \u201cancillary precursor\u201d to carrying out the business of providing public transportation. The WMATA Compact, when considered in light of our cases addressing this subject, leads us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Our first discussion of a principal contractor\u2019s \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d came in <em>Hubert, </em>154 Md. at 159, 140 A. at 52. We held that the placement of tile performed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>subcontractor was part of the trade, business, or occupation of a principal contractor that had entered into a contract for the construction of an office building. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 140 A. 52, 54-55. The tiling, we held, was part of a cooperative effort to execute \u201cthe whole of a particular work which the principal contractor had promised to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166,140 A. at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In <em>State, Use of Reynolds v. Baltimore, </em>199 Md. 289, 86 A.2d 618 (1952), we determined that work that is essential or integral to fulfilling the principal contractor\u2019s obligation is part of the principal contractor\u2019s business, trade, or occupation. In <em>Reynolds, </em>Rosoff was obligated under a contract with the City to excavate and line a water tunnel. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 86 A.2d at 619. Under that contract, Rosoff was required to use a type of \u201ccage\u201d \u201cfor hoisting men and materials during construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These cages operated in what are known as \u201chead-frames,\u201d which Archer Iron Works, Inc. agreed by subcontract to erect and install. <em>Id. </em>Archer entered into a contract with Arthur Phillips <em>&amp; </em>Co., which promised \u201cto supply ironworkers and equipment for the assembly and erection of the hoists and lifts under Archer\u2019s supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of Arthur\u2019s employees sustained a fatal injury while attempting to install a headframe. The employees\u2019 dependents brought suit against Rosoff, but Rosoff claimed immunity from the suit under the statutory-employer provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The crux of the question before us was whether providing headframes was part of Rosoffs business, trade, or occupation. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 86 A.2d at 620. In answering this question, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">The whole work of constructing the tunnel was let to Rosoff. The fact that the work of erecting the hoists was necessarily preliminary and appurtenant to the actual excavation does not make it any less an integral \u2018part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor\u2019. It was within the contemplation of the parties that Rosoff should provide headframes to support the hoists and cages; in no other way could the excavated material be removed. Removal of spoil is an essential part of a tunnel-digger\u2019s \u2018trade, business or occupation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 86 A.2d at 620. We concluded that the \u201cinstallation of the headframes was an integral part of Rosoff's undertaking and in subletting that portion of the work we think he was a statutory employer within the meaning of [the Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 86 A.2d at 621. Our reasoning here makes clear that a subcontractor\u2019s work is part of the contractor\u2019s business, trade, or occupation when that work is essential or integral to the completion of the principal contractor\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Relying on all of these cases, we have held that the installation of roofing was part of a home builder\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, even though the principal contractor, itself, was not equipped with the employees or materials to build a roof. <em>Honaker II, </em>285 Md. at 229, 401 A.2d at 1019-20. We explained how roofing is an essential and integral part of \u201cbuilding and selling homes\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">There is no question but that Miller is in the business of building and selling homes. From time immemorial shelter from the elements has been regarded as one of the necessities of life. Any structure with four walls must have a roof on it before it may be considered a house. Thus, a contention that the installation of a roof is not part of the \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d of building homes is without merit. Equally without merit is the claim that because Miller owns the land upon which it is erecting the houses which it sells, its \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d does not include the construction of homes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">As evidenced by the WMATA Compact, construction of Metrorail facilities is part of WMATA\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. The Compact indicates that WMATA was created for a number of purposes, including \u201cto plan, develop, finance and cause to be operated improved transit facilities.\u201d Thus, WMATA is in the business of developing the mass transit system in and around the District of Columbia. The development of this system cannot occur without the extension, improvement, and creation of Metrorail facilities. Indeed, to effectuate the development of Washington\u2019s mass transit, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Compact empowers WMATA to \u201c[c]onstruct, acquire, own, operate, maintain, control, sell, and convey real and personal property.\u201d Like tiling is essential to the construction of an office building and roofing is an integral part of home building, so is construction of Metrorail facilities essential for developing \u201cimproved transit facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>WMATA v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. at 940, 104 S.Ct. at 2835-36, 81 L.Ed.2d at 781 supports this conclusion. There, the Court held that, under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which formerly governed workers\u2019 compensation claims in the District of Columbia, \u201cWMATA was entitled to immunity from tort actions\u201d brought by the injured employee of a subcontractor. Although the Supreme Court was interpreting statutory language different from the Act in Maryland, its observations bolster our view that part of WMATA\u2019s trade, business, or occupation was the construction of mass transit facilities. The Court discussed WMATA\u2019s purpose, finding that WMATA \u201cis charged with the construction and operation of a rapid transit system (Metro) for the District of Columbia and the surrounding metropolitan region.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927, 104 S.Ct. at 2829, 81 L.Ed.2d at 773. The Court added that, according to the Compact, \u201cWMATA is authorized to hire subcontractors to work on various aspects of the Metro construction project\u201d and that, \u201c[sjince 1966 WMATA has engaged several hundred subcontractors, who in turn have employed more than a thousand sub-subcontractors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Disagreeing that WMATA is in the business, trade, or occupation of constructing Metro facilities, Rodrigues-Novo likens WMATA to a supermarket chain that builds its own supermarkets. He claims that the construction of a Metro station, like the grocery chain\u2019s construction of a supermarket, is an \u201cancillary precursor\u201d to doing business, not an essential or integral part of its undertaking. In support of this view, Rodrigues-Novo points to <em>Reynolds, </em>where we cited the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Wallace, </em>172 F.2d 802 (4th Cir.1949). The worker in <em>Wallace </em>was employed by a subcontractor that agreed to perform altera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tions to a storage warehouse owned by Sears. 172 F.2d at 803. The court in <em>Wallace </em>denied Sears statutory-employer immunity under Virginia\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, determining instead that Sears \u201cwas in the business of selling merchandise,\u201d but it \u201cwas not in the construction business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We distinguished the <em>Wallace </em>facts in <em>Reynolds, </em>199 Md. at 295, 86 A.2d at 620. As we discussed in greater detail above, we concluded in <em>Reynolds </em>that the \u201cinstallation of the head-frames was an integral part\u201d of the principal contractor\u2019s excavation project and that the principal contractor was a statutory employer. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 86 A.2d at 621. Distinguishing the facts in <em>Reynolds </em>from those in the <em>Wallace </em>case, we stated that, in contrast to the excavator, \u201cSears was not in the building trade at all\u201d and \u201c[t]he fact that the construction of a store was necessary or convenient to the conduct of its retail business did not convert it from a merchant to a builder by trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 86 A.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\"><em>Wallace </em>is readily distinguishable from the case before us for the same reason we distinguished it in <em>Reynolds. </em>Unlike Sears, which only builds stores as a means to carry out its principal function of selling merchandise, WMATA does not build Metro facilities merely out of \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cconvenience.\u201d The development of the Metro system, which includes constructing Metro facilities, is not just a means to accomplish another goal. Developing the system is, itself, one of WMA-TA\u2019s principal purposes. It is a fundamental reason for its creation. Just because WMATA also engages in the operation of the Metro system does not mean that its business, trade, or occupation is limited to such operation. Rather, we believe that the construction of Metrorail facilities is part of WMA-TA\u2019s business, trade, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">C. Subcontract for the Whole or Part of Principal\u2019s Work</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Having concluded that WMATA is a principal contractor which contracted to perform work or services for a third party that is part of its trade, business, or occupation, we turn now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>to the final element of the <em>Honaker I </em>test: whether WMATA subcontracted for the whole or part of the work or services required under the principal contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Whether there was a qualifying \u201csubcontract\u201d can be determined only by considering the scope of the principal\u2019s obligation. <em>See M.A. Long Co., </em>156 Md. at 645-46, 144 A. at 778. We have defined a subcontract as \u201ca contract with a person who owes labor or services under another contract, to perform some or all of the services or labor due.\u201d <em>Para, </em>339 Md. at 249, 661 A.2d at 742. If all or part of the principal\u2019s obligation is sublet to another, and the injury occurs in the course of fulfilling that obligation, a subcontract has been created under the Act. <em>M.A. Long Co., </em>156 Md. at 645-46, 144 A. at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>346 Md. at 599, 697 A.2d at 898, we held that the defendant in a negligence case, Super Fresh, was not a statutory employer because it had not established as a matter of law that the necessary principal/subcontractor relationship existed. The plaintiffs husband was fatally injured while working for Supermarket Distribution Services, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cSDS\u201d) at an A &amp; P warehouse, which was managed by Super Fresh, a wholly owned subsidiary of A &amp; P. <em>Id. </em>at 579, 697 A.2d at 888. SDS had a contractual obligation to provide \u201cwarehousing and distribution services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we recognized the presence of a contractual relationship between A &amp; P, Super Fresh, and SDS, we stated that the \u201crecord lacks conclusive evidence concerning the substance of the contractual obligations, if any, between SDS and Super Fresh, and any concomitant obligations to A &amp; P.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 697 A.2d at 898. We held, therefore, that the record did not support the existence of a principal/subcontractor relationship between Super Fresh and SDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In this case, we have no trouble identifying the relevant contractual obligations. WMATA was obligated under the ICCA 5 to extend \u201cF Route (Branch Avenue).\u201d WMATA\u2019s contract with Recchi called for Recchi to complete \u201c[c]onstruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tion of the Branch Avenue Station ... and at-grade parking for 3,370 vehicles.\u201d The contract also provides that the concrete pavement done by Recchi must be \u201cprepared subgrade or base for vehicular traffic and parking\u201d according to detailed specifications. Recchi is also obligated under the contract to provide curbs, gutters, and walks, which must be removed or replaced if placed unsatisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">To complete the concrete paving at the Branch Avenue Station, Recchi engaged Pessoa to furnish the necessary labor, equipment, supplies, and material. The agreement between Recchi and Pessoa requires Pessoa to \u201cproceed promptly to take down all portions of work and remove from the Project all materials, whether worked or unworked, which [the] Engineer condemns or fails to approve.\u201d Rodrigues-Novo sustained his injury while working for Pessoa and while using a machine loader to break a driveway that had been built incorrectly. The work he was performing at the time of the injury was exactly that which Pessoa was obligated to complete according to its contract with Recchi and in furtherance of Recchi\u2019s commitment to WMATA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that the WMATA contract with Recchi constitutes a subcontract for the whole or part of the work or services required under the ICCA 5. Because each element of the <em>Honaker I </em>test has been satisfied, we further hold that WMATA was the statutory employer of Rodrigues-Novo at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

Rodrigues-Novo asserts that certain statements in the Certifying Order reflect the Certifying Court\u2019s \u2018\u2018findings\u2019\u2019 as to WMATA's status as a statutory employer. The Certifying Court's <em>uncertainty </em>about WMATA\u2019s status as a statutory employer, however, is the reason it decided to certify the question in this case. It should be obvious that any statements made in the Certifying Order should not be construed to suggest a particular answer to the very question being asked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">. WMATA has not always had insurance coverage for the workers\u2019 compensation claims of its subcontractors\u2019 employees. Prior to 1971, during the first phase of construction of Washington\u2019s rapid transit system (Metro), WMATA \u201crelied upon its subcontractors to purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance for subcontractor employees.\u201d <em>WMATA v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 925, 928, 104 S.Ct. 2827, 2830, 81 L.Ed.2d 768, 774 (1984). When the second phase of construction commenced, WMATA decided to centralize its workers' compensation insurance in order to save money and ensure the coverage of all employees on its projects. <em>Id. </em>To do this, WMATA purchased \"a comprehensive 'wrap-up' policy from the Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ty Co./' which required a single premium from WMATA in return for \"compensation payments for any injuries suffered by workers employed at Metro construction sites and compensable under the relevant workers\u2019 compensation regimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 929, 104 S.Ct. at 2830, 81 L.Ed.2d at 774.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">. According to his deposition testimony, Rodrigues-Novo received from workers\u2019 compensation insurance $2800 to convert the transmission in his truck from manual to automatic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">. The parties to the ICCA 5 included WMATA, Maryland's Washington Suburban Transit District, the District of Columbia, Arlington County (Virginia), Fairfax County (Virginia), the City of Alexandria, the City of Falls Church, the City of Fairfax, Montgomery County (Maryland), and Prince George's County (Maryland).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">.

Rodrigues-Novo claims that the breaking of the concrete was \u201cdemolition\u201d work that was not covered by the Pessoa contract. Rodrigues-Novo,. however, was not performing any \u201cdemolition\" at the time of his injury. To the contrary, his efforts to break the incorrectly built driveway were carried out to effectuate the eventual proper construction of the driveway at the Branch Avenue Station. The Pessoa Contract required Pessoa to perform this exact type of work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
