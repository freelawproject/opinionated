State, </em>No. 94, September Term 2003, and <em>Knight v. State, </em>No. 93, September Term 2003, each present the question of whether an interrogating officer\u2019s assumedly truthful promise to a criminal suspect to report to the prosecuting authority that the suspect cooperated with an investigation is an improper inducement that renders a subsequent statement by that suspect involuntary under Maryland non-constitutional law and, therefore, inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Petitioner Steven Daniel Sirbaugh was told by police officers that if he cooperated during a custodial interrogation, the interrogating officers would inform the State\u2019s Attorney \u201cthat when we asked a question he answered it.\u201d Sirbaugh then confessed to driving the getaway car in a 29 October 2000 robbery of a convenience store in Owings Mills, Maryland. Although he sought to exclude this confession from coming into evidence at his trial, he failed. Based in large measure on his confession, Sirbaugh was convicted of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Petitioner Ricky Lee Knight, after being arrested in an unrelated robbery case, provided police with information regarding an unresolved murder in Baltimore City. He was brought to the Homicide Division, where he was asked to repeat his statement regarding the murder so that it could be recorded. During the course of the custodial interrogation leading up to the second statement, he was told that his cooperation \u201cwould be helpful\u201d and that the State\u2019s Attorney would be informed of his cooperation. Knight was also told \u201cdown the line, after this case comes to an end, we\u2019ll see what the State\u2019s Attorney can do for you, with your case, with your charges.\u201d Knight\u2019s second statement, which, unlike his first statement, was recorded, was essentially identical in content to the first. Knight, like Sirbaugh, also sought unsuccessfully to suppress these inculpatory statements. Those statements led eventually to his conviction for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Sirbaugh and Knight each argue that their statements were given in reliance on improper inducements, and were therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>involuntary. Because an interrogating officer\u2019s truthful promise to inform a prosecutor of a suspect\u2019s cooperation during a custodial interrogation is not an improper inducement, we affirm Sirbaugh\u2019s conviction. While the same holds for the similar statements interrogating officers made to Knight, the interrogating officers\u2019 further promise to \u201csee what the State\u2019s Attorney can do for you\u201d was an improper inducement. That promise, however, could not have caused Knight to make his statement because it was made after Knight\u2019s initial statement to the police. The content of the two statements was identical. We affirm Knight\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">A. <em>Sirbaugh</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">While sitting in a pickup truck parked in a convenience store parking lot in Owings Mills waiting for her husband to make purchases, Patricia Ann McConville saw a red car drive up Tollgate Road, the street next to the store. The time was approximately 4:00 p.m on 29 October 2000. The red car proceeded past the entrance to the store\u2019s parking lot and then backed down the street, where it pulled over to the shoulder across the street from the store. Its driver kept the engine running. A passenger got out of the red car and walked to the store. The passenger stood in front of the convenience store without entering for \u201cquite a while.\u201d Only when McConville\u2019s husband left the store and returned to his truck did the man enter the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Once inside, the man asked Brooke Presser, the sole employee in the store, for change for a dollar. When Presser opened the drawer of the cash register, the man reached over and grabbed all of the money out of the register. He did not display a weapon, but told Presser to get down on the ground or he was going to kill her. Shaking and crying, Presser complied. According to Presser, the man left -with between $130 and $150 from the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">As McConville and her husband drove away, they saw the man sprint out of the store toward the red car. When he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>reached the red car, it began to move and continued to roll slowly as he entered it. The car sped away, running a stop sign in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On 7 November 2000, Baltimore County Police officers arrested Erland Edward Roessler, III. Roessler confessed to committing a series of robberies, including the 29 October 2000 robbery of the convenience store in Owings Mills. Roessler told police that he had usually been the \u201cinside man,\u201d and that a man named \u201cSteve\u201d usually drove the automobile they used in the robberies. When shown a photograph of Sirbaugh, Roessler confirmed that Sirbaugh was the accomplice named \u201cSteve\u201d with whom he committed the robberies. He gave police officers sufficient information with which to locate Sirbaugh\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Sirbaugh was located by police in Carroll County on 11 November 2000. He was arrested and brought to the Maryland State Police barracks in Westminster. There he was interrogated by Maryland State Police Corporal Christina Becker and Hampstead Police Officer Clint Thom. According to the unreported Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in Sirbaugh\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cBecker advised Sirbaugh of his rights, and Sirbaugh said that he understood them. He initialed and signed a waiver of rights form. Sirbaugh did not make a written statement, but agreed to sign the notes that Becker had taken during the hour-long interview, which occurred between 1:35 and 2:35 a.m. Becker did not know when Sirbaugh last had eaten or slept, but said that the police normally offer a person being interviewed a soda. Becker testified that she did not threaten Sirbaugh or make any promises to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cThorn testified that he was present for the entire interview with Sirbaugh, and that neither he nor anyone in his presence promised Sirbaugh anything or threatened him to get him to make a statement. Sirbaugh appeared to understand his rights and did not ask for an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The following exchange concerning Sirbaugh\u2019s post-arrest interrogation took place during cross-examination of Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Thorn at the motion to suppress hearing that preceded Sirbaugh\u2019s trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3q\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Now, during the process, particularly during the <em>Miranda,</em><footnotemark><em>[1]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>you told him that if he cooperated you would let the State\u2019s Attorney know that he was cooperating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c[Officer Thorn]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did he understand that, that you would let the State\u2019s Attorney know he was cooperating if, in fact, he did cooperate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201c[Officer Thorn]: I believe he was under the impression that if he cooperated with us in answering questions that we asked, that we would relay that information to the State\u2019s Attorney that when we asked a question he answered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6q\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did you tell him that it might go easier on him, that it could affect his sentencing if he cooperated with you as opposed to not cooperating with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201c[Officer Thorn]: No, I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Sirbaugh confessed to Corporal Becker and Officer Thorn that he drove the getaway car in the 29 October 2000 convenience store robbery. According to Corporal Becker\u2019s trial testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">\u201cMr. Sirbaugh stated his participation in the robbery of the High\u2019s Store, that he had driven to the High\u2019s, which is located on Reisterstown Road near the area of Tollgate Road. He said that he had driven his ex-boss\u2019s car, which is a red Dodge Neon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\u201cHe had parked approximately a half a mile away from the store where he remained in his vehicle. He said after the robbery that he had gone to the Baltimore City area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMG\">Sirbaugh was charged with robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to the trial and as previously alluded to, the trial court held a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Sirbaugh\u2019s motion to suppress the confession. At the conclusion of that hearing, the trial judge ruled in favor of the State and ultimately allowed the confession to be admitted as evidence at the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The primary evidence used by the State at the 24 January 2002 jury trial to connect Sirbaugh to the robbery was Sirbaugh\u2019s confession. Sirbaugh was convicted of robbery. Because it was his third conviction for a crime of violence, he was sentenced to the mandatory term of twenty-five years in prison.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">B. <em>Knight</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">According to the unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in Knight\u2019s case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cOn the evening of January 25, 2000, Wiley \u2018Iceberg\u2019 McCroery, a drug dealer, was shot and killed at the comer of North Carey Street and Harlem Avenue in Baltimore. Police investigators learned that the victim was shot by someone known as \u2018Little Ralph,\u2019 who was later identified as Ralph Williams. The police also learned that someone named \u2018Ricky,\u2019 later identified as appellant, often hung out with Williams and that \u2018Ralph and Ricky\u2019 were known to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u2018stickup boys\u2019 in the Western District, where the killing occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cOn June 8, 2000, Williams and appellant were arrested on an unrelated robbery charge. Shortly after their arrest, appellant was interviewed by Detective Sergeant Darryl Massey, who was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division in the Western District. During the interview, [which was held in the Criminal Investigations Division Office,] appellant revealed information about the murder, so he was taken to the Homicide Office to meet with Detective Kevin Buie, who was in charge of the murder investigation. There, the detectives conducted a tape-recorded interview of appellant concerning the murder. The tape recording and a transcript made from it were later admitted into evidence at appellant\u2019s trial. In that interview, appellant told the following story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cOn the day of the murder, Williams and appellant caught a \u2018hack\u2019<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> and went to McCulloh Street to pick up a third man, [Antonio Jones,] who had a gun, and then proceeded to drive elsewhere to commit robberies. Appellant rode along \u2018to make sure that the hack wouldn\u2019t leave.\u2019 When they saw the victim, they drove down the street about three or four houses from the corner. Williams and [Jones] jumped out of the car and walked up the street to where the victim was, to rob him. Some time later, [Jones] returned to the car, and appellant \u2018heard some shooting.\u2019 Then Williams arrived and announced that he \u2018had to kill\u2019 the victim. Williams pulled out $100 in cash, and [Jones] pulled out $150 worth of heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Police officers, seeking to corroborate Knight\u2019s story, attempted to track down the alleged third member of the scheme, Antonio Jones. They discovered that Jones had been in jail at the time of the murder and could not have been involved in the crime. Despite this apparent untruth, certain details of Knight\u2019s version of events matched particular facts of the murder case not made public. Knight ultimately was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>indicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Knight filed a motion to suppress his statement to the police. During the hearing on the motion, Detective Sergeant Massey, who conducted the initial interview in the Criminal Investigations Division Office, testified that he made no promises to Knight before Knight made his initial statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Detective Buie, who led the second interview recorded at the Homicide Division, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Now, did you indicate to him on that first night, on June 8th, when you were at the Homicide Unit, that you could take care of some of these robberies, the robbery charge if he helped you out with Ralph Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201c[Detective Buie]: No, it\u2019s not my position to make any deals if that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. He was advised of his rights, and a statement was taken. Anything that would be done for Mr. Knight \u2014 I didn\u2019t communicate any offers to him. I\u2019m sure that he knew with his cooperation in the trial that maybe down the line something could be done for him. But it\u2019s not my purpose or point to make a deal that I can\u2019t see through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, by the time he was meeting with Mr. Urick, he would have had the opportunity to speak to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney about whether or not you could help him out. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201c[Detective Buie]: Sure. I had communications with Mr. Urick throughout the whole case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And did you have communications with Mr. Knight about what his cooperation could do for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201c[Detective Buie]: No. Other than the initial time that I met him, we writted him out and brought him over to Mr. Urick\u2019s office to get some more information, that would probably be that last time that I actually saw him or spoke with him. I didn\u2019t have any communication with him while he was in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: But on the night that he gave this [the recorded] statement, there was some, it was somehow translated to him that his cooperation would be helpful. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201c[Detective Buie]: It\u2019s always helpful. I think what we said to him, myself and Detective Sergeant Massey was, you have information in this case. We want the information in this case. We can\u2019t promise you anything, and on tape we said that to him several times. If down the line, after this case comes to an end, we\u2019ll see what the State\u2019s Attorney can do for you, with your case, with your charges, but no deal if you say this, we\u2019ll do that. We can\u2019t do that. And that\u2019s the problem that we run into.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">According to Detective Sergeant Massey, the content of the statement he and Detective Buie recorded at the Homicide Division office was identical to the statement Knight previously gave in the Western District Criminal Investigations Division Office.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The suppression hearing judge determined that Knight\u2019s statement was admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cI do not find the fact that the defendant was told that his cooperation would be brought to the attention of the State\u2019s Attorney to be an inducement for his testimony, and as indicated, the defendant was properly Mirandized. That he may have testified in the hopes of getting a reward down the line is not a sufficient basis for suppressing a voluntary statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cAccordingly, the motion to suppress is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The recorded statement was presented as evidence before the jury at Knight\u2019s trial. Knight was convicted of second degree murder, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery, conspiracy to rob with a deadly weapon, and conspiracy to rob. He was sentenced to thirty years in prison for second degree murder, twenty years for use of a handgun in a crime of violence, twenty years for robbery with a deadly weapon, and twenty years for conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon. Each of these sentences were to be served consecutively. The remaining counts \u2014 robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery \u2014 were merged with robbery with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In their direct appeals, Sirbaugh and Knight challenged the denials of their suppression motions. The Court of Special Appeals, rejecting their arguments, separately affirmed in unreported opinions. In affirming each judgment, the intermediate appellate court relied on <em>Boyer v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 648, 651 A.2d 403 (1995). In <em>Boyer, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that a truthful promise by police to inform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>State\u2019s Attorney that the defendant cooperated is not an improper inducement even though it could give rise to the \u201cperfectly reasonable assumption\u201d that the defendant might gain some advantage from the prosecutor\u2019s knowledge of his cooperation. 102 Md.App. at 654, 651 A.2d at 406.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We granted a petition for certiorari filed by Sirbaugh\u2019s attorney, 878 Md. 613, 837 A.2d 925 (2003),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cIs an interrogating officer\u2019s promise to inform the State\u2019s Attorney of a suspect\u2019s cooperation an improper inducement under Maryland common law, thereby rendering statements made by the suspect in reliance on that inducement involuntary?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Knight presented the same question in a petition for certiorari, which was granted by the Court. 378 Md. 613, 837 A.2d 925 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Only voluntary confessions are admissible as evidence under Maryland law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A confession is voluntary if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201cfreely and voluntarily made\u201d and the defendant making the confession \u201cknew and understood what he [or she] was saying\u201d at the time he or she said it. <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 480-81, 536 A.2d 622, 625-26 (1988). In order to be deemed voluntary, a confession must satisfy the mandates of the U.S. Constitution, the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda, </em>and Maryland non-constitutional law. <em>See Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 173-74, 699 A.2d 1170, 1178 (1997). Sirbaugh and Knight specifically argue that the promises made to them by the interrogating officers were improper inducements that rendered their confessions involuntary under Maryland non-constitutional common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">When a criminal defendant claims that his or her confession was involuntary because of a promise made to him or her by interrogating officers, the State must present evidence in order to refute the claim. <em>See Streams v. State, </em>238 Md. 278, 283, 208 A.2d 614, 616 (1965).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the defense files a proper pre-trial suppression motion, the State bears the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cthe inculpatory statement was freely and voluntarily made and thus was the product of neither a promise nor a threat.\u201d <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 306, 765 A.2d 97, 113-14 (2001). When lack of voluntariness is generated as an issue at trial, the State must prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>Upon proper objection, the State must prove at trial that the statement was made voluntarily even if it already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>prevailed on a pre-trial motion to suppress. <em>Baynor v. State, </em>355 Md. 726, 729 n. 1, 736 A.2d 325, 326 n. 1 (1999).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Maryland courts, in order to resolve a suppression challenge, look to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d in determining whether a confession is voluntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">[W]e look to all elements of the interrogation, including the manner in which it was conducted, the number of officers present, and the age, education, and experience of the defendant. Not all of the multitude of factors that may bear on voluntariness are necessarily of equal weight, however. Some are transcendent and decisive. We have made clear, for example, that a confession that is preceded or accompanied by threats or a promise of advantage will be held involuntary, notwithstanding any other factors that may suggest voluntariness, unless the State can establish that such threats or promises in no way induced the confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>375 Md. 404, 429, 825 A.2d 1078, 1092-93 (2003). <em>See also Winder, </em>362 Md. at 309, 765 A.2d at 115 (A confession made in reliance on an improper promise of assistance by an interrogating officer or an agent of the police always will be deemed involuntary under Maryland non-constitutional common law.).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), the Court established a two-step analysis that a trial court should apply to the evidence regarding an alleged promise. First, the trial court determines whether any officer or agent of the police force promised or implied to the suspect that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>would be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the confession. Second, if the court determines that such a promise was explicitly or implicitly made, it decides whether the suspect\u2019s confession was made in apparent reliance on the promise. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 309, 765 A.2d at 115 (summarizing the <em>Hillard </em>test). If the court concludes that the confession was made in reliance on an improper inducement, the confession may not be admitted as evidence at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test is an objective one. The suspect\u2019s subjective belief that he or she will be advantaged in some way by confessing is irrelevant. The trial court instead determines whether the interrogating officers or an agent of the police made a threat, promise, or inducement. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 311, 765 A.2d at 116. An improper promise or inducement occurs when \u201can accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration.\u201d 362 Md. at 308, 765 A.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The second prong inquires as to the defendant\u2019s reliance on the inducement in making the statement. In other words, whether there exists a causal nexus between the inducement and the statement is examined. Several factors may inform this analysis. For example, the temporal relationship between the improper threat, promise, or inducement and the confession may convince the trial court to draw an inference as to whether the confession came as a result of improper statements by interrogating authorities. 362 Md. at 312-13, 765 A.2d at 117.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cThe trial court\u2019s determination regarding whether a confession was made voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310-11, 765 A.2d at 116. An appellate court undertakes a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial judge\u2019s ultimate determination on the issue of voluntariness. <em>Id. </em>We do not look, however, at the trial record for additional information, nor do we engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding. <em>Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519, 525 (2000). Appellate review of a Circuit Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is limited to the record of the suppression hearing. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310-11, 765 A.2d at 116. \u201cAs the State was the prevailing party on the motion, we consider the facts as found by the trial court, and the reasonable inferences from those facts, in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d <em>Cartnail, </em>359 Md. at 282, 753 A.2d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">A. Sirbaugh</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The trial judge concluded that Sirbaugh\u2019s testimony at the motion to suppress hearing was inconsistent and discounted it. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, with due regard for the trial judge\u2019s determination regarding the credibility of the witnesses before him, we shall focus on the testimony of the police officers, who the trial judge apparently found credible. Officer Thorn testified that he informed Sirbaugh that the prosecutor would be made aware of his cooperation. The question before us is whether this was an improper inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Officer Thorn\u2019s statement was not a promise of help or special consideration because he had no discretion regarding such matters. Police officers, however, bear a professional duty to inform the prosecutor truthfully of the circumstances surrounding the investigation of a case so that the prosecutor is not surprised at trial. One of the relevant issues at trial, and therefore of interest to the prosecutor in preparation for trial, is the conduct of the defendant during any custodial interrogation. Because police officers always have a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>relate truthfully to the prosecutor the events that occur during custodial interrogation, a promise to a suspect that the interrogator truthfully would inform the prosecutor that the suspect either did or did not cooperate is not a promise of special advantage, in our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Officer Thorn\u2019s alleged \u201cpromise\u201d was not contingent on whether Sirbaugh confessed. Officer Thorn told Sirbaugh that he would inform the prosecutor of how the interrogation went, including whether Sirbaugh cooperated. This communication would occur regardless of Sirbaugh\u2019s conduct \u2014 the only difference being the content of Officer Thorn\u2019s report to the prosecutor. This is nothing more than the routine report that officers generally give to prosecutors. There was no special consideration because Sirbaugh was to be treated exactly as any other suspect would be treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Those statements that have been held to be improper inducements have involved promises by the interrogating officers either to exercise their discretion or to convince the prosecutor to exercise discretion to provide some special advantage to the suspect.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Officer Thorn offered no special advantage, did not promise to exercise any discretion, nor did he promise that the prosecutor would exercise any discretion in favor of Sirbaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Because there was no improper inducement in this case, there is no need to engage in step two of the <em>Hillard </em>test. The trial court did not err in denying the suppression motion or admitting Sirbaugh\u2019s confession as evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">B. Knight</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The preceding analysis applies to Detective Buie\u2019s statement to Knight that Knight\u2019s cooperation would be \u201chelp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ful.\u201d That statement was not an improper inducement. Detective Buie\u2019s statement to Knight, \u201cif down the line, after this case comes to an end, we\u2019ll see what the State\u2019s Attorney can do for you, with your case, with your charges,\u201d however, was clearly a promise to exercise advocacy on Knight\u2019s behalf to convince the prosecutor to exercise discretion in Knight\u2019s favor. This statement is very similar to the statements that have been held to be improper inducements. <em>See </em>note 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Having found that the promise to aid Knight \u201cdown the line\u201d was an improper inducement, we move to step two of the <em>Hillard </em>test, the reliance or nexus analysis. Knight made two statements to police officers on 8 June 2000. The statement presented to the jury at trial<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was the second of the two. That statement was recorded in the Homicide Division after the improper inducement was made. The first statement, given to Detective Sergeant Massey at the Western District Criminal Investigations Division Office prior to Detective Buie\u2019s involvement in the interrogation, preceded the improper inducement. According to Detective Sergeant Massey, the first statement contained \u201cthe exact information\u201d Knight provided in his recorded statement at the Homicide Division. Knight did not attempt to impeach or contradict this assertion at either the suppression hearing or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The improper inducement obviously could not have caused Knight to make the first statement. Giving due credit to Detective Sergeant Massey\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it follows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>improper inducement could not have caused Knight to make the second identical statement either. If Knight needed no improper inducement in order to give the first statement, then it is reasonable to conclude that there was no nexus between, or reliance on, the improper inducement in his repetition of the substantive content of the former statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The record indicates that Knight\u2019s goal in giving both statements was to shift blame from himself. He named in both Ralph Williams as the shooter and Antonio Jones as the man who accompanied Williams from the \u201chack\u201d to the scene of the robbery. The part of Knight\u2019s stories regarding Antonio Jones was a lie. As was subsequently discovered by the authorities, Jones was in prison at the time and could not have been involved. Knight\u2019s lie indicates a calculating, though doomed, attempt to shift the guilt to others. That, and not the hope of special treatment from the interrogating officers or prosecutor, motivated Knight when he gave his statements. It is ironic that in trying to place the blame on a man who could not have been involved in the crime, Knight gave the State its strongest evidence linking him to the conspiracy, robbery, and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We conclude that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence that Knight gave his first statement prior to the improper inducement and that the two statements were identical in substantive content was sufficient to support the hearing judge\u2019s finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Knight\u2019s recorded statement was admissible, untainted by the inducement. The trial court did not err in denying the suppression motion or admitting Knight\u2019s statement as evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b561-12\">1. <em>See Miranda v.

Officer Mills testified that he did not say that appellant would receive a lesser penalty if he talked, and he did not represent that it would be easier on him if he confessed. He denied telling appellant that he would help him, or that he would get him a better deal with the State's Attorney if he talked. What Officer Mills did indicate to appellant was that he would inform the prosecutor that appellant had given a statement and was cooperative. Assuming that appellant concluded that the State would be favorably impressed upon receiving such advice, which is a perfectly reasonable assumption, that conversation does not rise to the level of an improper inducement that would invalidate his confession.

We think the State's failure, after Streams left the stand, to go forward with testimony which would refute his claim of promises and threats and to show the conduct of the police during the period he was in custody of the arresting officers was enough under the circumstances of this case to require a holding that the judgments appealed from must be reversed because the State did not meet its burden of establishing the voluntariness of the confessions as a prerequisite to their admission in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\"><em>Streams, </em>238 Md. at 283, 208 A.2d at 616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">.
