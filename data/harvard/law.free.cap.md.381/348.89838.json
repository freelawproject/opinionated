We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The petitioner, Kurt H. Richardson, was arrested and charged with felony and misdemeanor drug offences and resisting arrest. When he appeared for his bail hearing, rather than being taken directly before the court, he, along with a group of defendants, was shown a videotape. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>videotape,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a judge provided advice and instructions, generally as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Your bail review is not your trial, but is a hearing to determine whether the bail that has been set in your case ought to be increased or decreased or whether you ought to be released on your own recognizance. This is not your opportunity to tell the Court whether you are guilty or not guilty. Each of you should\u2019ve received a copy of your statement of charges. If you have not received your charging documents please tell the pre-trial representative and the bail review judge, and a copy will be provided to you. You have certain very important rights, please listen carefully. If you are charged with a felony you have a right to preliminary hearing, if you choose to have a preliminary hearing the State must show that there is probable cause that a crime was committed and probable cause that you committed that crime. Your preliminary hearing date is printed on the paper the Court Commissioner gave you. If you are charged with a crime that carries a penalty of more than ninety days incarceration you have a right to a jury trial at the Circuit Court of Baltimore City. A jury is composed of twelve persons picked from the motor and voter rolls of Baltimore City, all twelve jurors must find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in order for you to be found guilty. You also have a right to a court trial, where a judge would decide whether you are guilty or not guilty. The standard of proof in a court trial is also beyond a reasonable doubt. Your trial date is printed on the paper the Court Commissioner gave you. Perhaps your most important right is your right to have a lawyer represent you. If you cannot afford to retain a private lawyer to represent you at not [sic] cost. The State\u2019s Attorney who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>will be prosecuting the case is a lawyer, the rules of evidence will apply at your trial. If you are not trained in the law and you do not know the rules of evidence you will find that you are at a disadvantage in attempting to represent yourself. A lawyer can help you in many ways, a lawyer can help you investigate your case, and determine if there is a legal defense that you might not know exists. A lawyer can help you question the State\u2019s witnesses, call witnesses and question any witnesses that you any have. A lawyer can help you decide whether you should testify or whether you should remain silent. Even if you are found guilty a lawyer can still help you by arguing to the judge about the sentence to be imposed. These are the advantages to having a lawyer. There are only disadvantages in representing yourself. You may retain any lawyer you choose, if you are unable to hire a private attorney you may go to the Public Defender\u2019s office to apply for representation. If you remain in jail the Public Defender\u2019s Office will represent you if you choose. If you make bail or are released on your own recognizance you must go in person to the Public Defender\u2019s Office. When you arrive you will be given an income verification form, the verification form must be returned to the Public Defender\u2019s office more than ten working days before your trial date so that a determination can be made whether you qualify for representation. If you do nothing between now and the date of your trial the judge may find that you have waived your right to a lawyer. If that happens you will have to proceed without representation. If you have any questions regarding these rights, please ask the bail review judge when you [sic] name is called.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Bail Review Instructions, Official Transcript of Proceedings before Honorable Alan T. Karlin, Judge, October 28, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">After viewing the video, the petitioner and the other members of the group were taken into the courtroom, before the bail review judge. Having inquired, \u201c[t]his group has seen the video and been advised of their rights, is that correct[ ]\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>received the response,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cYes, sir, they have,\u201d the judge proceeded to review each defendant\u2019s case individually. With respect to the petitioner, with the exception of advising the petitioner that his bail would remain the same and hearing from the representative from Pretrial Release Services, that review, in its entirety, consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Richardson, in case Number 2172, one count of distribution is a felony, 20 years, $25,000; one count of possession, 4 years and/or $25,000; resisting arrest (inaudible) could receive a sentence not deemed cruel and unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cPreliminary hearing is September 17th, Courtroom 3, 830 North Avenue. Pretrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201cWOMAN\u2019S VOICE: Gina (inaudible) for pretrial release services. For the record, Your Honor, this defendant does have a 52 page record, and this was the allegation: The police observed the defendant looking into a pill container. They come back with a field interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cHe then threw that container into the street. They did recover 14 gel caps of suspected heroine [sic]. Current bail is set at 5,000 and pretrial is not requesting a change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbO\">\u201cTHE COURT: The bail remains the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">(Official Transcript of Proceedings (Arraignment Hearing), August 18, 1998). The record thus reflects that the bail review judge never, inquired of the petitioner personally whether he was present when the video was shown, whether he understood its contents, or whether he had any questions regarding the video. Nevertheless, \u201cThe Bail Review Docket\u201d recorded that the District Court Judge did make \u201ccertain the defendant received a copy of the charging document; informed the defendant of right to, and importance of, counsel; complied w/rule 4-215; referred defendant to public defender; advised felony defendant of right to preliminary hearing; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>advised defendant of right to jury trial; ordered bail to remain the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">When the petitioner next appeared in the District Court, for his preliminary hearing, the felony drug charge against him was nolle prossed and his case was postponed. On that occasion, the only exchange between the petitioner and the court was, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay, So the State\u2019s \u2014 (inaudible)\u2014nolle prossed the felony, which means you have an absolute right to a postponement. December 18th is your new date. You have a right to hire private counsel. If you cannot afford private counsel, go to the Public Defender\u2019s Office 10 working days before your next trial date. Where do you live sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA2\">\u201cDEFENDANT: 6924 \u2014 (inaudible)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Have a seat, and we\u2019ll call you for a summons. Next person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">(Court Proceedings, September 17,1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The petitioner sought a postponement to get counsel on his next appearance in the District Court. When that request was denied, he prayed a jury trial. In its entirety, the record of that appearance reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201cVOICE: Okay. The next person in line, step up to the table. Give us your name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Kurt Richardson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201cVOICE: The State v. Kurt Richardson, Case No. 3b302172.

Is the current one \u2014 (inaudible) \u2014 I believe the case has been in before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why are you requesting a postponement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aak\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Well, I just got released and I just come from the Public Defender and they told me I got to get\u2014 (inaudible) \u2014 time to reapply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: You were arrested on something else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aii\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: When did you get released, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cDEFENDANT: A week-and-a-half ago</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: When did you get arrested on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT: That was in \u2014 last month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay, Sir, I\u2019m not going to grant you another postponement. This case was postponed three months ago in September. You\u2019ve had three months to get an attorney. Have a seat. The next person, step up. Give us your name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201c(Whereupon, the tape was temporarily stopped and resumed at this part of the proceeding.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cVOICE: Just a moment please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">\u201cVOICE: The State v. Kurt Richardson, Case No. 3B302172.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">\u201cVOICE: Mr. Richardson, are you \u2014 (inaudible)\u2014sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6So\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">\u201cVOICE: Stand over here. I\u2019ll give you a summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3j\">\u201cVOICE: You\u2019re asking for a jury trial, Richardson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxP\">\u201cVOICE: Kurt Richardson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">\u201c(Whereupon, the above-entitled proceeding was concluded.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">(Court Proceedings, December 18, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">The next appearance the petitioner made in court was in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. He appeared without counsel and the court determined that the petitioner had waived counsel by inaction, pursuant to Rule 4-215(d). The basis for that determination is reflected in following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Who is your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-18\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I was sent down on a summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOo\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sir, you weren\u2019t sent down here. You asked for a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-19\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Who is your lawyer, Mr. Richardson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-21\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: My lawyer is not present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: Who is your lawyer is my question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I ain\u2019t make it over there to 201 Saint Paul Place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: The answer is you do not have your lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APd\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So when I asked who your lawyer is, the answer is I don\u2019t have one, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Now, when were you charged with this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: When was I charged with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: When were you charged with this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQb\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I can\u2019t remember the date. It was this year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201c[THE STATE:]: August 17,1998, Your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: It continues to amaze me that people do not remember when they are arrested. Hardly anyone remembers the date they are arrested. I always though [sic] that was seminal [sic] day in the life of an individual. That is the day when someone took away your freedom. I guess not. When were you released?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Released? I believe in October.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQb6\">\u201cTHE COURT: How long did you stay incarcerated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: About thirty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: What have you done since your release to obtain a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I had a lawyer, but when I got released I didn\u2019t have sufficient time to go reapply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, sir, that is not true. If you were released in October\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014 today is December\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-19\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014 what prevented you from going to the Public Defender\u2019s Officer later in October, the whole month of November[,] or just about the whole month of December?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I had a public defender, but I had got locked up again and got released in November.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Let\u2019s take this chronologically. You were arrested for the charge of narcotic possession\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014 in August. That\u2019s this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: How long did you remain incarcerated on the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Thirty days, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So sometime in late September or early October you were released from custody on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfW\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... When were you arrested on the next case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: October and released in November.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afo\">\u201cTHE COURT: So how long was the interval or the gap between release on this charge and the arrest on the next charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: That was like ten or fifteen days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6C\">\u201cTHE COURT: In that period of ten or fifteen days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I went up to the Public Defender\u2019s Office and they told me I had to reapply within ten working days and they gave me a piece of paper that said within ten working days and bring proof of income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you remember your first trial date in the district court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-17\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: August.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, it was September 17. You were arrested in August. Your first trial date was September 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOc\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: That was when you were there for a preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-20\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: And the case was then later dropped from a felony to misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: And they postponed the case from September 17 to December 18, three months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: After you were released in November on a second charge, what did you do to get a lawyer for this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I went up there and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: When did you go up there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I went up there, I believe, around December, about the first or second week of December.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJD\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is there a reason you did not go there the day after you were released in November?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: What was that reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Because at that time I was out looking for a job and I was going \u2014 when I went up there, it was late, and they told me to come back. And when I did go back, they told me to bring proof of income and this and that and they told me that it was too late, that I had to reapply within ten days, and they gave me a piece of paper to show up North Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Here is our problem sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Your case has been pending since August, and here you are four months later and do not have a lawyer to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-18\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I had two lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s right, you had two lawyers probably from the Public Defender\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-20\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: And they represent you while you\u2019re incarcerated. Once you while you\u2019re released, they ask you simply to go back up and reapply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: But you had since August to do that, sir. \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You have not done it in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI6\">...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: By my calculation, sir, you had eight days in the last part of November and the first part of December when you had an opportunity to apply to the Public Defender\u2019s Office in a timely manner to get a lawyer and you didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s because they told me it was too late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, it was, when you applied in late December. You had from the 23rd of November to the 4th of December. Maybe you were busy trying to find a job or something else, but finding a lawyer to represent you in a criminal charge where you could get incarcerated seems to be a priority. I\u2019m not going to delay this case any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: This Court finds that you were aware of your right to the representation of an attorney, you were aware that an attorney could be helpful in representing you in these matters, and you have not set forth any meritorious reason why you do not have a lawyer to represent you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVh\">(Reporter\u2019s Official Transcript of Proceedings, December 22, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Following a jury trial, the petitioner was found guilty of possession of heroin. He was sentenced the same day to three years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">The petitioner timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Initially, that court, in an unreported opinion, dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal for \u201cfailure to provide a complete transcript of the proceedings in [Cjircuit [Cjourt as required by Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 411.\u201d Subsequently, after receiving affidavits the petitioner submitted with respect to the efforts his counsel had made to complete the record, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>granting or denying the petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that decision, but recognizing that justice would thereby be served, the intermediate appellate court issued an order remanding the case to the Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to a new trial because of noncompliance with Rule 4-215. More particularly, the Order instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201cIf there exists an accurate record of the relevant proceedings in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City, the [C]ircuit [Cjourt shall determine whether appellant is entitled to a new trial on the ground that a review of the relevant [Cjircuit [Cjourt and District Court records show that appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel did not comply with the requirements of Md. Rule 4-215. If the District Court employee responsible for producing accurate records of that court\u2019s proceedings is unable to provide the [Cjircuit [Cjourt with an accurate record of the relevant proceedings, the [Cjircuit [Cjourt shall determine whether appellant is entitled to a new trial on the ground that \u2014 through fault of appellant and/or appellant\u2019s counsel \u2014 the failure to produce an accurate record has denied appellant the benefit of meaningful appellate review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Thereafter, the petitioner filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Richardson v. State, </em>376 Md. 139, 829 A.2d 530 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We shall hold, as the petitioner argues, that merely showing a defendant a videotape of a judge providing the advice and instruction required by Rule 4-215(a) is an insufficient predicate for a finding of waiver of counsel by inaction. At the least, there must be some inquiry to determine the defendant\u2019s understanding of the advice and instructions so given. Before addressing that issue, however, we shall consider the propriety, which we shall reject, of the limited remand, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-604(d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ordered by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">To be sure, Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 604(d) makes clear that, in a proper case, a limited remand is an acceptable and appropriate disposition. Our cases clarifying and delineating those circumstances when it is acceptable and appropriate were recently synthesized in <em>Southern v. State, </em>371 Md. 93, 104-105, 807 A.2d 13,16-17 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cThe limited remand is proper in various circumstances, particularly when the purposes of justice will be advanced by permitting further proceedings. <em>Butler v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 409, [433,] 462 A.2d 1230[,1242] (1983). <em>See McMillian v.

State, </em>355 Md. 420, 444, 735 A.2d 1003, 1016 (1999), in which this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201cMaryland Rule 4-215(a) implements the constitutional mandates for waiver of counsel, detailing a specific procedure that must be followed by the trial court in order for there to be a knowing and intelligent waiver. <em>Vincenti v. State, </em>309 Md. 601, 604, 525 A.2d 1072, 1074 (1987); <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 609, 536 A.2d at 1161. Whether the defendant\u2019s waiver is expressly made to the judge by requesting to proceed to trial pro se, by inaction through simply appearing at trial without counsel present, or through discharging an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the trial court must comply with Md. Rule 4-215 in order for the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel to be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In practical terms, therefore, \u201cRule 4-215 exists as a safeguard to the constitutional right to counsel, providing a precise \u201cchecklist\u201d that must be strictly complied with before a defendant\u2019s waiver can be considered valid,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 426, 735 A.2d at 1006; it \u201cis a bright line rule that requires strict compliance in order for there to be a \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 waiver of counsel by a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 735 A.2d at 1020. <em>See also Vincenti v.

Not only is the Rule mandatory and subject to strict compliance, its violation cannot be \u201charmless error.\u201d <em>Moten v. State, </em>339 Md. 407, 409, 663 A.2d 593, 595 (1995); <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 278, 523 A.2d 597, 605-606 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In none of the four appearances the petitioner made before a court \u2014 three in the District Court and one in the Circuit Court \u2014 did the judge before whom he appeared advise him in accordance with Rule 4-215(a) or ascertain whether he understood the rights the Rule addresses. On the first occasion, the judge, having ascertained that an advice of rights videotape had been shown to the group of defendants, of which the petitioner presumably was a part, advised the petitioner of the charges, possible penalties, the preliminary hearing date and, after being apprised of the nature of the charges, that the bail remained unchanged. On the second District Court appearance, the State nolle prossed the felony charges, necessitating a postponement, whereupon the court informed the petitioner that he had the right to retain private counsel and of the requirement that he consult the Public Defender ten days before the next trial date. The petitioner\u2019s request for postponement was denied on his next appearance in the District Court, during the course of which the court noted that the petitioner had three months to obtain counsel. In the Circuit Court, the judge inquired pursuant to Rule 4-215(d), but did not provide the advice mandated by Rule 4-215(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">To be sure, as we have seen, a Circuit Court judge may rely on the compliance by a District Court judge with Rule 4-215(a). Because, in this case, the requirement that each defendant be advised pursuant to Rule 4-215(a) was discharged by showing a videotape of a judge giving the required advice and that viewing was followed by the petitioner being taken before the court to complete the bail review process, the question whether there was compliance on which the Circuit Court judge could rely must depend upon the combined adequacy of the videotaped advice and the interaction between the bail review judge and the defendant. Stated differently, and as posed by the petitioner, the critical question is whether the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-215(a) can be satisfied by merely showing a defendant a videotape of the advisements being given. We answer that question in the negative, believing that it is not sufficient simply to demonstrate that a defendant has been advised of his or her rights; rather, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>necessary that the court be satisfied that the defendant understood those rights, and there is a basis for the court\u2019s satisfaction in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">As indicated, to be effective, a waiver of the right to counsel must be made knowingly and intelligently. When that requirement is considered in conjunction with the fact that Rule 4-215(a) is mandatory and demands strict compliance, it follows ineluctably that, in complying with the Rule, more is required of a judge than merely exposing the defendant to the Rule\u2019s requirements. Simply advising the defendant as the Rule prescribes is not sufficient; the judge must endeavor to insure that the defendant understands the advice. Indeed, unless the defendant understands the advice, his or her subsequent waiver of counsel will not, and could not be, knowing and voluntary. Thus, the judge\u2019s obligation is not just to offer the advice and instructions, but also to inquire of the defendant sufficiently to satisfy him or herself that the defendant understands them.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>Johnson, supra, </em>355 Md. 420, 735 A.2d 1003, although not directly on point, is instructive. There, this Court held inadequate advisements pursuant to Rule 4-215(a), given to a defendant, piecemeal, by more than one judge over more than one court appearance. The rationale given to justify the holding has particular relevance to the case sub judice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">\u201cIn short, any Md. Rule 4-215(a)(1)-(5) advisements that Johnson received were inadequate and given to him in an incomplete manner in different courts by different judges, all resulting in likely confusion on the part of the defendant. Nowhere in the record is there evidence that any one circuit court judge went through the section (a) litany with Johnson, point-by-point as required. Indeed, the record indicates that the only judge who mentioned Md. Rule 4-215 to Johnson was Judge Nalley on the day of his trial, and even then he did not go through the complete subsection (a) advisement. For the rule to be an effective constitutional safeguard, it contemplates defendants receiving the advisements during their \u2018first appearance in court without counsel,\u2019 well before the day of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cWe conclude that to avoid confusion on the part of an accused and to protect the fundamental right to counsel, the subsection (a) advisements must be given in strict accordance with Md. Rule 4-215, by the correct court and not piecemeal. A \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 waiver of counsel can only occur when there is strict compliance with the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 461, 735 A.2d at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The cases that have addressed the issue of videotaped or <em>en masse </em>advisements reach a consistent result. <em>See Swensen v. Municipality of Anchorage, </em>616 P.2d 874, 877 (Alaska 1980) (upholding an <em>en masse </em>arraignment procedure consisting of \u201cthe recitation of rights to the group, followed by the questioning as to each defendant concerning whether he or she understood those rights\u201d); <em>McIntire v.

In <em>Snowe v. State, </em>533 N.E.2d 613 (Ind.App.1989), the issue was the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea. She had pled guilty at misdemeanor traffic court after being \u201cadvised of her rights by a televised advisement given to all defendants before the commencement of\u2019 that court. <em>Id. </em>at 615. Critical to her motion was the argument that the record did not demonstrate that the plea was knowingly and intelligently made. <em>Id. </em>After acknowledging the acceptability of <em>en masse </em>advisements, when there has been personal interrogation by the court to determine the defendant\u2019s understanding of the rights and the concept of waiver, <em>id. </em>at 616, citing <em>French v.

In addition to those advisements and the dispositional alternatives available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to the court, the video instructed that the judge should be informed if further explanation were needed or the rights were not understood. 605 N.E.2d at 206.

Given the judge\u2019s face to face instruction on M.R.\u2019s constitutional rights coupled with the prior written advisement of rights and videotape viewing, M.R. and his mother were fully advised of the right to counsel at public expense if they were indigent and desired representation by counsel.

To what the court had reference is best understood by repeating the court\u2019s description of the initial appearance proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201cAt the initial appearance on February 22, 1994, appellant was allegedly provided with a copy of a pamphlet prepared by the Chardon Municipal Court which appellee claims fulfilled these dictates____Then, prior to addressing appellant directly, the court read a standardized introduction to all who were in the courtroom:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u2018This proceeding is known as the arraignment. It is your opportunity to enter a plea to the charge for which you are here.

If there is an accident involved, you can enter a plea of no contest and I make a finding of \u201cGuilty.\u201d That finding of \u201cGuilty\u201d cannot be used against you in a civil suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u2018Each of you received a blue pamphlet when you checked in this morning. Please read this pamphlet when you get the opportunity this morning. The back page will tell you about the costs involved in addition to the f\u00edne. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF4\">\u201cThe record reveals that when appellant was called at the initial appearance he appeared before the court and was immediately required to enter a plea.... He pleaded not guilty. The court next asked appellant if he had an attorney, to which appellant indicated that he did not. The matter was then scheduled for a pretrial. Some other dialogue was had, but it was not of the nature commanded under Crim.R. 5 or Crim.R. 10 and did not demonstrate that appellant was afforded the opportunity to read the material in the booklet, or that he was literate, let alone able to discern its contents, including the nature of the charge, his right to counsel and right to a jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1318-19 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The only advisements the petitioner received that could qualify as meeting the Rule 4-215(a) requirements were neither delivered live nor individually. He was one of a group of defendants to whom the advisements were given <em>en masse </em>and the medium utilized for the purpose, albeit featuring a judge, was a videotape. Thus, the petitioner could not have asked questions while the rights were being explained and the instructions given and neither his individual concerns, nor those any of the other defendants were, or could have been, addressed. To be sure, the video advised the defendants to ask any questions and to raise concerns when brought before the court, when the petitioner\u2019s case was called, the interaction with the court was, the record reflects, focused and fleeting. In its entirety, it consisted only of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. This group has seen the advice of rights, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201cWoman\u2019s Voice: Yes, sir, they have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Richardson, in case Number 2172, one count of distribution is a felony, 20 years, $25,000; one count of possession, 4 years and/or $25,000; resisting arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(inaudible) could receive a sentence not deemed cruel and unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\u201cPreliminary hearing is September 17th, Courtroom 3, 830 North Avenue. Pretrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cWoman\u2019s Voice: Gina (inaudible) for pretrial release services. For the record, Your Honor, this defendant does have a 52 page record, and this was the allegation: The police observed the defendant looking into a pill container. They come back with a field interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cHe then threw that container into the street. They did recover 14 gel caps of suspected heroin. Current bail is set at $5,000 and pretrial is not requesting a change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cThe Court: The bail remains the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The court did not address the petitioner with respect to whether he had viewed the videotape. It did not ask the petitioner whether he understood the rights explained to him. It did not invite the petitioner to ask questions or even inquire whether he had any. The only time the court addressed the petitioner was to advise him of the charges, the possible penalties and the place and date of the preliminary hearing. Significantly, the petitioner was not asked whether he understood the charges or their consequences or had questions with regard to the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">We conclude that this record does not reflect, not to mention demonstrate or ensure, clearly, that the petitioner comprehended the rights of which he was presumably informed. What occurred in this case compares unfavorably with the one-sided, <em>en masse </em>rights colloquy found lacking in <em>Bayer. </em>It is grossly unacceptable and undermines the realization of the true purpose of Rule 4-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

I write supplementally only to underscore that, as I understand the Court\u2019s opinion, the use by a court of <em>en masse </em>videotape advisements to appraise defendants of the relevant rights is not condemned generally by our decision in this case. The Court holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWU\">that <em>merely </em>showing a defendant a videotape of a judge providing the advice and instruction required by Rule 4-215(a) is an insufficient predicate for a finding of waiver of counsel by inaction. At the least, there must be some inquiry to determine the defendant\u2019s understanding of the advice and instructions so given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Majority op. at 361-62, 849 A.2d 494-95 (emphasis added). This case does not present the situation where the defendant was informed of his rights by video and a trial judge subsequently made an inquiry to determine the defendant\u2019s understanding of the advice and instructions given in the video. Rather, there was no individual, particularized inquiry in this case as to whether Richardson understood his rights as explained in the video. As the Court\u2019s opinion points out, several jurisdictions employ a procedure consisting of the video recitation of rights to a group, followed by an individual inquiry by a judge where each defendant is questioned separately to see if he or she understood his or her rights. <em>See </em>majority op. at 369-70, 849 A.2d 499-500. Such a procedure should be acceptable in Maryland as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins in the view expressed here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
