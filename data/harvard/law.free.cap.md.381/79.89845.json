The MPIA is codified at Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">This case had its genesis when the appellees made a written MPIA request to the Athletic Department of UMCP seeking \u201ccopies of the original and revised employment contracts for head football coach Ralph Friedgen .... [and] any separate letters of understanding, side letters or similar documents specifying incentives, bonuses, broadcast agreements, athletic footwear contracts, and other matters concerning the terms and conditions of [Coach Friedgen\u2019s] employment and compensation.\u201d In response, University Counsel disclosed that Coach Friedgen\u2019s annual salary was $183,920,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and denied the remainder of the request, citing \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 10\u2014617(f),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>which prohibit the disclosure of personnel and certain financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Dissatisfied with the UMCP\u2019s response, the appellees retained counsel, who sought reconsideration of UMCP\u2019s decision to disclose only those documents related to Coach Fried-gen\u2019s salary and to refuse disclosure of documents \u201cdescribing other employment related compensation due\u201d him. They argued that.UMCP\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 10-616(i) and \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f) was flawed because UMCP improperly and narrowly interpreted the term, \u201csalary,\u201d and, at the same time, improperly construed the term, \u201cpersonnel,\u201d broadly, both inconsistently with the \u201cbias in favor of disclosure recognized by the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The UMCP was not persuaded and maintained its position. Responding to the appellees\u2019 request for reconsideration, it wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201cAlthough we understand the MPIA\u2019s general construction favoring disclosure of public records, we remain constrained by its specific prohibitions. With respect to the Baltimore Sun\u2019s request, the MPIA expressly requires us to deny inspection of Coach Friedgen\u2019s personnel records, as well as any part of a record that contains information about his finances, including income. <em>(See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) and 10 \u2014 617(f) of the MPIA). The only exception to these requirements is limited to his \u201csalary\u201d as a State employee. <em>(See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-611(g)(2) and 10-617(0(1) of the MPIA).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cWith respect to salary, we have concluded, in consultation with the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office, that the MPIA requires the disclosure of the total amount of an employee\u2019s State earnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Nonetheless, perhaps in an attempt to avoid the threatened lawsuit, Coach Friedgen voluntarily agreed to provide additional information about his compensation. Accordingly, the UMCP disclosed the following additional information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cCoach Friedgen receives a salary of $179,753 in 2001-2002. Also, he has earned the maximum amount of compensation for competitive achievement (ACC Championship and BCS Bowl), automobile allowances, radio and television appearances and apparel/endorsement compensation, which totals $762,000. The availability of student athlete academic achievement and citizenship bonuses is evaluated subsequent to the completion of the fiscal year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In the meantime and prior to receipt of the additional information voluntarily disclosed by Coach Friedgen, the appellees made another MPIA request of the UMCP Athletic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Department, this one seeking information with respect to the compensation and income of UMCP\u2019s head basketball coach, Gary Williams.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The University responded to that request as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">\u201cExcept for salary of a State employee, the MPIA requires State agencies to deny access to personnel records and financial information of an individual, including income. See \u00a7 10-616(i) and \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f) of the MPIA. Therefore, University of Maryland legal counsel has advised Intercollegiate Athletics to provide the following information in response to your request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cCoach Gary Williams receives a regular salary of $202,991 in FY 2002. To date, he has also earned $540,400 for competitive achievement (ACC Regular Season Championship and NCAA National Championship), automobile allowance and radio, television and personal appearances. The availability of additional University compensation based upon student-athlete academic achievement and NCAA compliance is evaluated at a later date. His apparel/endorsement compensation is received directly from the apparel company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cWe must decline to provide you with copies of Coach Williams\u2019 employment contract and/or any other records in the University\u2019s possession pertaining to other income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>which Coach Williams may receive directly from outside sources (e.g., apparel/equipment endorsements, sports camps, consulting, speaking engagements outside the scope of the contract, etc.) Such documents would constitute personnel records and/or contain personal financial information other than the salary of a State employee, and their disclosure is prohibited under \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) and \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f) of the MPIA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Thus, UMCP reaffirmed its previously communicated interpretation of the MPIA and, accordingly, refused to disclose any information relating to Coach Williams\u2019 non-University related income. Nor did it disclose a copy of Coach William\u2019s University contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The appellees filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, naming as defendants the University System of Maryland, Deborah A Yow, Ph.D., the athletic director at UMCP, and David Haglund, the assistant director of Intercollegiate Athletics at UMCP (collectively, the \u201cappellants\u201d or the \u201cUniversity\u201d). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, at the center of which was the question whether the University was required to disclose, not only each coach\u2019s total salary from the University, but, the underlying contracts and agreements relating to each coach\u2019s income. The appellants argued that the plain language of the applicable sections of the MPIA statute requires state agencies to deny disclosure of a state employee\u2019s personnel and financial records, with a narrow exception for salary derived from State funds. The appellees, on the other hand, maintained that the records sought were subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of the MPIA and that the appellant\u2019s interpretation \u201caccords broad secrecy to the terms of a state employee\u2019s compensation contrary to the MPIA\u2019s mandate that the salary of public employees should be a matter of public record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The trial court found in favor of the appellees. It reasoned: the legislature has directed that the MPIA \u201cshall be construed in favor of permitting inspection\u201d of public records; the term \u201csalary\u201d unambiguously is included in the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d in \u00a7 10 \u2014 611(g)(2); the financial records exclusion con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tained in \u00a7 10-617(f) does not apply to the salary of a public employee; and, salary related documents are not personnel records within the meaning of the statute. Consequently, the trial court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the appellants\u2019 cross-motion. Accordingly, the court ordered that the records requested by the appellees be produced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court instructed that, to the extent that salary information and personnel records coexist in the same document, the personnel information should be redacted before the records are delivered to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The appellants moved to alter or amend the judgment, in an attempt to have any references to payments to the coaches from third parties deleted from the court\u2019s order. They argued, in that regard, that such payments did not constitute \u201csalary\u201d of a public employee and pointed out that the appellees requested information only about payments to the coaches \u201cby the State University from public funds\u201d and indicated that the records it sought did \u201cnot reveal anything about the coaches\u2019 personal finances other than how much taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>money they are paid from their public employment.\u201d The trial court denied that motion, whereupon the appellants timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to any proceedings on the merits in the intermediate appellate court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this Court, on its own initiative, issued a writ of certiorari. <em>University System of Maryland v. The Baltimore Sun Co., </em>374 Md. 81, 821 A.2d 369, (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We recently considered the applicability of the MPIA in <em>Hammen v. Baltimore County Police Department, </em>373 Md. 440, 455-156, 818 A.2d 1125, 1134-36 (2003). In that case, we commented that the MPIA requires that a \u201ccustodian shall permit a person ... to inspect any public record at any reasonable time\u201d except as otherwise provided by law. <em>Id., </em>citing \u00a7 10-613.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We explained that the \u201cprovisions of the ... Act reflect the legislative intent that the citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded <em>wide-ranging access </em>to public infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>mation concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 81, 721 A.2d 196, 199 (1998) (emphasis in original). Moreover, we made clear that the MPIA \u201cis to be construed in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing \u00a7 10-612(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See also, Fioretti v. Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 73, 716 A.2d 258, 262 (1998) (\u201c \u2018the provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983) (the provisions of the statute \u201cmust be liberally construed ... in order to effectuate the Public Information Act\u2019s broad remedial purpose\u201d); <em>Cranford v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 771, 481 A.2d 221, 227 (1984); <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, </em>299 Md. 493, 506-507, 474 A.2d 880, 887 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">To be sure, the parties do not dispute that the records sought by the appellees are public records. They dispute only whether those records fall within the category of documents and/or information that the statute mandatorily instructs a custodian to deny,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or permit, inspection. As a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>matter, it is important to note the differences in the documents requested by the appellees and how these documents came to be public records. Both Coach Friedgen and Coach Williams are employees of the University of Maryland, College Park, a part of the University System of Maryland, an instrumentality of the State of Maryland. Consequently, both coaches are employees of the state of Maryland. Both also have entered into written agreements with the University, outlining the terms and conditions, including salary, of the employment arrangement. These written agreements, and any amendments thereto, similar to other government contracts, come under the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d as \u00a7 10-611(g)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> defines it, as they originated as documentary evidence in the transaction of public business. Indeed, \u00a7 10-611(g)(2) is clear, a public record \u201cincludes a document that lists the salary of an employee of a unit or instrumentality of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>government or of a political subdivision.\u201d Clearly, employment contracts on file with the University are public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\u201cNCAA\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pursuant to NCAA regulations, contractual agreements between a member institution and its athletic coaches, and hence between UMCP and both coaches in this case, must include an express stipulation that NCAA Enforcement Provisions shall apply to the terms of the employment contract. \u00a7 11.2.1.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Violations of these provisions by a coach, it is further stipulated, can result in disciplinary or corrective action, including suspension without pay and termination, for serious and deliberate violation of NCAA regulations. \u00a7 11.2.1.1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, the NCAA bylaws, see \u00a7 11.2.2, provides that an athletic coach must report annually to the member institution the sources of his or her athletically related income from third parties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To be sure, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>coaches may earn supplemental pay, \u00a7 11.01.7,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>see </em>\u00a7 11.3.2.1 (\u201cA staff member may earn income in addition to the institutional salary by performing services for outside groups\u201d); however, the NCAA recognizes the institution\u2019s control of the coaches\u2019 employment and salary, <em>see </em>\u00a7 11.3.1,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> by both limiting and prohibiting the source of, and how, supplemental pay may be earned. Section \u00a7 11.3.2.2, for example, prohibits \u201c[a]n outside source ... from paying or regularly supplementing an athletic department staff member\u2019s annual salary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>from arranging to supplement that salary for an unspecified achievement.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 11.3.2.3 limits bonuses to \u201cdirect cash payment[s] in recognition of a specific and extraordinary achievement (e.g., contribution during career to the athletic department of the institution, winning a conference or national championship, number of games or meets won during career/season), provided such a cash supplement is in recognition of a specific achievement and is in conformance with institutional policy.\u201d Additionally, \u201cAn institution\u2019s coaching staff member may not promote a noninstitutional camp or clinic by permitting the use of his or her quotations and/or pictures in the camp or clinic brochure, unless that coaching staff member is employed by the camp.\u201d Bylaw \u00a7 11.3.2.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Consequently, pursuant to the NCAA reporting requirements with respect to the ability of athletic coaches to earn outside income, the University has come into possession of documents that contain references to contracts for remuneration, and other financial arrangements, between the coaches and third parties. These documents evidence, at least purportedly, income in addition to both coaches\u2019 state-provided salaries, i.e., in NCAA parlance, \u201cinstitutional salary,\u201d <em>see </em>ByLaw, \u00a7 11.01.7, that is derived from athletically related sources outside of the University. Again, the documents, as all parties agree, fall within the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d as defined in \u00a7 10-611(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The interplay between the NCAA reporting requirements and the MPIA, as it relates to state employees, is, as we have said, at the heart of the dispute <em>sub judice. </em>Without the NCAA reporting requirement, the University, potentially, would not be in possession of the records the respondent seeks. Or, if both coaches were employed by a private university in Maryland, although subject to the same NCAA reporting requirements, the MPIA would not be applicable and the appellees could not compel their disclosure, since the MPIA does not apply to the business records of a private entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Whether, in this case, the records in the possession of the University need be disclosed depends solely upon the legislative intent in enacting the MPIA. That is a question of statutory construction, the principles of which are well settled. Most recently, the principal canons of statutory construction, and those relevant to the decision of the case <em>sub judice, </em>were reviewed by this Court in <em>Bank of America v. Stine, </em>379 Md. 76, 85-86, 839 A.2d 727, 732-733 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">\u201c[T]he primary goal of [statutory construction is] to \u2018ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u2019 <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). In order to discern legislative intent, we first examine the words of the statute and if, giving them their plain and ordinary meaning, the statute is clear and unambiguous, we will end our inquiry. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Kolzig, </em>375 Md. 562, 567, 826 A.2d 467, 469 (2003). As we have recognized, however, \u2018[a]n ambiguity may ... exist even when the words of the statute are crystal clear. That occurs when its application in a given situation is not clear.\u2019 <em>Blind Indus. &amp; Servs. of Md. v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Gen. Servs., </em>371 Md. 221, 231, 808 A.2d 782, 788 (2002). Therefore, a statutory provision may be ambiguous: \u20181) when it is intrinsically unclear; or 2) when its intrinsic meaning may be fairly clear, but its application to a particular object or circumstance may be uncertain.\u2019 <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 648-49, 689 A.2d 610, 613 (1997). Further, \u201cwhen the statute to be interpreted is part of a statutory scheme, ... [we read it in context, together with the other statutes] on the same subject, harmonizing them to the extent possible.... \u2019 <em>Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 196, 204, 760 A.2d 1087, 1091 (2000). We also \u2018seek to avoid constructions that are unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense,\u2019 <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994), and we will presume that \u2018the Legislature \u2018intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law,\u2019\u201d <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 220, 817 A.2d 229, 234 (2003), quoting <em>State v.

Kolzig, </em>375 Md. 562, 567-69, 826 A.2d at 469-70 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">At the threshold, we point out that the MPIA does not require the carte blanche, and unrestricted disclosure, of all public records. To the contrary, it clearly requires the custodian of public records, in some circumstances, to deny inspection of public records and disclosure of specific information, e.g. \u00a7\u00a7 10-616(i) and 10-617(f), and, in certain other circumstances, where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest, \u00a7 10-618,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> gives the custodian discretion to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>inspection of parts of a public records. Moreover, the MPIA recognizes that \u201can unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is reason to deny inspection of a public record. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-612(b). Read in its totality and in context, it is clear that, in enacting the MPIA, the General Assembly was attempting to balance the right of the public to unfettered access to government records against the \u201cunwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 10-612(b), that unrestricted disclosure would cause. Clearly, it is the threat of, and protection against, an unwarranted invasion of privacy that led to the exclusions found in \u00a7\u00a7 10-616 and 10-617. Nonetheless, the Legislature has also instructed, and we have repeatedly affirmed, see <em>Hammen, supra, </em>373 Md. at 457, 818 A.2d at 1136; <em>Caffrey v. Dept. of Liquor Control for Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 272, 305, 805 A.2d 268, 287-288 (2002); <em>Office of the Attorney General v. Gallagher, </em>359 Md. 341, 343, 753 A.2d 1036, 1037 (2000); <em>Fioretti v. Md. State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 73, 716 A.2d 258, 262 (1998); <em>Kirwan supra, </em>352 Md. at 96-97, 721 A.2d at 207, that the MPIA is to be construed in favor of permitting inspection of public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Our case law interpreting the MPIA\u2019s disclosure requirements is instructive. For example, in <em>Hammen, </em>a retired Baltimore County Police Officer, pursuant to an MPIA request, sought to inspect surveillance tapes taken of his activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ties. The videotapes were taken by the county to be used in a separate administrative proceeding related to the re-evaluation of the officer\u2019s disability retirements benefits. Denying the request to inspect the videotape, the Baltimore County Office of Law opined that disclosure of the videotapes would be contrary to the decision in <em>Shenk v. Berger, </em>86 Md.App. 498, 587 A.2d 551 (1991). In that case, the Court of Special Appeals addressed the issue of whether surveillance videotapes of an injured party, taken by the opposing party after the alleged injuries had occurred, were subject to Maryland\u2019s discovery rules. The intermediate appellate court held that they were, provided that, prior to disclosure, the party having to disclose is afforded the opportunity to depose the injured party. <em>Shenk, supra, </em>86 Md.App. at 506-507, 587 A.2d at 556. In <em>Hammen, </em>the defendant agreed to honor the MPIA request, if Hammen would agree to be deposed in a separate proceeding, which he agreed to do. Nevertheless, we concluded that <em>Shenk </em>was not applicable because it involved \u201ca private personal injury civil action and did not involve statutorily guaranteed access to public records by a \u2018party in interest\u2019 \u201d <em>Hammen, supra, </em>373 Md. at 452, 818 A.2d at 1133. We held that \u201cthe rules of discovery applicable to circuit court proceedings are not, generally, applicable in respect to MPIA proceedings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 453, 818 A.2d at 1133, explaining that an MPIA request <em>\u201cis an attempt to gain statutorily guaranteed access to \u2018public information,\u2019 not private information.\u201d Id. </em>at 457, 818 A.2d at 1135 (emphasis added). Thus, absent some rule of law to the contrary, whatever rights the appellees have to compel disclosure and, conversely, whatever rights the appellants have to deny disclosure, are embodied within the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Prior to <em>Hammen, </em>this Court addressed the scope of the MPIA in two cases, <em>Office of the Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249 (2000) and <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 721 A.2d 196 (1998). The MPIA request in <em>Washington Post </em>sought disclosure of the telephone records of the Governor of the State of Maryland for \u201call phones in the Governor\u2019s Mansion (Government House); his State House offices; all phones in Shaw House (an annex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>office in Annapolis); all phones in the Washington and Baltimore offices; all car phones and cellular phones used by the governor and anyone on his staff.\u201d In addition, the Washington Post asked to review the scheduling and appointment records of the Governor for a two-year period. Asserting executive privilege, the Governor\u2019s Office, denied the request, choosing instead to disclose only the aggregate cost of the telephone calls. In addition, it released the Governor\u2019s public agenda, but refused to release the appointment and scheduling records, which, in its opinion, did not constitute public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">We addressed, as a preliminary matter, whether the provisions of the MPIA applied to the Governor\u2019s office. Concluding that the statutory language \u201cclearly encompassed ... [the Governor\u2019s office] as a unit or instrumentality of the State government,\u201d this Court determined that records of the Governor\u2019s office are subject to the right of inspection guaranteed in the MPIA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We concluded that there was no statutory exclusion in the MPIA for certain of the records sought by the Washington Post and, accordingly, required their disclosure. More important, however, to the case <em>sub judice, </em>was the determination that phone records from the Governor\u2019s Mansion, although technically property owned and paid for by the State and in the possession of the Governor\u2019s office, did not come within the definition of \u201cpublic record,\u201d \u201cin light of one\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her own home.\u201d 360 Md. at 537, 759 A.2d at 258. The Court explained: \u201cIn light of the nature of Government House and the role of the Government House Trust, the Governor and his family might not have the identical expectation of privacy while living there as one has in his or her privately owned home.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Nonetheless, we do not believe that the Governor and his family must relinquish all normal expectations of privacy in their home simply because, in accordance with constitutional and statutory provisions, their home and furnishing, including telephone service, are supplied by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP9\"><em>Washington Post, supra, </em>360 Md. at 537-38, 759 A.2d at 259. Thus, the determination in <em>Washington Post, </em>with respect to the Governor\u2019s home telephone bills, turned on this Court\u2019s construction of those records as being in their nature private and, therefore, not being the kinds of records that are encompassed within the definition of a \u201cpublic record\u201d intended by the Legislature. <em>Id, </em>at 538, 759 A.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Also at issue in <em>Kirwan v. Diamondback, supra, </em>was the scope of an MPIA request involving the records of parking citations issued by UMCP to student-athletes, and, coincidentally, to the UMCP head basketball coach, Gary Williams. The MPIA request, made by the campus student-newspaper, was denied by the University, the custodian of the parking citation records, on the basis that they were either personnel records exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) of the MPIA or, in the alternative, financial information exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f) of the MPIA. This Court rejected both rationales. We concluded, instead, that a citation for a parking violation is, in sum, \u201ca charging document accusing the recipient of a petty crime, and the monetary penalty imposed for a parking violation is a fine rather than a debt.\u201d 352 Md. at 87, 721 A.2d at 202. As such, we stated, such records did not constitute financial information as defined under the statute and, moreover, \u201cdid not fit within the commonly understood meaning of the term \u2018personnel records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 721 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We also were not persuaded by the University\u2019s argument, pursuant to \u00a7 10-618 (permissive denials), that disclosure of the records \u201cis against the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87-88, 721 A.2d at 202-03. That argument was premised upon the, supposed, \u201cchilling effect\u201d disclosure would have on the University\u2019s obligation to self report NCAA violations. The Court concluded that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d argument did not fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>clearly into categories recognized in \u00a7 10-618\u2019s permissive denials. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Finally, the University argued, citing \u00a7 10-612, that disclosure of parking ticket records would be \u201c \u2018an unwarranted invasion of privacy\u2019 because it would subject student-athletes and their families \u2018to extreme embarrassment and humiliation.\u2019 \u201d 352 Md. at 88, 721 A.2d at 203. In response, we stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201cWhen an adult commits or is formally charged with committing a criminal offense, even a petty one, it is doubtful that any \u2018invasion of privacy\u2019 occasioned by an accurate newspaper report of the matter is \u2018unwarranted.\u2019 Nevertheless, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that one might reasonably believe that such disclosure is an unwarranted invasion of privacy, the Maryland Public Information Act does not contain an exemption for particular cases whenever the disclosure of a record might cause an \u2018unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u2019 Section 10-612(b), previously quoted, related to the \u2018General Construction\u2019 of the Act. It provides that the Act \u2018shall be construed in favor\u2019 of disclosure \u2018unless an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person in interest would result.\u2019 The statutory construction issues raised in the present case regarding the Maryland Public Information Act concern the meaning of the terms \u2018personnel records\u2019 and \u2018financial records.\u2019 As explained in Part II A and II B above, the records sought in the present case do not constitute personnel records or financial information. Furthermore, we do not believe that a broader definition of these terms would be justified under the statutory construction principles set forth in \u00a7 10-612(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 88-89, 721 A.2d. at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Our cases thus instruct that, in a dispute relating to an MPIA request, a party\u2019s right to deny or compel inspection of public records is grounded, almost, if not exclusively, within the Act. The express exemptions set out in \u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) and 10-617(f), are intended to address the reasonable expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of privacy that a person in interest has in certain types of records identified by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">To be sure, the MPIA expressly requires the disclosure of a state-employee\u2019s salary as a matter of public record. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10 \u2014 611(g)(2) (defining a public record to include \u201ca document that lists the salary of an employee of a unit or instrumentality of the State government.\u201d) and \u00a7 10-612. The appellants, while acknowledging that a document evidencing a state-employee\u2019s salary is subject to MPIA\u2019s disclosure requirements (Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 7), maintain that the employment contracts sought by the appellees are either personnel records or financial information exempt under \u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) and 10-617(f). (Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 8). With respect to the former, they reason: when \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) and \u00a7 10-617(f)(1) are read together, it is clear that \u00a7 10-617(f)(1) \u201cdoes not trump the personnel records exemption.\u201d They point out that the latter provision \u201crefers to the \u2018subsection,\u2019 meaning \u00a7 10-617(f). It does not refer to \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i),\u201d which it easily could have done, had that been what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The appellants also rely on 83 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 192 (Md.1998), <em>available at </em>1998 Md. AG LEXIS 35 (Opinion No. 98-025, December 18, 1998). In that opinion, the Attorney General, responding to an inquiry from the County Executive for Anne Arundel County concerning \u201cpublic access to records reflecting individual bonuses or performance awards paid to merit system employees and appointed officials of Anne Arundel County,\u201d concluded that \u201cthe public is entitled to inspect records that reflect the earnings of government officers and employees, whether those earnings consist solely of a regular salary or are augmented by a bonus or performance award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He cautioned, however, that \u201c[t]his conclusion does not imply that the public has an entitlement to the documents establishing the basis for a bonus or performance award[,] for example, performance evaluations. Underlying records of this kind fall within the exemption for personnel records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192 n. 3. The appellants argue that the employment contract the University has with each coach is an underlying record of the kind to which the Attorney General made reference and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>therefore, comes within the exemption for personnel records found in \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i). (Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 11). So viewing the contracts for employment, they disclosed the salary information that the contracts authorized, but refused to disclose the contracts themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The appellants\u2019 argument with respect to \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f) is premised on the financial information concerning the coaches\u2019 contractual and financial arrangements with, and thus payments from, third parties, being personal financial information and not a part of the salary the coaches receive from the State. They note, in this regard, that, while \u201cpublic record\u201d is broadly defined, the requirement of disclosure is tempered by whether the law provides otherwise. Section 10 \u2014 617(f) provides otherwise, they assert, by prohibiting \u201cinspection of the part of a public record that contains information about the finances of an individual, including assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.\u201d Thus, the appellants submit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201c[T]he plain language of the MPIA requires only the disclosure of \u2018salary\u2019 and expressly prohibits the disclosure of \u2018income.\u2019 Had the Legislature intended that State agencies disclose private income of an individual \u2018derived from any university asset,\u2019 it could have easily so provided. But those words do not appear in the statute.... The plain meaning of SG \u00a7 10-617(f)(2) requires that a custodian deny inspection of a public record that contains information about [the] finances of an individual, including income. There is no exception for income \u2018derived from any university asset.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">(Citations omitted). The need to give effect to the plain language of the statute is not trumped, the appellants conclude, by the statutory direction to construe the MPIA in favor of permitting inspection of a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">This court is not persuaded by the appellants\u2019 personnel records argument. Moreover, the MPIA clearly requires, as all of the parties agree, the disclosure of the \u201csalary of an employee of a unit or instrumentality of State government.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u00a7 10-611(g)(2). That certainly would include the dollar amount paid. We believe that the requirement must include, in addition, disclosure of any document evidencing the employment arrangement and how the state-funded salary is earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">A public record includes documentary material, in any form, made, or received, by a unit or instrumentality of State government in connection with the transaction of State business. A contract between the University and the coaches of their athletic teams entered into after negotiations is the result of, and indeed, is, the transaction of State business. While it may not fall neatly into the definition of salary, a contract setting out the rights and responsibilities of each party to it and the circumstances and conditions governing the coaches\u2019 entitlement to receive the salary is not only a document entered into, i.e. made by and received by the University in connection with the transaction of public business, but it certainly informs and gives context to \u201csalary.\u201d Indeed, the purpose of the MPIA, <em>see </em>\u00a7 10-612(a) (\u201call persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees\u201d), is better served when the full context in which the salary is due or paid is known, i.e., fully disclosed. That is achieved only when the contract itself is disclosed. Thus, it is clear that the employment contracts evidencing the regular salaries paid to each coach by the University, and their obligations and rights, are exactly the types of records to which the Legislature intended the public to have access.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We are not persuaded that the employment contracts are themselves the kinds of underlying documents referred to by the Attorney General and argued by the appellants. They may establish the basis for the salary, for they state the rights and obligations of the coach in order to earn the contractual remuneration, but they are not in the nature of a performance evaluation. Thus, under the legislative policy favoring disclosure of public records, we conclude that they do not fall within the exemption for personnel records found in \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Moreover, denial of inspection of the employment contracts would contribute to the lack of public understanding of the amounts earned by Coach Friedgen and Williams as a result of their public employment and would thwart the achievement of the goal of the MPIA. We, therefore, hold that the employment contracts and any amendments thereto, side letters or documents reflecting the total compensation and sums of monies paid directly by the University to Coaches Friedgen and Williams must be disclosed. The terms of the employment contract are essential to an understanding of the salaries paid to the coaches, especially in light of the various alternatives for compensation potentially available to the coaches, <em>supra </em>note 8, in the form of car allowances, country club memberships, complimentary ticket sales, use of state-owned resources for clinics and camps, etc. Consequently, the trial court correctly ordered disclosure of the records evidencing payments of state funds to Coach Friedgen and Coach Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">We reach a different result, one contrary to that reached by the trial court, with respect to records of financial arrangements between the coaches and third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">There are, to be sure, benefits that flow from being the head football or basketball coach at an institution like UMCP. As with any employment opportunity, there are both benefits and burdens. Along with status and celebrity, these positions afford the individuals holding them with a wide array of business and financial opportunities. Often, these opportunities result in financial remuneration from third parties over and above that called for by, but nevertheless consistent with, the contract with the University. As employees of the State of Maryland, Coach Friedgen and Coach Williams share in the burden with the thousands of other state employees whose employment terms and affairs are subject to the inspection requirements of the MPIA. To date, the MPIA does not provide an exception for head coaches who work at schools with NCAA programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>While it is true that the records evidencing these third party transactions are in the appellants\u2019 possession, we must also note that these records have come to be there only by virtue of the regulations governing the relationship between the University and the NCAA. Not only does the MPIA not require the University to collect these records, no Maryland statute requires the Coaches to provide these documents. Nonetheless, balancing the public\u2019s right of access to the affairs of government and the caution against unwarranted invasions of privacy, articulated in \u00a7 10-612, as manifested in the Legislature\u2019s exemption of certain financial information from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f), we do not believe the records of the private business affairs of Coaches Friedgen and Coach Williams, including contracts with third parties, unrelated to their public employment, are required to be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The situation may be different, however, when the contract with the third party, and the income flowing therefrom, are so connected with, and related to, the coach\u2019s public employment as to be, in effect, authorized by, and thus, a part of, the University contract. Although, as articulated above, the MPIA is to be construed so as to promote disclosure of public documents, the General Assembly simply, and clearly, provided that a custodian deny \u201cthe part of a public record that contains the finances of an individual, including assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.\u201d \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f)(2). Therefore, the decision whether it is appropriate to disclose the third party contract under the MPIA is one that cannot be made in a vacuum. Rather, to determine whether disclosure is appropriate, both the University contract and the third party contract will have to be reviewed in tandem. The University contract must be reviewed to determine whether, arguably, it authorizes or contemplates the third party contract or contracts similar thereto. And the terms of the third party contract must be reviewed in order to determine whether the income derived by that contract is closely connected with, and related to, the coach\u2019s employment with the University, to determine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>in other words, whether, but for the coach\u2019s employment with the University, the third party contract would not have been made, or many of its terms included.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The NCAA by-laws require that a coach must report annually to the member institution the sources of his or her athletically related income from third parties, and thus, make the third party contracts relating to athletically related income important when discussing the University\u2019s employment contract with the coaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We have also pointed out that, under the circumstances where public employment and remuneration, subject to the MPIA, and private employment and remuneration, not subject to the MPIA, intersect, the ability to comply with the MPIA is dependent on reviewing the contracts governing both in tandem. An unwarranted disclosure of private financial information can be avoided by the review being made by the trial court <em>in camera. </em>During that <em>in camera </em>review, the court must construe the MPIA as the Legislature enacted it, and not give it a forced or strained meaning. <em>See Kolzig, </em>375 Md. at 568-569, 826 A.2d at 469-470; <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 364, 772 A.2d 1240, 1246 (2001); <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001); <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995) <em>Brown v. State, </em>285 Md. 469, 474, 403 A.2d 788, 791 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">If the court determines that Coach Williams is receiving payments from companies solely as a result of his position as coach at UMCP, and that the income is intimately connected to his activities as coach of UMCP, then that income is part of his compensation and subject to disclosure. Thus, for instance, if the third party contract requires that the members of the basketball team wear that party\u2019s shoes or clothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>during UMCP basketball games, the court may find that the financial benefit to the coach is directly related to the coach\u2019s status with the University and, therefore, order the contract pursuant to which it is paid disclosed. On the other hand, if after reviewing the contract terms, the court is convinced that the payments the coach is receiving from the third party company, although prompted by his position as an NCAA coach, and the University\u2019s coach in particular,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> are not so connected with or related to his activities as coach of UMCP as to render the contract proceeds a part of his official compensation, the contract is not subject to disclosure under the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We conclude that the records evidencing contracts and agreements, to which the University is not a party, providing income to the coaches and supplied by third parties, must be viewed by the lower court, <em>in camera, </em>in order to determine whether they are financial information within the contemplation of \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f) and, thus, are not required to be disclosed pursuant to the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND RE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>VERSED IN PART.

Maj. op. at 104-06, 847 A.2d 441-43. The salary of a public employee is paid by the State. The MPIA simply and clearly distinguishes between salary and income so that the privacy of the non-salary finances of an individual is protected against an unwarranted invasion. Balancing the public\u2019s right of access to the affairs of government against an individual\u2019s right to privacy, articulated in \u00a7 10-612, as manifested in the Legislature\u2019s exemption of certain financial information from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 617(f), I conclude that the records of the private business affairs of Coach Friedgen and Coach Williams categorically do not warrant disclosure, let alone <em>in camera </em>examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As is customary in matters of statutory interpretation, we begin by reminding ourselves of the pertinent rules of interpretation. \u201cThe goal with which we approach the interpretation of a statute or ordinance is to determine the intention of the Legislature enacting it.\u201d <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001) (citation omitted). It is well settled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgQ\">the cardinal rule is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also. Where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in that language, nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. Moreover, whenever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and formatting omitted) The language of the MPIA statute is clear and unambiguous. The plain language clearly states that \u201csalary\u201d must be disclosed and the parts of public records that contain financial information not relating to salary are excluded from inspection. \u00a7 10-617(f)(1). Merriam Webster\u2019s Ninth Collegiate Dictionary 1031 (10th Ed. 1989) defines salary as \u201cfixed compensation paid regularly for services.\u201d As regards the finances of an individual, the General Assembly provided that a custodian deny disclosure of \u201cthe part of the record that contains the finances of an individual, including assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.\u201d \u00a7 10-617(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">By enacting the MPIA, the Legislature expressly chose to exempt from disclosure public records that contain information about the personal finances of an individual, including income, that do not constitute salary paid by the State. The information that the University holds about the contracts between the coaches and third parties is financial information about income from outside sources that is not part of the coaches\u2019 salaries. Moreover, those documents are collected by the University, not as part of any requirement of State Law, but in obeisance to NCAA regulations. The Legislature has not required the inspection of public records that reflect all sources of a State employee\u2019s income \u2014 it chose not to do so. I would conclude, therefore, that the records evidencing contracts and agreements providing income to the University\u2019s coaches supplied by third parties, and to which the University is not a party, are financial information other than salary information under \u00a7 10-617(f). Thus, those documents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the information contained therein are not required to be disclosed pursuant to the MPIA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
