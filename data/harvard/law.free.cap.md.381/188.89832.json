Determining that \u201creceives\u201d means \u201cactual receipt,\u201d we conclude that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter the \u201cALJ\u201d) that the appellant must actually be receiving disability benefits to be entitled to the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction was correct, and we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which had affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"AzT\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Luella Christopher, the appellant, worked for the Library of Congress as a foreign affairs analyst until she was terminated on December 23,1994 \u201cfor reasons of disability.\u201d Christopher has challenged the Library of Congress\u2019 determination, maintaining that she is not disabled and that she should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>reinstated to her former position. Christopher has not received any disability benefits and alleges that her appeal of her termination has prevented her from recovering such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Christopher took a part-time job with General Nutrition Centers and, in 1995, also began receiving food stamps for \u201can assistance unit of one person.\u201d When Christopher first applied for food stamps with the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Social Services (hereinafter the \u201cDepartment\u201d), she received an \u201cuncapped excess shelter cost deduction\u201d of $1000.98, which, when combined with her average monthly earned income of $713.93, qualified her for food stamps.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In April 2002, the Department determined that Christopher was eligible to continue to receive food stamps, and approved her for $135 per month for a six month period. On May 18, 2002, the Department sent Christopher a notice informing her that it had changed her food stamp payment to $110, explaining that the $135 amount was incorrect because Christopher was \u201cerroneously receiving an uncapped shelter deduction based upon disability.\u201d In its notice to Christopher, the Department stated that, in order to receive the uncapped shelter cost deduction, food stamp recipients must either be at least 60 years old or be receiving disability benefits. Christopher was 57 at the time and was not receiving disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Arbitration proceedings are still pending to resolve whether Christopher was properly terminated based on her alleged disability. Christopher continues to work at General Nutri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tion Centers on a part-time basis. She does not consider herself disabled and has not received any form of disability income or pension since she first challenged the Library of Congress\u2019 determination to terminate her employment. If she is unsuccessful at arbitration, she claims she would be entitled to no less than $1,346 per month in disability benefits based on a general \u201cstatement of benefits\u201d she received from the Library of Congress before she was terminated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On August 6, 2002, Christopher requested an administrative hearing regarding the Department\u2019s decision to reduce her food stamp allotment, contending that the Department\u2019s determination \u201ccountermand[ed] the spirit of the law which is to provide certain benefits such as the uncapped shelter deduction to disabled individuals instead of denying [the] same on a technicality.\u201d A hearing was held on September 24, 2002 before Administrative Law Judge Eleanor Wilkinson, who heard testimony from Christopher and a representative from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">ALJ Wilkinson concluded that the Department correctly reduced Christopher\u2019s allotment when it determined that she was not eligible for the uncapped shelter deduction. Under COMAR 07.03.07.431(3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the ALJ explained, a food stamp recipient is entitled to the uncapped shelter cost deduction if he or she is at least 60 years old or disabled. The ALJ then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>pointed out that \u201cdisabled is defined by COMAR 07.03.07.02B(6),\u201d which defines disabled as an individual who \u201creceives\u201d or \u201cis receiving\u201d Supplemental Security Income benefits, federal or state disability benefits under the Social Security Act, disability retirement benefits, interim assistance benefits pending receipt of Supplemental Security Income, or disability-related federal medical assistance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Christopher was not receiving any of the disability benefits required by the definition of disabled found in COMAR 07.03.07.02B(6), AL J Wilkinson concluded that Christopher was not entitled to the uncapped shelter cost deduction: \u201cThere is simply no provision under governing regulations that permits an individual who is not receiving some form of disability benefit to qualify as disabled and receive the uncapped shelter deduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Christopher filed a timely petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, alleging that the Department improperly reduced her food stamp benefits. On June 9, 2003, the Circuit Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Observing that Christopher \u201cadmitted she did not qualify as an individual entitled to benefits as illustrated in [COMAR] 07.03.07.02B(6),\u201d the court determined that the ALJ properly ruled that Christopher cannot be considered \u201cdisabled\u201d for the purposes of receiving the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Christopher noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court issued, on its own initiative, a writ of certiorari, <em>Christopher v. Dept. of Health, </em>379 Md. 98, 839 A.2d 741 (2004), prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. Christopher presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">1. Whether [the Department\u2019s] decision that COMAR 07.03.17.431(3) \u2014 which permits an uncapped shelter deduction for individuals \u201creceiving\u201d federal disability benefits\u2014 precludes an uncapped deduction for [Christopher], who was deemed eligible to receive federal disability benefits but has not actually received them because the disability determination is under appeal, is arbitrary and capricious because it penalizes an individual for exercising her right to appeal and arbitrarily distinguishes between individuals who are eligible to receive disability benefits based on whether they appeal their disability determinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">2. Whether [the Department\u2019s] denial of an uncapped deduction to [Christopher] under COMAR 07.03.17.431(3) deprives her of equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because there is no rational basis for distinguishing among individuals determined to be entitled to disability benefits based on whether they appeal their disability determinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision was correct and affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We observe at the outset that Christopher conflates two different standards of review when she contends that the Department \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d because \u201cits interpretation of COMAR 07.03.17.431(3) and COMAR 07.03.17.02B(6) is arbitrary and capricious\u201d as it penalizes her \u201cfor exercising her legal right to appeal her disability determination.\u201d As we shall explain, the statutory standards allowing reviewing courts to reverse or modify agency decisions are different depending upon the agency\u2019s action. <em>See Spencer v. Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>land State Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 527-29, 846 A.2d 341, 348-49, 2004 WL 439310, at *6 (2004). Contrary to Christopher\u2019s contention, if the Department \u201cerred as a matter of law,\u201d the question is not whether the Department abused its discretion by acting \u201carbitrarily and capriciously,\u201d but whether the agency interpreted and applied the law correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Our review of administrative agency decisions made by the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, which administers state social services for Montgomery County, is governed by Section 10-203(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (hereinafter the \u201cAPA\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-203(d) of the State Government Article (1984,1999 Repl. Vol.). When we consider an administrative agency decision, we review the agency\u2019s decision applying the same statutory standards as used by the preceding reviewing court. <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. 515, 523-25, 846 A.2d 341, 345-47, 2004 WL 439310, at *4; <em>Watkins v. Dept. of Public Safety and Corr. Services, </em>377 Md. 34, 46, 831 A.2d 1079, 1086 (2003); <em>Maryland Div. of Labor and Industry v. Triangle General Contractors, Inc., </em>366 Md. 407, 416, 784 A.2d 534, 539 (2001); <em>Gigeous v. Eastern Correctional Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495-96, 769 A.2d 912, 921 (2001) (citing <em>Public Serv. Com\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691, 694-95 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The statutory standards allowing reviewing courts to reverse or modify agency decisions are found in Section 10-222(h)(3) of the APA. Under the provision, agency decisions may be reversed or modified if the court concludes that an agency finding, conclusion, or decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah7\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">As we explained in <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. 515, 527-29, 846 A.2d 341, 348-49, 2004 WL 439310, at *6, the six standards may be grouped into three categories: conclusions of law, findings of fact, or discretionary action. <em>See also Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 118, 771 A.2d 1051, 1057 (2001)(explaining that \u201cthe issue for the reviewing court is whether the administrative agency committed an error of law, or whether its decision is supported by substantial evidence, or is \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 \u201d). The first four standards apply when an agency makes a \u201cconclusion of law.\u201d The fifth standard applies when an agency makes a finding of fact. The sixth standard applies when an agency acts in its \u201cdiscretionary capacity.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. 515, 527-29, 846 A.2d 341, 348-49, 2004 WL 439310, at *6; <em>see also Maryland Transp. Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002) (discussing the arbitrary and capricious standard). The tests differ for each category.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Determining whether an agency\u2019s \u201cconclusions of law\u201d are correct is always, on judicial review, the court\u2019s prerogative, although we ordinarily respect the agency\u2019s expertise and give weight to its interpretation of a statute that it administers. <em>Watkins, </em>377 Md. at 46, 831 A.2d at 1086 (quoting <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985)); see <em>also Total Audio-Visual Sys., Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, </em>360 Md. 387, 394, 758 A.2d 124, 127-28 (2000). Of course, even though an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is often persuasive, \u201cthe reviewing court must apply the law as it understands it to be.\u201d <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City v. Chase </em>Assocs., 306 Md. 568, 574, 510 A.2d 568, 571 (1986). Nevertheless, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">With respect to an agency\u2019s findings of fact, a reviewing court applies the substantial evidence test, determining \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 729 A.2d at 380 (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978)). Again, the reviewing court generally defers to the agency, appraising its fact-finding and subsequent inferences from that fact-finding, if supported by the record, in a light most favorable to the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 729 A.2d at 381 (citing <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Finally, the court applies the arbitrary and capricious standard when it reviews an agency\u2019s discretionary functions. As we observed in <em>Spencer, </em>when an agency acts in its discretionary capacity, it is taking actions that are specific to its mandate and expertise and, unlike conclusions of law or findings of fact, have a non-judicial nature. For this reason, we \u201cowe a higher level of deference to functions specifically committed to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. 515, 529-31, 846 A.2d 341, 349-50, 2004 WL 439310, at *7. \u201c[A]s long as an administrative agency\u2019s exercise of discretion does not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process and other constitutional requirements, it is ordinarily unreviewable by the courts.\u201d <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557, 625 A.2d 914, 922 (1993). Courts thus generally only intervene when an agency exercises its discretion \u201carbitrarily\u201d or \u201ccapriciously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 625 A.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The basis of Christopher\u2019s argument rests on her assumption that, had she not appealed the Library of Congress\u2019s termination of her employment \u201cfor reasons of disability,\u201d she would be eligible to receive disability benefits and, consequently, would be deemed \u201cdisabled\u201d for the purposes of receiving the entire or \u201cuncapped\u201d excess shelter cost deduction as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>opposed to the limited or \u201ccapped\u201d deduction. We shall assume, for the sake of this discussion, that the fact-finder had a basis for concluding that Christopher, indeed, would have been entitled to disability benefits had she not taken her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Claiming, thus, that she forfeited disability benefits she would have received otherwise in order to appeal her employer\u2019s termination decision, Christopher goes on to maintain that the Department \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d for two reasons when it denied her the \u201cuncapped\u201d excess shelter cost deduction. According to Christopher, the Department\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of COMAR 07.03.17.43I(3) and 07.03.17.02B(6) is arbitrary and capricious ... because it penalizes Christopher for exercising her legal right to appeal her disability determination .... [and] impermissibly distinguishes between individuals who have been determined to be disabled based on whether the individual has appealed that decision....\u201d Christopher thus urges that she should be \u201cdeemed to be constructively receiving disability benefits\u201d under the relevant COMAR regulations. Furthermore, in Christopher\u2019s view, \u201cconstructive receipt means that [she] is \u2018receiving\u2019 benefits for purposes of the statute and regulation, but the <em>amount </em>of the benefits actually received is zero due to [her appeal of the Library of Congress\u2019 disability determination].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Christopher also contends that the Department deprived \u201cher of equal protection of the laws under both the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because a distinction between individuals who have been determined to be disabled, based on whether the individual has appealed that decision, is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest.\u201d She maintains that \u201cthere is no rational government interest inherent in placing an individual who has been determined to be disabled, and therefore lost job and compensation, in a position of where that individual must forego the right to appeal that determination or otherwise receive lower food stamp assistance than other disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>individuals who choose not to appeal their disability determinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The State argues that the ALJ correctly found that Christopher was not entitled to the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction because she is not \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined by state and federal law. According to the State, under COMAR 07.03.17.02B(6), the definition of disabled for the purposes of the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction turns on whether the individual actually receives a disability benefit. Moreover, in the State\u2019s view, there is no \u201ccatch-all definition of \u2018disabled\u2019 that would permit an individual who receives no type of compensation for a disability but whom an employer has terminated on the basis of a disability to be considered a \u2018disabled\u2019 household member.\u201d Because the ALJ \u201cadhered to the plain meaning of the words defining disabled,\u201d the State maintains that the ALJ cannot be considered to have acted arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The State also contests Christopher\u2019s argument that, by appealing her termination from the Library of Congress, she receives a smaller food stamp benefit than if she had declined to appeal. The State disputes Christopher\u2019s claim that she is constructively entitled to \u201czero\u201d benefits while her employment matter is on appeal. It argues instead that, if Christopher were to be awarded disability benefits of $1,346 per month, and if she were to receive such, the benefits would count as income \u201cwhich would have only been partially offset by the uncapped shelter deduction.\u201d As such, according the State, the amount of food stamps Christopher would be entitled to receive would decrease to approximately $71.00 per month. The State thus rejects Christopher\u2019s argument that she is penalized for appealing her disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Finally, the State maintains that the equal protection guarantees under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution are not violated by the requirement that individuals receive disability benefits in order to be.considered disabled for the purposes of the uncapped excess shelter cost deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion. The definition of \u201cdisabled\u201d required for the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction, in the State\u2019s view, is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in treating those who receive disability income differently than those who do not for the purpose of calculating food stamp benefits. As the State explains it, because additional income ordinarily reduces an individual\u2019s food stamp allotment, the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction is a means of \u201coffsetting\u201d or \u201cmitigat[ing] the negative effect of that income\u201d when the income is disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">A. The ALJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"A7a\">1. The Food Stamp Program</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011, <em>et. seq., </em>is a state administered program funded by the federal government to provide low-income individuals with \u201can opportunity to obtain a more nutritious diet.\u201d 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2013(a) (West 1999); <em>see West v. Bowen, </em>879 F.2d 1122, 1124 (3d Cir.1989). \u201cThe Secretary of Agriculture prescribes the standards for eligibility for food stamps, but state agencies are authorized to make individual eligibility determinations and to distribute the food stamps to eligible households, which may use them to purchase food from approved, retail food stores.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Parker, </em>472 U.S. 115, 117, 105 S.Ct. 2520, 2523, 86 L.Ed.2d 81, 85 (1985) (footnote omitted); <em>see </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2014(b) (West Supp.2003). In order to participate in the Food Stamp Program, states must comply with the Food Stamp Act and the Secretary\u2019s regulations. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2020(a), 2025 (West 1999). Maryland law requires the Department to implement the program in conformity with federal and state law and regulations. Maryland Code, Art. 88A, \u00a7 13A(e) (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol.)(stating that \u201cthe administration of State programs by Montgomery County shall ... be governed by State and federal regulations\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Eligibility for food stamps is largely determined by a household\u2019s income. Section 2014(a) of the Food Stamp Act provides: \u201cParticipation in the food stamp program shall be limited to those households whose incomes and other financial resources, held singly or in joint ownership, are determined to be a substantial limiting factor in permitting them to obtain a more nutritious diet.\u201d <em>See also Knebel v. Hein, </em>429 U.S. 288, 289, 97 S.Ct. 549, 551, 50 L.Ed.2d 485, 488 (1977). As a general rule, the recipient\u2019s food stamp allotment decreases when his or her income increases. <em>See West, </em>879 F.2d at 1124. Although \u201c[hjousehold income for purposes of the food stamp program shall include <em>all income from whatever source,\u201d see </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2014(d) (West Supp.2003)(emphasis added), certain exclusions (regarding incoming revenue) and deductions (regarding expenses) apply. For example, federal energy assistance payments may be \u201cexcluded\u201d from the income calculation. <em>See West v. Sullivan, </em>973 F.2d 179, 181 (3d Cir.1992). Benefits, such as social security disability benefits, are not \u201cexcluded\u201d under the program, however, and thus ordinarily constitute income.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Stevens v.

The ALJ\u2019s Conclusion of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In defining whether receiving disability means actual receipt in COMAR 07.03.17.02B(6), we begin the analysis by noting that the principles governing our interpretation of a statute apply when we interpret an agency rule or regulation. <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 592-93, 457 A.2d 1146, 1149-50 (1983); <em>Carnage Hill Cabin John, Inc. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>125 Md.App. 183, 248-249, 724 A.2d 745, 778 (1999). As we have said many times, a statute\u2019s plain language \u201cis itself the best evidence of its own meaning.\u201d <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>360 Md. at 395, 758 A.2d at 128. \u201c[W]hen the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.\u201d <em>Drew v. First Guar. Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003). We, of course, read statutory language within the context of the statutory scheme, and thus our approach is a \u201ccommonsensical\u201d one designed to effectuate the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327-28, 842 A.2d at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Under COMAR 07.03.17.02B(6), aside from the provisions relating to veterans, a food stamp applicant may be considered disabled in five different ways, all of which depend on whether the applicant \u201cis receiving\u201d or \u201creceives\u201d benefits. The Meriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201creceive\u201d as \u201cto come into the possession of: acquire.\u201d Meriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 975 (10th ed. 1995). Similarly, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201creceipt\u201d as \u201cthe act of receiving something.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1274 (7th ed. 1999). In both definitions, \u201creceives\u201d unambiguously means the actual possession of something. We, therefore, conclude that a plain reading of COMAR 07.03.17.02B reveals that, unless the individual is a veteran, the definition of \u201cdisabled\u201d for the purposes of the food stamp program requires the individual to <em>receive </em>some kind of disability-related benefit. <em>See </em>1 Americans With Disabilities Practice &amp; Compliance Manual \u00a7 1:177 (2003)(explaining that a disabled member of a household is defined as someone who has been awarded and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ceives disability payments); <em>see also Burnett v. Heckler, 756 </em>F.2d 621, 628 n. 4 (8th Cir.1985)(noting that, in the context of Supplemental Security Income payments, \u201c[u]nearned income like disability benefits is considered \u2018income\u2019 for SSI purposes ... but cannot be counted until actually received\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In a case similar to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has read the term \u201creceives\u201d in Section 2012(r) of the Food Stamp Act as actual receipt. <em>West, </em>879 F.2d at 1126-27. In <em>West, </em>a woman applied for food stamps and Social Security disability benefits at the same time. <em>Id. </em>at 1124-25. Her food stamp application was held until the Social Security Administration determined that she was entitled to disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>Two years passed until the Social Security Administration deemed that she was entitled to disability benefits, and the woman claimed she was entitled to the two years of food stamp payments she did not receive during this interim period. <em>Id. </em>at 1125. The court disagreed, concluding that \u201creceives\u201d means \u201cactual receipt\u201d under Section 2012(r)(2), and the woman could not receive back payments of food stamps because she had not actually \u201creceived\u201d her disability benefits during the two-year period. <em>Id. </em>at 1126-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Our sister court in Iowa also has interpreted the term \u201cdisabled\u201d for the purposes of the Food Stamp Program as requiring the actual receipt of benefits. In <em>Lundy v. Iowa Dept. of Human Services, </em>389 N.W.2d 392, 393 (Iowa 1986), Lundy\u2019s household, which was receiving food stamps, became ineligible for food stamps because he acquired a new truck that exceeded in value the household\u2019s \u201cmaximum resource level.\u201d Lundy argued that he needed the new truck because of his disability, and that the value of the vehicle should be excluded, pursuant to federal regulations, from his household\u2019s assets because the truck \u201cwas necessary to transport a \u2018physically disabled household member.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. After examining the definition of disabled in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.2, which is derived from Section 2012(r)(2), the Iowa Supreme Court determined that Lundy was not disabled for the purposes of the Food Stamp Program because, even though he had applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>for disability benefits, he did not receive them: \u201c[Section 271.2] defines a \u201cdisabled member\u201d as an individual receiving social security disability benefits. However, Lundy does not meet these criteria because at the time of the administrative proceedings Lundy has filed for, but not yet received, social security disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that \u201cdisabled\u201d for the purposes of the Food Stamp Program plainly turns on the receipt of disability benefits, Christopher argues that she should be deemed to have \u201cconstructively received\u201d disability benefits because her appeal has prevented her from receiving the disability benefits she <em>might </em>otherwise be entitled to. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">If we accepted Christopher\u2019s argument, we would be expanding the definition of disabled beyond the confines of a state regulation that is derived from federal law. States must adhere to federal standards when implementing food stamp programs. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2014. Not only are \u201c[s]tate or local policies or practice inconsistent with federal statutes or regulations ... invalid,\u201d <em>Harrington v. Blum, </em>483 F.Supp. 1015, 1019 (S.D.N.Y.1979), but states may be financially liable for noncompliance. <em>See </em>7 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 276.1-276.7 (establishing state agency liabilities for not complying with federal guidelines). A state agency that fails to comply with federal law and regulations \u201cmay result in [the Federal Nutrition Service] seeking injunctive relief to compel compliance and/or a suspension or disallowance of the Federal share of the State agency\u2019s administrative funds.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 276.1(a)(4). Section 276.2 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides, among other things, that \u201c[s]tate agencies shall be strictly liable for ... [t]he value of coupons overissued and coupons issued without authorization.... \u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 276.2(b)(1)(iii); <em>see Pennsylvania v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 334, 338 (3d Cir.l986)(stating that states are hable for issuance errors resulting in financial loss, which includes errors where individuals receive benefits to which they are not entitled). Given that States must comply with federal guidelines and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>risk financial penalty by not doing so, we are not inclined to impose \u201cconstructive receipt\u201d onto the Maryland regulation, which must conform with federal law, when there is no federal (or state, for that matter) precedent for reading \u201creceives\u201d constructively in this context.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u201cConstructive receipt\u201d also contravenes the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy\u201d of the Food Stamp Program as it has been established in federal law. <em>See Knebel, </em>429 U.S. at 289, 97 S.Ct. at 551, 50 L.Ed.2d at 488; <em>West, </em>879 F.2d at 1124. As we explained <em>supra, </em>the Food Stamp Program\u2019s overall purpose is to assist individuals with limited financial resources. Eligibility for food stamps, logically enough, depends upon a household\u2019s net income, a quantifiable, bottom-line amount. <em>See </em>COMAR 07.03.17.43 (outlining how net monthly income is calculated under the Food Stamp Program). Factoring \u201cconstructive benefits\u201d into that amount as Christopher urges, however, would create a net income that is inaccurate. It would not reflect the household\u2019s actual financial status, thus defeating the program\u2019s purpose to distribute food stamps based on a household\u2019s actual financial need.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Christopher\u2019s contention that she should be deemed to be constructively receiving \u201czero\u201d benefits does not change our view. If the program\u2019s purpose is to distribute food stamps based on income, then it is income, indeed, that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>calculated: \u201czero\u201d constructive benefits does not change Christopher\u2019s net income for the purposes of the Food Stamp Program in any way. Piling legal fiction (constructive benefits) upon legal fiction (constructive benefits of \u201czero\u201d) only obfuscates the program\u2019s goal of calculating income as accurately as possible in order to distribute the appropriate allotment of food stamps based upon the individual\u2019s financial need. We cannot accept such an approach.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">For the above reasons, we reject Christopher\u2019s contention that she is \u201cconstructively receiving zero benefits.\u201d Therefore, the ALJ did not err as a matter of law when she determined that \u201creceives\u201d means \u201cactual receipt\u201d for the purposes of the disability requirement for the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">3. Arbitrary and Capricious</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">As we explained <em>supra, </em>\u201c[w]hen the agency is acting in a fact-finding or quasi-judicial capacity, we review its deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>sion to determine \u201cwhether the contested decision was rendered in an illegal, arbitrary, capricious, oppressive or fraudulent manner.\u201d \u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>356 Md. 180, 185, 738 A.2d 856, 858 (1999). According to Christopher, the ALJ acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d because she refused to recognize that Christopher was disabled for the purposes of the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction. Christopher also maintains that the ALJ \u201cpenalized\u201d her for exercising her right to appeal the Library of Congress\u2019 decision to terminate her \u201cfor reasons of disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">With respect to Christopher\u2019s contention that the ALJ improperly failed to deem her disabled based on her termination status from the Library of Congress, we conclude, based on our decision that \u201creceives\u201d means \u201cactual receipt,\u201d that the ALJ did not abuse her discretion when she found that Christopher was disabled because she did not have the discretion to conclude otherwise in the first place. As we explained in <em>Spencer, </em>\u201c[w]hether an action is in fact deemed arbitrary or capricious will vary depending upon the amount of discretion granted an agency, a matter of substantive law.\u201d 380 Md. 515, 531-33, 846 A.2d 341, 350-52, 2004 WL 439310, at *8. Here, regarding the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction, the ALJ had no discretion as a matter of substantive law because \u201cdisabled\u201d so clearly turns on whether the applicant receives certain disability benefits. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has noted, the definition of disabled found in Section 2012(r)(2) of the Food Stamp Act \u201crequires no discretion or judgment of officials in [a] food stamp program.\u201d <em>Huberman, </em>884 F.2d at 66 (involving a case where the effective date of the uncapped shelter cost deduction was at issue). The disability determination under the Food Stamp Act, thus, is a straightforward one: either an individual receives disability benefits or he/she does not. The ALJ did not act arbitrarily or capriciously because she applied the regulation to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>With respect to Christopher\u2019s argument that she has been \u201cpenalized\u201d for taking an appeal, Christopher seems to suggest that she has been singled out, in an arbitrary and capricious manner, because she chose to appeal. She provides no factual support for her assertion; rather, she seems to base her argument on the fact that, because her appeal allegedly places her disability status in question, she has been penalized unfairly by the ALJ. We do not accept Christopher\u2019s logic. There is no evidence in the record that the ALJ treated Christopher any differently from any other applicant claiming to be disabled, acted inconsistently, or deviated from prior policies relating to disability determinations under the Food Stamp Program. <em>See Montgomery County v. Anastasi, </em>77 Md.App. 126, 137, 549 A.2d 753, 758 (1988)(stating that, in the context of an agency\u2019s change in promotion procedures, \u201c[a]n agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored, and if any agency glosses over or swerves from prior precedents without discussion it may cross the line from tolerably terse to intolerably mute\u201d). Christopher\u2019s arbitrary and capricious claim thus fails in this regard as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">B. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Christopher argues that the Department\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of COMAR 07.03.17.431(3) so as to deny an uncapped shelter deduction to Christopher and individuals similarly situated\u201d violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Acknowledging that Christopher is not in a protected class requiring strict scruti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ny, Christopher claims that the Department has \u201cno rational government interest\u201d in distinguishing between individuals receiving disability benefits and those who do not when determining whether an individual is disabled under the Food Stamp Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Christopher asserts that she is not mounting a \u201cfacial challenge\u201d to the regulation, and she conceded at oral argument that, if we were to determine that \u201creceives\u201d requires \u201cactual receipt,\u201d her equal protection argument based on the Department\u2019s application or \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the regulation automatically would fail. In other words, if \u201creceipt\u201d requires actual receipt, the regulation cannot be said to have been <em>applied </em>to her unconstitutionally because we will have concluded that she does not fall within its ambit in the first place.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Bruce v. Director, Dept. of Chesapeake Bay </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Affairs, </em>261 Md. 585, 600, 276 A.2d 200, 208 (1971)(stating that \u201cwe are mindful that if a law is applied and administered by-public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand so as to make unjust discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, such denial of equal justice is within the prohibition of the Constitution\u201d)(internal quotations omitted). Because we have concluded that receives means actual receipt, Christopher, as was pointed out in oral argument, is thus left with a facial challenge to the regulation and would have to argue that it, as written, violates the Equal Protection Clause, something she declined to do. We, therefore, need not consider this issue, as we \u201cadhere[] to the established principle that a court will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u201d <em>Murrell v.

We observe that courts have recognized \"constructive dividends\u201d in the federal income tax context when some kind of economic benefit is conferred. 10 Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 38B:44 (2004). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained, \"[i]n determining whether a constructive dividend has been made, '(t)he crucial concept ... is that the corporation <em>conferred an economic benefit </em>on the stockholder without expectation of repayment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ireland v. United States, </em>621 F.2d 731, 735 (5th Cir.1980) (emphasis added). Examples of conferred economic benefits include a taxpayer's use of a company car for personal purposes, use of a boat purchased by a company and used for personal purposes, and use of a residence furnished by the corporation. <em>Id. </em>In other words, before a court recognizes a \"constructive dividend,\u201d the taxpayer must have <em>received </em>some kind of economic benefit amounting to a value more than zero. We, thus, are unable to accept that Christopher has \u201cconstructively received zero\u201d when there is no indication that she has received anything, economic or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">. Indeed, the administrative problems that certainly would follow if we adopted Christopher's view reveals why the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction turns on the receipt of disability benefits rather than their \"constructive\u201d receipt. Determining \"constructive receipt\" would place the Department in the position of evaluating on a case-by-base basis whether an applicant is likely to receive disability benefits, an evaluation that would consist of the Department predicting, based on its own estimation of an applicant's disability, whether or not an applicant <em>might </em>receive disability benefits. Because the Social Security Administration requires an interview and medical documentation, among other things, from the individual applying for disability benefits, and also issues a tome entitled <em>Disability Evaluation Under Social Security </em>that lists the medical criteria it uses to determine disability, we do not believe this would be a simple task. Nor is there any indication that it is within the Department\u2019s scope of responsibility or expertise to evaluate disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Furthermore, we observe that, under the approach Christopher advocates, every food stamp applicant and recipient waiting to be deemed eligible for disability benefits potentially could be entitled to the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction. Some of those disability applicants inevitably will be denied disability benefits, yet they will have received nevertheless a deduction for the interim period for which they applied. We, thus, are able to see, for this reason as well, why the Food Stamp Program requires actual receipt of disability benefits in order to avoid such an administrative quagmire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">. Section I of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the following guarantee: \u201cNo State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d \u201cAlthough Article 24 [of the Maryland Declaration of Rights] does not contain an express equal protection clause, the concept of equal protection nevertheless is embodied in the Article.\" <em>Frankel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Maryland System, </em>361 Md. 298, 312-13, 761 A.2d 324, 332 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\">. Regarding Christopher\u2019s argument that the uncapped shelter cost deduction, which turns on the receipt of disability benefits, \"penalizes\u201d her for exercising her appeal of her termination, we believe that <em>Lyng v. Int\u2019l Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of America, UAW, </em>485 U.S. 360, 108 S.Ct. 1184, 99 L.Ed.2d 380 (1988) is analogous. In <em>Lyng, </em>union members argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that a provision under the Food Stamp Act prohibiting households from becoming eligible for food stamps during the time when any member of the household is on strike violated the equal protection <em>component </em>of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 108 S.Ct. at 1188, 99 L.Ed.2d at 387. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that it had \"little trouble in concluding that [the provision] is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of avoiding undue favoritism to one side or the other in private labor disputes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 108 S.Ct. at 1192, 99 L.Ed.2d at 392. The Court acknowledged that the provision \u201dwork[ed] at least some discrimination\u201d against strikers as compared to \"voluntary quitters,\u201d but explained that, under the rational basis test, \"even if the statute provides only rough justice, its treatment ... is far from irrational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371-72, 108 S.Ct. at 1192-93, 99 L.Ed.2d at 392 (quoting <em>Ohio Bureau of Employment Services v. Hodory, </em>431 U.S. 471, 97 S.Ct. 1898, 52 L.Ed.2d 513 (1977))(internal quotations omitted). In short, although the food stamp policy may have negatively affected strikers, the Court nevertheless declined to find that strikers were entitled to food stamps on the basis that the provision \"penalized\u201d them, to use Christopher\u2019s words, for exercising their right to strike. We believe the same rationale applies here and hold that Christopher\u2019s equal protection rights were not violated because she is arguably \"penalized\u201d by the Food Stamp Program for exercising her right to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
