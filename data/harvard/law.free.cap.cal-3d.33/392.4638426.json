(a); see present \u00a7 23152) and for resisting, delaying or obstructing an officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148). Just prior to her arrest, one of her tires blew out, causing her momentarily to lose control of her car, although the vehicle did not collide with any other object, and no injuries were sustained. Plaintiff\u2019s apparent erratic driving was reported to the police and upon arriving at the scene the arresting officer directed plaintiff to perform various sobriety tests. (Plaintiff admitted that she had consumed two beers earlier in the day.) The officer\u2019s evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s performance of these tests, as poor or failing, was contradicted by plaintiff and two independent witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The original charges against plaintiff were dismissed after she pleaded guilty to one count of reckless driving. (\u00a7 23103.) Soon thereafter, plaintiff received notice that her driver\u2019s license would be suspended for six months, effective June 19, 1980, for an alleged violation of section 13353. After a formal hearing the DMV found that (1) the arresting officer had reasonable cause to believe that plaintiff had been driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, (2) she was lawfully arrested, (3) at the scene of the arrest she was properly advised that her driving privileges would be suspended if she refused to submit to a blood alcohol test and (4) she failed to submit to any of the prescribed tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court seeking judicial review of the DMV\u2019s decision on the ground that the DMV\u2019s findings were not supported by the evidence presented at the hearing. The trial court issued an alternative writ of mandate, set a hearing date and stayed enforcement of the license revocation pending a ruling on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The trial court thereafter rejected petitioner\u2019s request that the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard of review be applied and, using the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, found that the administrative findings and decision were properly supported and denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff challenges (1) the sufficiency of the evidence presented to support the DMV\u2019s decision and (2) the trial court\u2019s decision to apply the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, instead of the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (c), provides: \u201cWhere it is claimed that the findings are not supported by the evidence, in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence; and in all other cases, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We have added our own judicial amplification to these statutory principles.  If the decision of an administrative agency will substantially affect a \u201cfundamental vested right,\u201d then the trial court must not only examine the administrative record for errors of law, but also must exercise its independent judgment upon the evidence. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 130, 143.)  When the administrative decision neither involves nor substantially affects such a right, then the trial court must review the whole administrative record to determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the agency committed any errors of law. <em>{Bixby, supra, </em>at p. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Subsequently in <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 34 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29], referring to <em>Bixby, </em>\u201cwe explained the considerations which counsel in favor of fuller judicial review in cases involving vested, fundamental rights. The essence to be distilled is this: When an administrative decision affects a right which has been <em>legitimately acquired </em>or is otherwise \u2018vested,\u2019 and when that right is of a fundamental nature from the standpoint of its economic aspect or its \u2018effect... in human terms and the importance ... to the individual in the life situation, \u2019 then a full and independent <em>judicial </em>review of that decision is indicated because \u2018[t]he abrogation of the right is too important to the individual to relegate it to exclusive administrative extinction.\u2019 <em>([Bixby] </em>at p. 144.)\u201d (First italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Within the foregoing guidelines, where lies the \u201cright\u201d to drive an automobile?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The term \u201cvested\u201d denotes a right that is either \u201calready possessed\u201d <em>(Bixby, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 146) or \u201clegitimately acquired\u201d <em>(Strumsky, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 34). Business or professional licensing cases have distinguished between the denial of an application for a license (nonvested right) and the suspension or revocation of an existing license (vested right)'. (See, e.g., <em>Frink </em>v. <em>Prod </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 166, 175 [181 Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476].) Once an agency has exercised its expertise and issued a license, the agency\u2019s subsequent revocation of that license generally calls for an independent review of the facts, because the revocation or suspension affects a vested right. (Ibid.; <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 731, 735 [129 Cal.Rptr. 298, 548 P.2d 698]; <em>Bixby, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Whether or not retention of a driver\u2019s license once issued constitutes a \u201cfundamental\u201d right, it uniformly has been held to be \u201cvested.\u201d (See <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 70, 83 [177 Cal.Rptr. 566, 634 P.2d 917]; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 354, 357, fn. 1 [165 Cal.Rptr. 626]; <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 293, 298, fn. 3 [160 Cal.Rptr. 557]; <em>McConville </em>v. <em>Alexis </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 593, 599 [159 Cal.Rptr. 49]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 12, 15, fn. 3 [158 Cal.Rptr. 506]; <em>McGue </em>v. <em>Sillas </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 799, 804 [147 Cal.Rptr. 354]; <em>James </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 750, 754 [73 Cal.Rptr. 452].)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Is the right to retain a driver\u2019s license a \u201cfundamental\u201d right, in the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>context? The appellate courts have reached differing conclusions on this point. (Cf. <em>McGue </em>v. <em>Sillas, </em>and <em>McConville </em>v. <em>Alexis, </em>both <em>supra.) </em>Recently, in <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 70 [177 Cal.Rptr. 566, 634 P.2d 917], we suggested the answer. We there considered a claim that the right to drive is a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d under the California Constitution, requiring \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review for purposes of substantive due process analysis. Rejecting that contention, we concluded, \u201cWe may assume without deciding that the loss of a driver\u2019s license does implicate interests sufficiently important to \u2018the individual in the life situation\u2019 to warrant <em>independent review of a quasi-judicial administrative decision </em>suspending or terminating such right. It does not follow, however, that legislative measures regulating or limiting the possession of a driver\u2019s license are subject to strict judicial scrutiny.\u201d (P. 83.) We then stressed an important distinction. \u201cAs both <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky </em>explain, the standard of review question with which those cases deal relates to the appropriate relationship between <em>administrative </em>and <em>judicial </em>adjudicatory decisions, and does not concern the constitutional legitimacy or validity of legislative policy judgments at all. Thus, under <em>Bixby-Strumsky, </em>the \u2018fundamental right\u2019 category does not identify areas in which substantive legislative judgments are in any manner constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>suspect or justify unusual judicial scrutiny; rather, that category simply encompasses those quasi-judicial administrative decisions that have \u2018an impact on the individual \u201csufficiently vital ... to compel a full and independent review\u201d by the court. \u2019 <em>(Interstate Brands </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 770, 779 [163 Cal.Rptr. 619, 608 P.2d 707].) [f] Indeed, even a cursory review of the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>line of decisions makes it abundantly clear that the applicability of the independent judgment standard of review does not in any sense suggest that legislative measures pertaining to the individual interest at issue are properly subject to strict scrutiny review.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We reaffirm the foregoing distinction and emphasize that we view the \u201cright to drive\u201d herein as important, indeed \u201cfundamental\u201d for purposes of selecting the standard of judicial review of the administrative decision to suspend the driver\u2019s license. However, we expressly do not thereby invoke strict scrutiny review of the legislative enactment of section 13353 itself, and caution against any blurring of two separate and distinct senses in which the term \u201cfundamental\u201d is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">There is little similarity between the analysis applied in determining (1) whether a right is a \u201cfundamental right\u201d for equal protection/due process purposes on the one hand, and (2) which scrutiny is applicable for administrative review purposes, on the other. The principle of \u201cfundamentality\u201d differs depending on the context or analysis within which the concept arises. Thus, for example, when determining which rights are \u201cfundamental\u201d for due process purposes, a court\u2019s attention focuses primarily on whether the right (1) is specifically guaranteed by the Constitution, (2) affects the integrity of the political process, or (3) has a disproportionate impact upon a discrete and insular minority. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Carotene Products Co. </em>(1938) 304 U.S. 144, 152-153, fn. 4 [82 L.Ed. 1234, 1241, 1242, 58 S.Ct. 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Obviously, the foregoing <em>Carotene Products </em>test bears little relation to the standard used when determining which rights are \u201cfundamental\u201d under the <em>Bixby </em>rule for administrative review purposes. In this latter situation, we examine a right or interest to see if it is important enough \u201cto individuals in their life situations\u201d to require an independent judicial review of the evidence. We are here more concerned with the personal nature of the interest than with its constitutional basis or its specific impact on a particular segment of society. These interests and rights do not need to be \u201cfundamental\u201d in the <em>Carotene Products </em>sense in order to invoke judicial protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Thus, the fact that retention of a driver\u2019s license does not rise to the level of a fundamental right for purposes of discussing due process or equal protection of the law is not conclusive in the resolution of the present case. As a practical matter, continued retention of her driver\u2019s license clearly is of substantial im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>portance to plaintiff herein, in her own life situation. As the court said in <em>McConville </em>v. <em>Alexis, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at page 600 \u201cthere can be little question but that possession of a driver\u2019s license rises to the level of a fundamental right under <em>Bixby </em>in terms of both the economic implications relating thereto and \u2018the importance of the possession \u2018to the individual in the life situation.\u2019 <em>(Bixby, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 130, 144.) This, of course, is most obviously true with respect to those individuals whose occupations depend directly on the ability to drive, such as truck drivers or delivery persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In our present travel-oriented society, the retention of a driver\u2019s license is an important right to every person who has obtained such a license. (See <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 70, 74.) While we might agree with defendant\u2019s observation that there exist alternative means of transportation, the reality of contemporary society is that public transportation systems may not meet the needs of many travelers and other forms of transportation, such as taxicabs, are not economically feasible for a large portion of the population.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Whether a driver\u2019s license is required only for delivering bread, commuting to work, transporting children or the elderly, meeting medical appointments, attending social or political functions, or any combination of these or other purposes, the revocation or suspension of that license, even for a six-month period, can and often does constitute a severe personal and economic hardship. (See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 535, 539 [29 L.Ed.2d 90, 94, 91 S.Ct. 1586] [as continued possession of a license <em>may become </em>essential in the pursuit of a livelihood, any adjudication would involve an \u201cimportant\u201d interest of the licensee].)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">For plaintiff, as a route driver, her ability to drive a delivery truck affects her very livelihood and the suspension of her license obviously will affect her directly, immediately, and adversely. Further, as a single working parent, she is faced with the numerous responsibilities of child rearing, many of which necessitate a speedy and reliable means of transportation. The suspension of plaintiff\u2019s license, even for only six months, may have profound and obvious effects on her \u201clife situation\u201d and thus, in the <em>Bixby-Strumsky-Interstate Brands </em>sense, constitutes \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d administrative decisions that have an impact on the individual \u201csufficiently vital ... to compel full and independent review\u201d by the court. <em>(Interstate Brands, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">A driver\u2019s license is a fundamental right for the purpose of selecting the standard of judicial review of an administrative decision to suspend or revoke such license. In the matter before us, suspension of plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s license may be entirely appropriate, but it should be ordered only after the administrative record receives that \u201cindependent judgment review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In view of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to reach plaintiff\u2019s additional contentions on appeal. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Bird, C.
