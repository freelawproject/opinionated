Shalant, who was admitted to the bar in 1967, be suspended from the practice of law for 90 days, and that such suspension be stayed on conditions of probation which include passing the Professional Responsibility Examination within 1 year from the effective date of our order. As will appear, we have concluded that a public reproval is sufficient discipline for the misconduct at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Fran S. engaged petitioner to represent her in a personal injury action commenced by her previous attorney, Sidney Shiffman. Petitioner agreed to pay Shiffman\u2019s fee out of petitioner\u2019s share of any recovery in the action. Petitioner also represented to Shiffman that they would mutually agree upon the amount of Shiffman\u2019s fee before petitioner withdrew any fees from his client\u2019s trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Petitioner settled client S.\u2019s case for $10,000 and disbursed to S. her agreed percentage of the proceeds. Petitioner then, unilaterally, determined Shiffman\u2019s fair fee to be $200 and forwarded to him a check in that amount. Petitioner then withdrew all remaining funds from the trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Shiffman rejected petitioner\u2019s tender of $200 and, refusing an offer to arbitrate, sued petitioner <em>and </em>client S., seeking $910 for his services. Although petitioner remained in contact with S., and was served with process in Shiffman\u2019s suit, he said nothing to S. regarding the suit, and she remained unaware of it until she was personally served a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On being served, client S. called petitioner\u2019s office. After he failed to reply promptly, she retained other counsel to defend her in Shiffman\u2019s action in which she then filed a cross-complaint against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">During this same period, petitioner was representing S.\u2019s father, K. In the course of a discussion about another matter, petitioner mentioned to K. that Shiffman\u2019s suit and S.\u2019s cross-complaint might be resolved if S. were willing to discuss these matters with petitioner. He then asked K. to suggest such a meeting to his daughter. K. did so, but S., being then represented by other counsel, declined to talk with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">After conducting hearings on S.\u2019s complaint, the State Bar hearing panel found that petitioner breached his fiduciary duty to communicate with a client (see <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 973, 978 [126 Cal.Rptr. 801, 544 P.2d 937]), and wilfully, though indirectly, communicated with a party without permission of her counsel in violation of rule 7-103, Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar. The hearing panel recommended that petitioner be privately reproved, on condition that he first pass the Professional Responsibility Examination. The review department added a finding that petitioner had violated rule 8-101 (improper withdrawal of disputed funds from trust account), and recommended a 90-day probationary suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">1. <em>Failure to Communicate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">It is reasonable to conclude that an attorney has a duty promptly to inform his client when he becomes aware that the client has been named as a defendant in a civil action. We have found no direct authority on the point. However, the potential prejudice to the client flowing from counsel\u2019s withholding of such information is self-evident. Here, petitioner\u2019s silence denied client S. the option of choosing whether to retain another attorney thereby avoiding the potential harm and conflict of interest which would follow representation by her codefendant in Shiffman\u2019s action. Moreover, the attorney whom she eventually engaged was deprived, for approximately one year, of opportunities to act in her behalf. Thus, we sustain the State Bar\u2019s finding that petitioner breached his fiduciary duty to communicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>2. <em>Communicating With Represented Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Additionally, there seems no doubt that petitioner knowingly initiated indirect communication with a party represented by counsel, without such counsel\u2019s prior permission. At the hearing, K. testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cQ. At any time in the course of [your] conversation did Mr. Shalant ask you to have your daughter contact him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201cK. Yes . . . he suggested that perhaps if my daughter and he could sit down, this situation could be resolved . . . .\u201d Mr. K. further testified that he suggested such a meeting to his daughter, but she rejected the overture. This uncontradicted evidence fully supports the hearing panel\u2019s finding and conclusion that petitioner violated rule 7-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">3. <em>Withdrawal of Trust Funds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The review department, contrary to the conclusion of the hearing panel, concluded that petitioner withdrew disputed funds from his client trust account in violation of rule 8-101(A)(2), which in relevant part provides: \u201cwhen the right of the member of the State Bar ... to receive a portion of trust funds is disputed <em>by the client, </em>the disputed portion shall not be withdrawn until the dispute is finally resolved.\u201d (Italics added.) The review department did not specify which acts it relied on for this finding, and we conclude that its conclusion is unsupported by the record. Rule 8-101 requires an attorney to retain funds in his client trust account only if their ownership is disputed by a client. The funds at issue here, being those remaining in the trust account after disbursement to the client of her share, were claimed by another <em>attorney, </em>not the client, and the client had not directed their disbursement in a particular manner. Accordingly, this case does not fall within the proscription of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The State Bar argues that petitioner indirectly violated rule 8-101 on the theory that he \u201cintentionally failed to communicate the fee dispute [between himself and Shiffman] to Ms. S. in order to deprive her of the opportunity to object to his withdrawal of all but $200 of the attorney fees from his trust account.\u201d The State Bar asserts that, given such knowledge, S. might well have requested petitioner to retain sufficient funds in his trust account to satisfy any liability on her part to Shiffman in the event Shiffman prevailed at trial. Petitioner, however, improperly failed to communicate only the fact that S. had been named a party defendant in Shiffman\u2019s fee dispute. Even had petitioner dutifully and promptly so informed S., alerting her to the continuing dispute, the information would have come too late to allow S. effectively to \u201cfreeze\u201d the trust funds, for petitioner had disbursed all of the settlement funds <em>before </em>Shiffman filed his suit. We conclude, accordingly, that the review department erred in finding that petitioner violated rule 8-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>4. <em>Discipline</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The review department considered petitioner\u2019s past disciplinary record, namely, a private reproval in 1979 for misconduct consisting of wilful failure to provide services for which he was hired, including a failure to communicate with his clients. As noted, the review department recommended a 90-day probationary suspension for petitioner\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">After our independent examination of the record, we sustain the State Bar Court\u2019s finding that petitioner breached his duty to communicate with his client, as well as his obligation not to communicate with a party represented by counsel without the counsel\u2019s permission. We further note that some of petitioner\u2019s misconduct, namely, failure to communicate with a client, was of a type for which petitioner previously had been privately reproved. We are unable to accept, however, the State Bar Court\u2019s recommendation that petitioner\u2019s misconduct deserves a period of probationary suspension, or that he be required to take and pass the Professional Responsibility Examination. Under the circumstances, we believe that a public reproval will constitute sufficient discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We therefore order that petitioner should be, and he hereby is, reproved.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AOo\">MOSK, J.\u2014I dissent.</author>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">More than two centuries ago Alexander Pope mused in The Rape of the Lock; \u201cWhat mighty contests rise from trivial things!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">I deem this entire disciplinary contest to rise from trivial things. It was basically a dispute between two attorneys over the reasonable amount of a fee; it belongs in civil court or in arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">I would impose no discipline and would dismiss the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Bird, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
