We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The probate court is invested with broad discretion to accommodate the interests of the decedent\u2019s family and creditors. The locality has no power, in essence, to \u201cveto\u201d a division accomplished by the probate court by imposing criminal sanctions on the survivors or by refusing to permit any development of the parcels due to the noncomplying manner of their creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">This case takes us back a few years. Lloyd Johnson, husband of plaintiff and respondent Anna I. Johnson, died in 1963. His will, admitted to probate the same year, named his widow and plaintiff-respondent Wells Fargo Bank as executors, and as trustees of a testamentary trust to which he devised the family residence on its 39.5-acre lot in the Town of Woodside, directing that the trustees sell it within three years of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Mrs. Johnson\u2019s attorney wrote to the town clerk in February 1964, inquiring about the application of the town\u2019s subdivision ordinance to a probate homestead set aside by the probate court. The clerk replied that she was unaware of any case having arisen under the ordinance involving a probate homestead, but mentioned two cases which she thought might \u201cfall in that category\u201d; she also informed the attorney that she was referring his letter to the town attorney and the planning consultant. There was no further communication regarding the inquiry from either the town or Mrs. Johnson\u2019s attorney, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">In September of 1965, during the administration of the estate, Mrs. Johnson did petition the probate court to set aside for her as a surviving spouse a probate homestead consisting of the house on approximately 6.6 acres. The petition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>unopposed, and an order setting apart the probate homestead as requested was entered on November 2, 1965. The decree of final distribution in 1966 distributed the remainder of the original property to the testamentary trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The trustees\u2019 efforts to sell the 32.9-acre parcel remaining after the probate homestead was set aside continued without success until 1978 (they had earlier obtained an extension of the period in which they were required to sell the property).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September of that year, they evidently sent a \u201cnotice of sale\u201d to the town manager, who responded with a letter in which he took the position that the trustees must \u201cfile for a land division\u201d before the 32.9-acre trust property could be sold separately from the homestead parcel and, further, expressed concern about the former parcel\u2019s access to a road.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In 1979, the probate court approved a sale of the trust property \u201csubject to a condition that a land division, if necessary, [would] be accomplished by December 31, 1979 or that the buyer, if satisfied that no land division [was] necessary, agree[d] that the condition ha[d] been satisfied or the buyer waive[d] the condition and elect[ed] to proceed with the purchase. ...\u201d The town manager continued to insist on compliance with the subdivision ordinance, so the trustees brought the instant action for declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that the \u201cordinance had and has no application to the creation in 1965 of the probate homestead [i.e., the 6.6-acre parcel], and that the [32.9-acre parcel] and the [6.6-acre parcel] are separate parcels of real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">After a hearing, the trial court granted the trustees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in their favor and against the town. It declared, as requested, that the town\u2019s subdivision ordinance \u201chad no application to the creation of the Probate Homestead\u201d or to \u201cthe existence of the Probate Homestead and the Trust Property as separate parcels,\u201d that [t]he Probate Homestead . . . and the Trust Property . . . are, and since the creation of the probate Homestead on November 2, 1965 have been, separate legal parcels of real property for all purposes,\u201d and, finally, that the town did not have \u201cany right, duty or power to refuse to grant any permit, or to refuse to do any act, or to do any act, under [the subdivision ordinance in effect in 1965] or [its successor, adopted in 1970] or any other ordinance of the Town of Woodside, on the basis that the creation of the Probate Homestead or the maintenance of the Probate Homestead and the Trust Property as separate parcels constituted or constitutes a land division or other violation of [the ordinances].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Article XI, section 7, of the California Constitution provides: \u201cA county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations <em>not in conflict with general laws. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Italics added.) \u2018\u201c\u201cAs defined by the cases the constitutional phrase \u2018conflict with general laws\u2019 . . . may arise in several different ways.

Another instructive case is <em>In re Means </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 254 [93 P.2d 105], in which we held that state civil service regulations fully prescribed the qualifications of plumbers employed by state, so that application of a local licensing ordinance to such employees posed a \u201cdirect conflict\u201d with the state law in attempting to impose additional requirements. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 257.) We concluded: \u201cAlthough the Legislature has enacted no statute regulating plumbing, if the city\u2019s ordinance is a valid exercise of power, then one whom the state has examined and found eligible for employment as a plumber and who has later entered the state civil service may be unable to work on state property because he cannot pass the examination of a city health officer or licensing board. <em>The result is a direct conflict of authority. Either the local regulation is ineffective or the state must bow to the requirement of its governmental subsidiary. Upon fundamental principles, that conflict must be resolved in favor of the state. </em>\u201d (14 Cal.2d at p. 260; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>In the instant case, we have concluded that the local subdivision ordinance is in conflict with the state probate homestead law because requiring compliance with the ordinance in effecting divisions of property for homestead purposes would \u201cmaterially interfere\u201d with the probate court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in taking into account the family\u2019s and the creditors\u2019 interests in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">1. <em>The state probate homestead law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Upon Mrs. Johnson\u2019s application in 1965, the probate court had a mandatory duty to set aside for her a probate homestead.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The selection of the homestead and its boundaries were up to the sound discretion of the trial court, considering the value of the homestead, the financial condition of the estate and the rights of creditors, and subject to the paramount demands of the family. <em>(Estate of Claussenius </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 600, 611 [216 P.2d 485].) State law has vested the probate court with this broad discretion incident to its exclusive occupation of the field of probate law for the purpose of protecting the surviving family of a decedent \u201cagainst the greed of creditors or its own improvidence\u201d <em>(Estate of Adams </em>(1900) 128 Cal. 380, 383 [57 P. 569, 60 P. 965]).

For the purpose of this ordinance the division of land shall mean the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land, as shown as a unit in the last preceding tax assessment roll of the Town of Woodside, into two or more lots, plots, sites or parcels for the purpose, whether immediate or future of sale, transfer, lease or building development. ...\u201d(\u00a7 1.10.)

Local subdivision and zoning regulations, which reflect the public\u2019s interest in controlling development to protect health and safety, certainly qualify as such. Accordingly, a probate court presumably could, in its discretion, require the survivors and the estate to seek local approval of a requested division of property, in recognition of said interest. (Since 1980, the probate court has discretion to decide whether to set aside a homestead at all (Prob. Code, \u00a7 660).) However, to therefore recognize such an ordinance as effective and <em>binding </em>on the probate court or on a party seeking a probate homestead, a violation triggering criminal sanctions or restrictions on development, would have the effect of making the regulations and the restrictions imposed by the locality as conditions of its approval of the division <em>paramount </em>over every other consideration. This would constitute a direct impairment of the probate court\u2019s discretion since the ordinance addresses the very act of dividing the property (in contrast to minimum-lot and other zoning restrictions which may do so indirectly but which are nevertheless binding and effective as to such divisions, as respondents concede).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">It should be noted that the town goes out of its way to disclaim any contention that the probate court was bound by and violated the ordinance. The town concedes that the 1965 order \u201cwas, and still is, fully effective for all purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>relating to the probate proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its view, \u201c[t]he violation would occur upon any subsequent attempt by Mrs. Johnson and the other beneficiaries to <em>develop or transfer </em>the [39.5-acre] property as separate parcels without prior compliance with the town\u2019s Subdivision Ordinance. \u201d According to the town, then, it is possible for the property to have been divided by the probate court for its own purposes\u2014removal of the probate homestead from the estate to be administered and insulation from the claims of creditors (though, in this case, it appears to have been set aside to avoid the will\u2019s mandate to sell the property)\u2014but to have remained one parcel for purposes of the subdivision ordinance, which addresses the town\u2019s legitimate concern about orderly development. It is intriguing to contemplate this almost metaphysical notion of property which is at once one and two parcels. (Cf. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>City of Manhattan Beach </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 279, 282-285 [98 Cal.Rptr. 785, 491 P.2d 369] [fact that two adjacent parcels were purchased separately did not establish that they were separate \u201clots\u201d within meaning of zoning ordinance which defined \u201clot\u201d in such a way that the two parcels did not qualify]; <em>In re Estate of Sayewich </em>(1980) 120 N.H. 237 [413 A.2d 581] [testamentary devise of real property as four separate parcels did not require local subdivision approval since probate law is concerned only with passage of title, and had no bearing on use or development of property].) We are constrained to reject the town\u2019s argument based on the language of the ordinance, however. As previously noted, title to the 6.6-acre parcel was vested in Mrs. Johnson by the order setting aside the probate homestead in 1965 <em>(Fealey </em>v. <em>Fealey </em>(1894) 104 Cal. 354, 360 [38 P. 49]; <em>Otto </em>v. <em>Long, supra, </em>144 Cal. at p. 146; former Prob. Code, \u00a7 667, repealed by Stats. 1980, ch. 119, \u00a7 15, p. 285; see also 24 Cal.Jur.3d, Decedent\u2019s Estates, \u00a7 475, p. 771) and the 1966 decree of final distribution confirmed title to the 32.9-acre parcel in the testamentary trust (see Prob. Code, \u00a7 300). The town\u2019s 1958 ordinance applied by its terms to the division of \u201ca lot, tract or parcel of land, <em>as shown as a unit in the last preceding tax assessment </em>roll. . . . \u201d (Italics added.) (See also Gov. Code, \u00a7 66424 [defining \u201csubdivision\u201d with reference to property shown as a unit or as contiguous units <em>with the same owner </em>on the latest tax assessment roll]; former Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 11535 repealed by Stats. 1974, ch. 1536, \u00a7 1, p. 3464.) Although the record does not contain the 1970 ordinance, there is no reason to believe its definition is different. Respondents asserted at oral argument that the latest assessment roll reflects the separate ownership of the homestead and the trust property. There being no reason to doubt that this is so, the town\u2019s suggestion that any violation of the subdivision ordinance is prospective only carries with it its own rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Thus, if the town\u2019s subdivision ordinance is to have any application to the property purportedly divided in 1965, it must be on the basis that the division was <em>then </em>violative of the ordinance. Notwithstanding its express assurance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>it makes no such contention, the town does appear to suggest that Mrs. Johnson might be characterized as a \u201cperson desiring to divide the property\u201d who was obliged under the ordinance to seek local approval of the division she sought from the probate court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Concerning the appropriateness of holding her liable for violation of the ordinance when the division was actually effected by the court, the town cites <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 602 [40 Cal.Rptr. 505].</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In <em>Pratt, </em>a group of people took title to a 46-acre property as joint tenants, then filed an action for partition, which was granted. Each of the owners then went on to divide his or her parcel into four or less smaller ones, so that a total of 38 parcels resulted. When the county refused to issue them building permits pursuant to an emergency zoning ordinance requiring a minimum lot size of three acres, the owners of the parcels insisted that they came within a provision of the county code that zoning would not affect the right to build on a lot \u201cproviding such was a separate lot or parcel of record or as shown on a Map of a recorded subdivision on the effective date.\u201d The county responded that the parcels had to have been legal lots as of the date of the zoning change, and contended that the lots in question were created in violation of the state Subdivision Map Act. The appellate court agreed, stating: \u201cOne of the appellants set the partition in motion by filing the complaint; the others, represented by the [same] counsel . . . , stipulated to the interlocutory decree. Under the circumstances, it is fair to say that appellants \u2018caused\u2019 the dividing of the land even though judicial approval . . . was obtained.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 60S.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>Pratt </em>is distinguishable, however, on the grounds that it involved a scheme to avoid the requirements of the state Subdivision Map Act and the parties sought partition of the property by a court <em>solely </em>for that purpose, since they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>have so divided without approval (48 Cal.Jur.3d, Partition, \u00a7 4, p. 243). <em>(Ibid.) </em>In contrast, Mrs. Johnson had to apply to the probate court in order to have a homestead set aside for her, and her application did not manifest any intention to avoid the town\u2019s subdivision ordinance. Moreover, critically, the determination of the boundaries of the homestead was entirely up to the probate court\u2019s discretion; by her application Mrs. Johnson merely triggered the probate court\u2019s exercise of its statutory duty to effect a just accommodation of the family\u2019s and the creditor\u2019s interests. Whereas in <em>Pratt </em>it was the parties\u2019 seeking partition, rather than the court\u2019s pro forma act of approving it, which was the \u201ccause\u201d of the division, in the instant case, though the language of the ordinance is broad enough to embrace Mrs. Johnson, and though it happens that the probate court divided it as she requested, still the division was governed ultimately by the court\u2019s discretion pursuant to the state probate homestead law.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Consideration of the effects of holding the subdivision ordinance applicable to Mrs. Johnson\u2019s act of petitioning for the setting aside of a probate homestead in 1965 illustrates the ordinance\u2019s potential for interference with the probate court\u2019s exercise of its statutory discretion. Although the town has not attempted to prosecute her under the ordinance\u2019s provision making it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 and imprisonment in the county jail for up to six months to \u201cviolat[e] any of [its] provisions,\u201d we think the homestead provisions of the state\u2019s probate scheme disclose a state interest in the \u201c \u2018providing] a place for the family and its surviving members, where they may reside and enjoy the comforts of a home, freed from any anxiety that it may be taken from them against their will. . <em>(Strangman </em>v. <em>Duke </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 185, 190 [295 P.2d 12], quoting <em>Estate of Fath </em>(1901) 132 Cal. 609, 613 [64 P. 995]; <em>Estate of Adams, supra, </em>128 Cal. at p. 383) which will not countenance applications of a penal provision of a local ordinance to a widow seeking to exercise her right to have a homestead set aside.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The prohibition on issuance of \u201cany permit or . . . any approval necessary to develop any real division ...\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.34) would no less seriously impinge on the probate court\u2019s discretion in selecting the boundaries of the homestead since any division not approved by the locality may leave the resulting parcels much reduced in value due to their unavailability for development and certainly leaves them subject to conditions which ignore the division of the property, and attendant transfer of title, accomplished by the probate court. A probate court\u2019s setting apart of a portion of a piece of real property as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>homestead reflects an implicit determination that the remainder of the property is not necessary to preserve the homestead\u2019s character and use as a home for the decedent\u2019s family (see <em>In re Smith </em>(1893) 99 Cal. 449, 450 [34 P. 77]) and should be retained in the estate and subject to the claims of creditors and beneficiaries. If, by its very act of dividing the property in this case, the probate court were held to subject both resulting parcels to a severe diminution of value, due to expected problems to be encountered in developing them, the ability of the court to respond to the perceived needs of such creditors and beneficiaries, and even the decedent\u2019s family (which may find itself prevented from remodeling the residence, for example), would be compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Nor could the probate homestead scheme under which the property was divided in 1965 tolerate the town\u2019s imposition of whatever conditions it could have imposed before they were divided, in essence ignoring the action of the probate court and the resulting separate ownership of the parcels. To condition development on their joining together to obtain approval, despite the fact that neither owner can compel the other to do so, ignores the fact that, as a result of the probate court\u2019s action, the parcels have come under separate ownership. (Cf. <em>Keizer </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 976, 980 [88 Cal.Rptr. 183, 471 P.2d 983] [holding that Subdivision Map Act did not \u201crequire the innocent purchaser to suffer for a violation by his grantor . . . ,\u201d rejecting as \u201cuntenable\u201d a suggestion that the purchasers be required to join together to attempt to obtain belated approval of the subdivision].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The town points out that <em>Keizer </em>recognized a county\u2019s \u201cequitable\u201d right to require \u201cas a condition to the issuance of a building permit, compliance] with such reasonable conditions as the county may require in the public interest and for the protection of plaintiff\u2019s property and of neighboring property, and performance] or agree[ment] to perform or construct such reasonable improvements with respect to [the owner\u2019s] lot aS could have been required of [the owner\u2019s] grantor as a condition of dividing the latter\u2019s tract of land under the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and the county subdivision ordinance at the time of the sale ... of [the] lot.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at p. 981.) The \u201cequitable\u201d right in <em>Keizer, </em>though, was predicated on an <em>illegal </em>division by the current owners\u2019 grantor, whereas, here, there was no \u201cviolation\u201d of the local subdivision ordinance, whose application to the division in question was preempted by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The trial court correctly declared that the town has no right \u201cto refuse to grant any permit, or to refuse to do any act, or to do any act, ... on the basis that the creation of the probate homestead . . . constituted a land division or other violation [of the subdivision ordinance].\u201d Consequently, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Again, we emphasize that our holding is only that a local subdivision ordinance cannot bind either the probate court or decedent\u2019s family in <em>derogation </em>of the court\u2019s exercise of its statutory discretion under the probate law.

The court, in light of the foregoing and other relevant considerations as determined by the court in its discretion, shall select as a homestead the most appropriate property available that is suitable for use as a dwelling and shall set apart in addition to the dwelling such adjoining property as appears reasonable for such a term and upon such conditions (including, but not limited to, assignment by the homestead recipient of other property to the heirs or devisees of the property set apart as a homestead) as appear proper.\u201d (Added by Stats. 1980, ch. 119, \u00a7 10.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> Although there are numerous decisions stating that the jurisdiction of the probate court is limited and it cannot try questions of title between the estate and third parties (see, e.g., <em>Estate of Niccolls </em>(1912) 164 Cal. 368, 373 [129 P. 278], here, there is no issue whether the property was part of the estate, and the fundamental jurisdiction of the probate court is thus undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AjfX\">Under the ordinance (\u00a7 2.2) and the state Subdivision Map Act (former Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 11535, as amended by Stats. 1963, ch. 1551, \u00a7 1, pp. 3136-3137, repealed by Stats. 1974, ch. 1536, \u00a7 1, p. 3464), a \u201csubdivision\u201d was a division into five or more parcels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"ALi\">Government Code section 66499.34 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAI\">\u201cNo local agency shall issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this division or of the provisions of local ordinances enacted pursuant to this division if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety.

Respondents suggest that, since there was no such provision in the Subdivision Map Act in 1965, the statute cannot now be applied to authorize the denial or conditioning of a permit. It is the \u201cprevailing rule,\u201d however, that, when an application for a building complied with the requirements in effect when it was filed, but in the interim between the application and the appeal from its denial, a new ordinance is enacted which would prohibit the development, \u201ca reviewing court will apply the law in existence at the time of its decision rather than at the time the permit was denied. [Citation.] The purpose of the rule is to prevent an appellate court from issuing orders for the construction of improvements contrary to presently existing legislative provisions. \u201d <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 125 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111].) The only recognized exception to this rule applies to cases where a subsequent ordinance is enacted with the purpose of frustrating the developer\u2019s plans. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 126, fn. 11; <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1974) 40 Cal. App.3d 1059, 1063-1065 [115 Cal.Rptr. 731].)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Amicus County of Sonoma, on the other hand, insists that the court did violate the subdivision ordinance in 1965. Amicus\u2019 argument is considered <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The town does not suggest that the probate court itself was a \u201cperson desiring to divide\u201d the 39.5-acre parcel. Amicus Sonoma County does make that argument, but it lacks merit. In <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Reclamation District No. 108 </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 43 [109 P.2d 1], this court held that a county treasurer who, as trustee of a reclamation district, split a property which was subject to sale into several parcels and sold them separately was not included within the definition of a sub-divider. (See also 64 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 815 (1981).) Amicus seeks to distinguish <em>Morris, </em>noting that the rule excluding government agencies from the operation of general statutory provisions applies \u201conly if their inclusion would result in an infringment of sovereign governmental powers.\u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>City of San Fernando </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 199, 276-277 [123 Cal.Rptr. 1, 537 P.2d 1250]; see also 62 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 140 (1979).) As the ensuing discussion will demonstrate, however, that application of the subdivision ordinance to the setting aside of a probate homestead would definitely impair the probate court\u2019s exercise of its statutory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Pratt\u2019s </em>holding that the right of joint tenants to seek partition of property could not be used to avoid the Subdivision Map Act has been codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 872.040: \u201cNothing in this title excuses compliance with any applicable laws, regulations, or ordinances governing the division, sale, or transfer of property.\u201d (Added by Stats. 1976, ch. 73, \u00a7 6, pp. 110-111.)

The ordinance was obviously not written with this kind of division of property in mind, and issues of notice and vagueness might be presented. The ordinance by its terms governs \u201cperson[s] desiring to divide\u201d property (\u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.2). Is a creditor who opposes setting aside the entire property as a homestead and prevails on the probate court to set apart only a portion thereof a \u201cperson desiring to divide\u201d the property? If so, how can he compel the owner to file an application for approval of the division, as is apparently required by the ordinance (\u00a7 5.2)?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
