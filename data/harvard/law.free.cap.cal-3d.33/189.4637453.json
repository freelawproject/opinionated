Particularly, we must determine whether the reasons stated by the trial court in denying petitioner\u2019s request for bail on appeal provide sufficient specificity to permit meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Petitioner was convicted of conspiracy and possession of controlled substances for sale and was sentenced to state prison. The trial court denied his motion for release on bail pending appeal on the basis that he posed a \u201csubstantial flight risk,\u201d represented \u201csome risk to society,\u201d and that the court did not \u201cperceive a substantial likelihood of success on appeal.\u201d Petitioner, relying on <em>Podesto </em>and federal decisional authority, contends (1) the trial court failed to adequately articulate its reasons for denying bail on appeal, and (2) the denial of bail constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">As we shall explain, we find petitioner\u2019s first contention sound and conclude that the trial court\u2019s statement is inadequate to allow us to review its evaluative process in weighing the factors by which we must judge the validity of the denial. In accordance with the reasoning underlying our decision in <em>Podesto, </em>we hold that a trial court\u2019s statement of reasons should contain more than mere findings of ultimate fact or a recitation of the relevant criteria for release on bail; the statement should clearly articulate the basis for the court\u2019s utilization of such criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">With respect to petitioner\u2019s claim of abuse of discretion, we conclude that the court\u2019s statement of reasons is in itself insufficient to review the claim, even if complemented by the court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing. Because of the inadequacy of the court\u2019s statement, we cannot determine whether the court properly exercised its discretion in light of all the attending circumstances. Accordingly, the writ should be denied. We conclude, however, that in light of the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with the mandate of <em>Podesto, </em>petitioner is entitled to an immediate hearing on his present application for bail on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Petitioner Thomas H. Pipinos (hereafter defendant) was convicted by a jury of five offenses dealing with controlled substances: one count of conspiracy to transport or furnish controlled substances (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379), and four counts of possession of controlled substances for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378). After the verdict was entered, the trial court ordered defendant to appear at a later date for a sentencing hearing; the court further ordered that defendant be released on bail of $60,000 pending sentencing. Defendant had made all required appearances during the year trial proceedings were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>On June 19, 1980, defendant appeared at the sentencing hearing as required by the trial court, and he was sentenced to a four-year prison term. That same day, defendant moved for an order releasing him on bail pending appeal. The prosecutor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> urging that bail be denied, conceded that defendant had ties to the community\u2014\u201ca house, a family and a business\u201d\u2014but nonetheless argued that defendant was a flight risk in view of the impending prison term; that defendant\u2019s conviction of drug offenses indicated that he posed a \u201cvery significant danger to society\u201d; and, finally, that defendant\u2019s appeal was frivolous since pretrial petitions for writ of mandate raising the same issues had been denied. Defense counsel sought to rebut each of these assertions by noting that defendant had appeared at all prior proceedings, that defendant\u2019s conduct since his arrest had been exemplary, and that the proposed grounds of his appeal from conviction have legitimate merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel also made a lengthy argument attaching significance to the fact that defendant had not fled during a recess when, immediately prior to argument on the motion, the judge and bailiff had temporarily left the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">At the time of defendant\u2019s motion for bail on appeal, the trial court had before it three reports which had been offered in evidence at the immediately preceding sentencing hearing. The reports were prepared by the probation officer and two doctors who had been engaged to make a sentencing recommendation. All recommended no state prison custodial time. All three reports characterize defendant as a family man and aggressive businessman who became involved in the sale of methamphetamines through poor judgment, greed and the bad influence of business associates in the bar supply distribution business.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The probation officer\u2019s report indicates that defendant was a self-employed salesman, age 38, who had lived in San Diego County for 15 years. He has been married since 1970 and is the sole support of his wife and two children. At the time of his arrest he had been earning $50,000 per year as a master distributor for a bar supply dealership. The offenses of which defendant was convicted occurred when he sold methamphetamines to an undercover informant. The report acknowledged the seriousness of the offenses and concluded that defendant was motivated primarily by monetary considerations; never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>theless, the probation officer pointed out that defendant had no prior criminal record and, accordingly, recommended a formal probation of five years with a maximum term of local confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Dr. Thomas Rodgers, a psychiatrist, submitted to the court an evaluation letter which concluded that defendant is free from any mental disorganization or disorder, that he is not psychotic, that he is not violent, that he has no history of drug abuse, and that, in his professional opinion, he presents no threat to the community upon his release. Accordingly, Rodgers recommended monitored probation. Dr. G. Thomas Gitchoff, a criminologist, described defendant as a highly motivated, energetic man who had successfully developed a business which, prior to his arrest, grossed about $3 million a year. He too expressed the opinion that defendant would pose no threat to the community upon release. Concluding that a prison term would result in long-term damage to defendant\u2019s family and business, Gitchoff designed a suggested rehabilitative program involving five years\u2019 probation with conditions including payment of a fine and donations to charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The court rejected these recommendations when, as noted above, it sentenced defendant to prison for four years. The court also apparently gave little weight to the reports\u2019 conclusions that defendant posed no danger to the community and that he had strong community ties, as it denied the request for bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">A review of the reporter\u2019s transcript reveals that the court, in denying defendant\u2019s motion, did purport to articulate its basis for denying bail. First, the court opined that defendant was a potential flight risk. The court noted: \u201cWe\u2019re in a different ballgame now. He\u2019s been sentenced to prison for a substantial period of time . . . and I\u2019m persuaded that he wouldn\u2019t give much pause to flee.\u201d Secondly, the court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s argument that defendant posed \u201csome risk to society\u201d because of his involvement in a drug distribution operation. With respect to defendant\u2019s potential risk to society the court explained: \u201cI\u2019m not persuaded that there\u2019s going to be this sudden metamorphosis ... [1] I think that what we\u2019re dealing with here are the results of some basic character flaws in Mr. Pipinos, and I am not persuaded there\u2019s going to be any change in that regard.\u201d Finally, the court concluded that while it was \u201cnot really in a position to comment on some of the pretrial motions,\u201d it nevertheless did not perceive \u201ca substantial likelihood of success on appeal.\u201d (The trial court\u2019s comments are set out verbatim in the margin.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Defendant filed a notice of appeal and a request for a transcript of the hearing. Thereafter, he petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of habeas corpus to compel the setting of bail on appeal. The appellate court summarily denied the writ. Upon defendant\u2019s petition for hearing in this court, we ordered the Director of Corrections to show cause before the Court of Appeal why the relief prayed for should not be granted. Following hearing on the matter, the Court of Appeal by opinion again denied the writ. We then granted defendant\u2019s subsequent (and second) petition for hearing in order to reaffirm and elaborate on our holding in <em>Podesto, </em>and, particularly, to explore the question of what constitutes an adequate statement of reasons for denying release pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Defendant concedes, as he must, that there is no absolute right to bail on appeal <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 921, 929-933) since release after a felony conviction is totally within the trial court\u2019s discretion (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1272).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His principal contention is that the trial court failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons for denying bail pending appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u201cCalifornia courts have long acknowledged that a primary purpose of bail after conviction is to assure that defendant will not flee the jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Podesto, supra, </em>at p. 930.) It is settled that release of a convicted felon during the appeal process is a matter left to the sound legal discretion of the trial court seeking some \u201cpractical assurance that defendant will attend upon the court when his presence is required.\u201d <em>(In re Brumback </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 810, 813 [299 P.2d 217].) We recognized in <em>Podesto, </em>however, that the court does not have unbridled discretion in this area (15 Cal.3d at p. 933; see also <em>Ex Parte Hoge </em>(1874) 48 Cal. 3, 5); and, accordingly, we set out guidelines to assist courts in making reasoned determinations regarding postconviction bail applications by felons. We held that in exercising discretion under section 1272 the superior court \u201cmay consider (1) the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s flight, (2) the potential danger to society posed by the defendant\u2019s release, and (3) the frivolousness or lack of diligence in defendant\u2019s prosecution of his appeal; ...\u201d <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>at p. 933.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Recognizing that appellate review of bail decisions had been largely frustrated because trial courts were not required to articulate their reasons for denying an application, we further held in <em>Podesto </em>that trial courts \u201cshould render a brief statement of reasons in support of an order denying bail on appeal. [Citations.] Such a statement need not include conventional findings of fact; all that is required \u2018is that the basis for the order be set forth \u201cwith sufficient specificity to permit meaningful review.\u201d\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 938; quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Browning </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 125, 137-138 [119 Cal.Rptr. 420];<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541, 561 [16 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>84, 97, 86 S.Ct. 1045].<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>) We stressed in <em>Podesto </em>that the requirement of a statement of reasons\u2014in addition to facilitating appellate review\u2014advances two other independent policies. The requirement of articulated reasons serves the dual purpose of acting as \u201can inherent guard against the careless decision\u201d and of \u201cpreserving public confidence in the decision-making process.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 937; citing <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 517 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12].) Thus, Podesto\u2019s requirement of a statement of reasons seeks to ensure that the trial judge weighs the relevant considerations and that he or she recognizes and articulates the grounds for denial of bail so as not to deprive defendant of meaningful appellate review of the decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The question of what constitutes an adequate statement of reasons must therefore be resolved by determining whether the statement furthers these desirable ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we examine whether the trial court\u2019s comments serve to further the purposes of Podesto\u2019s requirement of a statement of reasons. As will appear, our review of the court\u2019s statement (as set forth fully at fa. 4, <em>ante) </em>reveals that, to the contrary, the court\u2019s ruling in this case does not promote Podesto\u2019s goal of ensuring that judges engage in careful and reasoned decisionmaking. Once defendant came forward with evidence in support of his application for release\u2014by way of the three reports, including the independent report by the probation officer\u2014the court was duty-bound to articulate its evaluative process and show how it weighed the evidence presented in light of the applicable standards. <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>at p. 938.) We find the court\u2019s statement inadequate as it does not identify the specific facts which persuaded the court that bail would be inappropriate in this case. The court simply based its denial of bail on the bare conclusions that there was a likelihood that defendant would flee and would continue his criminal activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>as a dealer of controlled substances, and that his appeal was meritless. We examine each of these conclusions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>Likelihood of Flight</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Because the primary purpose of bail is assurance of continued attendance at future court proceedings <em>(In re Brumback, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 810, 813), a defendant to qualify for release on appeal must satisfactorily demonstrate that the likelihood of his flight is minimal in light of the following criteria: \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s ties to the community, including his employment, the duration of his residence, his family attachments and his property holdings; (2) the defendant\u2019s record of appearance at past court hearings or of flight to avoid prosecution; and (3) the severity of the sentence defendant faces.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 921, 934-935.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In the present case, the three reports submitted on behalf of defendant presented a prima facie case for release pending appeal. These reports reveal that defendant has lived in San Diego for approximately 15 years; that he owns his own business which he intends to continue; that he had no criminal history; and that, at the time of sentencing, he was residing with his wife and two children and was earning a legitimate annual income in excess of $50,000. Further, defendant attended all court proceedings and was released on $60,000 bail prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Yet, the trial court was \u201cpersuaded that he wouldn\u2019t give much pause to flee\u201d solely on the ground that the defendant faced a four-year prison term. While the criteria enunciated in <em>Podesto </em>permit the court to consider the severity of the sentence, this factor cannot be considered in isolation; rather, <em>Podesto </em>requires that it be weighed against other factors, including community ties, employment and record of appearances. We cannot agree with Justice Kaus\u2019 view that it is sufficient for the trial court to state <em>only </em>\u201cthat because of the severity of the sentence the defendant was likely to flee.\u201d While in this case the sentence may in fact be so severe that it is likely defendant would have elected to leave his family and forego his property, the court\u2019s failure to mention the other factors identified in <em>Podesto </em>does not permit us to review in what manner, if at all, it balanced defendant\u2019s community ties and record of court appearances against the incentive to flight suggested by the prison term. <em>Podesto </em>mandates such a balancing; otherwise denial of bail would be proper in any case in which a prison term is imposed, regardless of offsetting factors presented by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Because there is no evidence of such a balancing in this case, the court\u2019s conclusory finding that defendant poses \u201csome substantial flight risk\u201d because of the impending prison term is clearly inadequate to satisfy Podesto's requirement of a statement of reasons. Consequently, defendant is deprived of meaningful review of the decision. Moreover, such an insufficient statement fails to promote the policy purpose underlying our requirement of a statement of reasons\u2014guarding against careless decisionmaking. Although the court may very well have engaged in careful analysis of the facts and law, its failure to articulate its reasons for finding defendant a flight risk leaves us without the benefit of its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>Danger to Community</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The court\u2019s finding that defendant is a \u201cdanger to society\u201d is also deficient with respect to providing a basis for meaningful review and guarding against careless decisionmaking. We held in <em>Podesto </em>that one factor a court may properly consider in deciding whether to release a convicted felon on bail \u201cis whether there is any danger that, if released, [the defendant] would continue to commit crime.\u201d (15 Cal.3d 935; quoting <em>In re Scaggs </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 416, 419 [303 P.2d 1009]; but see <em>In re Underwood, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 345, 347.) The court in the instant case, however, does not expressly state that there is a probability that defendant will continue to engage in criminal conduct. Instead, the court obliquely refers to defendant\u2019s \u201cbasic character flaws\u201d and bases its conclusion of danger to society on the fact that there is no evidence of a \u201cmetamorphosis.\u201d We may conceivably infer that the court found, based on its assessment of defendant\u2019s character, that it was unlikely that defendant would forego his profitable trafficking in controlled substances. However, a primary purpose of the <em>Podesto </em>requirement of a statement is precisely to prevent this type of speculative judicial second-guessing, especially when, as here, we are asked to draw inferences as to inferences the trial court might have drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Further, the trial court does not mention whether it even considered the professional evaluations submitted to the court by Drs. Rodgers and Gitchoff, both of whom expressly conclude\u2014contrary to the court\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s character and its prediction of his future behavior\u2014that defendant presents no threat or danger to the community.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Certainly, the court was free in the exercise of its discretion to reject these professional evaluations in favor of its own assessment of the present crime and defendant\u2019s history. However, the court\u2019s conclusory comments regarding defendant\u2019s alleged dangerous propensities do not reveal on what ground the court rejected the reports\u2019 contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Because of the court\u2019s failure to articulate its reasons for finding defendant a danger to the community, we cannot ascertain the manner in which the court exercised its discretion. We do not know if the denial of bail was based upon the circumstances and propensities of the individual defendant, or whether it was based upon precisely the generalizations of future criminality <em>Podesto\u2019s </em>standards were meant to prevent. <em>Podesto </em>urges caution in denying bail based on the alleged propensities of the defendant and warns courts \u201cnot [to] adopt an ironclad, mechanical policy of denying bail to all who commit a particular crime.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 936, fn. 10; citing <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737]; <em>In re Minnis </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 639 [102 Cal.Rptr. 749, 498 P.2d 997].) The court\u2019s statement in this case does not indicate what factors the court considered in predicting defendant\u2019s future criminal activity. <em>Podesto\u2019s </em>intent is not fulfilled by such a statement. To hold otherwise would allow courts to deny bail to every defendant convicted of drug offenses solely on the basis of the inherent danger of this criminal activity. A court\u2019s statement of reasons should clearly indicate to the reviewing court that a defendant\u2019s interest in freedom pending appeal has been abrogated only after careful scrutiny of his or her individual circumstances and propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">\n<em>Merit of the Underlying Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">As a final ground for denying bail on appeal, the trial court ruled that it did not perceive a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d on appeal. Defendant correctly argues that the court applied an incorrect standard and improperly placed the burden. <em>Podesto </em>holds that the court may decline to grant bail \u201cif it determines either that the appeal is <em>wholly </em>frivolous or that the defendant is not diligently prosecuting his appeal.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 936; italics added.) The court, however, \u201cshould not require as a prerequisite to release that the appeal actually appear meritorious [citation]; instead, denial of release on these grounds is only justifiable if \u2018the appeal is so baseless as to deserve to be condemned as frivolous or is sought as a device for mere delay.\u2019 <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1956) 1 L.Ed.2d 25, 27 [76 S.Ct. 1063, 1065].)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">It will be recalled that the prosecutor below urged the court to find the appeal frivolous because the search and seizure issues which defendant proposed to raise were briefed in pretrial writs denied by this court and the Court of Appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, neither court addressed the merits of the issues. As we noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 484, 493 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686], an \u201cappellate court\u2019s denial without opinion of defendant\u2019s petition for a pretrial writ cannot properly be deemed a conclusive decision on the merits, and . . . defendant is entitled to an appellate court\u2019s determination of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>search and seizure contention . . . .\u2019\u2019In this case defendant\u2019s pretrial petition for writ of mandamus was denied for being untimely and for failure to provide an adequate record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In sum, the court\u2019s statement is inadequate to allow us to review its evaluative process in weighing the factors to be considered in the setting of bail. The court\u2019s comments that defendant is a potential danger to the community and that he is likely to \u201cskip\u201d bail are the conclusionary equivalent of ultimate findings of fact. \u201c[W]ithout an adequate statement of reasons we cannot follow \u2018the analytic route the [court] traveled from evidence to action\u2019 [citation], or whether it \u2018randomly leap[ed] from evidence to conclusions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Juan T. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d 207, 209, fin. 2; quoting <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 506, 515-516.) We are presented with such an inadequate statement in this case; consequently, it is only with great difficulty, if at all, that we as a review court can ascertain the manner in which the trial court exercised its discretion. A statement like the one here does not promote the primary purpose of Podesto's requirement of a statement of reasons\u2014the facilitation of meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The trial court\u2019s comments in this case amount to nothing more than a recitation of the standards set forth in <em>Podesto. </em>Thus, the trial court\u2019s statement indicates only that it recognized the criteria to be considered\u2014likelihood of flight, potential danger to society and frivolousness of the appeal\u2014though it did mischaracterize the last factor. To accept as adequate a statement that shows no more than judicial conversance with the applicable standards would render our <em>Podesto </em>mandate a formalistic gesture. Because a court has considerable discretion in bail matters, it is imperative that the record reflect the factors that influenced its decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is insufficient for a trial court to merely state conclusions of ultimate fact which, at best, indicate a check-list approach to the standards set forth in <em>Podesto. </em>Accordingly, we hold that a trial court\u2019s statement should clearly delineate the basis for its utilization of the applicable standards. Such a statement affords defendants the opportunity to meaningfully challenge arbitrary decisions and allows appellate courts to engage in meaningful review upon being apprised of the analytical process by which the trial court arrived at its conclusions. It is this analytical process, and not mere conclusory com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ments, which is most useful in reviewing to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion. We thus reaffirm Podesto\u2019s mandate imposing on trial courts the duty to articulate the basis for denial of release on appeal with sufficient specificity to afford meaningful appellate review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Our conclusion that the trial court failed in its duty to provide an adequate statement of reasons does not mean, of course, that defendant automatically prevails in his contention that the court abused its discretion in denying bail. Failure to state reasons does not in itself justify the conclusion that the court\u2019s denial constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion. We must still review the record to determine if the court\u2019s denial is supported by the totality of facts before it, notwithstanding its failure to identify the specific facts which caused it to deny bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Although we have examined the three reports submitted to the court\u2014which we concede are favorable to defendant\u2014we cannot conclude that he has made a showing sufficient to entitle him to bail as a matter of law. We are reluctant to find that the trial court abused its discretion where that court presided over the trial, was able to observe defendant\u2019s demeanor, and was generally in a better position to assess his showing. Under these circumstances\u2014and given the limited record before us\u2014it is not our province to substitute our judgment for that of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Must we therefore uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of bail even though the three favorable reports have left us with the lingering doubt that the court <em>may </em>have abused its discretion? As will appear, the answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The present case illustrates the problems an appellate court must confront when presented with an inadequate <em>Podesto </em>statement. As noted above, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>primary purpose of the requirement of a statement of reasons is to provide a basis for meaningful appellate review in bail cases which, as a practical matter, arrive in the appellate court by collateral proceeding and often without a complete record of facts and proceedings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 796, 803.) We are presented with just such an incomplete record in this case. Nonetheless, the Attorney General argues that if we review the trial court\u2019s comments at sentencing, we must uphold the denial of bail. We examine this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At the time the Court of Appeal denied defendant\u2019s habeas corpus petition, it had before it a partial transcript relating only to the hearing on the motion for bail. However, because of the duration of the instant proceeding in the appellate courts, a complete transcript of all proceedings of June 19, 1980, including the sentencing hearing, is now available. Pursuant to the request of the Attorney General, we have taken judicial notice of the transcript of the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (d); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 124, 130-131 [144 Cal.Rptr. 95].) We agree with the Attorney General that because the sentencing hearing immediately preceded the hearing on the motion for bail, the transcript of the earlier hearing may show the context in which the court made its comments at the latter hearing. We conclude, however, after careful review of the sentencing transcript, that the court\u2019s comments therein in no way further explicate the basis for its denial of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We note at the outset that the court did not discuss matters relating to likelihood of flight or merit of the underlying appeal since these factors are not relevant in a sentencing context. The court did, however, express its disagreement with the probation report\u2019s and professional evaluations\u2019 recommendation of probation. In this regard, the court expressed the opinion that defendant is a thief, perjurer and drug dealer who, though technically without a prior record, has been engaged in illegal conduct for some time. It is in this context that the court states that defendant\u2019s ongoing involvement in the distribution of illegal drugs shows that he is a threat to the community. This statement thus serves to justify the court\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s <em>past </em>offenses warrant more severe punishment than probation; it does not, however, purport to predict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>defendant\u2019s <em>future </em>behavior so as to justify incarceration on appeal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The statement is in any event conclusory and as such cannot provide an adequate basis for denying bail. (See discussion, <em>ante, </em>at section II.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In sum, the court\u2019s comments in denying bail\u2014even when complemented by its comments at sentencing\u2014do not provide sufficient specificity to enable us to meaningfully review defendant\u2019s abuse of discretion contention. This case thus illustrates the soundness of <em>Podesto\u2019s </em>requirement of a readily available statement of reasons articulating the court\u2019s grounds for denial of bail. It is incumbent upon the trial court to provide such a statement so that an appellate court will not have to review the entire record, as we have done, in search of a basis to justify the court\u2019s denial of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Without an adequate statement of reasons, we simply cannot ascertain if the court exercised its discretion \u201cin the light of all the attending circumstances.\u201d <em>(In re Brumback, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 810, 813.) Even after reviewing the limited record available to us, we are unable to determine with certainty whether or not the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">We have concluded that the court\u2019s statement of reasons consists of mere conclusions which do no more than recite that defendant has failed to meet the <em>Podesto </em>standards for release pending appeal. We hold that, to comply with <em>Podesto, </em>a statement of reasons must clearly articulate the court\u2019s evaluative process in applying the relevant criteria to the particular facts of defendant\u2019s case. On the limited record before us, however, we cannot hold that the totality of the evidence before the trial court does not support its denial of bail; \u201cwe merely say that without an adequate statement of reasons we cannot follow \u2018the analytic route. . . \u2019 \u201d taken by the trial court. <em>(Juan T. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d at p. 209, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Accordingly, we decline defendant\u2019s invitation to set bail or order that reasonable bail be set. In <em>Podesto </em>we denied the writ without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to file a new application for bail on appeal with the superior court. (15 Cal.3d at p. 938.) Defendant in this case has been incarcerated for many months without having been properly apprised of the reasons for denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>bail. Requiring him to file a new application can only serve to further penalize him for the trial court\u2019s <em>Podesto </em>error. In order to provide a more expeditious remedy, the trial court is ordered to promptly conduct a new hearing on his present application. If bail is again denied, the court should prepare a record sufficient to afford meaningful review in accord with the views we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Mosk, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\">As in <em>Podesto, </em>this opinion will utilize the terms \u201crelease pending appeal\u201d and \u201cbail pending appeal\u201d interchangeably. \u201cWe believe that the \u2018release pending appeal\u2019 terminology is generally preferable to the more common \u2018bail pending appeal\u2019 nomenclature, because the former term clearly indicates that money bail is only one condition, among others, that courts may utilize in the exercise of judicial discretion to assure a defendant\u2019s presence at all necessary proceedings.

Because <em>Kent </em>is founded on procedural due process principles (id., at p. 562 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 98]), it seems clear that a judge\u2019s reasoning must be adequately delineated both out of fundamental fairness to the defendant and as an aid to the appellate court.

In spite of defendant\u2019s first argument, we conclude that\u2014in fairness to the trial court\u2014we should consider its comments at the sentencing hearing since defendant himself relies on evidence submitted at sentencing in support of his contention that he made a prima facie case for bail. Defendant\u2019s second argument is only superficially appealing. That the <em>Podesto </em>statement should stand alone is conceded, but only as it is relevant to the issue whether the statement adequately sets forth the trial judge\u2019s reasoning. However, once an appellate court is presented with an inadequate <em>Podesto </em>statement, as in the present case, it must of necessity search the record to determine if the totality of the evidence before the trial court supports its denial of bail.

The majority correctly hold that the trial court failed to articulate the evidentiary basis for its ruling. Here, petitioner has in essence been penalized for the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with the mandate of <em>Podesto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> Generally, an appellate court is unable to review the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion when no explanation of the reasons for denying bail is provided. Whether or not a petitioner should be released on bail is a question which this court is foreclosed from resolving. Our only recourse is to order the trial court to conduct a new bail hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">To one whose application for bail on appeal was erroneously denied, such relief is in effect no relief at all. It is well recognized that an application for bail pending appeal \u201crequires . . . speedy determination if relief is to be effective.\u201d (See rule 9(b) Fed. Rules App.Proe., 28 U.S.C., Advis. Com. Note.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The present case graphically illustrates this problem. Petitioner has spent more than 17 months in jail awaiting resolution of his bail application. If he is entitled to bail, the additional hearing necessitated by the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the mandate of <em>Podesto </em>will only serve to further delay vindication of his right and further deprive petitioner of his liberty without according him due process of law. In addition, given the many months that have passed since petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentencing, a decision to grant petitioner\u2019s bail application after the new hearing takes place will have little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The procedural protections outlined by this court in <em>Podesto </em>are useless if there is no adequate remedy for their violation. Only if a trial court complies with <em>Podesto </em>will a petitioner be able to obtain effective relief from an erroneous denial of bail pending appeal. Surely, our trial courts should make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>effort to comport with those requirements.

Because the trial court at the bail hearing did not give a sufficient statement of its reasons for denying bail pursuant to <em>In re Podesto </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 921, 937-938 [127 Cal.Rptr. 97, 544 P.2d 1297], we must review the record of sentencing to determine whether it illuminates the trial court\u2019s actions on the bail motion. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 203-204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The majority characterizes the trial court\u2019s statements during sentencing as expressing \u201cthe opinion that defendant is a thief, perjurer and drug dealer who, though technically without a prior record, has been engaged in illegal conduct for some time.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 204.) My colleagues interpret this description merely as the court\u2019s justification for its conclusion that <em>past </em>offenses by defendant warranted greater punishment than probation. They give no effect to the statements as predictive of defendant\u2019s future behavior sufficient to support a denial of bail on appeal. It is here that I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In <em>Podesto, </em>after alluding to the difficulty of predicting future behavior, we reaffirmed that \u201cWhen the pattern of a particular defendant\u2019s history indicates that additional criminal conduct will probably ensue if the defendant is released, ... a court unquestionably retains the authority to deny release on appeal.

No such \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion\u201d occurred here.

[f] What I meant by that in my pronouncement of judgment, not quite the same risk a rapist or murderer does; but he represents some risk, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>I\u2019m not persuaded that there\u2019s going to be this sudden metamorphosis that he seems to suggest that there might be, that his conviction, and now his sentence to prison is going to have that major effect, going to bring about that substantial a change in his character, [1] I think that what we\u2019re dealing with here are the results of some basic character flaws in Mr. Pipinos, and I am not persuaded that there\u2019s going to be any change in his character.\u201d The court\u2019s general conclusion that defendant poses a risk which would support a denial of bail on appeal thus <em>must </em>be considered in the context of its more specific statements during the sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">During the sentencing proceedings the trial court extensively recited its reasons for finding defendant unsuitable for probation. After detailing several specific factors and its belief that defendant was not a first time offender but one who had avoided previous detection, the court indicated that while defendant did not present a threat of violence, \u201cI certainly think he does represent a threat or danger to the community, [f] He\u2019s engaged in an ongoing scheme for distributing dangerous substances, controlled substances that are\u2014could be the source of great mischief and danger to members of the community, and he\u2019s a thief, [f] He represents danger to society because he has no compunction at all about going around ripping people off.\u201d These comments were aimed at both past and present behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Subsequently, the court observed that defendant\u2019s \u201cattitude as I perceive it watching him as a witness here, watching him throughout the trial, based on the other information before me, also convinces me that he\u2019s not a suitable and likely candidate for probation. He\u2019s not credible, he\u2019s not reliable.\u201d Finally, the court concluded \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that he surrounds himself with persons who are deeply engaged in criminal activity and criminal conduct. And again, that seems to satisfy not only the monetary and material needs, but even more significantly some emotional and psychiatric needs of his that I\u2019m not persuaded that, at this stage in his life, I\u2019m not very optimistic there\u2019s likely to be much change in that regard; ...\u201d Also notable is the court\u2019s reference to the reports by the psychiatrist and criminologist who evaluated defendant and its specific rejection of their conclusions on the ground that the evaluations did not sufficiently take into account defendant\u2019s history of criminality or the attributes of his personality which had embroiled him in the crimes with which he was charged and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The trial court\u2019s discourse on defendant\u2019s conduct was more than merely a statement as to defendant\u2019s <em>past </em>criminal conduct. It also contained a considered prediction that defendant\u2019s future acts presented a risk because the psychological and other factors which had led defendant to become involved in criminal activities remained, and defendant\u2019s attitude as revealed during trial indicated no present movement toward improvement or meaningful change. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The court considered \u201cthe pattern of . . . defendant\u2019s history\u201d <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 936) and concluded that it revealed a present propensity for criminality which might lead to criminal conduct if defendant was released on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">As a result, unlike the trial court in <em>Podesto, </em>the court here articulated sufficient reasons for finding that defendant posed a substantial risk if released. A reading of the transcripts of the sentencing and bail proceedings in conjunction provides, in my view, ample material on which to permit appellate review, and to identify several valid reasons for the trial court\u2019s action. I conclude that no manifest abuse of discretion occurred and would deny the writ on this basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b169-6\">KAUS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6p\">Concurring and Dissenting.\u2014I concur in Justice Richardson\u2019s dissent which focuses on the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s release would pose a threat to society. In addition, I believe that the court said all that it needed to say on the issue of \u201clikelihood of flight.\u201d For convenience I repeat its statement of reasons with respect to this issue below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clearly this is more than adequate to permit meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">What, in truth, the majority demands is not the type of finding on which meaningful review may be based\u2014a finding of ultimate fact\u2014but a recital of the evidentiary bits and pieces on which the finding of ultimate fact is based. That, however, is not what we were talking about in <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12]. What we found lacking in that case is precisely what this record contains: a finding of ultimate fact \u201cto bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and the ultimate decision or order.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The ultimate decision in this case was, of course: \u201cBail denied.\u201d Had the court said nothing else, it would have erred. I think it probably would also have erred had it merely said: \u201cBail denied\u2014likelihood of flight.\u201d It gave, however, several reasons for its denial, among others a statement that because of the severity of the sentence the defendant was likely to flee. That is a finding of fact which supports the decision. We can meaningfully review it by going through the record and determining whether there is evidence to support the finding\u2014as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>we do in almost every other case where a finding is attacked for insufficiency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, that is precisely what the majority appears to have done in this case when it declared itself \u201creluctant to find that the trial court abused its discretion. ...\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I would deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Broussard, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u201cI do find and I am persuaded that there is some substantial flight risk at this point in time, [fl We\u2019re in a different ballgame now. He knows he\u2019s been sentenced to prison for a substantial period of time and I think he, in good faith, and probably with some reason, perhaps, was hopeful that was not going to be the judgment of the court, and maybe anticipated up to this point in time that that wouldn\u2019t be the judgment, but that question has been resolved now, and he knows exactly what the judgment of the court is, and I think that makes\u2014changes the situation substantially, and I\u2019m persuaded that he wouldn\u2019t give much pause to flee, because I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not at all happy about the prospect of spending some time in prison, even though he\u2019ll be, if not literally, at least to some extent, in the company of Big Frank, his mentor, the one he admires so much.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">There are special situations where a statute mandates that the trial court go beyond findings of ultimate fact. One which comes to mind is the granting of a new trial for insufficiency of the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657; <em>Scala </em>v. <em>Jerry Witt &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 359 [90 Cal.Rptr. 592, 475 P.2d 464].) The reasons for that requirement, explained at length in <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 104, 112-116 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315], are, of course, not present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
