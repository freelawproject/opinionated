Following dependency proceedings (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 300, subd. (a)), Stacy was placed with his paternal aunt and uncle; his younger stepsisters were placed in separate foster homes with nonrelatives. On July 25, 1979, the state initiated two proceedings under section 232, subdivision (a)(7)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to terminate parental rights, one involving Stacy, the other, Laura and Tammy.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">After five days of hearing, with testimony from social workers, foster parents, a psychologist, Della, and Stacy\u2019s father and uncle, the superior court entered one judgment freeing the three children from Della\u2019s control. Pursuant to section 239, the Director of the Department of Social Services was appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>guardian and the children were referred to the California Adoptive Service for placement. Della\u2019s separate appeals have been consolidated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The appeal raises five issues: (1) whether \u201cfoster home\u201d within the meaning of section 232, subdivision (a)(7) includes care in the home of a relative; (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment; (3) whether the county offered Della adequate help to regain her children; (4) whether the court employed the proper standard of proof; and (5) whether the court erred in failing to appoint counsel for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Definition of \u201cFoster Home\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Della contends that the proceedings as to Stacy did not meet the threshold requirement under subdivision (a)(7)\u2014that he have spent two years in \u201cone or more foster homes.\u201d The issue is whether Stacy\u2019s placement with his aunt and uncle constitutes care in a \u201cfoster home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Della relies on <em>In re Antonio F. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 440 [144 Cal.Rptr. 466], the first case to define \u201cfoster home\u201d as \u201ccare other than in the home of a parent or relative.\u201d In <em>Antonio F. </em>the court considered a termination order under subdivision (a)(7) against a mother who, fearing deportation, left her children with their aunt for five years. In her absence the children were adjudged wards of the court and placed with the aunt. The mother received no notice of the dependency proceedings and continued to support and correspond with the children. The Court of Appeal reversed on three grounds: (1) the state\u2019s efforts to notify the mother of the dependency hearings were inadequate; (2) no evidence supported the finding that she was unable to provide an adequate home for her children; and (3) the children, placed with a relative, had not been in foster care within the meaning of subdivision (a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\"><em>Antonio F. </em>spawned a definition of foster care that was both unnecessary to the decision and wrong. The <em>Antonio F. </em>court found what it felt was the relevant definition in a statute dealing with the administration of the aid to families with dependent children\u2014foster care program (AFDC-FC), section 11251 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The definition of \u201cfoster care\u201d employed in section 11251 reflected a funding scheme in which dependent children placed with relatives received less aid than those placed with nonrelatives. Under the federal program (\u00a7 408(a)(l)(2), Social Security Act), children placed in foster homes\u2014AFDC-FC recipients\u2014were allowed greater monthly payments than those available under the basic AFDC programs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Although the federal statute did not exclude homes of relatives from the definition of foster homes, that is how California interpreted it. The idea behind that interpretation\u2014that neglected children placed with relatives need fewer services\u2014was discredited in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Youakim </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 125 [59 L.Ed.2d 194, 99 S.Ct. 957]. Disapproving an Illinois statute similar to California\u2019s, the Supreme Court found that there was no intent in the federal statutes to preclude children placed in the homes of relatives from AFDC-FC funds: \u201c[T]o differentiate among children who are equally neglected and abused\u201d because of the status of their court-appointed substitute parent is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 145 [59 L.Ed.2d at p. 209].) After <em>Miller, </em>the Welfare and Institutions Code was amended. Section 11400, replacing section 11251, now provides: \u201c. . . (e) \u2018Foster care\u2019 means the 24-hour out-of-home care provided to children whose own families are unable or unwilling to care for them, and who are in need of temporary or long-term substitute parenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Acceptance of the narrow definition of foster care articulated in <em>Antonio F., </em>and followed in at least one later case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> can have sad consequences, as this case illustrates. Stacy, who was placed with relatives, has hope of an immediate adoption. At the hearing, his uncle stated that he and his wife planned to adopt him as soon as he was eligible. An interpretation of \u201cfoster care\u201d as set forth in <em>Antonio F. </em>will preclude adoption of Stacy unless he spends one more year in the foster care of nonrelatives. Such a result would surely not be consonant with the purpose of the statute, as stated in section 232.6, to \u201cserve the welfare and best interests of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions are missing from his or her life.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Insofar as <em>Antonio F. </em>narrowly defines foster care and relies on former Welfare and Institutions Code section 11251, it is disapproved. The trial court correctly found that the three children met the threshold requirement of two years placement in a \u201cfoster home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Della contends that the judgment must be reversed for insufficiency of evidence to support the findings of the trial court on the remaining provisos of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>subdivision (a)(7): that the return of the child to the parent would be detrimental to the child and that, during the years of foster home care, the parent failed, and is likely to fail in the future, to provide an adequate home for the child or to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child. Our review of the record convinces us that there is ample evidence to support the requisite findings as to each of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">On October 13, 1976, when it became apparent that Della was providing less than minimal care for the children, they were taken from her custody and placed under foster care. The children were declared wards of the juvenile court under subdivision (a) of former section 600 (now \u00a7 300) of the Welfare and Institutions Code which provides for wardship of a child whose parents are either incapable or unwilling to exercise effective parental care or control.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the parents\u2019 incapacity or unwillingness to provide care or control continues for an extended period of time and there is no indication that they can or will rehabilitate themselves, they become subject to the potential termination of parental rights as provided in subdivision (a)(7) of section 232. In 1979, at the time of the termination proceedings in this case, subdivision (a)(7) provided a waiting period of two years during which time the offending parent might rehabilitate himself as a parent and regain full custody and control of the child. Albeit in dicta, we pointed out in <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514], that subdivision (a)(7) differed in some respects from the other subdivisions of section 232: \u201cThe section, accordingly, balances the interest of the child in secure and sufficient parenting with the conjoined interests of both parent and child in preserving the familial bond. The subdivision has the added advantage of permitting the parents a longer period, two years, in which to rehabilitate themselves to a position whereby they can properly support this most fundamental responsibility. Such an accommodation, inherent in the structuring of section 232, affords the fullest opportunity to the parents for exercise of their rights not inconsistent with the ultimate best interests of the child.\u201d (21 Cal.3d at pp. 491-492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The means by which the balancing of interests of which we spoke in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>is achieved is, of course, foster care. Legislative recognition that foster care is at best only a temporary solution and that the ultimate best interest of the child calls for stability and permanence was restated in 1980 in section 396 (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code) as follows: \u201cIt is the policy of the Legislature that foster care should be a temporary method of care for the children of this state, that children have a right to a normal home life, that reunification with the natural parent or parents or another alternate permanent living situation such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>adoption or guardianship are more suitable to a child\u2019s well-being than is foster care, and that this state has a responsibility to attempt to ensure that children are given the chance to have a happy and healthy life, and that, to the extent possible, the current practice of moving children receiving foster care services from one foster home to another until they reach the age of majority should be discontinued.\u201d At that time, the Legislature amended subdivision (a)(7) to decrease from two years to one year the time permitted the incapable or unwilling parents to rehabilitate themselves for resumption of parental responsibilities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Keeping in mind that our task is not to reweigh the evidence or to express an independent judgment thereon but merely to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support the findings of the trial court <em>(In re Angelia P. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 924 [171 Cal.Rptr. 637, 623 P.2d 198]; <em>In re Robert J. </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 894, 901 [181 Cal.Rptr. 188]), we examine the record to decide whether return of the three children to Della would be detrimental to them and whether she failed in the past and is likely to fail in the future to provide an adequate home for them or to maintain an adequate parental relationship with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Although subdivision (a)(7) focuses on the parent\u2019s failures <em>during </em>the period of foster care and the likelihood of failure in the future, a measure of a parent\u2019s future potential is undoubtedly revealed in the parent\u2019s past behavior with the child. <em>(In re Angelia P., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 908, 925; <em>In re Lynna B. </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 682, 700 [155 Cal.Rptr. 256]; <em>In re Norma M. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 110, 116 [143 Cal.Rptr. 412].) Thus, Della\u2019s relationship with the children before 1976 has relevance to her continuing and future capacity as a parent and, indeed, is the only indication of the quality of her parenting at a time when she was solely responsible for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\"><em>Background\u20141976. </em>Stacy, born in 1968, was for the first few years of his life cared for primarily by his grandmother (Margaret S.). In October 1970 Della had a second child, Tina, who was later adopted by Margaret S. Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Protective Services first became involved in 1971 when Margaret S. complained that she had the children and that AFDC payments to Della were being used to support the drug habit of Larry F., Della\u2019s boyfriend and future father of Laura and Tammy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Laura was born in April 1973, Tammy in April 1975. The children were buffeted by the stormy relationship between Della and Larry and neglected by Della except for short periods when she and Larry were reconciled. The children were reported to the authorities as sleeping in cars and begging for food. The family moved continually\u2014five times in one eighteen-month period\u2014and the children were \u201cfarmed out\u201d to whomever was handy, for days, weeks, months, or years. The dependency proceeding in 1976 followed a series of such placements: Della had given Tammy to a woman whose last name she did not know; Laura had been left with a woman herself accused of child neglect; Stacy, however, had been picked up by his paternal aunt and uncle several days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The condition of the children in 1976 when taken from Della reflected the inadequacy of their care. Stacy, then eight and of normal intelligence, functioned at the level of a child less than half his age. Laura, three and a half, born with severe physical disabilities,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> could not talk and would not walk (\u201chad to be carried around\u201d). Tests indicated that the child, a girl of normal intelligence, had a three-word vocabulary. Her teeth were rotten and her belly extended. Tammy, the youngest, was then a year and a half old. She never cried, nor did she acknowledge pain; she did not want to be held or to receive affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>Dependency period\u20141976-1979. </em>After the children were placed in foster homes Della was repeatedly counseled to get a job, establish a home\u2014she has moved 15 times in 1 year\u2014stay out of jail, and prove to the court that she could adequately care for her children. She followed none of the advice. During the first two and a half years of the dependency, she visited the children only sporadically. Between October 1976 and May 1978,' she made five of the scheduled biweekly visits with Stacy. Visits with Tammy and Laura occurred more frequently, especially during a three-month period when, pursuant to order of the court, the children were delivered to her by a social worker. On her own, Della kept less than half of scheduled visits and often failed to visit for one or two months at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Della has virtually never worked. Her brief forays into the job market, as a motel maid or housekeeper, usually ended within a week or two with her quitting without notice. How she supported herself is somewhat of a puzzle. During the winter of 1977 she apparently used Laura\u2019s social security check for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>own needs instead of forwarding it for Laura\u2019s foster care. She and her boyfriend were jailed at least once for refusing to deliver the checks to the court, as ordered. The record is silent as to other sources of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Six month\u00e1 before the November 1979 hearing which led to the order under appeal, Della\u2019s mother rented a one-bedroom apartment in Della\u2019s name. It is unclear whether Della actually lived there. About then Della began visiting the children more frequently. Two weeks before the hearing she married an agricultural worker with whom she had been living on and off for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Dr. Wuehler, a psychologist, examined the children in 1979 and testified for petitioner. He found that all three children had regained their ground intellectually and were prospering in their placements with substitute parents. Stacy was doing particularly well with his aunt and uncle, and the girls had formed strong bonds with their foster parents. He testified that all would suffer some anxiety if separated from their foster homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In Dr. Wuehler\u2019s opinion, it would have been detrimental to the children to return them to their mother. Although he had not examined Della, it seemed to him that on the basis of her past conduct she was incapable of attending adequately to the pressing needs of the three children. Laura had a particularly high risk of having future psychological, educational, and emotional problems; she would need a family that could deal effectively with her very special developmental needs. Stacy too had special problems because his attachment to Della, based primarily on \u201crole reversal\u201d (the need to protect his mother), was both misplaced and abnormal. Tammy\u2019s problems were primarily emotional; strongly and emotionally attached to her foster mother, she had only an \u201cintellectual\u201d attachment to her biological mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Dr. Wuehler concluded that despite Della\u2019s professed love for the children and their lingering attachment to her, Dell \u2019s inability to provide consistent parenting would be detrimental to them. He was reluctant to address the prospects for improvement in Della\u2019s capacities as a parent in the future but, based upon her complete failure to rehabilitate herself with the assistance offered by the county in the three years before the termination proceedings, there was no probability that she would be able to meet the responsibilities of mothering the. three children if they were returned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Based on this evidence, the trial court found that Della was \u201cnot capable, mentally or emotionally, to provide a stable home or environment for the children. Her apparent concern in the past has been the receipt of the funds provided by the government, or her own needs, rather than the well-being of the children. On those occasions when the children have stayed with Della, they were \u2018farmed out\u2019 with relatives or \u2018friends\u2019. The latter relationships were of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>extremely short duration and in fact could, in some instances, be classified as strangers. The mother has been on the move almost constantly, and has engaged in numerous living arrangements with various men. [1] Her present marriage to Ricardo does not enhance the aspects of stabilizing home and environment in that Ricardo, the present husband, is a migrant laborer and follows the crops. The renting of the present home is a result of Mrs. [S.\u2019s] efforts and does not appear to be those of Della\u2019s. Having a \u2018house\u2019 does not meet the definition of a \u2018home.\u2019\u201d The court concluded that Della\u2019s past and present record indicated that she had failed and would fail in the future to provide the children with the care needed and that it would be detrimental to the children to return them to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We recognize the gravity of the decision to terminate parental rights and that the granting of a petition for severance under section 232 results in an irrevocable break in the bond between parent and child. <em>(In re Angelia P., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 908, 928.) The Legislature has, however, directed the courts to balance the interest of the child in secure and sufficient parenting with the interests of all parties in maintaining the family. <em>(In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 491.) Subdivision (a)(7) is obviously directed to providing for the child what may be his last opportunity to achieve the benefits and comforts of a permanent family home. Viewing this record in the light most favorable to the judgment below, there clearly is substantial evidence that termination is in the best interest of the children. <em>(In re Marcos S. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 768, 781 [140 Cal.Rptr. 912].) The evidence demonstrates that Della depended, and at the time of the hearing still depended, on others to take care of her. She has shown few signs of becoming responsible for herself or the children and she has woefully failed to provide adequate care or maintain adequate relationships with the children in the past. The trial court was justified in concluding that her behavior and attitudes had not markedly changed and that she would not be an adequate parent in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Della contends that this is not the extreme case of neglect or abandonment which calls for the imposition of such a drastic measure as termination of parental rights, citing <em>In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 482, and <em>In re T. M. R. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 694 [116 Cal.Rptr. 292]. Neither of those cases involved proceedings under subdivision (a)(7). In <em>Carmaleta B. </em>we upheld a finding of neglect (subd. (a)(2)) where the children were originally removed from the parents\u2019 custody because of physical abuse by the father and where, after three years of foster care, there was evidence that the mother still did not appreciate the necessity of keeping the children from their father and could not be relied upon to live away from him if the children were returned to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In <em>T. M. R. </em>the termination of parental rights was based upon abandonment and neglect for a period of one year before the commencement of the action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>The charges were premised, however, on actions the mother had taken or failed to take during the year she spent in prison after conviction for possession of marijuana; the children had originally been made wards of the court because there was no one to care for them when the parents were arrested. In overturning the finding of neglect in <em>T. M. </em>R., the appellate court noted that, before she was deprived of her children, the mother had been a good and loving mother who gave excellent attention and supervision to her children. (41 Cal.App.3d at p. 700.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Contrast the case before us. The children were originally removed from Della\u2019s custody for a compelling reason\u2014her incapacity or unwillingness to provide even the minimal care and control to which they were entitled. The record is replete with evidence of her deficiency as a parent. It is true that Della was poor, but the hallmark of an effective parent has never been the parent\u2019s bank account. Children can be and are loved and nurtured in poverty-stricken families and deprived and neglected in affluent homes. In our view, this record simply demonstrates an extreme case of deficient parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">There was no conflict in the experts\u2019 evidence that Della cannot now provide them a home and that return of the children to her now would be detrimental. No expert was willing to predict the future in a positive way but the consensus was that it was unlikely, based on her past record, that she would ever be able to provide the kind of parenting to which the children are entitled. As the court summed it up: \u201cWhat of the future? Are the detriments of the present likely to be overcome or will they continue in the future? [f] Sadly, the answer is an unqualified \u2018No\u2019; Della\u2019s present conduct and past record indicate that it is extremely remote that she will ever be able to offer a satisfactory environment, home, emotional stability, or maternal maturity to these children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">It may be suggested that nothing be done, that the children be permitted to stay where they are.  As noted several times, however, the purpose of the statute permitting termination of parental rights is to \u201cserve the welfare and best interests of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 232.6; <em>In re D. L. C. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 840 [126 Cal.Rptr. 863].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To facilitate the stated goal, \u201cit seems indisputable that. . . the state as a <em>parens patriae </em>not only has a compelling interest but also a duty to sever the parental bonds once a situation contemplated by the statute arises.\u201d <em>(In re Eugene W. </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 623, 629 [105 Cal.Rptr. 736]; <em>In re D. L. C., supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d at p. 850.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>There is, of course, no specific proof that Laura and Tammy will be adopted or, indeed, that the now prospective adoption of Stacy will be effectuated. Neither, however, is there authority for the proposition that termination is improper unless there is an adopting parent waiting in the wings. The statute itself imposes no duty on the superior court to make an express finding as to the prospects for adoption of a particular child.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that the trial court here referred all three children to the California Adoptive Service for placement, impliedly finding that they were all appropriate candidates for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We take no issue with the proposition that the purpose of section 232 is to facilitate the adoption of minor children. We also recognize that some children are more \u201cadoptable\u201d than others and that a child\u2019s chances of obtaining the security of an adoptive home are lessened by emotional or physical handicaps. But for a child who faces, in all probability, perpetual foster care with no realistic chance for a stable home with natural parents, it can only be a plus to become legally eligible for adoption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are satisfied that the possibility of adoption for all of Della\u2019s children is at least as good or better than the possibility\u2014described by the court as \u201cextremely remote\u201d\u2014that Della will ever be capable of exercising parental responsibilities. Thus the termination of parental rights under these circumstances is \u201cthe least detrimental alternative\u201d for the three children whose only other realistic alternative is the limbo of perpetual foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In sum: the evidence amply supports the findings of the trial court and its disposition is entirely in accord with the legislative purpose of section 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Miscellaneous Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"A4A\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Adequacy of Services Offered to Della</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Della contends that the state\u2019s efforts to help her regain custody of the children were inadequate. The contention is without merit. It is true that where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>as here, the state initiates the termination proceedings, the trial court must consider, inter alia, whether appropriate social services were previously offered to help the parent regain custody. (See, e.g., <em>In re Lynna B., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.3d at pp. 701-702.) In its notice of intended ruling, however, the trial court concluded that the state, through the Child Protective Services, had done \u201call that is reasonably possible to do in order to help the mother accomplish the return of her children. \u201d The record supports the court\u2019s conclusion. From 1976 to 1979, Della was counseled by various social workers and advised of the changes she had to make in order to regain custody of her children. Her failure to win back the children indicates her lack of interest or capacity rather than the inadequacy of the services offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Standard of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Subdivision (a)(7) requires that the trial court make its findings on clear and convincing evidence, and the trial court expressly did so. Della\u2019s position is that the proper standard of proof in a proceeding to irrevocably sever all parental ties is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Trial counsel recognized, however, that the issue was then before us in <em>In re Angelia P., supra, </em>and conceded that resolution of that case would control the issue in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In February 1981\u2014a little over a year after the hearing in this case\u2014we filed <em>Angelia P., </em>rejecting the contention that in section 232 proceedings due process requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and holding that findings under any subdivision of the section must be made on the basis of clear and convincing evidence. The United States Supreme Court later reached the same conclusion in <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745, 769-770 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 617, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1402-1403].</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Independent Counsel for Children</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Della\u2019s final assignment of error is the failure to appoint independent counsel for the three children. Section 237.5 provided that in proceedings under section 232 the trial court \u201cmay appoint counsel to represent the minor.\u201d (Italics added.) In its notice of intended ruling, the trial court stated: \u201cFinally, the court did consider the necessity of appointment of independent counsel for the children. The court\u2019s familiarity with the juvenile court proceedings involving the children, the nature of the case, prior conversations with the children (and chamber sessions with the children during the trial) and a conclusion by this court that the children\u2019s best interests could be protected by the court, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>well as the respective positions of both counsel, all led to the conclusion that independent counsel was not necessary to protect the interests of Stacy, in particular, who is 11 years old, and those interests of the two little girls, Tammy and Laura.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">It is a function of an appellate court to see if a minor\u2019s interests were adequately represented <em>(In re Christina L. </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 737, 747 [173 Cal.Rptr. 722]). \u201c[W]hen the court finds a child has separate interests not protected in the contest between parents and a petitioner, the court must exercise its discretion by appointing separate counsel. \u201d <em>(In re Richard E. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 349, 354 [146 Cal.Rptr. 604, 579 P.2d 495].) But where \u201cthe proceedings are instituted by a public agency on behalf of a child that has been a dependent of the juvenile court for a number of years, counsel for the public agency can adequately represent the child\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>(In re Christina L., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 747, citing <em>In re Heidi T. </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 864, 876 [151 Cal.Rptr. 263].) Here the proceedings were instituted by a public agency on behalf of three children who had been dependents of the court for a number of years. There is no hint that petitioner\u2019s counsel overlooked the interests of these minors. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its decision not to appoint independent counsel for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Mosk, J., Richardson, J., and Hanson (P.

(A compilation is contained in Unger etal., Chaos, Madness, and Unpredictability . . . Placing die Child with Ears like Uncle Harry\u2019s (1977) Append. D.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">The trial court apparently considered the question of independent counsel <em>sua sponte; </em>no request for independent counsel is contained in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-11\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b776-8\">BIRD, C. J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A8fZ\">I dissent from section II of the majority opinion for I am particularly disturbed by the holding that the mother-daughter relationship must be terminated. As a result of this decision Laura and Tammy will permanently lose the right to see their natural mother even though there is evidence that their relationship has been a close and loving one. This relationship should not be permanently severed without some showing of adoptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Even a cursory glance through the statutory scheme (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232 et seq.) reveals a clear legislative intent that parental rights are not to be terminated unless there is at least some realistic possibility that the child or children will be adopted thereafter. In the present case, <em>no </em>evidence was presented to the trial court suggesting that either Laura or Tammy was adoptable. Indeed, the scant testimony relevant to the issue indicated they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>There was, however, undisputed evidence of a long, caring, and nonabusive\u2014albeit deficient\u2014relationship between the girls and their natural mother, Della. Thus, when the superior court terminated the fundamental mother-daughter relationship, there was neither a reasonable prospect of replacing so basic a bond with anything comparable nor any evidence that continuing the relationship would be detrimental to the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The majority\u2019s response to this is to ignore virtually all of the relevant statutes. Incredibly, they apparently believe there is no authority for the proposition that termination of parental rights should not occur in the absence of evidence of adoptability. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 838.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In this manner, the majority relegates these girls to continuing the status quo\u2014foster home placement\u2014except that the state has now excluded from their lives the natural mother whom they love and who loves them. This result not only undermines the black-letter intent of the Legislature, but is illogical as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The facts recited in the majority opinion regarding Laura, Tammy, and their mother Della tell less than the frill story. Della met Larry F. in early 1970. Thereafter a relationship began which lasted for about six years. In 1973, the couple had their first child (Laura) and, in 1975, their second (Tammy).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Della and Larry\u2019s relationship was not a happy one. The couple separated a number of times. Larry frequently drank to excess, used drugs, and on at least two occasions stole his disabled daughter\u2019s Social Security check to support his habits. Although there is no evidence in the record that Larry physically abused Laura or Tammy, he was violent toward Della. During the years from 1974 through 1976, Larry was convicted six times for driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">The family had several contacts with the county welfare department. Although Della had no marketable job skills, had barely reached the 10th grade in school, possessed only a \u201cvery basic\u201d ability to read and write, and appeared to be \u201csomewhat clumsy\u201d in performing mundane tasks of feeding, the department offered her no education, counselling, or training. Instead, they focused on Larry. As one social worker testified, \u201cThe department policy at that time was to focus on the man if he was an employable person in the home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">In September of 1976, Larry and Della separated again. Della had no income and no suitable place to live so Laura and Tammy remained with Larry. However, Larry unexpectedly appeared one day and returned the girls to Della. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>At the time, Della was staying with a cousin. According to her social worker, Della had \u201c no money, no way to keep them, no place to live, and [Larry] knew this when he dropped the children off with her.\u201d Larry again took Laura\u2019s Social Security check.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Della made temporary arrangements for the girls to stay with friends. The social worker found Della to be distressed over these arrangements \u201cbut she had no alternatives.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The social worker brought up the possibility of foster care and a formal dependency action. (Former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (a), repealed by Stats. 1976, ch. 1068, \u00a7 20, p. 4782. See now Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 300, subd. (a).) Della agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Accordingly, a section 600 petition was filed with the juvenile court. It alleged that Della \u201chas separated from the [minors\u2019] father and has no home or finances with which to provide for the [minors].\u201d The social worker noted that there was no allegation against Della of neglect, abuse, or molestation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In October of 1976, the section 600 petition was sustained, and Tammy and Laura were declared to be dependent children of the court. By early 1977, both girls had been placed in foster homes where they were living at the time the hearings were held on the petition to terminate Della\u2019s parental rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">During the first two and one-half years following the dependency hearing, there were, according to Della\u2019s social worker, \u201cperiods when [Della] moved frequently to the point she really didn\u2019t have a residence, and . . . other periods when she stayed in the same place for quite some period of time.\u201d Although Della repeatedly attempted to have her children returned to her by the court, her visits with them were erratic. She had no jobs skills, but did obtain employment on three or four occasions as a maid or live-in housekeeper. None of these jobs lasted more than three months. Della did not seek job training.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Beginning in the early spring of 1979, however, Della\u2019s situation improved considerably. Her visits with Laura and Tammy became both frequent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>regular. With her mother\u2019s help, she rented an apartment where she lived through the termination proceedings. She worked for much of the time as a babysitter or housekeeper. In the fall, she married a man she had been seeing for several years, Ricardo B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In late My of 1979, a petition was filed in the superior court to terminate Della\u2019s parental rights pursuant to subdivision (a)(7) of Civil Code section 232.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hearings on the petition were held in November. Those hearings produced considerable evidence of an abiding love between the children and their mother, Della. As the deputy attorney general conceded in her argument to the trial court, \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in this courtroom who doesn\u2019t believe that Della . . . loves her children, and that her children love her.\u201d The trial court agreed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">No evidence was introduced at the hearing to show that Della\u2019s relationship with Laura and Tammy was detrimental to the girls. There was testimony from a psychologist, who opined that returning the girls to Della\u2019s <em>custody </em>\u201cwould more than likely be detrimental than not [sz'c].\u201d In his view, this would occur because the girls would suffer from \u201cseparation anxiety\u201d if removed from their current foster homes and returned to the custody of their mother. He admitted, however, that separation anxiety can be expected <em>whenever </em>a long-term foster placement is changed. He was not asked, nor did he testify, as to whether maintaining the mother-daughter <em>relationship </em>would be detrimental to the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The proceedings authorized by section 232 are one part of a comprehensive scheme by which the state asserts its strong interest in the welfare of children. As was noted in <em>In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 696 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244], \u201cCalifornia has at least eight separate proceedings in which [child] custody questions can be litigated. \u201d The primary focus of this scheme is the welfare and best interests of the child. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 227; 232.6; 4600, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The termination of parental rights contemplated by section 232 is the ultimate contingency in the overall plan. It represents the total and irrevocable severance of the bond between parent and child. (\u00a7\u00a7 232.6, 238.) As the United States Supreme Court has recently emphasized, \u201cFew forms of state action are both so severe and so irreversible. \u201d <em>(Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745, 759 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 610, 102 S.Ct. 1388].) The child\u2019s emotional relationships with his or her natural parents and siblings are cut off. Any right to parental support or to an inheritance from biological family members is extinguished. The natural parents, in turn, are \u201cdenie[d] . . . physical custody, as well as the rights ever to visit, communicate with, or regain custody of the child. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 749 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 603], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">These are fundamental liberty interests which are at stake. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 753 and fn. 7 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 606].) They are \u201cranked among the most basic of civil rights . ...\u201d <em>(In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 688.) Moreover, the \u201cfundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.\u201d <em>(Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>455 U.S. at p. 753 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 606].)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Consequently, the parent-child relationship may be terminated under section 232 \u201c \u2018only in extreme cases of persons acting in a fashion incompatible with parenthood.\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Angelia P. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 916 [171 Cal.Rptr. 637, 623 P.2d 198], quoting <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482, 489 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514].) Termination may not occur in the absence of a compelling state interest,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and substantial evidence must support a finding that \u201csevering the parental relationship [is] the least detrimental alternative for the children.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Other provisions of statutory law permit a child to be taken from the custody of a deficient parent without extinguishing the parent-child relationship or terminating all parental rights. (See especially Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 300 et seq.) <em>Thus, resort to termination proceedings is both unnecessary and inappropriate unless, inter alia, the state intends\u2014and is reasonably likely\u2014to provide the child with a satisfactory long-term replacement for the otherwise permanent parental relationship that is being terminated. </em>In short, a termination of the fundamental parent-child relationship is normally appropriate only when adoption is realistically contemplated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Case law, legislative history, and black letter statutory language all confirm this obvious conclusion. The courts of this state have long recognized that the \u201cpurpose of [a section 232 action] is to facilitate adoption of the minor child.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of O\u2019Connell </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 849, 854 [146 Cal.Rptr. 26].<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, the statutory provisions regarding the termination of parental rights were originally transferred from the Juvenile Court Law to the Civil Code for precisely this reason: \u201cWhat is contemplated by court action under [the statutory predecessor to section 232] is not continuing guidance and supervision by a governmental agency, but freeing the child for adoption by a private person. This is essentially an adoption problem and, therefore, should be handled by the civil court handling adoptions. \u201d (Governor\u2019s Special Study Com. on Juvenile Justice (1960) pt. I, p. 23. See also <em>In re Jacqueline H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 170, 174, fn. 1 [145 Cal.Rptr. 548, 577 P.2d 683].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The language of the statutes themselves makes this point with unmistakable clarity. Thus, section 232.6 specifically states that the \u201cpurpose of this chapter\u201d in providing for the termination of parental rights is \u201cto serve the welfare and best interests of a child <em>by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home </em>when those conditions are otherwise missing from his or her life.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>The essential role of adoptability was recently underscored by the enactment of Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.25. (Sen. Bill No. 14, <em>ante, </em>fft. 5, Stats. 1982, ch. 978, \u00a7 27.) This section deals with the disposition by the juvenile court of children\u2014like Laura, Tammy, and virtually all children on whose behalf proceedings are brought under subdivision (a)(7)\u2014who have been determined to be dependent children of the court (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 300).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The pertinent provisions of the new law apply when a dependent child cannot be returned home and there is no \u201csubstantial probability\u201d of such a return within six months. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.25 [hereafter, \u00a7 366.25], subd. (d).) Under these circumstances, the juvenile court shall order the initiation of section 232 proceedings if \u201cthe minor is adoptable.\u201d (\u00a7 366.25, subd. (d)(1).) If, however, \u201cthe court finds that the minor is not adoptable,\u201d it orders the initiation of legal guardianship proceedings. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)(2).) Or, if there is no suitable adult available to become legal guardian, then some other plan is worked out for placement \u201cin a home environment that can reasonably be expected to be stable and permanent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Thus, a section 300 finding only entitles the juvenile court to order section 232 proceedings <em>if the minor is adoptable. </em>Even as to adoptable dependent children, however, the Legislature has specified three situations in which termination proceedings are inappropriate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the statutory scheme indicates that termination of parental rights is <em>not </em>appropriate if the outlook for the dependent child is for something other than adoption, i.e., legal guardianship or long-term foster care. Thus, adoptability has once again been revealed to be of critical concern to the Legislature in the area of termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">No evidence was presented to the superior court in the present case suggesting that Laura or Tammy was adoptable. Rather, the limited testimony touching upon this issue indicated they were not.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the superior court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>order terminating Della\u2019s parental rights placed the girls in the position of having neither a parent nor the realistic prospect of ever gaining one.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Moreover, there was no evidence that allowing the mother-daughter relationship to continue would be detrimental to either of the girls. Quite the contrary, both girls had had a long and loving\u2014if deficient\u2014relationship with their natural mother. \u201c[T]he importance to a child of continuity of parental relationships\u201d cannot be underestimated. (See <em>Adoption of Michelle T., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d at p. 706.) No purpose is served by permanently severing parental rights under these circumstances. Where, as in the present case, the natural parent has not abused the child, an inadequate parent is clearly preferable to no parent at all and is more consistent with the legislative scheme.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">It is, of course, correct that the primary purpose of the overall statutory plan regarding children is to promote the best interests and welfare of the child. But the role of termination proceedings within the larger context has been plainly stated by the Legislature. It is <em>not </em>to remove the child from the custody of deficient parents, nor is it to punish parents for their inadequacies. Rather, the explicit \u201cpurpose\u201d of termination proceedings is to serve the child\u2019s interests \u201cby providing the stability and security of an adoptive home ....\u201d(\u00a7 232.6.) If \u201cthe stability and security of an adoptive home\u201d are not reasonably likely to be achieved, and if no harm to the child flows from maintaining the existing parent-child relationship, then no purpose is served by permanently severing that basic relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Nevertheless, a majority of this court apparently believe there is no authority for the proposition that termination of parental rights should not occur in the absence of evidence of adoptability. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 838.) That belief is curious for it can be maintained only by ignoring the legislative history and virtually all of the relevant statutes. Unmentioned in the majority opinion are (1) the fact that proceedings to terminate parental rights were transferred from the juvenile court to \u201cthe civil court handling adoptions\u201d because the matter \u201cis essentially an adoption problem;\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (2) the Legislature\u2019s declaration upon enacting section 232.9 that its aim was to enable children in foster homes to \u201cbe placed in adoptive homes;\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (3) the fact that the juvenile court may order the initiation of termination proceedings only if it determines that \u201cthe minor is adoptable.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The majority opinion does mention\u2014but then ignores\u2014section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>232.6, which declares the purpose of termination proceedings to be to provide minors with \u201cthe stability and security of an adoptive home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">One result of today\u2019s decision is that, without even a whisper of justification, this court has effectively purged from the law of this state a valid, clearly expressed, logical, and consistent theme of the Legislature. On perhaps a more mundane level, two young girls have been cut off from their natural mother by the state, which has offered them no prospect of replacing what was lost. From any viewpoint, today\u2019s decision is harsh in the extreme, and I cannot subscribe to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Two other aspects of this case trouble me profoundly. Both relate to a warning sounded recently by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>455 U.S. 745. That court observed that termination proceedings similar to those authorized by subdivision (a)(7) of section 232 \u201cemploy imprecise substantive standards that leave determinations unusually open to the subjective values of the judge.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 762 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 612].) Noting that \u201cthe [trial] court possesses unusual discretion to under-weigh probative facts that might favor the parent,\u201d the high court observed that \u201c[b]ecause parents subject to termination proceedings are often poor, uneducated, or members of minority groups, such proceedings are often vulnerable to judgments based on cultural or class bias.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 762-763 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 612-613], citation and fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Support for these observations can, unfortunately, be found in the present case. Initially, while it is settled that an order to free a child from parental custody and control \u201cmust rest on present circumstances as well as past acts . . .,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the trial court discounted Della\u2019s current situation and singled out her marriage to Ricardo B. It reasoned that because the husband \u201cis a migrant laborer and follows the crops,\u201d the marriage \u201cdoes not enhance the aspects of stabilizing home and environment.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 836.) This reasoning is questionable. Certainly, there is nothing in the record to justify the conclusion which the trial court drew from Ricardo\u2019s employment. Rather, the court\u2019s statement seems to represent an erroneous \u201cjudgment[] based on cultural or class bias\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> about a worthy class of people, who in fact are perfectly capable of raising healthy children with much to contribute to the lives of us all.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">A second echo to the Supreme Court\u2019s warnings can be found in that portion of today\u2019s majority opinion which discusses the dependency proceedings at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>which Della lost custody of Tammy and Laura in the first place. (See cone, and dis. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 842.) It is the majority\u2019s claim that those proceedings demonstrate an \u201cincapacity or unwillingness\u201d to be an effective parent and thus support the view that Della\u2019s was \u201can extreme case of deficient parenting.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In fact, however, the dependency proceedings were based on allegations that Della \u201chas separated from the [minors\u2019] father and has no home or finances with which to provide for the [minors].\u201d The social worker who drew up the dependency petition specifically testified at the termination proceedings now under review that there was no allegation against Della of neglect, abuse, or molestation. In short, the dependency petition was sustained because Della was poor, recently separated, and had no place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">I do not criticize the local authorities for their response to what was thought to be a temporary, emergency situation. However, I question the majority\u2019s belief that these circumstances alone demonstrate an \u201cincapacity or unwillingness\u201d to be an effective parent. And if this alleged \u201cincapacity or unwillingness\u201d is in turn deemed to be evidence of \u201can extreme case of deficient parenting\u201d so as to justify termination of all parental rights under subdivision (a)(7),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> then it will indeed be the poor, the uneducated, and the minorities who are disproportionately subjected to proceedings to deprive them of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">I respectfully but vigorously dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Broussard, J., and Reynoso, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\">As the majority opinion notes, the family with whom Della left Tammy had previously been referred to the authorities for child neglect. However, neither Della nor her social worker was aware of that fact at the time Tammy lived there, and that family\u2019s case was no longer \u201cactive.\u201d There is no indication that Tammy was harmed or neglected in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Simply put, the dependency petition was sustained because Della was poor and recently separated. The majority opinion calls this a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d for removing the girls from their mother\u2019s custody, demonstrating \u201cincapacity or unwillingness\u201d to be an effective parent. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Prior to arriving at these foster homes, Laura and Tammy had been tried in two other foster care placements which did not work out. When they arived at what became their long-term foster homes, both girls were far behind in their development. Laura had an extended belly, which was the result of improper nutrition. This was discovered by a doctor. The foster mother testified she herself had not noticed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Della\u2019s change in status was noted by the foster parents of Laura and Tammy, as well as by court officers. Interestingly, Della\u2019s mother, who had called the welfare department on several occasions prior to the 1976 dependency hearings to report inadequate child care by Della and Larry, now supported Della in her attempt to keep her children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">All statutory references hereafter are to the Civil Code unless expressly provided otherwise. At the time of the court proceedings in the present case, section 232 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWI\">\u201c(a) An action may be brought for the purpose of having any person under the age of 18 years declared free from the custody and control of either or both of his parents when such person comes within any of the following descriptions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">\u201c(7) Who has been cared for in one or more foster homes under the supervision of the juvenile court... for two or more consecutive years, providing that the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that return of the child to his parent or parents would be detrimental to the child and that the parent or parents have failed during such period, and are likely to fail in the future, to do the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">\u201c(i) Provide a home for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">\u201c(ii) Provide care and control for the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-12\">\u201c(iii) Maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">\u201cPhysical custody of the child by the parent or parents for insubstantial periods of time during the required two-year period will not serve to interrupt the running of such period.\u201d Recently, the Legislature reduced the two-year foster care period to one year and added new paragraphs at the end of subdivision (a)(7).
