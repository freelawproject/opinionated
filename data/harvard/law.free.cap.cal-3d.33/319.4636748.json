The union contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a temporary restraining order directed against it. We conclude that the evidence should have been excluded and that the error in admitting it was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">This case arises out of a three-car collision on September 19, 1974, before sunrise. Striking union farm workers were about to picket a tomato field alongside a county highway. Encarnaci\u00f3n Avalos and his son Jesse, tomato sorters who had walked off their jobs to join the strike, parked their pickup truck along the right side of the northbound lane of the highway, near the edge of a dirt road leading to a tomato field east of the intersection. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence\u2014hotly contested by the union\u2014was that the Avalos\u2019 truck occupied 4 feet of the northbound lane and blocked 10 feet of the 24-foot wide dirt road. The Avalos\u2019 were waiting for the union picket captain to arrive so that picketing could begin. At least one other truck was parked in front of the Avalos\u2019 vehicle. Plaintiff Marcella Stafford, a hospital nurse, was northbound on the highway driving to work. A third vehicle, heading south, was driven by a nonstriking farm worker, Guadalupe Avilla. She had started to make a left turn toward the dirt road.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, she hit the Avalos\u2019 pickup truck, swerved and struck Avilla\u2019s car which was at least two feet over the line into plaintiff\u2019s lane.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff was injured. She sued the union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>on the theory that the accident was caused by the Avalos\u2019 truck protruding westerly onto the highway causing her to swerve and strike the Avilla car which had been left \u201cstuck\u201d two feet over the center line because the truck\u2019s partial blocking of the dirt road prevented Avilla from completing her left turn. The union\u2019s legal responsibility for the claimed negligent placement of the Avalos\u2019 truck was urged on two theories: (1) vicarious liability for Avalos\u2019 negligence as agent of the union, and (2) the union\u2019s own negligence in failing to direct and supervise the parking of the pickets\u2019 vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">A key procedural issue at trial was the admissibility of a temporary restraining order (TRO) issued against the union about a week before the accident. It prohibited the union in various ways from blocking access to the tomato field and barred other conduct such as rock throwing, violence, and threatening behavior. The union moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude all references to the TRO. After first holding that the order was inadmissible as unduly prejudicial and likely to cause unnecessary confusion and delay, the trial court reconsidered and allowed it into evidence, even though it had explicitly found that the TRO \u201cwas designed to protect growers and union people from violence and members of the public from violence by way of the strike and not simply negligent motor vehicle operation on a public highway.\u201d The TRO was read in full to the jury, referred to frequently during the trial, and emphasized in plaintiff\u2019s closing argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The jury found the union liable and awarded $100,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The TRO was irrelevant and prejudicial. The only issues at trial were (1) whether parking the pickup truck which may have protruded onto the highway and partially blocked the access road amounted to negligence justifying a finding of liability, and (2) whether the union was directly or vicariously liable for such negligent parking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The TRO which was not intended as a traffic control device had no bearing on either issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Although we have found no case discussing an injunction or TRO as relevant to the duty of care in a negligence action, the rule with respect to statutes is obviously analogous. In California, the relation between a statute and negligence is governed by Evidence Code section 669,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which codifies general judicially created doctrines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our courts have interpreted section 669 broadly, applying it to police department manuals <em>(Peterson </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 238, 245-246 [155 Cal.Rptr. 360, 594 P.2d 477]) and Administrative Code safety orders <em>(Short </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 104 [125 Cal.Rptr. 15]).  In any event, the law is clear and well-settled that for a statute or ordinance\u2014and, by analogy, an injunction or TRO<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014to be relevant to a determination of negligence, not only must the injury be a proximate result of the violation, but the plaintiff must be a member of the class of persons the statute or order was designed to protect, and the harm must have been one the statute or order was designed to prevent. (\u00a7 669, subds. (a)(3), (4); <em>Vesely </em>v. <em>Sager </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 153, 164 [95 Cal.Rptr. 623, 486 P.2d 151]; <em>Nunneley </em>v. <em>Edgar Hotel </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 493, 497 [225 P.2d 497].)  Here, even if a violation of the TRO was a contributing cause of the accident, the other two elements were absent. By its own terms the TRO protected only the class of tomato growers and those with whom they do business, not passing motorists. Even more vitally, the TRO was designed to prevent labor violence, not automobile collisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Plaintiff argues that though the TRO might have been irrelevant to a finding of negligence in parking the pickup truck, it was relevant on the question of the union\u2019s negligent failure to supervise its members. She points to testimony by Richard Chavez, a member of the union\u2019s executive board, that it was the union\u2019s responsibility to familiarize pickets with the contents of the TRO. This she contrasts with evidence from Encarnaci\u00f3n Avalos that he and the other pickets were \u201cnever told . . . anything.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The argument, if we understand it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>correctly, is that the union\u2019s lack of due care in omitting to publicize the contents of the TRO, is relevant on the question whether its alleged failure to tell the pickets where not to park their vehicles was negligent. In other words, the jury was invited to infer the negligent quality of the latter omission from the union\u2019s negligence with respect to the former. That, of course, is precisely what is prohibited by section 1104 of the Evidence Code\u2014itself a codification of existing law <em>(Towle </em>v. <em>Pacific Improvement Co. </em>(1893) 98 Cal. 342 [33 P. 207]): \u201c[Evidence of a trait of a person\u2019s character with respect to care or skill is inadmissible to prove the quality of his conduct on a specified occasion.\u201d (See also <em>Brokopp </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 841, 850-853 [139 Cal.Rptr. 888, 93 A.L.R.3d 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The TRO was, therefore, not admissible on the theory that the union\u2019s negligent failure to publicize its ban on obstruction of ingress into the fields implied negligence on the issue of lack of directions where to park. This does not mean, of course, that plaintiff was not free to prove and argue that the union, having caused the Avalos\u2019 truck and others to congregate at the scene, was under a common law duty to control their conduct in some fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Finally, even if the union\u2019s failure to communicate the portions of the TRO prohibiting the blocking of ingress to the field did have some bearing on union\u2019s negligence liability, there was no justification for admitting the entire TRO into evidence. It contained completely irrelevant and highly prejudicial paragraphs forbidding assaults, threats of violence and destruction of property. Thus the TRO provided in part: \u201c. . . it appears to the satisfaction of the Court . . . that unless a Temporary Restraining Order is granted as prayed for that Plaintiff\u2019s tomato grower members will suffer great and irreparable injury before the matter can be heard on Notice: [1] [The union must show cause that it] should not be enjoined and restrained during the pendency of this action from: ... [1] Injuring persons or destroying or damaging the property of Plaintiff\u2019s tomato grower members, their employees, agents, customers, contractors or of others; and from engaging in conduct calculated or likely to cause or causing injury to persons or damage to property, including, but not limited to, the throwing of clods, rocks, tomatoes or other objects. [f| .... [f] Molesting, assaulting, pushing, elbowing, shouldering or in any other manner unreasonably intentionally physically contacting the person or the clothing of any of Plaintiff\u2019s tomato grower members\u2019 agents . . . employees ... or others doing or attempting to do business with [them]; [t] Causing or inducing, or attempting to cause . . . any reasonable fear of physical molestation, injury or damage to person or property of Plaintiff\u2019s tomato grower members\u2019 employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We find no conceivable probative value in these paragraphs. The picture painted is one of a violent, dangerous, and irresponsible union requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>judicial curbing to prevent the impending \u201cirreparable injuries\u201d of bloodshed, property destruction, and wholesale intimidation. Undoubtedly the inference drawn by the jury was that the judge making such an order did so on the basis of reasonably grounded concern that the order was warranted by experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Nor did plaintiff\u2019s counsel fail to make the most of the erroneous ruling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The union\u2019s failure to comply with the TRO was, in his own words, the \u201ctheme\u201d of his closing argument. Counsel portrayed the union as deliberately bent on ignoring the law and court orders, as an organization that had to be punished, that needed to receive a \u201cmessage\u201d that courts and the law could not be ignored with impunity. \u201cWe have, I think, a lot of evidence that indicates that the Defendants were intent upon kind of doing what they wanted <em>without any fear of what our statutes are and even without any fear of what our superior courts say in the way of a temporary restraining order . . </em>. . [f] So, if they won\u2019t comply with being responsible; and they have been irresponsible, another word for negligence, then I think it would be good to send them a message; a telegram. . . [Wjhat it really keeps boiling down to, to me, is when you get to this stage of the trial, I think the question is, can they get away with it? Can they ask to have all the privileges and the rights and the protection of the law, on the one hand, and negligently and irresponsibly thwart it on the other? And the question is, can they get away with it? I think we need to send them a message\u2014and this will be the first of its kind\u2014that says, \u2018No, you can\u2019t.\u2019 I think we need to send them a message that says, <em>1 If you won\u2019t listen to the restraining orders </em>or the statutes, or you weren\u2019t being reasonable, then we want you to listen to this, here\u2019s our message: And the message is called a verdict.\u2019\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The erroneous admission of the TRO was clearly prejudicial. To be fair it seems highly probable that when the trial court first allowed it\u2014\u201cas one of the circumstances relevant to the common law negligence issue\u201d\u2014it did not anticipate that it would become the centerpiece of plaintiff\u2019s attack against union. Yet that is precisely what happened: Plaintiff\u2019s counsel adroitly turned a simple issue of negligence into an OSC in re contempt\u2014a referendum on whether the jury should \u201csend a message\u201d to union that restraining orders cannot be violated with impunity. None of this had anything to do with the simple issues of whether the Avalos truck was illegally parked and whether the union was legally responsible therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Broussard, Acting C. J., Mosk, J., Richardson, J., Rouse, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Feinberg, J.,* and Newsom, J.,* concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Defendant\u2019s version of the facts is that plaintiff struck the oncoming Avilla car and then sides wiped the parked Avalos pickup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Before trial, plaintiff dismissed Avalos and Avilla as defendants, preferring to seek damages solely from the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The TRO, which was also admitted as a written exhibit, read as follows: \u201c \u2018Upon reading the verified Complaint for Injunction on file in this action; the supporting Declarations and Points and Authorities filed therewith, and hearing the arguments of counsel, it appears to the satisfaction of the Court therefrom that this is a proper cause for the granting of a Temporary Restraining Order and an Order to Show Cause, and that unless a Temporary Restraining Order is granted as prayed for, Plaintiff\u2019s tomato grower members will suffer great and irreparable injury before the matter can be heard on notice: [5f] Now, therefore, it is hereby ordered that the above named Defendants are, and each of them is, ordered to appear before this Court at the Yolo County Courthouse, Woodland, California, on the 26th day of September, 1974 at 10:00 a.m., then and there to show cause, if any they have, why they and their officers, agents, representatives, employees and members and all other persons acting at the direction of, or in combination with, said Defendants, should not be enjoined and restrained during the pendency of this action, from: [K] (a) Picketing, standing, sitting, loitering, gathering, assembling, massing, parading, walking, stopping, or stationing, placing or maintaining any pickets or any other persons at, on, or within the facilities and properties noted in Schedule A attached hereto, or in the traffic lanes of a public street or highway, the use of which is necessary for ingress to or egress from said properties or facilities, [f] <em>Provided, however,: </em>[K] (1) that where there is regular ingress and egress to or from said properties, facilities or ranches from public roads customarily and regularly used by vehicular traffic, not more than three (3) pickets may be stationed within fifty (50) feet of each side of any said regular ingress or egress; [1] (2) that pickets shall not stand in, parade or march across any said ingress or egress or any public or private road in the vicinity of said properties, the use of which is necessary for ingress or egress to or from said properties, facilities or ranches, nor in any other manner physically interfere with or obstruct said ingress or egress of public roads in the vicinity thereof; [t] (3) that pickets shall not be upon the private property of Plaintiff\u2019s members described in Schedule A; [U] (4) that where there is public property adjacent to the private property of Plaintiff\u2019s members described in Schedule A, and there is compliance with all other requirements of this Order, the placing or maintaining of pickets on such public property is not hereby restrained, [f] (b) Parking or placing their vehicles in such a manner as deliberately to obstruct the free flow of traffic into and out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of said facilities and properties, [f] (c) Injuring persons or destroying or damaging property of Plaintiffs tomato grower members, their employees, agents, customers, contractors or of others, and from engaging in conduct calculated or likely to cause or causing injury to persons or damage to property, including, but not limited to, the throwing of clods, rocks, tomatoes or other objects.

We emphasize this because on appeal plaintiff refers us to certain unobjected hearsay testimony by the owner of the struck ranch that he had been told that the pickets had jumped off a truck, stood in the \u201centranceway\u201d to the field and shouted to nonstrikers not to enter the field. He \u201cguessed\u201d that this was when the accident happened. This testimony is quite uncorroborated and contradicted by two eyewitnesses, including Guadalupe Avilla. Suffice it to say that at the trial plaintiff was true to her pleading: this supposed conduct by the pickets was never\u2014not in the opening statement, nor in the closing argument\u2014cited as negligent conduct which had anything to do with the accident. We note this merely for the record and do not mean to imply that our holding with respect to the admissibility of the TRO would differ had plaintiff relied on the pickets\u2019 shouting as one of the causes of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Section 669 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) the failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if: [f] (1) He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity; [1] (2) The violation proximately caused death or injury to person or property; [U] (3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to prevent; and [K] (4) The person suffering the death or the injury to his person or property was one of the class of persons for whose protection the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The Law Revision Commission comment to section 669 explains: \u201cSection 669 codifies a common law presumption that is frequently applied in the California cases.

In the relatively short trial, the reading of the TRO itself covered six pages of transcript, and discussion of the TRO or its violation cropped up during the testimony of virtually every witness called thereafter, except those testifying exclusively about medical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">Plaintiff\u2019s witness DeBo, owner of the picketed field, testified about conduct of union members violating the TRO, and the TRO was mentioned explicitly in connection with the strikers \u201ccausing a problem in the entranceway.\u201d (See fn. 4, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aau\">The deposition of Richard Chavez had been taken by plaintiff and was read to the jury. At the deposition plaintiff\u2019s counsel had tried to establish what measures a responsible union takes in order to comply with a TRO such as the one in question. His questioning also suggested that the TRO was inimical to the union\u2019s goal of interfering with the successful harvesting of the struck farm\u2019s crop\u2014thus implying a basic conflict between the law and the union\u2019s aims.</p>\n<p id=\"ARQ9\">But the most constant and prejudicial references came during the cross-examination of the union\u2019s final witness, A1 Rojas, the union organizer in charge of the strike. The TRO was referred to several times during his direct testimony in connection with how it was communicated to pickets and how the union would ensure compliance. On cross-examination, after a series of questions about whether the union intended to portray itself as \u201crougher and tougher\u201d than the rival Teamsters\u2019 Union and whether it intended to \u201cinterfere\u201d with a grower\u2019s harvest by \u201charrassing his crops [sic],\u201d counsel asked Rojas, in reference to his wife, who was his assistant, \u201cDid you witness her being served with a restraining order, when she threw it at them and spat at them?\u201d Counsel referred several more times to the TRO and instruction of union pickets. He continually returned to the subject, discussing the union\u2019s desire\u2014or lack thereof\u2014to abide by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the TRO. \u201cQ: Do you remember saying, as an organizer for the UFW, that the court order\u2014 the union may not be willing to abide by a ruling that would cripple its strike against tomato growers? ... A: ... I may have said that. Q: Okay. So I understand that, if this court\u2019s\u2014Yolo County Superior Court\u2019s Restraining Order would in any way cripple your strike, then, in your opinion, you wouldn\u2019t abide by the Order? A: Well, that would depend .... [o]n the health and safety of people. Q; And you\u2019d be the person who made that decision, I guess, not the Superior Court Judge? A: I\u2019d make the decision . . . . Q: And you were to have been here Friday [when the witness in fact failed to appear] . . . ? A: My understanding, yes . . . . Q: You just sort of substitute your own judgment for the Court\u2019s Order generally, don\u2019tyou? . . .\u201d After a brief recess, plaintiff\u2019s counsel again went to the subject of the TRO, Rojas\u2019 potential disregard for it, and the contempt sanction for violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Assigned by the Acting Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
