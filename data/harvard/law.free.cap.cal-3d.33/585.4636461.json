J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJfJ\">Is a school teacher entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits where she was assaulted in her car immediately after leaving a school parking lot to go home from work under circumstances in which the teacher\u2019s car was immobilized by departing school children who blocked the traffic?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Petitioner, Sandra Parks, teaches kindergarten through third grade in the Los Angeles Unified School District. On January 17, 1979, she completed her workday at the 111th Street School in the Watts section of the city. Parks left the building and went to her car in the school parking lot. As was customary, she and a number of other teachers left work together for their own safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">On this day, Parks drove to the exit of the lot and turned left onto Compton Boulevard. After she had driven one to two car lengths on Compton, the traffic was halted by a group of departing school children who were crossing the street between the cars. Parks found herself in a line of cars, boxed in from both the front and the rear. She had no choice but to wait until the children cleared the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">At that moment, three youths pulled open the driver\u2019s door on Parks\u2019 car, wrestled her purse away from her and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">Parks was unable to return to work for three weeks as a result of the physical and emotional trauma from this assault. For a time after the attack she suffered pain in her left shoulder and experienced periodic dizziness. She also developed chronic anxiety about being alone and she became fearful when entering or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>leaving the school grounds. She requested a transfer from the 111th Street School and was offered a position at another elementary school in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Parks sought compensation for the disability resulting from the attack. Her claim was granted by the workers\u2019 compensation judge. However, on petition for reconsideration, respondent school district argued to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) that Parks\u2019 disability did not occur in the course of her employment because she had completed her workday and was on her way home when the injury occurred. The WCAB agreed and rescinded the award. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The issue presented by Parks\u2019 claim is a simple one. Does the fact that Parks was leaving her job after work and had driven a short distance down a public street at the time the injury occurred automatically bring her case within the proscription of the so-called \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A review of applicable authority demonstrates that Parks\u2019 claim is not barred by this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">This court\u2019s analysis must begin with the fundamental requirement of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that a compensable industrial injury occur \u201cin the course of the employment. \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is this requirement of the Labor Code that is involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">This statutory mandate has been clarified and defined over the years by the judiciary. One of the rules the courts have fashioned to aid in determining whether an injury occurred in the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d is the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. (See 2 <em>Hanna, supra, </em>\u00a7 9.03[3][a] and [b] and cases there cited.) Broadly stated, the rule prohibits compensation for injuries received by an employee while traveling to and from work. <em>(General Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 595, 598 [128 Cal.Rptr. 417, 546 P.2d 1361], hereafter <em>Chairez.) </em>Courts have reasoned that the employment relationship is suspended during this period and, therefore, injuries occurring when an employee is engaged in off-duty travel, off of the employer\u2019s premises, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>within the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>(Cal. Cas. Ind. Exch. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 751, 754 [135 P.2d 158]; see also <em>Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 598-600.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The going and coming rule, which appears simple on its face has been difficult in practice to apply. Charitably Justice Grodin has referred to it as a \u201cslippery concept.\u201d <em>(Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 528, 535 [163 Cal.Rptr. 750].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Justice Tobriner characterized its \u201c\u2018tortuous history\u201d as the \u201crecord of a raw issue.\u201d <em>(Hinojosa </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Problems in applying the rule occur chiefly in borderline cases where the employee is injured in close proximity to the employer\u2019s premises just before or after the workday. (See generally, 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15.00-15.15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Normally, when an injury occurs during the commute to or from work, the going and coming rule will apply to prevent compensation unless the injury can be found to fit within one of the many exceptions to the rule. <em>(Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 598-600.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the exceptions which has been devised to implement the rule in marginal situations is the \u201cspecial risk\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">An employee will be \u201centitled to compensation, if the employment creates a special risk, for injuries sustained within the field of that risk. Such a risk may attend the employee as soon as he enters the employer\u2019s premises or the necessary means of access thereto, even when the latter is not under the employer\u2019s control or management. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Freire v. Matson Navigation Co. </em>(1941) 19 Cal.2d 8, 11 [118 P.2d 809], hereafter <em>Freire; Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>This principle applies when the employee is entering or <em>leaving </em>the employer\u2019s premises. <em>(Makins </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1926) 198 Cal. 698, 701 [247 P. 202, 49 A.L.R. 411], italics added.) Furthermore, \u201c[t]he fact[ ] that an accident happens upon a public road and that the danger is one to which the general public is likewise exposed . . . do[es] not preclude the existence of a causal relationship between the accident and the employment if the danger is one to which the employee, by reason of and in connection with his employment, is subjected peculiarly or to an abnormal degree. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Freire, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d atp. 12; accord, <em>Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 329, 338 [170 P.2d 18], hereafter <em>Henslick, Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Synthesizing concepts from these and other older cases, this court in <em>Chairez </em>devised a two prong test to determine applicability of the special risk exception. <em>Chairez </em>held that the exception will apply (1) if \u201cbut for\u201d the employment the employee would not have been at the location where the injury occurred and (2) if \u201cthe risk is distinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than risks common to the public. \u201d <em>(Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 600-601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The California cases have not applied the special risk exception to an employee who sustains an injury on a public street only a few,feet from the boundary of the employer\u2019s premises while driving home directly <em>after </em>work. However, the special risk exception has been applied in two cases in which an employee was injured in an auto accident <em>before </em>work at or just outside the boundary of the workplace. <em>(Henslick, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 329; <em>Greydanus, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 490.) Consideration of these cases leads to the conclusion that the special risk exception applies here. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In <em>Henslick, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 329, the employee\u2019s route to work required him to make a left turn across on-coming traffic to enter the company parking lot. The worker\u2019s car was struck as he attempted to make the turn. He later died as a result of a ruptured aorta sustained from the force of the collision. The court in <em>Henslick </em>found that the required left turn was a special risk of Henslick\u2019s employment. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 338.) As a result, even though.it was not clear whether the accident occurred precisely on the employer\u2019s premises, the court held that the injury occurred in the course of Henslick\u2019s employment. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 337-338.) :</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The court noted that, in applying the going and coming rule, the term \u201c \u2018employment\u2019 has been held to include \u2018not only the doing of the work, but a reasonable margin of time and space necessary to be used in passing to and from the place where the work is to be done.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 336.) Furthermore, the <em>Henslick </em>court pointed out as did the court in <em>Freire </em>that if the employee is subject to a special risk, he or she is entitled to compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>injuries sustained within the field of that risk. (Ibid.; <em>Freire, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d at p. 11.) This would include injuries sustained in areas of access to the employer\u2019s premises even if such areas are \u201cnot under the employer\u2019s control or management. \u201d <em>(Henslick, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d at p. 336.) In <em>Henslick, </em>the fact that the employee had only entered the means of access to the employment premises did not bar compensation because the field of the risk to which he was subjected encompassed that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In <em>Greydanus, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 490, this court encountered another situation in which an employee was required to turn left into oncoming traffic to gain access to the employer\u2019s premises. In that case, unlike <em>Henslick, </em>the employee\u2019s car was fully on the public highway when it was hit by a vehicle as the employee was starting to turn left into the company parking lot. Relying on <em>Henslick, </em>this court again found that the injuries were compensable under the special risk exception to the going and coming rule. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 492-493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Principles similar to those followed in <em>Greydanus </em>and <em>Henslick </em>have been applied with equal force in cases from sister states involving post-workday injuries incurred off, but within a short distance of, the employer\u2019s premises. For instance, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has considered the problem of injury to an employee who had just turned her car onto a public street after exiting the employer\u2019s premises at the end of the workday. In <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Industries Corporation </em>(Me. 1973) 308 A.2d 860, a private road, open to the public but maintained and controlled by the employer, led from the parking lot to the public street. A condition on the private road created a blind corner at the intersection. The employee, on her way home from work, drove to the blind corner. She turned onto the public roadway and was struck by a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The Maine high court held the injury to be compensable because the hazardous condition on the employer\u2019s premises \u201cwas in fact a cause of the employee being injured after she had reached the street. \u201d (Id., at p. 863.) The court noted that \u201c \u2018whenever the hazards of employment spill over the boundary line and injure an employee on his way to work, his injury arises within the statutory space limitations of the employer\u2019s premises and is compensable as having arisen in the course of the employment. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>City of Saint Paul </em>(1957) 249 Minn. 53 [81 N.W.2d 272, 277].)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In a New York case, an employee of a towel supply business noticed three suspicious men outside the employer\u2019s garage as he entered the premises to park the company truck for the night. When he exited onto the sidewalk to walk home, the men were still there and he began to run. The men gave chase and assaulted the employee about a block away from the employer\u2019s premises. <em>(Notowitz </em>v. <em>Rose Towel &amp; Linen Supply Company </em>(1971) 36 App.Div.2d 543 [316 N.Y.S.2d 694], affd. (1971) 29 N.Y.2d 502 [323 N.Y.S.2d 975, 272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>N.E.2d 485].) The court sustained the compensation board\u2019s finding of compensability based on the fact that a special hazard existed which \u201cdid not permit . . . safe egress from the employment premises.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The teaching of these cases from sister jurisdictions as well as our own decisions in <em>Henslick </em>and <em>Greydanus </em>is clear. Compensation will be allowed for injuries off the work premises both before or after work if the injury occurs within the field of a risk created by the employment. This is true whether the employment creates a risk in gaining entry to the workplace or in exiting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In the present case, the WCAB relied upon our <em>Chairez </em>case to deny compensation. However, our decisions in <em>Greydanus </em>and <em>Henslick </em>indicate that the WCAB read <em>Chairez </em>too narrowly in denying compensation to Parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Chairez, </em>the employee parked his car before work on a street in front of the employer\u2019s premises and was struck and killed by a passing motorist as he alighted from the auto. <em>(Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 598.) The <em>Chairez </em>court found that the death did not fall within the special risk exception to the going and coming rule. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 601.) Although Chairez would not have been where he was \u201cbut for\u201d his employment, the court reasoned that being struck by a passing motorist was not a risk \u201cdistinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than risks common to the public.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">As in <em>Chairez, </em>the first prong of the test for application of the special risk exception is indisputably met in this case. It is clear that \u201cbut for\u201d her employment Parks would not have been where she was when the assault occurred. <em>(Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The WCAB, however, ignored the fact that the risk to which Parks was subjected also met the second prong of the <em>Chairez </em>test. Parks was <em>regularly </em>subjected at the end of each day\u2019s work to the risk of becoming blocked by school children in traffic and becoming a \u201csitting duck\u201d for an assault. The risk to which Parks was exposed, while common to the public at large was \u201cby reason of [her] employment . . . peculiarly and to an abnormal degree\u201d thrust upon her. <em>(Freire, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d at p. 13.) Her risk was clearly \u201cquantitatively greater\u201d than that to which passing motorists might be subjected on a sporadic or occasional basis. <em>(Chairez, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 601; see also <em>Bountiful Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission </em>(1926) 68 Utah 600 [251 P. 555, 556], affd. <em>sub nom., Bountiful Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Giles </em>(1928) 276 U.S. 154 [72 L.Ed. 507, 48 S.Ct. 221, 66 A.L.R. 1402] [regular exposure of an employee to a common peril creates a greater degree of risk and sustains a causal relationship between the employment and an accident resulting from the risk].) Parks\u2019 employment required her to pass through the zone of danger each day. As such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>her employment created a special risk in leaving the school parking lot. The going and coming rule may not be applied to preclude her from recovering compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">in.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The employee in this case was injured as she was beginning her commute home at the end of the workday. Ordinarily, operation of the going and coming rule would not permit compensation under such a circumstance. However, where the employment creates a special risk which extends beyond the boundary of the employment premises, compensation will be allowed if injury occurs within the zone of that risk. It is well settled that \u201cany reasonable doubt as to the applicability of the going and coming doctrine must be resolved in the employee\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>(Hinojosa, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 155-156; see also Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.) Here, a special risk, making the employee prey to the assault which caused her disability, had been created by the flow of children from the school grounds into the street with the consequent blockage of traffic. Accordingly, this court holds that the going and coming rule does not apply to bar compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board is annulled and this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The going and coming rule provides that, in the absence of special circumstances, an employee is barred from compensation for injuries suffered while traveling to or from the workplace. <em>(Hinojosa </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Indeed, it has been suggested that the rule should be discarded altogether as being out of touch with the dangers inherent in a modern commuter-oriented society in which travel to and from work may be more dangerous than work itself. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 206-207.) And, in fact, the rule has been abandoned in several foreign countries, including France and Germany. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 207, fn. 3.) The rule also has been abandoned in Michigan and New Jersey.

Labor Code section 3600 requires, as a condition of workers\u2019 compensation, that the injury <em>arise out of and in the course of employment. </em>I think the injury here did not so arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">In the absence of \u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances, the well established going and coming rule precludes an award of workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>tion for injuries suffered during the course of a local commute to or from a fixed place of business at fixed hours. We have repeatedly so held. (See <em>General Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 598; <em>Hinojosa </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 150, 157 [104 Cal.Rptr. 456, 501 P.2d 1176].) While an employer\u2019s parking lot is deemed a part of the employment \u201cpremises\u201d for purposes of applying the foregoing rule <em>(General Ins. Co., </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 599-600), petitioner was injured <em>after </em>she left the lot and <em>after </em>she had begun to travel on a public street. This was a normal, routine departure by petitioner from her place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Petitioner was not engaged in any \u201cspecial mission\u201d for her employer. She suffered her injury after working hours, away from her place of employment, as a result of the voluntary, criminal act of third parties wholly unrelated to her work. As we recently observed, \u201cThe \u2018premises line\u2019 has the advantage of enabling courts to ascertain the point at which employment begins\u2014objectively and fairly .... As Professor Larson has so clearly pointed out, \u2018[i]t is a familiar problem in law when a sharp, objective, and perhaps somewhat arbitrary line has been drawn ... to encounter demands that the line be blurred a little to take care of the closest cases. For example, one writer says that there is no reason in principle why states should not protect employees \u201cfor a reasonable distance\u201d before reaching or after leaving the employer\u2019s premises. This, however, only raises a new problem . . . because it provides no standard by which the reasonableness of the distance can be judged. It substitutes the widely-varying subjective interpretation of \u201creasonable distance\u201d by different administrators and judges for the physical fact of a boundary line. At the same time, it does not solve the original problem, because each time the premises are extended a \u201creasonable distance,\u201d there will inevitably arise new cases only slightly beyond that point\u2014and the cry of unfairness of drawing distinctions based on only a few feet of distance will once more be heard.\u2019 (1 Larson, [Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1972)] \u00a7 15.12, pp. 4-5\u20144-6; fn. omitted.)\u201d <em>(General Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Petitioner\u2019s injury was not compensable as job related unless some exception to the going and coming rule applies and the majority attempts to invoke the rule\u2019s \u201cspecial risk\u201d exception. This restriction is recognized when the employment itself has created a special risk of injury which is not shared by the public generally. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 600.) It seems obvious that the special risk exception is inapplicable here. The hazard which caused petitioner\u2019s injury, the \u201chit and run\u201d assault by unidentified criminals, was not \u201cspecial\u201d to her, nor was it a \u201cspecial risk\u201d of her employment as a teacher, nor was it \u201ccausally\u201d related to the school. It was a common danger to which the public in general was and is equally susceptible. Our holding in <em>General Ins. Co. </em>is enlightening. We there denied compensation where the applicant\u2019s decedent was struck on a public street by a passing motorist as he alighted from his parked car on his way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>work. We specifically emphasized that \u201cBut for his job, Chairez would not have been on La Cienega that morning. However, Chairez\u2019 death does not come within the second requirement of the special risk exception\u2014that the risk is distinctive in nature or qualitatively greater than risks common to the public. Chairez was parked on a public street at a time and in a location where parking is available to the general public. The fact that he was struck by a passing motorist, while tragic, is a type of risk the public is subject to daily. Moreover, nothing in the facts indicates Chairez was exposed to a greater risk from passing motorists than anyone else on La Cienega that morning.\u201d (Id., 16 Cal.3d at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The key question is whether \u201cthe danger [is] one to which the employee, by reason of and in connection with his employment is subjected peculiarly or to an abnormal degree.\u201d <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 28, 31 [227 P. 168]; see <em>Freire </em>v. <em>Matson Navigation Co. </em>(1941) 19 Cal.2d 8, 12 [118 P.2d 809].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The assault by unknown assailants on the occupant of a vehicle stopped on a public street was a wholly random and unforeseeable risk. Such a stop could occur anywhere on the street, and could have been caused by pedestrians in a cross walk, a red traffic light or a temporary traffic obstruction. It was shared by any and all members of the general public who were on the public street where it occurred. It cannot reasonably be said that petitioner, because of her work, was subjected \u201cpeculiarly or to an abnormal degree\u201d to the risk of this type of assault. The incident causing the injury here cannot fairly or reasonably be considered a risk that is special to petitioner\u2019s employment as a schoolteacher. In terms of time, location, nature, cause or source of the injury, it was not job related. As we stressed in <em>General Ins. </em>Co., we cannot say that \u201cthe risk is distinctive in nature or qualitatively greater than risks common to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The special risk exception not applying, the case is controlled by the going and coming rule. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board was correct in denying petitioner relief. I would affirm the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The petition of respondent Los Angeles Unified School District for a rehearing was denied April 20, 1983. Richardson, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
