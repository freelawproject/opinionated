J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5y\">Does the Public Employees Relations Board (PERB) have exclusive jurisdiction over a school district\u2019s complaint for damages resulting from a teachers\u2019 strike led by noncertified employee organizations?</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">This case, which began in the trial court over five years ago, is still in the pleading stage. It was before this court on one prior occasion. Although it has a complicated procedural history, the events giving rise to the litigation are essentially without controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Plaintiff is the El Rancho Unified School District (District). Defendants are four labor unions\u2014the National Education Association, its affiliates, the California Teachers Association and the El Rancho Education Association, and the California Federation of Teachers and its affiliate, the El Rancho Federation of Teachers (Unions).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">When the students enrolled in the District returned to school in the fall of 1976, they were met with a teachers\u2019 strike in which a large number of the District\u2019s teachers participated. The strike, which was called for and led by the Unions, lasted from the first day of school, September 13, 1976, until October 7, 1976, and allegedly cost the District over $1 million. At the time of the strike, none of the Unions had been recognized or certified as the exclusive representative of the District\u2019s teachers under the then newly enacted Education Employment Relations Act (EERA). (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3540 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>On March 31, 1977, the District filed an unfair practice charge with PERB, claiming that the Unions twice violated EERA during the strike. The District claimed that the Unions violated section 3543.6, subdivision (b) of EERA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by engaging in threatening, coercive, and intimidating conduct towards its teachers during the allegedly illegal strike. Such conduct, the District asserted, constituted unlawful interference with the teachers\u2019 exercise of their rights \u201cto refuse to join or participate in the activities of employee organizations,\u201d and \u201cto represent themselves individually in their employment relations with [a] public school employer.\u201d (\u00a7 3543.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the District charged the Unions with violating subdivision (a) of section 3543.6<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by demanding that the District meet and negotiate with them despite the fact that all were noncertified. According to the District, such action constituted an attempt to cause the District to interfere with the teachers\u2019 exercise of their alleged right to be represented in negotiations only by an exclusive bargaining agent of their choice. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3543, 3S43.3.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">On June 15, 1977, PERB\u2019s general counsel ordered the first of the unfair practice claims dismissed without leave to amend after concluding that the District lacked standing to assert its employees\u2019 rights. The District appealed and on December 30, 1977, PERB reversed this ruling and remanded the case to the general counsel for settlement or hearing. (See <em>El Rancho Federation of Teachers, et al. </em>(Dec. 30, 1977) EERB Dec. No. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">On September 30, 1977, while its PERB appeal was still pending, the District filed the present tort action against the Unions in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. Seeking actual damages of $1.1 million and punitive damages of $10 million, the District charged the Unions with (1) inducing the El Ran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>cho teachers to breach their employment contracts; (2) engaging in an illegal strike \u201cwhereby [the Unions] coerced or otherwise induced [the teachers] to refrain from rendering services\u201d to the District; and (3) conspiring to coerce and coercing the District to negotiate with the Unions in violation of section 3543.3 of EERA (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The Unions demurred to the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (a).)  More specifically, after properly invoking judicial notice of the PERB proceedings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Unions argued that PERB had exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute since it arguably involved unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">In support of their argument, the Unions directed the court\u2019s attention to section 3541.3 of EERA which vests PERB with the power \u201c[t]o investigate unfair practice charges or alleged violations\u201d of the act, and to section 3541.5, which declares that \u201c[t]he initial determination as to whether . . . charges of unfair practices are justified, and, if so, what remedy is necessary to effectuate the purposes of [the act], shall be a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of [PERB].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The Unions\u2019 demurrers were overruled on March 15, 1978. Undeterred, they petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of prohibition commanding the trial court to dismiss the action. Alternative writs were issued, but on July 19, 1978, the appellate court continued the hearing on the writs pending this court\u2019s decision in <em>San Diego Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 1 [154 Cal.Rptr. 893, 593 P.2d 838], \u00e1 case involving similar issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The decision in <em>San Diego Teachers </em>was filed in April of 1979. In it, this court held that PERB had exclusive jurisdiction over a school district\u2019s action to enjoin an allegedly illegal strike led by an exclusive representative, since the strike arguably constituted an unfair practice under EERA. <em>{Id,., </em>at p. 14.) However, this holding was explicitly limited to actions seeking \u201cinjunctions against strikes by public school employee organizations recognized or certified as exclusive representatives.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Following this decision, the Court of Appeal discharged the alternative writs issued in this case and denied the Unions\u2019 petitions. The only reason given for its action was this: \u201cIn light of the decision in <em>San Diego Teachers </em>. . . , relief by extraordinary writ is no longer indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Confronted with this unquestionably cryptic order, the Unions filed a petition for rehearing. When it was denied, they petitioned for hearing in this court. By order filed September 26, 1979, their petition was denied \u201cwithout prejudice to [their] right to seek reconsideration by the trial court of its prior rulings in light of the intervening decision of <em>San Diego Teachers </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Thus armed, the Unions returned to the trial court and promptly moved for reconsideration of the order overruling their demurrers. The trial court reconsidered its ruling and on January 14,1980, sustained the demurrers but gave the District leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The District subsequently filed an amended complaint. The first three causes of action in the amended complaint are virtually identical to the three causes of action stated in the original complaint. The only additions or deletions of interest are these. First, the District eliminated the allegation that the Unions <em>coerced </em>the teachers into participating in the strike. Instead, the amended complaint merely avers that the Unions \u201cencouraged, advised, and induced\u201d the teachers to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Second, the District added to the first and third causes of action an allegation stating that the District\u2019s unfair practice charge was \u201cdismissed\u201d by PERB and \u201csuch dismissal was stipulated by the parties to be without prejudice to [the District] in this litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the third cause of action now charges the Unions with conspiring to coerce and coercing the District not only to negotiate with the Unions in violation of section 3543.3 but also to enter into a collective bargaining agreement with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Finally, the District added a fourth cause of action. That cause charges the Unions with conspiring to cause and causing a violation of the California Compulsory Education Law by making it impossible for students to attend school by means of the allegedly illegal strike. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7 48200.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The Unions again demurred, and on July 15, 1980, the trial court finally sustained their demurrers without leave to amend and dismissed the action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Their victory, however, was short-lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The District appealed, and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment insofar as it dismissed the first and second causes of action. Although the Court of Appeal agreed that <em>San Diego Teachers </em>was controlling, it concluded that PERB had no jurisdiction over the Union\u2019s strike activity because there was no arguable basis on which the strike could be found to constitute an unfair practice under EERA. In all other respects, the trial court\u2019s judgment was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">This court granted the Union\u2019s petition for hearing because of the importance of the issues presented.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The principal issue presented by this appeal is whether EERA divests a superior court of jurisdiction to entertain a school district\u2019s tort suit for damages arising out of a teachers\u2019 strike led by noncertified unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">In <em>San Diego Teachers, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 1, this court held that PERB has exclusive jurisdiction over actions to enjoin strikes by public school employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>organizations recognized or certified as exclusive representatives under EERA. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 14.) This case, of course, concerns a suit for compensatory and punitive damages, not injunctive relief based on a strike led by noncertified employee organizations. Our holding in <em>San Diego Teachers, </em>therefore, does not directly answer the question whether PERB has exclusive jurisdiction over this action. It does, however, provide a starting point for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In reaching the conclusion that a superior court does not have jurisdiction to enjoin a strike by an exclusive representative, <em>San Diego Teachers </em>embraced the preemption doctrine developed by the federal courts under the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. [NLRA]). Noting the \u201cmarked similarities\u201d between the NLRA and EERA, as well as the broad powers expressly conferred upon PERB in section 3541.5<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this court concluded that the principles defining the preemptive reach of the NLRA are generally applicable in determining the scope of PERB\u2019s preemptive jurisdiction under EERA. (24 Cal.3d at p. 12; accord <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Modesto City Schools Dist. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 881, 890-891 [186 Cal.Rptr. 634].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is to those principles this court must look in deciding whether EERA preempts the power of a superior court to entertain a tort suit for damages under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Stated broadly, under the federal preemption doctrine, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is held to have exclusive jurisdiction over activities arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA. <em>(San Diego Unions </em>v. <em>Garmon </em>(1959) <em>(Garmon II) </em>359 U.S. 236, 244-245 [3 L.Ed.2d 775, 782-783, 79 S.Ct. 773]; see also <em>Local 926 </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1983) \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [75 L.Ed.2d 368, 378-379, 103 S.Ct. 1453].) As the Supreme Court has explained on numerous occasions, the aim of this rule is to avoid conflict \u201cin its broadest sense\u201d in the regulation of labor-management relations, \u201cconflict with [the] complex and interrelated federal scheme of law, remedy and administration.\u201d <em>(Garmon II, supra, </em>359 U.S. at p. 243 [3 L.Ed.2d at p. 782]; accord <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 180, 197, 202-203 [56 L.Ed.2d 209, 225, 228-229, 98 S.Ct. 1745]; <em>Farmer v. Carpenters </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 290, 305 [51 L.Ed.2d 338, 353, 97 S.Ct. 1056]; <em>Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 274, 285 [29 L.Ed.2d 473, 482, 91 S.Ct. 1909].)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Turning first to the arguably prohibited branch of the preemption doctrine, the Unions contend that the activity complained of by the District<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> arguably constitutes an unfair practice under EERA section 3543.6, subdivisions (a) and (b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The conduct complained of in the District\u2019s complaint is, of course, the Unions\u2019 strike. Count I charges the Unions with inducing teachers to strike and thus to breach their employment contracts with the District. Count II charges the Unions with engaging in an \u201cillegal strike,\u201d and count III charges that the Unions, by engaging in a strike, forced the District to negotiate and enter into a collective bargaining agreement with them in violation of its duty to \u201cmeet and negotiate <em>with and only with . . . </em>exclusive representatives ....\u201d(\u00a7 3543.3, italics added; see also \u00a7 3540.1, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The Unions first contend that the strike arguably could have involved a violation of section 3543.6, subdivision (b). This section makes it unlawful for a union \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees because of their exercise of rights guaranteed them by [EERA],\u201d including their rights to refuse to participate in union activity and to represent themselves individually (\u00a7 3543).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">PERB, the Unions suggest, might find that teachers were induced to participate in the strike at issue here against their will and by means prohibited by this section. Indeed, it might. In fact, in its unfair practice charge (and in its original complaint), the District alleged that the Unions engaged in coercive, threatening and intimidating conduct toward teachers during the strike. Moreover, under the test of coercion and intimidation which PERB has adopted, strike-related conduct will be found to violate section 3543.6, subdivision (b) not only when it is successful but also when, under the circumstances, it may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate employees in the exercise of their rights. <em>(Fresno Unified School District </em>(Apr. 30, 1982) PERB Dec. No. 208, citing, e.g., <em>Local 542, International Union of Operating Eng. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(3d Cir. 1964) 328 F.2d 850.) Accordingly, the Unions\u2019 strike could be found to involve a violation of section 3543.6, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Next, the Unions maintain that the strike arguably could have violated section 3543.6, subdivision (a). That section makes it unlawful for an employee organization to \u201c[c]ause or attempt to cause a public school employer to violate Section 3543.5.\u201d Subdivision (d) of the latter section, in turn, forbids a public school employer from \u201ccontribu\u00ed[ing] financial or other support\u201d to a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The Unions reason that \u201cmeeting and negotiating\u201d with a noncertified union constitutes unlawful support because a public school employer thereby accords a union which does not represent a majority of the employees in a unit the authority and status of an exclusive representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The assumption underlying this argument\u2014that the representation rights afforded noncertified unions are not equivalent to the representation rights afforded exclusive representatives\u2014appears well-founded. Exclusive representatives clearly have the right to \u201cmeet and negotiate\u201d with a public school employer. (\u00a7 3543.3.) Indeed, the term \u201cmeeting and negotiating\u201d is defined in section 3540.1, subdivision (h) as a process engaged in by the public school employer and an exclusive representative in a good faith effort to reach a binding written agreement. Noncertified unions, on the other hand, are given only an undefined \u201cright to represent\u201d their members, a right which terminates upon the selection of an exclusive representative. (\u00a7 3543.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In construing analogous provisions of the State Employer-Employee Relations Act (\u00a7 3512 et seq. [SEERA]), PERB has concluded that the \u201cright to represent\u201d conferred upon noncertified unions under SEERA (\u00a7 3515.5) does not rise to the level of the right to engage in negotiations looking toward a binding written agreement which is granted to an exclusive representative (\u00a7\u00a7 3517-3517.7). Rather, the \u201cright to represent\u201d encompasses a lesser right\u2014the right to meet with and present proposals to the Governor or his or her designated representative. <em>(Professional Engineers in California Government (PECG) </em>(Mar. 19, 1980) PERB Dec. No. 118-S, 4 PERC f 11045; see also <em>California State University (Sacramento) </em>(Apr. 30, 1982) PERB Dec. No. 211-H, 6 PERC 113115 [similarly construing the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (\u00a7 3560 et seq. [HEERA])].) By parity of reasoning, then, it would appear that the \u201cright to represent\u201d given noncertified unions under EERA does not encompass the right to engage in negotiations looking toward a binding written agreement which is given to exclusive representatives.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Not only is the assumption underlying the Unions\u2019 argument well-founded, so too is the argument itself. The Unions\u2019 assertion that an employer contributes unlawful support by engaging in \u201cnegotiations\u201d with a noncertified union finds substantial support in decisions of the federal courts interpreting section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(2)). Those decisions establish the general principle that the extension to a minority union of representation rights beyond those to which it is statutorily entitled constitutes unlawful support. (E.g., <em>Garment Workers </em>v. <em>Labor Board </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 731, 738 [6 L.Ed.2d 762, 768, 81 S.Ct. 1603]; <em>Pick-Mt. Laurel Corp. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(3d Cir. 1980) 625 F.2d 476, 482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Thus, two separate theories support the proposition that the Unions\u2019 strike was prohibited under EERA\u2019s unfair practice provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">This being so, only one question remains to be considered in deciding whether preemption is justified in this case under the arguably prohibited branch of the preemption doctrine. That question is \u201cwhether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to ... or different from . . . that which could have been . . . presented\u201d to PERB. <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. 180, 197 [56 L.Ed.2d 209, 225].) As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cit is only in the former situation that a . . . court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction necessarily involves a risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the Board . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 197 [56 L.Ed.2d at pp. 225-226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">A recent Supreme Court decision, <em>Local 926 </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 [75 L.Ed.2d 368], provides guidance for this case. There, the plaintiff sued a union in state court for causing his dismissal from a supervisor\u2019s position with a utility company. He contended that since federal labor law only prohibited a union from <em>coercing </em>an employer to discharge a supervisor, his state claim was distinct from that which he could have presented to the NLRB. Therefore, his state action was not preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The Supreme Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument on three grounds. First, the court reasoned that to the extent that the state cause of action \u201c cover[ed] coercive influence on the employer,\u201d it was identical to the federal unfair labor practice claim, and was, therefore, preempted. <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 379].) Secondly, if the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the union noncoercively interfered with his employment relationship were permitted to go forward, it \u201cwould . . . require the state court to decide in the first instance whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>[u]nion\u2019s conduct was coercive, and hence beyond its\u201d jurisdiction. <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 379-380].) The court held that \u201c[decisions on such questions of federal labor law should be resolved by the [NLRB].\u201d (Id., at p. \u2014 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 380].) Finally, the federal and state claims required proof of the \u201csame crucial element\u201d\u2014that the union caused plaintiff\u2019s dismissal. Thus, the court reasoned that the two controversies were \u201cthe same in a fundamental respect.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In this case, strikes are an unfair practice under EERA only if they involve a violation of the act\u2019s provisions. (See <em>San Diego Teachers, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 13.) As a result, the District argues that the issues which it could present in court are broader than the issues it could present to PERB. In the District\u2019s view, PERB would be concerned only with the existence of unfair labor practices\u2014asserted to be a minor aspect of this case\u2014and not with the harm to the District and to the public flowing from the allegedly illegal strike itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The District\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, the issue before PERB would have been whether the strike itself was unlawful as it was the means by which the Unions allegedly caused the district to meet and negotiate with them in violation of sections 3543.6, subdivision (a) and 3543.5, subdivision (d). Similarly, in its court action, the District challenges the legality of the strike itself. Thus, as in <em>Local 926, </em>the controversy presented in both forums may fairly be termed the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Second, and more fundamentally, the District\u2019s argument hinges on an assumption rejected by this court in <em>San Diego Teachers. </em>It \u201cpresupposes a disparity between public and PERB interests.\u201d (24 Cal.3d at p. 11.) As this court explained, \u201cThe public interest is to minimize interruptions of educational services. . . . [A]n identical concern underlie[s the] enactment of the EERA .... <em>PERB\u2019s responsibility for administering the EERA requires that it use its power... in ways that will further the public interest in maintaining the continuity and quality of educational services.'1'\u2019 (Ibid., </em>italics added.) Thus, there is little chance that PERB will ignore \u201cthe larger harm\u201d involved in a teachers\u2019 strike. Moreover, it is equally clear that PERB has the authority to take steps to alleviate that harm in order to effectuate its duties and the purposes of the act. (\u00a7 3541.3, subd. (n).)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Application of the arguably prohibited branch of the preemption doctrine is, therefore, fully justified in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">As an independent and alternative ground for finding the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction preempted, the Unions assert that their strike may be protected under EERA. They argue by analogy to decisions under the NLRA which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>establish that a strike which is otherwise unlawful may be found protected if undertaken in response to employer unfair practices. (E.g., <em>Mastro Plastics Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Board </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 270, 278 [100 L.Ed. 309, 318, 76 S.Ct. 349].)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">While conceding that EERA does not provide express protection for economic strikes,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Unions reason that strikes undertaken in response to unfair practices on the part of a public school employer\u2014i.e., unfair labor practice strikes\u2014may be ruled protected. That idea may seem anomalous. In fact, it is not. The proposition finds substantial support in this court\u2019s decision in <em>San Diego Teachers </em>which recognized that \u201cEERA gives PERB discretion to withhold as well as to pursue\u201d a remedy and that the overriding consideration is whether imposition of a remedy will effectuate the purposes of the act. (24 Cal.3d at pp. 12-13; see \u00a7\u00a7 3541.5, 3541.3, subd. (n).)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The proposition also finds support in a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court interpreting that state\u2019s Public Employment Relations Act (see Mich. Comp. Laws Ann., \u00a7 423.201 et seq. [PERA]). Although Michigan\u2019s PERA expressly declares public employee strikes to be illegal,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Michigan Supreme Court held, in <em>Lamphere Sch. </em>v. <em>Lamphere Fed. of Teachers </em>(1977) 400 Mich. 104 [252 N.W.2d 818, 824], that a public employer\u2019s conduct may convert an unlawful economic strike into a protected unfair practice strike. \u201c[D]espite the illegality of [a] teachers\u2019 strike, [an] employer\u2019s conduct may convert the economic strike into an unfair practice strike\u201d against which no remedy should be imposed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">It is equally clear that some of the <em>employer </em>unfair practice provisions contained in EERA are as applicable to noncertified unions as they are to exclusive representatives. Section 3543.5, for example, declares that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for a public school employer to . . . [|] (b) [d]eny to employee organizations rights guaranteed to them by [the act].\u201d \u201cEmployee organizations\u201d are defined as including both noncertified unions and exclusive representatives. (\u00a7 3540.1, subd. (d).) And, as previously noted, section 3543.1, subdivision (a) grants noncertified unions certain representation rights where, as here, no exclusive representative is present. Similarly, subdivision (d) of section 3543.5 prohibits employer interference with representation campaigns conducted by noncertified organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Thus, the strike at issue here may arguably involve unfair practices, if not on the part of the Unions then on the part of the District. In addition, the possibility of unfair practices on the District\u2019s side may properly be considered in determining the appropriateness of imposing a remedy against the Unions. Under these circumstances, this court can only conclude that the Unions are correct in their contention that the strike may constitute \u201carguably protected\u201d activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">This possibility provides a further reason for concluding that the District\u2019s tort causes of action are within PERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. (Cf. <em>Lamphere Sch. </em>v. <em>Lamphere Fed. of Teachers, supra, </em>252 N.W.2d at pp. 824-825.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">As the Supreme Court has explained, the arguably protected branch of the preemption doctrine \u201cunquestionably requires that when the same controversy may be presented to the . . . court or the [Board], it must be presented to the Board. But [this rule] does not extend to cases in which an employer has no acceptable method of invoking, or inducing the Union to invoke, the jurisdiction of the Board,\u201d unless there is \u201ca significant risk of misinterpretation of [the governing labor law] and the consequent prohibition of protected conduct.\u201d <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. at pp. 202-203 [56 L.Ed.2d at pp. 228-229], see discussion at pp. 199-202 [56 L.Ed.2d at pp. 226-228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Applying this rule to the case before this court, to the extent that the Unions\u2019 conduct is arguably protected, there exists a \u201cpotential overlap\u201d between the controversy presented to the superior court here and the controversy that might have been presented to PERB. <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 200 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 227].) Prior to granting the District an award of damages based on the Unions\u2019 strike, the superior court would of necessity have to decide whether the strike was protected under EERA. (See, e.g., <em>Imperial Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Rossier </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 33, 35 [112 P.2d 631].) Resolution of that question would require a decision as to whether the District had engaged in unfair labor practices. In a proceeding before PERB on an unfair practice charge, it too would have been required to make this same decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Moreover, it appears\u2014at least under the circumstances of this case\u2014that the Board could have obtained a PERB decision on whether the Unions\u2019 conduct was protected. It had only not to withdraw its unfair practice charge. In deciding whether a remedy should be imposed against the Unions, PERB could have investigated and determined whether the Unions\u2019 strike was protected.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Thus, application of the arguably protected branch of the preemption doctrine is also fully justified in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Having concluded that the Unions\u2019 strike was arguably protected or prohibited under EERA and that application of the preemption doctrine is fully justified under either prong, it follows that the superior court would not have had jurisdiction to enjoin the strike. <em>(San Diego Teachers, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 1; cf. <em>San Diego Unions </em>v. <em>Garmon (Garmon </em>I) (1956) 353 U.S. 26 [1 L.Ed.2d 618, 77 S.Ct. 607] [a court may not enjoin conduct arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA].) Nor does it have jurisdiction to award the District damages arising out of the strike. (Cf. <em>Garmon II, supra, </em>359 U.S. at pp. 246-247 [3 L.Ed.2d at pp. 783-784].)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">EERA establishes a comprehensive scheme of law, remedy and administration through PERB. <em>(San Diego Teachers, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 12.) In delimiting the areas of conduct which are within PERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, the courts must necessarily be concerned with avoiding conflict not only in the substantive rules of law to be applied, but also in remedies and administration, if state policy is to be unhampered. The United States Supreme Court put the matter well when, 24 years ago, it made the following observation. \u201cNor is it significant that [the court] assert[s] its power to give damages rather than to enjoin what the Board may restrain though it could not compensate. Our concern is with delimiting areas of conduct which must be free from . . . regulation [by the courts] if national policy is to be left unhampered. Such regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief. The obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy. . . . [S]ince remedies form an ingredient of any integrated scheme of regulation, to allow the [courts] to grant a remedy . . . which has been withheld from the . . . Board only accentuates the danger of conflict.\u201d <em>(Garmon II, supra, </em>359 U.S. at pp. 246-247 [3 L.Ed.2d at pp. 783-784].)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Through the preemption doctrine \u201c[b]oth federal and state courts seek to avoid conflicting adjudications which may interfere with [a labor] board\u2019s abili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>ty to carry out its statutory role, yet to permit court action when the board cannot provide a full and effective remedy.\u201d <em>(Kaplan\u2019s Fruit &amp; Produce Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 26 Cal.3d 60, 75 [160 Cal.Rptr. 745, 603 P.2d 1341].) As set forth in the foregoing discussion, it is evident that strikes by noncertified unions involve a grave risk of such conflicting adjudications. It is equally evident that PERB can provide a \u201cfull and effective\u201d\u2014though not identical\u2014remedy against such strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">PERB can assist in mediating employer-union differences when strikes occur or are theatened. It can seek injunctive relief, and if an injunction is violated, contempt sanctions may be sought. These remedies are far more likely to accomplish the Legislature\u2019s goal of \u201cfoster[ing] constructive employment relations (\u00a7 3540)\u201d and \u201cthe longrange minimization of work stoppages\u201d than an after-the-harm-is-done award of damages. <em>(San Diego Teachers, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 13.) Indeed, as the Michigan Supreme Court has explained, \u201cTo recognize alternative tort remedies would result in a substantial negative impact upon such purposes. It would encourage [precisely what happened here] . . . school board inaction. ...\u201d <em>(Lamphere Sch. </em>v. <em>Lamphere Fed. of Teachers, supra, </em>252 N.W.2d at p. 830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Moreover, \u201c[a] court . . . cannot with expertise tailor its remedy to implement the broader objectives entrusted to PERB.\u201d (24 Cal.3d at p. 13.) PERB, however, can, for \u201cEERA gives PERB discretion to withhold as well as to pursue, the various remedies at its disposal.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Accordingly, this court holds that EERA divests the superior courts of jurisdiction to entertain a school district\u2019s complaint for damages arising out of a teachers\u2019 strike led by noncertified unions. To paraphrase <em>San Diego Teachers, </em>PERB has exclusive initial jurisdiction to determine whether such a strike is an unfair practice and what, if any, remedies should be pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The trial court\u2019s order sustaining the Unions\u2019 demurrer to the District\u2019s complaint and dismissing its action is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-13\">All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">For ease of reference, an employee organization which has neither been recognized nor certified as an exclusive representative under EERA will be referred to as a \u201cnoncertified\u201d employee organization or union.

This court should no longer continue its hesitant, tentative ritual dance around the perimeter of this central legal principle, but honestly, openly, and forthrightly enforce it. The Education Employees Relations Act (EERA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3540 et seq.) does not create any exception to this rule in favor of public school employees. Accordingly, it is my view that courts retain their traditional jurisdiction to restrain and punish illegal public strikes, and the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) should be precluded from exercising exclusive jurisdiction over such strikes or from doing any act which either sanctions or encourages such unlawful conduct. <em>(San Diego Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 20 [dis. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Unfortunately, a majority of the court in <em>San Diego Teachers, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 1, ruled in favor of PERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction in illegal public employee strike cases.

With all respect, however, I suggest that California law pertaining to public employee bargaining has progressed beyond the common law stage, and that the Legislature has taken hold of the field in such a way as to cast substantial doubt upon the continuing validity (assuming it was once valid) of the familiar generalization concerning the illegality of public employee strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">That generalization got its start, in California, with a Court of Appeal decision in <em>City of L.A. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Council </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 36 [210 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>P.2d 305]. In that case, a group of building trades unions made various demands of the city\u2019s department of water and power. Among other things, they demanded a closed shop, reclassification of civil service positions to conform with craft jurisdictions and job classifications of the unions, and the fixing of pay in accordance with privately negotiated collective bargaining agreements. When these demands were not met, pickets were posted, and the union employees withdrew from work. The city obtained an injunction in the trial court, and the Court of Appeal affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The court began its analysis by observing that the constitutional protections which had been afforded strikes and picketing were subject to qualification for \u201cillegality of purpose\u201d; and this qualification extended to situations where the \u201cillegality consists of violation of settled public policy.\u201d It was therefore necessary to consider the \u201cpeculiar nature of public employment, and particularly ... the legal foundations of such employment in the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.\u201d (94 Cal.App.2d at pp. 42-43.) That \u201cpeculiarity\u201d consisted in the fact that \u201c[t]he employer-employee relationship in the city\u2019s service is governed by statutory law and administrative regulation; it is not fixed, either in whole or in part, by contract, as in the field of private industry.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 44.) Thus, it was \u201cself-evident that defendants may not, consistently with the public policy expressed in the Los Angeles City Charter, lawfully either strike or picket for the purpose of enforcing demands as to conditions of employment in respect to which neither the city nor the department of water and power is obligated to bargain collectively. To hold to the contrary would be to sanction government by contract instead of government by law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The premise underlying the court\u2019s opinion in <em>City of </em>L.A.\u2014that it is necessarily contrary to public policy to establish terms and conditions of employment for public employees through the bilateral process of collective bargaining rather than through unilateral lawmaking\u2014has since been rejected by the Legislature. The heart of the statute under consideration in this case, for example, contemplates that matters relating to wages, hours, and certain other terms and conditions of employment for teachers will be the subject of negotiation and agreement between a public school employer and organizations representing its employees. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3543.2, 3543.3, 3543.7.) Thus, the original policy foundation for the \u201crule\u201d that public employee strikes are illegal in this state has been substantially undermined, if not obliterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">There are, to be sure, other policies which might be asserted in justification of a ban on public employee strikes, or at least some public employee strikes (see, e.g., Wellington &amp; Winter, <em>The Limits of Collective Bargaining in Public Employment </em>(1969) 78 Yale L.J. 1107, and Justice Richardson\u2019s dis. opn. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number><em>San Diego Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 1, 15-18 [154 Cal.Rptr. 893, 593 P.2d 838]), but these policies are, to say the least, highly debatable. (See, e.g., Burton &amp; Krider, <em>The Role and Consequences of Strikes by Public Employees </em>(1970) 79 Yale L.J. 418; and, more recently, Hanslowe &amp; Acierno, <em>The Law and Theory of Strikes by Government Employees </em>(1982) 67 Cornell L.Rev. 1055.) And the Legislature itself has steadfastly refrained from providing clearcut guidance. The Education Employees Relations Act, for example, while excluding the application of Labor Code section 923 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3548 et seq.) does not expressly prohibit, or even mention, strikes. Under these circumstances, for courts to undertake resolution of the policy controversies through assertion of a blanket prohibition on strikes, independent of the statute and irrespective of the authority of the Public Employment Relations Board, seems quite inappropriate, even if constitutional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
