J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">This case presents two related questions. (1) Are the Trustees of the California State University and Colleges required to adopt regulations concerning the notice to be given temporary academic employees whose appointments are not going to be renewed? (2) If so, does the trustees\u2019 failure to adopt such regulations entitle an employee who is not reappointed to reinstatement or back pay?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Plaintiff, Terese Tiernan, is an archivist and was formerly employed in that capacity at California State University, Northridge (University). Defendants are the Trustees of the California State University and Colleges, and the University\u2019s president, vice-president, acting director of personnel, director of libraries, and director of the urban archives center.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">On November 30, 1978, defendants wrote to plaintiff, offering her an appointment as an archivist at the University\u2019s newly created urban archives center (Center). In their letter, defendants explained that the appointment was a temporary one, \u201cfor the remainder of the [1978-1979] academic year,\u201d but that it could be renewed \u201cat the option of the University, depending upon the status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of the . . . Center . . . and its funding.\u201d The letter also stated that the appointment was \u201csubject to the conditions of employment prescribed by the State of California,\u201d and set forth in the state Education and Administrative Codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Plaintiff replied immediately, accepting the offer and acknowledging its temporary nature. It is undisputed that this was an academic appointment. Plaintiff was given the rank of \u201clecturer,\u201d the title used to designate a \u201cnonpermanent academic assignment.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, \u00a7 42700, subd. (x).)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">During the course of the 1978-1979 academic year, the University applied for and was awarded a grant to fund a portion of the Center\u2019s activities for a three-year period, beginning in September 1979 and ending in August 1982. The grant proposal named plaintiff as the Center\u2019s archivist for each of the three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Even before the grant was awarded, the University offered to reappoint plaintiff to the position of archivist for a second year. In her letter of acceptance, plaintiff again acknowledged that the appointment was temporary and noted that it would expire at the end of the 1979-1980 academic year.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In November of 1979, plaintiff was informed that she might not be offered a third appointment. Subsequently, in May of 1980, the director of the Center met with plaintiff and told her that, on his advice, the University had decided not to reappoint her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to prevent the nonreappointment from appearing on plaintiff\u2019s employment record, the director offered to accept her resignation. He told plaintiff that, should she resign, he would give her \u201cthe most favorable recommendation possible.\u201d He further advised her that if she chose to contest her nonreappointment, he would \u201cdefend his decision\u201d and that she could not then be assured of receiving a favorable recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Plaintiff did not resign. Instead, she filed a written notice of grievance after receiving formal notice of her nonreappointment from the University. By letter dated June 11, 1980, the University acknowledged receipt of the notice, but informed plaintiff that her grievance could not be heard until \u201cafter the beginning of the new academic year on August 25, 1980,\u201d when the faculty reconvened. Soon thereafter, plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the Los Angeles County Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Relying on Education Code section 89534, plaintiff argued that defendants were required to adopt and follow regulations prescribing the \u201cform, time, and method\u201d for giving temporary academic employees notice of their nonreap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>pointment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to plaintiff, defendants\u2019 failure to adopt and follow such regulations rendered her nonreappointment invalid. Plaintiff further asserted that defendants infringed her First Amendment rights by conditioning their offer of a good recommendation on her agreement to resign rather than contest her nonreappointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The trial court held that section 89534 applies only to probationary employees \u201cwho ha[ve] a reasonable expectation of permanent employment,\u201d and not to temporary employees such as plaintiff. The court also rejected plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment claim, finding that the University offered plaintiff a good recommendation upon resignation merely as a courtesy and not for purposes of coercing her resignation. Finally, the court declared that plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust her administrative remedies would bar granting her relief in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\"> At the outset, this court must decide whether plaintiff\u2019s action is barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Executive Order 301 of the Chancellor of the California State University and Colleges (Executive Order) provides a grievance procedure for the resolution of disputes between the University and its academic employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under that procedure, plaintiff was required to attempt an informal resolution of her grievance and, if that failed, institute formal proceedings. This she did. However, plaintiff failed to pursue her formal grievance beyond the filing stage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>before seeking relief in the courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendants contend that this failure bars consideration of plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">It is settled that the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply where an administrative remedy is unavailable <em>(Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 802, 829 [140 Cal.Rptr. 442, 567 P.2d 1162]) or inadequate <em>(Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 342 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609]).  Plaintiff contends that her claims fall within this settled exception to the exhaustion doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">With respect to plaintiff\u2019s charge that her First Amendment rights were violated, it is evident that her claim falls within the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, not within the exceptions to the rule. Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the grievance procedure available to her was inadequate to resolve her First Amendment claim either because the grievance committee lacked the power to fashion an appropriate remedy or because this issue was beyond the scope of grievance resolution. Moreover, an independent review of the terms of the Executive Order discloses no reason to believe that the grievance procedure was not adequate to resolve this issue. Accordingly, since plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, present consideration of this claim is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">It is equally clear, however, that the grievance process was ill-suited to resolve plaintiff\u2019s other claims. The rules governing the University\u2019s grievance procedure provided no avenue by which plaintiff could have advanced her claim that the trustees had a duty to enact regulations governing notice of nonreappointment for temporary employees. Section 2.13.1 of the Executive Order puts \u201cmatters . . . which require . . . rule formulation and adoption [by] the Board of Trustees\u201d beyond the scope of grievance resolution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A parallel provision, section 11.4.3, specifically enjoins a grievance committee from including in its recommended orders \u201cany requirement that changes be made in rules and policies ... of the Board of Trustees.\u201d To the extent, therefore, that plaintiff seeks to compel the trustees to adopt regulations governing notice of nonreappointment for temporary employees, her action cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>be held barred by the exhaustion doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Compare <em>Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 802 at pp. 828-829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Similarly, to the extent that plaintiff claims a right to reinstatement or back pay by virtue of the trustees\u2019 failure to adopt such regulations, her action is not barred. It is evident that the grievance committee would have been compelled to refuse to recommend reinstatement in these circumstances. First, any such recommendation would include\u2014sub silentio\u2014the forbidden \u201crequirement that changes be made in [trustees\u2019] rules.\u201d (Exec. Order, \u00a7 11.4.3.) Moreover, it would necessarily and improperly contravene University policy. <em>(Ibid, </em>[\u201cthe Committee\u2019s recommendation . . . shall not be contrary to law, rule or policy . . . \u201d].) The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require a litigant to present his or her claim to an administrative body powerless to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">This court must next decide whether the trustees are required by statute to adopt rules governing notice of nonreappointment for temporary employees. Section 89534, subdivision (a) directs the trustees to adopt rules prescribing the \u201cform, time, and method\u201d of notice of termination or of nonreappointment for certain employees. Rules governing notice of termination must be adopted for \u201cprobationary nonacademic employee[s].\u201d Rules governing notice of nonreappointment are required for <em>\u201cacademic </em>employee[s] . . . <em>not having permanent </em>status. \u201d (Italics added.) Since neither temporary nor probationary academic employees have \u201cpermanent status,\u201d the statute\u2019s plain language requires rules governing notice of nonreappointment for both these groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Despite the statute\u2019s clear language, defendants maintain that the Legislature did not intend to require rules regarding nonreappointment for all nonpermanent academic employees, but only for those with <em>probationary </em>status.  However, if statutory language is \u201cclear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d <em>(Solberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 182, 198 [137 Cal.Rptr. 460, 561 P.2d 1148].) Unless defendants can demonstrate that the natural and customary import of the statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>language is either \u201crepugnant to the general purview of the act,\u201d or for some other compelling reason, should be disregarded, this court must give effect to the statute\u2019s \u201cplain meaning.\u201d (2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1973) \u00a7 46.01, p. 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Defendants attempt to find support for their position in the statutory framework. First, they point to section 89533, subdivision (a), which details the rights of <em>nonacademic </em>employees with regard to permanent employment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As defendants point out, the protection it affords is limited to those nonacademic employees with probationary status. Second, defendants note that section 89534 itself, insofar as it requires notice to <em>nonacademic </em>employees, requires it only for probationary nonacademic employees. Since the Legislature has restricted the reach of these statutes to nonacademic employees who are classified as \u201cprobationary,\u201d defendants aver that the Legislature must have intended similarly to restrict the reach of section 89534 to academic employees having probationary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The simple answer to this assertion is that if the Legislature had intended to so limit the statute\u2019s reach, it would have clearly said so. Moreover, an examination of the statutory context reveals a simple explanation for the disparity in the treatment of academic and nonacademic employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The law governing appointment, tenure, and dismissal of California State University and College employees is set forth in division 8 of the Education Code. (See \u00a7 89530 et seq.) For purposes of that article, <em>all </em>nonacademic employees are classified as either probationary or permanent. (\u00a7 89531.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>contrast, academic appointments may be temporary, probationary, or permanent (i.e., tenured). (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, \u00a7 42700, subd. (j).) The fact that the statutory scheme does not provide protection for temporary <em>nonacademic </em>employees, then, is simply irrelevant to the legislative treatment of temporary <em>academic </em>employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In a last attempt to avoid the express requirements of section 89534, defendants maintain that it is absurd and illogical to require notice of nonreappointment for temporary employees whose appointments have a fixed expiration date. According to defendants, such notice may reasonably be required only for probationary employees who have a reasonable expectancy of reemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The distinction that defendants seek to draw between probationary and temporary academic employees in this context is simply not persuasive. Both classes of employees are hired for annual appointments of fixed and limited duration. (See Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, \u00a7 43561.) It is true that only probationary academic employees can, by virtue of a certain period of service, obtain the right to be considered for tenure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Also, in some areas, probationary employees enjoy greater rights than temporary employees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The procedural protection provided by section 89534, subdivision (a) is, however, as vital to temporary employees as it is to probationary employees. A reasonable time, form, and method of notice of nonreappointment is an important safeguard for both temporary and probationary employees who may be required to seek other employment. Additionally, uniform procedures bolster morale by minimizing the risk of arbitrary or prejudiced procedures. <em>(American Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 91, 97 [59 Cal.Rptr. 85].) Thus, the Legislature could quite reasonably have concluded that the notice required by section 89534 was as necessary to temporary academic employees as it was to probationary academic employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Since there is no indication that the language of section 89534 is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent, this court is obliged to give effect to the statute\u2019s \u201cplain meaning.\u201d The statute requires the adoption of regulations governing notice of nonreappointment for all \u201cacademic employee[s] . . . not having permanent status.\u201d This class clearly includes temporary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">There remains the question of what remedy, if any, is appropriate.  Plaintiff assumes that the trustees\u2019 failure to adopt the rules required under section 89534 renders her nonreappointment invalid. Accordingly, she urges this court to order her reinstatement, or, if that is not feasible, to award back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s position finds some support in the law. Courts often hold that an agency\u2019s action dismissing an employee is void if taken in violation of the agency\u2019s own regulations. (See, e.g., <em>Layton </em>v. <em>Merit System Commission </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 58, 63 [131 Cal.Rptr. 318]; see also <em>Gratehouse </em>v. <em>United States </em>(Ct. Cl. 1975) 512 F.2d 1104, 1108 and cases cited therein.) In that situation, reinstatement may be an appropriate remedy. <em>(California Sch. Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Personnel Commission </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 139, 145-146 [89 Cal.Rptr. 620, 474 P.2d 436]; <em>Vitarelli </em>v. <em>Seaton </em>(1959) 359 U.S. 535, 545-546 [3 L.Ed.2d 1012, 1020, 79 S.Ct. 968].)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Where, however, the procedural error complained of is deemed harmless, neither reinstatement nor back pay is generally considered appropriate. <em>(Gratehouse </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 F.2d at p. 1108 [collecting cases]; cf. <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Nielsen </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 25, 28 [149 Cal.Rptr. 728].) In this case, plaintiff has not shown that she suffered any prejudice as a result of the defendants\u2019 failure to adopt rules regarding notice. As early as November of 1979, just two months after the beginning of her second appointment, plaintiff was warned that she might not be offered a third appointment. Thus, six months before the end of her appointment, plaintiff was put on notice that her reappointment was not assured. Under these circumstances, plaintiff might have been expected to initiate inquiries concerning her status. Instead, she simply awaited the University\u2019s final decision. She cannot now reasonably claim that she was surprised by that decision or that the defendants\u2019 failure to adopt and follow regulations requiring proper notice prejudiced her in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> Neither reinstatement nor an award of back pay is therefore appropriate here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The judgment of the superior court is reversed, with directions to issue a writ of mandate commanding respondents to issue the regulations required under section 89534.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Mosk, J., Kaus, J., Broussard, J., and Cologne, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Richardson, J., and Reynoso, J., concurred in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 10, 1983, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
