J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZB\">This case concerns the applicability of the harmless error doctrine to an appeal pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m). The question raised is whether the entire judgment of conviction must be reversed when the erroneously admitted evidence was directly relevant to some, but not all, of the counts to which the accused pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">In the early morning hours of December 21, 1979, Officer Peter Winston was patrolling a residential neighborhood of Stockton in his marked police cruiser. He had been assigned to investigate a recent series of house burglaries that had occurred in that area. Most of the burglaries involved similar means of entry. The burglar used a pipe wrench to break the lock of the garage door and gain entry to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">At approximately 1:30 a.m., Officer Winston saw the taillights of a small car traveling westbound on Stanfield Street. He became suspicious because it was traveling very slowly along the extreme right-hand edge of the,road. When the car would come upon another car that was parked parallel to the curb, it would drive around that vehicle and return to the curb line.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Winston followed at a distance of 50 to 70 yards. The headlights of the car were extinguished as the car turned northbound. It traveled another 50 yards and stopped. The officer pulled up behind the car, shined a spotlight on it and turned on his red light to let the driver know that he should not move.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">However, after looking back over his shoulder at Winston, the driver made a U-turn with his car. When the officer ordered him to stop, the driver accelerated. Winston quickly followed and turned on his siren. Immediately, the driver pulled his car over to the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, Jonathan Sorling, was the driver of the car and appellant was the sole passenger. A consensual search of the car disclosed a loaded handgun under the passenger side of the front seat. Winston also recovered a pair of needle-nose pliers, a screwdriver, a flashlight and a 10-inch pipe wrench. After additional officers arrived, both appellant and Sorling were transported to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">During an interview at the station, Sorling stated that he had seen appellant in possession of a sawed-off shotgun at a certain address. Two police officers accompanied Sorling to that location. There, the officers spoke with Louie Coultres, who told him that he had recently sublet a washroom attached to his apartment to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Following this encounter, one of the officers prepared an affidavit in support of a search warrant, relating the statements made by Sorling and Coultres. The affidavit did not contain any information pertaining to Sorling\u2019s reliability as an informant. A search warrant was issued and executed later that day. In the washroom, the police seized a sawed-off shotgun and numerous other items reported stolen in recent burglaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Sometime after these events, appellant was released from police custody. On January 25, 1980, Officer Christopher Bruno was patrolling the Stockton neighborhood in which the \u201cpipe wrench burglaries\u201d had occurred. Bruno knew that appellant was a suspect in the cases and that felony and misdemeanor warrants had been issued for his arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At approximately 3:50 a.m., Officer Bruno observed a 1967 Oldsmobile sedan driving very slowly along West Lane. When the officer looked at the person driving the car, the driver ducked. Bruno followed as the car turned southbound and stopped at a red light. The officer noticed that the taillights of the Oldsmobile were not functioning. He also concluded that appellant was the driver of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">After the traffic light turned green, Bruno continued to follow the Oldsmobile. He signaled the car to stop by turning on his overhead red light. However, the Oldsmobile accelerated, drove through a stop sign and made several quick turns. Two other police cruisers joined in the pursuit. Finally, the Oldsmobile was forced to stop when a police cruiser intentionally collided with the car, pushing it into a ditch along the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Appellant emerged from the driver\u2019s side of the car. A pat-down search revealed a loaded handgun in a holster under appellant\u2019s left arm. The police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>also seized a flashlight, a screwdriver and a pipe wrench from the right back pocket of appellant\u2019s pants. Officer Bruno looked into the car through a closed window and noticed a sawed-off shotgun protruding from under the driver\u2019s seat. After obtaining appellant\u2019s permission to search the vehicle, the officer also found a hypodermic syringe under the floor mat and a hypodermic needle, spoon and bindle of white powder (later determined to be methamphetamine) in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Appellant was charged in a 22-count information with 11 counts of second degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 4 counts of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021), and 1 count each of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496), unlawful possession of a hypodermic syringe (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4143), possession of a dangerous drug (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377) and reckless driving (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23103).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Pursuant to section 1538.5, appellant moved to suppress the evidence seized by the police from his rented washroom on the ground that the affidavit underlying the search warrant was inadequate. He argued that the affidavit did not contain facts establishing Sorling\u2019s reliability as a \u201cnoncitizen-informant.\u201d After the trial court denied the suppression motion, appellant negotiated a plea bargain agreement with the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Under the terms of this bargain, appellant pled guilty to six of the burglary counts (counts 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11). Of the six burglaries only one was directly linked by testimony at the preliminary examination to any of the stolen items recovered from the washroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Three of the burglaries to which appellant pled guilty had taken place after the date of the washroom search. Appellant also pled guilty to one firearm related offense resulting from the December 21st arrest (count 14) and three firearm related offenses arising from the arrest on January 25, 1980 (counts 17-19). In exchange for these pleas of guilty, the prosecution dismissed the remaining 12 counts of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The prosecution concedes that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from the rented washroom.  Since Sorling was not a \u201ccitizen-informant,\u201d his reliability had to be established either by a showing that he had given reliable information to the police in the past or by corroboration of his claims of criminal activity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 845, 850-854 [132 Cal.Rptr. 397, 553 P.2d 557]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scoma </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 332, 336-340 [78 Cal.Rptr. 491, 455 P.2d 419]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 172, 178-180 [162 Cal.Rptr. 171].) The affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant was totally silent as to Sorling\u2019s reliability. Therefore, it was constitutionally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Thus, the only issue raised by this case is whether the error committed by the trial court requires reversal of the entire judgment of conviction.  The state contends that the error should be deemed harmless as to those counts which were \u201cunrelated\u201d to the evidence discovered in the illegal search.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Analysis of the state\u2019s contention must begin with this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1]. There, the defendants were charged with murder, robbery and possession of marijuana. They moved to suppress numerous items of evidence discovered in several searches. The trial court denied the section 1538.5 motion in its entirety. Subsequently, the defendants and the prosecution entered into a plea bargain agreement pursuant to which the defendants pled guilty to murder in the second degree. The remaining charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On appeal, this court upheld the denial of the suppression motion with respect to the bulk of the evidence that the defendants had sought to have suppressed. However, three articles recovered from one of the searches were found to have been illegally seized. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 763-764.) This court rejected the state\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling was harmless and held that \u201cthe doctrine of harmless error is inapplicable in the context of an appeal under section 1538.5, subdivision (m). The accused must be afforded an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>personally elect whether, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the suppression of certain items of evidence would alter the situation in a sufficiently favorable manner so as to render a plea of not guilty strategically preferable.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 769, fn. omitted.) Accordingly, the judgments of conviction were reversed. The trial court was directed to vacate the guilty plea of any defendant who so requested and to reinstate all the original charges upon the motion of the prosecution. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 769-770.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">There were two bases for the holding in <em>Hill </em>that the harmless error doctrine was inapplicable. The first was \u201cthe magnitude of the consequences of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 769.) The court explained that an accused\u2019s plea of guilty involves the waiver of \u201cseveral of [the] most fundamental constitutional rights\u201d and may have extreme consequences, \u201cincluding the loss of one\u2019s liberty .... Consequently, only the most compelling reasons can justify any interference, however slight, with an accused\u2019s prerogative to <em>personally </em>decide whether to stand trial or waive his rights by pleading guilty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 767-768.) Implicit in this reasoning was the notion that in making a decision as critical as whether or not to plead guilty to the charged offenses, an accused must not be encumbered by an erroneous ruling on his motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The second justification for the holding in <em>Hill </em>was the \u201clack of an adequate basis\u201d for evaluating the impact of a trial court\u2019s error on a defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 769.) This court reasoned that when an appellate court determines that the trial court erroneously refused to suppress evidence, \u201cthe situation is altered, no matter how slightly, from that which existed prior to the plea of guilty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 768.) The harmless error concept is inappropriate because \u201c[tjhere simply is no intelligent means of assessing the impact of a particular erroneous refusal to suppress evidence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">A strategic decision to enter into a particular plea bargain hinges not only on the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, but also upon the probable effectiveness of the defenses and exculpatory evidence available to the accused. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, these matters normally cannot be determined from the record when no trial has taken place. Therefore, the <em>Hill </em>court recognized that \u201c[a]tier the exclusion of certain items of evidence, the prosecution\u2019s case may continue to appear invulnerable to an appellate court .... [Yet], the defendant may have or believe he has means of impeaching, discrediting or casting doubt on such evidence, and the items excluded on appeal might be the very ones which posed the most difficult strategic problems for the defendant. Only the accused and his counsel are aware of what favorable evidence is available to them.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Given these circumstances, this court concluded in <em>Hill </em>that an appellate tribunal could not \u201cconsistently arrive at an accurate assessment of whether the defendant would again plead guilty after knowledge that some but not all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>challenged evidence is to be suppressed. To the contrary, an unacceptable degree of appellate speculation would necessarily inject itself into the application of the harmless error concept in such a context.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><em>Hill's </em>holding that the harmless error concept is inapplicable to an appeal under section 1538.5, subdivision (m) was reiterated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 351 [128 Cal.Rptr. 5, 546 P.2d 293]. In that case, the defendant was charged with three counts of possessing controlled substances for sale. After his motion to suppress evidence was denied by the trial court, he entered a plea of guilty to one of the counts. The other two charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On appeal, this court ruled that the trial court had erred in refusing to suppress some of the narcotics discovered by the police in the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s business. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 358.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This error required automatic reversal of the judgment. \u201cWhen on such a record an accused withdraws a not guilty plea and enters a guilty plea pursuant to subdivision (m) of section 1538.5, thereby challenging the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on appeal, the judgment in <em>all cases </em>must be reversed for reasons we enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 731.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 357-358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The court further explained, \u201c[t]he evil of an attempt to measure the prejudice which an accused may suffer in the posture of this case derives from the speculation in which the appellate court is compelled to engage in an effort to determine prejudice. . . . Because we cannot measure the prejudice suffered by defendant without engaging in impermissible speculation, he is entitled to be restored to the position he would have enjoyed had the court properly ruled on the motion in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 358-359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Other jurisdictions are in accord with <em>Hill </em>and <em>Rios. </em>(See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weber </em>(1st Cir. 1981) 668 F.2d 552, 562 [citing to <em>Hill </em>as a \u201cwell-considered\u201d opinion]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State of Wis. </em>(7th Cir. 1977) 562 F.2d 440, 445-446 [citing to <em>Hill </em>in support of its holding reversing a guilty plea entered following an erroneously admitted in-court identification].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The New York Court of Appeal has analyzed this issue well. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1978) 45 N.Y.2d 366 [408 N.Y.S.2d 429, 380 N.E.2d 257, 264], that court pointed out that when a conviction is based on a plea, rather than a verdict, the question that must be asked is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ty that the [trial court\u2019s] error contributed to the plea . . . .\u201d However, \u201c[u]nlike a verdict, which must necessarily be based exclusively on the evidence submitted at trial, a defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty may be based on any factor inside or outside the record. ... [A] conviction based on a plea of guilty simply reflects the fact that for some reason, sufficient to the defendant, he decided to waive his trial rights. [Citation omitted.]\u201d {Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Nevertheless, the state argues that the harmless error doctrine should apply in this case. It is contended that <em>Hill </em>and <em>Rios </em>are distinguishable because in those cases the tainted evidence was relevant to all of the counts to which the defendants pled guilty. By contrast, some of the counts to which appellant pled guilty were not connected to evidence erroneously admitted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">However, this is a distinction without a difference. The disposition of the \u201cunrelated\u201d counts was not independent from that of the \u201crelated\u201d charges. Appellant and the prosecution entered into one plea bargain agreement which resolved all twenty-two counts of the information. The bargaining positions of the parties were determined, in part, by the aggregate strength of all the incriminating evidence accumulated by the state. Appellant undoubtedly negotiated for what he believed was the best disposition that he could obtain given the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. This objective may well have led him to plead guilty to \u201cuntainted\u201d as well as \u201ctainted\u201d counts. As in <em>Hill, </em>the denial of the motion to suppress evidence may have influenced appellant\u2019s decision to agree to the negotiated plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Indeed, the record does not indicate that any other factors motivated appellant to enter his guilty pleas. Nor does it disclose what defenses or evidence appellant was capable of producing on his behalf. In addition, suppressing the challenged evidence alters the bargaining positions of the parties from that which existed prior to negotiation of the agreement. The prosecution\u2019s case against appellant is weakened and some of the counts may have to be dismissed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For these reasons as well, this court is unable to conclude that appellant would have agreed to any of the same guilty pleas absent the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling on the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The state relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Punchard </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 995 [163 Cal.Rptr. 366] to support its contention that the harmless error rule should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>applied here. After the trial court erroneously failed to suppress evidence in <em>Punchar\u00e1, </em>the defendant pled guilty to one count of receiving stolen property. In accordance with the terms of the plea bargain, two other counts of receiving stolen property were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of conviction, holding that the items found during the illegal search were only relevant to the dismissed counts. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 998-999.) In <em>Punchard, </em>the court asserted that the \u201cdefendant pled guilty to a count to which there appears no conceivable defense and to which the error in failing to suppress had no connection and no effect. \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">This reasoning is flawed in two significant respects. First, Punchar\u00e1\u2019s conclusory assertion that the defendant had \u201cno conceivable defense\u201d flies in the face of <em>Hill\u2019s </em>recognition'that an appellate court is unable to determine from a blank record what defenses and evidence were available to an accused. Secondly, the Court of Appeal\u2019s assumption that the trial court\u2019s error had \u201cno effect\u201d on the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty to the unrelated count ignores the fact that the guilty plea was entered as part of an agreement involving all of the counts of the information. As explained above, the defendant\u2019s decision to agree to that particular bargain may well have been affected by the cumulative strength of the prosecution\u2019s evidence on all the charges. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 552-553.) <em>Punchar\u00e1 </em>is inconsistent with the rationale of <em>Hill, Rios </em>and this opinion, and, therefore, is disapproved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Not only is the harmless error rule proposed by the state inappropriate under the rationale of <em>Hill </em>and <em>Rios, </em>but it is also not practical. An appellate court will not usually be able to confidently determine from the record even the seemingly simple matter of whether or not a connection exists between the counts to which the accused pled guilty and the erroneously admitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Consider count 4 of the present case as an example. This count involved a burglary occurring seven days before the search of the washroom. At the preliminary examination, the victim testified that his house had been ransacked and that jewelry had been stolen. The schedule of evidence seized from the washroom contained a listing for jewelry. The prosecution did not ask the victim whether this jewelry found by the police was taken during the burglary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor were any other burglary victims asked to identify the jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">What additional evidence the prosecution would have introduced had appellant\u2019s case proceeded to trial is beyond this court\u2019s knowledge. The prosecution had no obligation to present its entire case against appellant at the preliminary examination. At a trial, the prosecution may well have elicited testimony from the victim linking the seized jewelry to the burglary of her house. Thus, even under the harmless error rule proposed by the state, it would be impossible to determine whether or not appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to count 4 was prejudiced by the tainted evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Finally, what the state fails to recognize is that a disposition reversing the entire judgment and returning the parties to the status quo is fair to the prosecution, as well as the accused. As this court has explained, \u201cthe concept of reciprocal benefits\u201d is critical to the plea bargaining process. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 208, 214 [145 Cal.Rptr. 686, 577 P.2d 1026].) \u201cThe state, in entering a plea bargain, generally contemplates a certain ultimate result. . . . \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 215.) The state may be seeking to have the accused subjected to a certain prison term or a particular number of convictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>If the harmless error rule suggested by the state were adopted, the \u201crelated\u201d counts to which the accused pled guilty would be reversed and the \u201cunrelated\u201d counts affirmed. This disposition would deprive the prosecution of the benefit of its bargain, while keeping the state bound to the dismissals won by the accused. By contrast, a disposition reversing the entire judgment and returning the parties to the status quo would provide the prosecution with the option of either renegotiating for a result similar to the one originally sought or going to trial on all the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">To apply a harmless error rule in this case would require this court to engage in the same type of speculation found to be impermissible in <em>Hill </em>and <em>Rios. </em>Therefore, appellant is entitled to have the judgment of conviction vacated and the pleas of guilty set aside. If appellant so elects, the state may reinstate all the original charges contained in the information. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 769.) However, as in <em>Hill, </em>appellant is \u201cnot. . . foreclosed from . . . electing] to be bound by the judgment[ ] and . . . not subjecting] [himself] to trial on the original charges.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the superior court. That court is directed to vacate the guilty pleas if appellant makes an appropriate motion within 30 days after this opinion becomes final. In that event, the court should reinstate the original charges contained in the information, if the state so moves, and proceed to trial or make other appropriate dispositions in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion. If no such motion is filed by appellant, the trial court is directed to reinstate the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Kaus, J., Broussard, J., Zenovich, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Woolpert, (W. R.), J.,* concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The felony warrant charged appellant with receiving stolen property, while the misdemeanor warrant charged him with a weapons offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Stolen property seized from the washroom was also linked by testimony at the preliminary examination to five of the dismissed burglary counts and four of the dismissed firearm violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Section 1538.5, subdivision (m) authorizes an accused who has pled guilty to seek appellate review of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lilienthal </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 891, 896-897 [150 Cal.Rptr. 910, 587 P.2d 706].) The state contended for the first time at oral argument that subdivision (m) does not permit this court to reverse those convictions as to which the illegally seized evidence was irrelevant. Neither the language nor purpose of the statute supports this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">In pertinent part, subdivision (m) states, \u201cA defendant may seek further review of the validity of a search or seizure on appeal from a conviction in a criminal case notwithstanding the fact that such judgment of conviction is predicated upon a plea of guilty. Such review on appeal may be obtained by the defendant providing that at some stage of the proceedings prior to conviction he has moved for the return of property or the suppression of evidence.\u201d The \u201cvaluable purpose\u201d served by subdivision (m) is that it allows an accused to preserve his claim of error for appellate review without \u201cthe delay and expense of a needless trial.\u201d (See <em>Ramis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 325, 332-333 [141 Cal.Rptr. 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Thus, subdivision (m) merely confers jurisdiction on an appellate court to review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence in a case in which the accused has pled guilty. The provision does not purport to limit the appellate court\u2019s authority to determine which convictions must be set aside upon a finding that the challenged evidence was improperly admitted by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In <em>Rios, </em>the defendant invited the police into his shop to investigate a burglary. One officer observed in plain view 3 ounces of marijuana, 1,000 sodium secobarbital capsules and 5,000 amphetamine sulfate tablets. This court held that the seizure of these drugs was proper. However, the subsequent seizure of an additional 13,500 amphetamine sulfate tables during a warrantless search of the premises following the defendant\u2019s arrest was found to be illegal. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The prosecution\u2019s case is weakened with respect to both the \u201ctainted\u201d and \u201cuntainted\u201d counts. Obtaining convictions on the \u201ctainted\u201d charges becomes more difficult because evidence directly probative of appellant\u2019s guilt is now inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Suppressing the evidence also has an effect on the trial of the \u201cuntainted\u201d offenses. Generally, a jury is more apt to convict an accused of charged offenses if it believes that he has committed other crimes. (See Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) Circumstantial Evidence, \u00a7 340, p. 299.) Here, if absent the inadmissible evidence the prosecution cannot prove at trial that appellant is guilty of the \u201ctainted\u201d offenses, the jury may be less likely to believe that appellant had the criminal propensity to commit the \u201cuntainted\u201d counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The state also claims that footnote 36 of the <em>Hill </em>opinion suggests that <em>Hill </em>is not controlling in the present case. In that footnote, the court observed that \u201c[flhere is no basis whatsoever for concluding that the items which we hold to be inadmissible are in fact unconnected to the murder or would be irrelevant to the prosecution\u2019s case against defendants. Indeed, the opposite conclusion seems unavoidable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Several factors indicate that the state is reading too much into this statement. The footnote appears to have been written solely for the purpose of rebutting the dissent\u2019s assertion that the court could not determine from the appellate record whether the erroneously admitted evidence was \u201cextremely incriminating.\u201d (Id., at p. 771 (conc. and dis. opn. of Clark, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">In addition, the question of whether the harmless error rule would have applied had the tainted evidence been relevant only to the dismissed charges was obviously not before the <em>Hill </em>court. The opinion did not resolve that issue. Finally, given <em>Hill\u2019s </em>emphasis on the inability of an appellate tribunal to determine from a blank record what factors motivated an accused to plead guilty, it is improbable that <em>Hill </em>intended to exempt from its ruling cases like the present one. These factors undermine the state\u2019s reliance on footnote 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">ProbabIe cause to hold appellant to answer for this burglary was based on a police officer\u2019s testimony that appellant\u2019s fingerprints were lifted from the burglary scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The same is true with respect to appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to count 6. This burglary was committed four days before the search of the washroom. At the preliminary examination, the victim testified that she returned home to find her house ransacked. However, the prosecution did not ask whether any of the property recovered from appellant\u2019s washroom had been stolen from her home. Since not all of the items listed in the schedule of seized evidence were accounted for by the other burglary victims, the possibility may not be discounted that at a trial, the prosecution would have connected some tainted evidence to count 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">In addition, even the disposition of the counts involving burglaries occurring after the date of the search may have been prejudiced by the illegally seized evidence. Almost all of the burglaries that appellant was charged with committing occurred in the same residential neighborhood and involved similar means of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Consequently, the prosecution\u2019s use of the illegally seized property to bolster its case with respect to the \u201ccontaminated\u201d burglary counts was likely to make conviction of the \u201cuntainted\u201d counts easier. Once the jury believed that appellant had committed the \u201ctainted\u201d burglaries, it would have been more apt to find appellant guilty of the other counts because of the similarities involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b515-11\">For example, the record in the present case indicates that the prosecution\u2019s objective in agreeing to the plea bargain was to ensure that appellant served a six-year prison term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b516-8\">KAUS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoI1\">I concur in and have signed the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion which, I believe, is foreordained by <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 767-769 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1]. In the past, <em>Hill </em>has led to some logically correct, but practically rather bizarre, reversals. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 351 [128 Cal.Rptr. 5, 546 P.2d 293] [5,000 tablets legally seized, 13,500 taken illegally; plea to <em>one </em>count of possession for sale reversed].) The problem is, of course, that a guilty plea followed by a successful appeal under section 1538.5, subdivision (m) of the Penal Code does not permit an appellate assessment of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Pending a legislative solution, it occurs to me that one way for a prosecutor to avoid unnecessary reversals is to stipulate, before the plea bargain is entered into, that certain evidence, the seizure of which may not be upheld on appeal, will not be used if the case were to go to trial. It is only a guess, of course, but a pretty safe one that if in the case at bar there had been a stipulation that the items seized in the washroom would not be offered at the trial\u2014and the counts dependent on them dismissed\u2014there would still have been a plea bargain to a number of counts and that the punishment meted out to defendant would not have been materially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">I may, of course, be suggesting something which is already routinely taking place in our trial courts. If so, I apologize.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b517-6\">RICHARDSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, defendant, having pleaded guilty to several counts which are wholly unrelated to those counts which are \u201ctainted\u201d by an erroneous suppression ruling, should not be permitted to withdraw his pleas to the former counts merely because he appealed successfully from convictions on the latter counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Although the People have conceded that the evidence obtained during the search of the washroom should have been ordered suppressed, most of the charges to which defendant pleaded guilty were not based, either in whole or in part, upon that evidence. Indeed, the record indicates that only one undismissed burglary charge was based upon evidence which was discovered in the course of, or as a result of, the illegal search. The important issue before us is whether, under such circumstances, defendant is entitled to a reversal of his conviction as to <em>all </em>counts, and an opportunity to withdraw his guilty pleas to those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Defendant\u2019s right to appellate review of the convictions entered upon his pleas of guilty is necessarily based upon subdivision (m) of section 1538.5 of the Penal Code. As we recently acknowledged, \u201cSubdivision (m) constitutes an exception to the rule that all errors arising prior to entry of a guilty plea are waived, except those which question the jurisdiction or legality of the proceedings. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lilienthal </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 891, 897 [150 Cal.Rptr. 910, 587 P.2d 706]; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237.5.) In pertinent part, subdivision (m) provides that \u201cA defendant may seek further review of the validity of a search or seizure on appeal from a conviction in a criminal case notwithstanding the fact that such judgment of conviction is predicated upon a plea of guilty. Such review on appeal may be obtained by the defendant providing that at some stage of the proceedings prior to conviction he has moved for the return of property or the suppression of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In light of the foregoing statutory prerequisite of a prior motion to suppress evidence or return property, it seems apparent to me that authorization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>review under subdivision (m) extends only to those charges which were based upon an assertedly unlawful search or seizure. Reasonably construed, subdivision (m) does not suspend the finality of <em>all </em>guilty pleas entered by a defendant in a multicount proceeding, but only those pleas to charges which have been previously challenged by a motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Defendant asserts that because his guilty pleas were part of a plea bargain, he should be permitted to withdraw all those pleas, including the ones relating to those counts which are wholly \u201cuntainted\u201d by any illegally obtained evidence. Subdivision (m) does not create any such right, however, and the applicable cases have allowed a withdrawal of guilty pleas only if the pleas related to charges previously challenged by a suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1], defendants had pleaded guilty to first degree murder pursuant to a plea bargain in which certain other charges were dismissed. Defendants appealed from the judgments of conviction, alleging that the trial court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence. We held that although the \u201cbulk\u201d of the evidence was lawfully seized and was properly admissible, at least some of the evidence should have been ordered suppressed. (P. 767.) Accordingly, we ruled that defendants were entitled to elect whether, \u201cthe suppression of certain items of evidence would alter the situation in a sufficiently favorable manner so as to render a plea of not guilty strategically preferable. \u201d (P. 769, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">All of the evidence at issue in <em>Hill </em>related to the charges to which defendants pleaded guilty, and nothing we said in <em>Hill </em>suggests that defendants would have been permitted to withdraw their pleas to any unrelated charges. Indeed, we specifically observed in <em>Hill </em>that \u201cThere is no basis whatsoever for concluding that the items which we hold to be inadmissible are in fact unconnected to the murder or would be irrelevant to the prosecution\u2019s case against defendants .... [T]he inference seems inescapable that such items . . . tend to incriminate defendants and therefore ar\u00e9 \u2018connected\u2019 to the murder. To conclude otherwise is to engage in unfounded speculation at the expense of defendants. \u201d (P. 767, fn. 36.) Thus, <em>Hill </em>clearly stands for the proposition that if, on appeal, it is determined that a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted at least in part, defendant will be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea with respect to any charges to which such evidence relates. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 351, 357-359 [128 Cal.Rptr. 5, 546 P.2d 293] [unlawfully obtained evidence related to count on which guilty plea entered]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salazar </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 912, 915-916 [156 Cal.Rptr. 125].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Subsequent cases have uniformly recognized the requirement of some nexus between the unlawfully obtained evidence and the charge on which the guilty plea was based. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 624, 635-636 [173 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 554] [evidence related to dismissed counts]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nagdeman </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 404, 412 [168 Cal.Rptr. 16] [evidence related to uncharged offenses]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Punchard </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 995, 999 [163 Cal.Rptr. 366] [evidence related to dismissed counts].)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><em>Punchar\u00e1, supra, </em>is particularly instructive. There, as part of a plea bargain, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of receiving stolen property; two other receiving counts were dismissed. Defendant had previously moved to suppress certain evidence connected to the <em>dismissed </em>counts and, on appeal from the conviction following his guilty plea, he contended that the foregoing evidence should have been ordered suppressed. The court held that the admissibility issue was rendered \u201cmoot\u201d by reason of the dismissal of the counts to which the evidence in question related. (Pp. 998-1000.) As the court explained: \u201cDefendant forwent the risk of conviction under counts II and HI by pleading guilty to count I. He is presumed to have been aware of the possible defense to counts H and HI, and recognized his claim of error in the court\u2019s failure to suppress the evidence. Yet he chose to forego the risks of asserting such defense as he may have had. Rather, defendant chose to seek a <em>certain </em>dismissal of counts H and IH by bargaining away his right to contest count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201cNor is the matter one of pure gamesmanship; defendant was thoroughly apprised that in bargaining away his right to contest count I, he was unequivocably [sic] admitting that he did in fact commit the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cHe cannot now reasonably challenge the validity of his bargain and his plea by pointing to the possible defenses he might have asserted as to the dismissed counts. Defendant knowingly and willingly forwent such defense[s] and cannot raise them now.\u201d (Pp. 999-1000, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Although <em>Punchar\u00e1 </em>does not discuss the point, its holding could be equally sustained on the alternative basis that, as discussed above, Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m), does not authorize appellate review following a guilty plea to charges which were not challenged by a prior motion to suppress evidence. Those pleas are final and unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">It is argued that had defendant known at the time of his plea bargain the ultimate merit of his earlier motion to suppress, he might not have entered into that bargain or pleaded guilty to the various offenses, and that accordingly he should now be permitted to withdraw his pleas in toto. <em>Every </em>plea bargain, however, requires a careful weighing of the various tactical considerations, including possibly meritorious defenses which might have been asserted at trial or on appeal. As <em>Punchar\u00e1, supra, </em>explains, the defendant in such a situation cannot claim any surprise or ignorance of the facts. Moreover, as we have seen, the Legislature has chosen to restrict appellate review of convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>based upon guilty pleas to those charges to which a prior motion to suppress was directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Thus, I would reverse the judgment in part and direct the trial court on remand to permit defendant to withdraw his guilty pleas to any offense or offenses to which his prior motion to suppress was related. Because the People have not requested reinstatement of any charges which were dismissed as part of the plea bargain, I would not reach the question whether such reinstatement would be proper upon partial rescission of a plea bargain. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
