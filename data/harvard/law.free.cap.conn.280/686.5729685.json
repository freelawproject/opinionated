On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant claims that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>deprived of his federal due process right<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to a fair trial when the trial court: (1) denied his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor had committed misconduct by continuing to offer into evidence a guilty plea pursuant to an agreement between the state and a codefendant, despite the court\u2019s having sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to that evidence; and (2) concluded that the plea agreement, which had not been disclosed by the state to the defendant was not \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). We disagree, and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Annette Gonzalez, the defendant\u2019s common-law wife, had engaged in a romantic relationship for approximately two years with the victim, Raymond Munoz, who was her coworker. The victim did not leam of Gonzalez\u2019 common-law marriage to the defendant until approximately one and one-half years into their relationship, but he continued to see her because the defendant was living in Puerto Rico at that time. The victim broke off his relationship with Gonzalez when the defendant moved to Waterbury to join her, but she continued to call the victim despite his requests that she stop doing so. Gonzalez had, however, kept her keys to the victim\u2019s apartment after the breakup. On December 23, 2001, the victim went to the home of Gonzalez\u2019 mother to recover those keys from Gonzalez. This led to a physical altercation between the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>dant, who was present, and the victim, during which the defendant hit the victim with a bat, and the victim bit the defendant\u2019s finger, causing the defendant a significant injury for which he was hospitalized. No criminal charges were filed against either the defendant or the victim in connection with that altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Approximately one week later, the defendant, his brother, Michael Ortiz, and Angel Mundo, a friend of Ortiz, decided to attack the victim at his apartment in Waterbury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their plan was for Gonzalez to lure the victim from his apartment by calling him and inviting him to come talk to her. Mundo testified that, when the victim came out of his apartment, Mundo and Ortiz were to surprise and to subdue him, and then to use walkie-talkies that belonged to Gonzalez<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to notify the defendant when the victim was secured. The defendant, who was to wait outside the apartment building because he had limited use of his hands as a result of his injured finger, was then to come up to the apartment and to kick the victim in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">At approximately 1 a.m. on December 31, 2001, the defendant, Mundo and Michael Ortiz drove to the victim\u2019s apartment in the defendant\u2019s car. In the meantime, Gonzalez had called the victim to invite him over to her house. When the victim left his apartment, Mundo and Ortiz, wearing ski masks and medical gloves, surprised him with a gun and forced him back into the apartment, while the defendant waited in the car. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>then pistol-whipped the victim, bound him with duct tape and put a mask on his face. Their struggle, however, made a significant amount of noise as the victim slammed his feet on the floor, and a downstairs neighbor called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The police responded quickly and, after speaking to the person who had reported the noise, they entered the victim\u2019s apartment, where Sergeant Michael Edwards and Officer Gregory LaFountain saw the victim on the floor with duct tape over his mouth and binding his hands. There also was blood on the floor, along with some medical gloves, a bloody Glock nine millimeter pistol and a purple walkie-talkie. The officers discovered Mundo and Ortiz hiding in the apartment and took them into custody, and then had the victim transported to the hospital for treatment of facial and head injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Before he entered the apartment building, Edwards, who had heard a car on the block start its engine, had instructed Officer Anthony Tito to go with his partner and check that car. They found and questioned the defendant, who was attempting to leave the area in his Buick LeSabre, which was parked on the same side of the street as the victim\u2019s house, several car lengths from the front door.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s car revealed medical gloves and a purple walkie-talkie matching the gloves and radio found in the victim\u2019s apartment. The officers arrested the defendant, Mundo and Michael Ortiz, and the defendant subsequently gave a statement to Detective Sergeant Eugene Coyle of the Waterbury police department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Thereafter, the state filed a substitute information that charged the defendant with conspiracy to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>burglary in the first degree, aiding and abetting burglary in the first degree, and aiding and abetting assault in the second degree. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts of the substitute information. The trial court, <em>Hartmere, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to concurrent five year sentences on the burglary charges plus a consecutive three year sentence on the aiding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>abetting assault charge, for a total effective sentence of eight years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct by disregarding, on multiple occasions, the court\u2019s rulings precluding the state from introducing Mundo\u2019s guilty pleas into evidence; and (2) concluded that an undisclosed plea agreement between the state and Mundo was not \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87, because there was no reasonable possibility that its disclosure would have affected the result of the defendant\u2019s trial or sentencing. Additional relevant facts and procedural history will be set forward in the context of each claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of a fair trial when the trial court denied his motion for a mistrial on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s repeated references to the guilty plea of Mundo, a coconspirator. Specifically, the defendant claims that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 187 A.2d 442 (1962), the trial court properly precluded the use of Mundo\u2019s guilty plea to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt, and that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated references to the plea operated to subvert that legally correct order, thereby depriving him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history, much of which consists of the questioning and testimony of Mundo, to illustrate the context of the prosecutorial actions at issue. On September 2, 2003, Mundo pleaded guilty to one count of burglary in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), and one count of conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-101 (a) (2). At that proceeding, which had been held more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>than one month prior to the defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecutor told the court that the agreed upon sentence recommendation for Mundo was eight years imprisonment. After both sides waived presentence investigation, the trial court, <em>Iannotti, J., </em>granted Mundo\u2019s request to continue his sentencing for six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In the period after the court had accepted his plea, but before his sentencing, Mundo testified at the defendant\u2019s trial. During the initial questions of his direct examination by the prosecutor, Terence Mariani, Mundo stated that he resided at the Gardner correctional institution because he had been convicted of \u201cburglary one.\u201d At that point, the defendant objected and moved to strike that comment. When offered the opportunity to respond to the defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor stated that he would \u201cmove on,\u201d and the trial court, <em>Hartmere, J., </em>did not rule further on the defendant\u2019s objection at that time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prosecutor then asked Mundo, \u201c[w]hat events landed you in jail,\u201d and Mundo went on to explain how he had met the defendant through Michael Ortiz, and how the defendant\u2019s plan to attack the victim had developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">After Mundo testified about the plan and the events of December 31, 2001, he then responded affirmatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>when the prosecutor had asked him about his \u201cown run-ins with the law in the past,\u201d and his \u201cquite . . . lengthy criminal record . . . .\u201d The prosecutor then asked Mundo specifically whether he had been convicted of burglary in the first degree in the present case. The defendant objected to this question, arguing that the objection already had been sustained by the trial court. Although the prosecutor argued that \u201c[t]he fact that he\u2019s been convicted of kinds of felonies is admissible,\u201d the trial court characterized that answer as a \u201cseparate question\u201d and directed the prosecutor to \u201c[m]ove on . . . .\u2019\u2019At this point, the prosecutor concluded his direct examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel, Leonard Crone, then commenced his cross-examination of Mundo, asking him extensively about the various aliases that he had used, including on the night he was arrested in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>case. Mundo stated that he had used the aliases while on drags,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and also admitted to lying frequently. He also testified about his intravenous cocaine and heroin use, including on the day at issue, as well as his nineteen page criminal record containing numerous convictions for, inter alia, drag possession, burglary, larceny, fraud, turnstile jumping and robbery. Defense counsel then asked Mundo how he liked jail, at which point Mundo testified that, \u201cI don\u2019t like it in jail, but the way I was going it\u2019s better than being homeless on the streets.\u201d Mundo then testified that he would like to shorten his stay in prison, but gave conflicting answers about whether he could do that by testifying in this case. He did, however, testify that he had no expectations of leniency at his sentencing because no promises had been made to him and he had \u201calready copped out to the time [he] was offered.\u201d At that point, defense counsel stated, \u201cYou haven\u2019t been sentenced, Mr. Mundo. Don\u2019t lie to the jury.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The prosecutor then objected to the defendant\u2019s characterization of Mundo\u2019s testimony \u201cas a lie,\u201d saying the defendant knew that \u201cto be untrue,\u201d and that the prosecutor had Mundo\u2019s plea transcript with him. The defendant reiterated to the trial court that Mundo had not yet been sentenced. The court told the prosecutor, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about either .... You are using very strong language concerning what you know.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: There\u2019s an agreed upon recommendation. He\u2019s already [pleaded] guilty. [Defense counsel] was provided the transcript of that. He\u2019s read it.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I haven\u2019t been given a transcript. Again, I don\u2019t think his guilty plea is something that should be\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I handed him the transcript the other day and he sat here and read it, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u201cThe Court: Degenerating quickly here. What\u2019s the objection?</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\u201c [The Prosecutor]: That that is a misstatement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right, I\u2019ll overrule the objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">At this point, questioning continued and Mundo testified that he had not been sentenced yet, and that his sentencing had been postponed until after the defendant\u2019s trial. Defense counsel then asked Mundo whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>he was \u201chere testifying because you\u2019re a good guy?\u201d Mundo testified that he came to testify because \u201cI got taken for a fool. You understand? I\u2019m here testifying because I was told it was supposed to be done a certain way. Something was supposed to get out of it, after I was incarcerated . . . .\u201d Mundo then testified that he was told that there would be drugs for him in the victim\u2019s apartment once the beating concluded. When defense counsel again asked whether Mundo \u201cexpect[ed] testifying in this case is going to somehow help you at the time of your sentence,\u201d Mundo replied in the negative. Mundo testified that he did not \u201cexpect\u201d his testimony to help at his sentencing, because he had not been told that it would do so. When defense counsel asked whether Mundo \u201choped\u201d that his testimony would help at his sentencing, Mundo testified: \u201cNo. The only thing that I\u2019m hoping that the time I\u2019m going to do, I\u2019m going to share it with the person that brought me to Connecticut.\u201d Mundo, however, also testified about the opportunity to obtain a sentence modification, and agreed that he would do whatever he could to attain a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">After Mundo testified further about his involvement in the attack, and the gun used therein, defense counsel again asked Mundo about whether he had spoken to the state about his testimony against the defendant. Mundo testified that he had spoken to the prosecutor twice, and that he had approached the state through his attorney about testifying. He told his attorney that, \u201c[i]f I\u2019m going to go to jail, all the people responsible are going to go with me also.\u201d Mundo testified that he had told the prosecutor what happened, that he made the decision to testify in this case, and that the prosecutor had reviewed his testimony and the exhibits with him. Cross-examination concluded when Mundo stated that he had no expectation of benefiting from his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>On redirect examination, the prosecutor moved for the admission into evidence of the transcript from Mundo\u2019s plea hearing. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to its admission without giving reasons for the ruling. The prosecutor then asked Mundo whether he had pleaded guilty to a crime in September, 2003, and the defendant objected immediately. At this point, the trial court excused the jury, and heard arguments on the admissibility of the transcript. The prosecutor explained that the allocution in the transcript would contradict Mundo\u2019s stoiy that he was there to buy drugs from the victim, and also was \u201cextremely relevant on the point of . . . any expectations that Mr. Mundo had as to what was going to happen with the disposition of this case. His case based on his testimony and the transcript I would submit clearly indicates that it\u2019s an agreed upon recommendation, that he\u2019s going to get eight years.\u201d Legal argument then ensued as to the propriety of that line of questioning, and defense counsel moved for a mistrial because he argued that the questioning had created \u201ca prejudice that we may not be able to overcome in this case. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper. I think [the prosecutor] knows it was not proper. The objection was sustained. You told him not to ask it. He just kept on asking.\u201d The prosecutor responded that the agreed upon sentence recommendation in the transcript rebutted the defendant\u2019s goal of showing that Mundo expected consideration for his testimony. The court, however, agreed with the defendant\u2019s position that the case had not yet been disposed of, especially after the state admitted that it could lower the recommendation prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">After further argument, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial. The trial court stated: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of conspiracy cases. My understanding was always after someone had been impeached, his credibility had been attacked, depending on the \u00f1atee of the cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>examination, [convictions of coconspirators] could be used, and even then, as I understand it, it\u2019s quite discretionary. You offered the initial conviction early in the testimony of the witness. There had been no impeachment. I sustained the objection. I am a bit concerned that you make yourself the arbiter of whether further questions in the same area are appropriate, Mr. Mariani. I trust I won\u2019t see that again. If I sustain an objection to something, do not go into it because you think the law is to the contrary. Get an opinion from the court out of the presence of the jury in the future.\u201d The trial court further concluded that there was no prejudice to the defendant because the transcript had been offered only as a \u201ctranscript,\u201d but reiterated that it would not be admissible for impeachment. The trial court then offered a curative instruction, but the defendant declined that offer because he was \u201cafraid that would highlight something.\u201d The trial court also stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think the jury grasped the issue as you framed it. I know I didn\u2019t in the beginning. As I said, I don\u2019t know what it was in terms of the transcript. The other questions, the objection was sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 195, the trial court properly precluded the use of evidence of Mundo\u2019s guilty plea to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt, and that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated references to the plea operated to subvert that legally correct order. The defendant further contends that, under the test articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987), he was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was frequent and the credibility of Mundo\u2019s testimony was absolutely essential to proving the accessory and conspiracy charges of which the defendant was convicted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In response, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>concedes that the trial prosecutor improperly contravened the trial court\u2019s preclusion ruling by continuing to seek admission of the guilty plea, but contends that the defendant\u2019s rights were not prejudiced because the circumstances surrounding Mundo\u2019s guilty plea properly had been explored at trial by both the defendant and the state. The state also claims that there was no due process violation because the defendant\u2019s own statement corroborated Mundo\u2019s testimony. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\u201cThe standard for review of an action upon a motion for a mistrial is well established. While the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. ... On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. . . . The trial court is better positioned than we are to evaluate in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. . . . The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gary, </em>273 Conn. 393, 413, 869 A.2d 1236 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>278 Conn. 620, 657, 899 A.2d 1 (2006) (\u201c[i]n our review of the denial of a motion for [a] mistrial, we have recognized the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial has so prejudiced a party that he or she can no longer receive a fair trial\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Indeed, \u201c[w]hen a mistrial is sought on the ground that a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law the same standard applies. . . . The burden on the defendant is to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. . . . The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S.

Ed. 2d 259 (1983); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 420, 844 A.2d 810 (2004) (\u201cwe have afforded deference to trial courts in deciding whether to deny a defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial that is based on prosecutorial misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\u201cIn reviewing a claim of abuse of discretion, we have stated that [discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. ... In general, abuse of discretion exists when a court could have chosen different alternatives but has decided the matter so arbitrarily as to vitiate logic, or has decided it based on improper or irrelevant factors. . . . Therefore, [i]n those cases in which an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done, reversal is required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated on what he characterizes as the prosecutor\u2019s disobedience of the trial court\u2019s ruling precluding admission of the transcript or any discussion of Mundo\u2019s conviction for his actions on the night in question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is well settled that prosecutorial disobedience of a trial court order, even one that the prosecutor considers legally incorrect, constitutes improper conduct. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 403-404, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). Even if we were to assume that the prosecutor in this case committed misconduct by disobeying those evidentiary rulings by the trial court, his actions nevertheless do not amount to a due process violation requiring reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may occur in the course of cross-examination of witnesses . . . and may be so clearly inflammatory as to be incapable of correction by action of the court. ... In such instances there is a reasonable possibility that the improprieties in the cross-examination either contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty or, negatively, foreclosed the jury from ever considering the possibility of acquittal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, 278 </em>Conn. 354, 380, 897 A.2d 569 (2006). \u201c[T]he defendant in a claim of prosecutorial misconduct must establish that the prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process .... In evaluating whether the misconduct rose to this level, we consider the factors enumerated by this court in <em>State v. Williams, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 540], . . . These factors include the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument, the severity of the misconduct, the frequency of the misconduct, the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case, the strength of the curative measures adopted, and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Application of the factors enumerated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, to this record demonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s disregard of the trial court\u2019s rulings precluding the use of Mundo\u2019s guilty plea did not violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights. Beginning with the first factor, namely, the extent to which the alleged misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument, the prosecutor introduced the subject of the defendant\u2019s conviction twice briefly on direct examination, defense counsel objected both times, and the prosecutor moved on from that line of questioning without the benefit of further argument or a definitive ruling by the trial court. See footnotes 8 and 9 of this opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>and the accompanying text. On cross-examination, however, defense counsel, after inquiring about Mundo\u2019s prodigious criminal history, inquired extensively about any expectations that Mundo had in connection with his testimony, a line of questioning that itself clearly implied that Mundo had a criminal conviction as a result of his involvement in the activities at issue. See footnote 11 of this opinion and the accompanying text. On redirect examination, however, the prosecutor again attempted to introduce the transcript of Mundo\u2019s plea. It was only at this point that the jury was excused. The prosecutor explained that he wanted to introduce the transcript to rebut the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Mundo with respect to any expectations of leniency that he might expect from his testimony. It was only at this point that full legal argument ensued over the admissibility of Mundo\u2019s guilty pleas, and the trial court relied on the fact that the sentence still could be changed as not refuting the defendant\u2019s cross-examination. To the extent, however, that the prosecutor was improperly aggressive in continuing to seek the admission of the plea transcript in the face of the trial court\u2019s orders, that action was encouraged, if not invited, by defense counsel's appropriate questioning exploring Mundo\u2019s motives for testifying against the defendant. Indeed, it was not until the fourth attempt that the questions regarding the pleas\u2019 admissibility were resolved explicitly for the duration of the trial, and the law regarding the admissibility of such pleas or convictions under <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 198, is itself far from definitive. See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We address together the second and third factors, namely, the severity and frequency of the misconduct. With the exception of the alleged <em>Brady </em>violation; see part II of this opinion; the alleged misconduct was limited to the prosecutor\u2019s attempts to address one discrete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>subject during the course of his direct and redirect examinations of Mundo. Indeed, the state did not refer to Mundo\u2019s conviction in its opening or rebuttal summations. This is not, for example, a case wherein reversal is required because a variety of different types of misconduct had been committed during the course of both cross-examination and summations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 398 (\u201c[w]e first conclude that the instances of prosecutorial misconduct were not isolated because they occurred during both the cross-examination of the defendant and the prosecutor\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 410 (same); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 349-50, 441 A.2d 98 (1981) (\u201cAnother factor militating against finding harmful error in this case is the lack of any claim by the defendant that the evidence of the witnesses\u2019 guilty pleas was ever again brought to the attention of the jury by the state in a prejudicial fashion. There is no claim that the testimony of the pleas was either emphasized by the state, or argued by the state during final argument.\u201d). Moreover, we also note that the misconduct was not particularly flagrant or severe, in light of the fact that the trial court did not rule definitively on the <em>Pikul </em>issue until after the prosecutor\u2019s fourth \u201coffense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">With respect to the curative measures, there were none. This was, however, because the defendant made the tactical decision to decline the trial court\u2019s offer of a curative instruction, determining that such an instruction would highlight what he concluded was improper evidence of Mundo\u2019s conviction. The fact, however, that experienced defense counsel, having the vantage point to observe firsthand the impact of that evidence on the jury, deemed it not so harmful as to require an instruction, and that such an instruction might only highlight the impropriety, mitigates against a finding that this misconduct by itself deprived the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>his fair trial. Indeed, the trial court agreed with defense counsel\u2019s assessment of the situation, when it denied the motion for a mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pepper, </em>79 Conn. App. 1, 21, 828 A.2d 1268 (2003) (\u201c[o]ur conclusion that any misconduct was not severe is highlighted by the fact that no objection or curative instructions were sought by the defendant at trial\u201d), aff d, 272 Conn. 10, 860 A.2d 1221 (2004) (per curiam); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 414 (\u201cdefense counsel may elect not to object to arguments that he or she deems \u2018marginally objectionable\u2019 for tactical reasons, namely, \u2018because he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to it or because he or she wants to later refute that argument\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 351-52 (\u201c[o]ne legitimate defense consideration might be a concern that the remedy could be more injurious than the malady \u2014 that is, that a corrective instruction might call more attention to a witness\u2019 guilty plea than the witness\u2019 admission\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Finally, the misconduct related to the credibility of Mundo\u2019s testimony, which undoubtedly was significant to the state\u2019s case against the defendant. The state did, however, have a strong circumstantial case of the defendant\u2019s conspiratorial activities<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> even without Mundo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>testimony, as shown by evidence taken from the defendant\u2019s car located outside the scene of the crime, including the matching walkie-talkie and rubber gloves. This evidence, in addition to the defendant\u2019s own inculpatory statement to the police, notwithstanding the fact that his statement differed from Mundo\u2019s account of the events in several ways, nevertheless demonstrated his participation in the planning of the attack on the victim. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Finally, the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine Mundo extensively as to his credibility and interest in this case, and elicited the fact that he had not been sentenced yet.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See footnote 11 of this opinion and the accompanying text. This served to mitigate any harm caused by the state\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Finally, given Mundo\u2019s extensive testimony about his involvement in the events at issue, we also find instructive this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 339, wherein this court held harmless the improper admission of a coconspirator\u2019s conviction or guilty plea to establish that the crime had been committed. In <em>Just, </em>the court noted that the accomplices had \u201ctestified at length. It was only at the end of their direct testimony and after each had implicated himself and the defendant that testimony was elicited about their convictions concerning the criminal activity involving themselves and the defendant. This evidence, quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>apart from that of their guilty pleas, was properly received \u2014 its breadth and detail probative of the defendant\u2019s guilt. . . . The purpose of the witness\u2019 testimony was to give the facts and circumstances of the crime [s]. The testimony as to their pleas of guilty gave the circumstances under which they were testifying, and then-status with regard to the charge, and went to their credibility as witnesses for the state. . . . Any prejudice resulting from the testimony of the pleas was rendered harmless when the guilt of the accomplices was established by their own testimony which also implicated the defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 349; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>66 Conn. App. 238, 244, 784 A.2d 387 (following <em>Just </em>and concluding reversal not required when \u201cevidence of the codefendants\u2019 pleas of guilty came from the witnesses\u2019 own testimony and was inextricably linked with their testimony and other evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the robbery\u201d), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 943, 786 A.2d 431 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Accordingly, on the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s actions did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of a fair trial by virtue of the state\u2019s failure to disclose, pursuant to <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83, its agreement with Mundo to bring his cooperation and testimony to the attention of his sentencing court. The defendant contends that this agreement was critical impeachment evidence, the absence of which diminished the effectiveness of his cross-examination of Mundo, an important witness for the state. In response, the state concedes that it did not disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the agreement to the defendant, but contends that this nondisclosure did not affect the verdict because the defendant himself corroborated important parts of Mundo\u2019s testimony. The state also notes that the defendant\u2019s counsel was aware of the fact that Mundo\u2019s cooperation could be brought to the attention of his sentencing judge, and that the defendant engaged in a comprehensive cross-examination of Mundo that covered his sentencing expectations. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. After Mundo had testified at the defendant\u2019s trial, the state brought his cooperation to the attention of the court, <em>Iannotti, J., </em>and stated that it was now recommending a six year sentence. Mundo\u2019s defense counsel also asked the court to take Mundo\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial into consideration when fashioning the sentence. The court stated that it believed that Mundo had testified honestly in the defendant\u2019s trial, and that \u201cconsideration must be given to Mr. Mundo with regard to his testimony so that he receive a better sentence than the eight years that was originally offered.\u201d The court then sentenced Mundo to a total effective sentence of six years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">After the defendant filed this appeal in the Appellate Court, he learned of Mundo\u2019s six year sentence, rather than the eight year sentence that had been discussed at trial, and determined that the state might have violated <em>Brady </em>by failing to disclose an agreement to that effect that could have been used as impeachment evidence. In order to \u201cinquire into the [sjtate\u2019s failure to disclose the nature of the plea agreement\u201d and develop this claim, the defendant filed a motion for augmentation and rectification of the record pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>253 Conn. 700, 756 A.2d 799 (2000), and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-2, 61-10 and 66-5 <em>(Floyd </em>hearing). The state opposed this motion, claiming that it was an inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ate attempt to supplement the record, as the defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was unpreserved and, therefore, could be raised only pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and also, that there was insufficient evidence to justify such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The trial court, <em>Hartmere, J., </em>determined that there was sufficient evidence to justify a <em>Floyd </em>hearing and granted the defendant\u2019s motion for rectification. The trial court reasoned that requiring the defendant to wait for a collateral attack of his conviction would be a classic case of \u201cjustice delayed, is sometimes justice denied.\u201d The trial court then denied the state\u2019s request for a stay pending review of its order, and the Appellate Court upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the stay following the state\u2019s motion for review. The Appellate Court also granted the state\u2019s motion for review of the trial court\u2019s decision to hold a <em>Floyd </em>hearing, but denied the relief requested without prejudice to filing a subsequent post-hearing motion for review. The trial court then held the <em>Floyd </em>hearing and issued a memorandum of decision augmenting the record. Thereafter, this court granted the state\u2019s motion to transfer this appeal to itself pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-2, and we then upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to hold a <em>Floyd </em>hearing when we granted the state\u2019s motion for review, but denied the relief requested therein.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>After the <em>Floyd </em>hearing, the trial court issued a memoraudum of decision finding the following facts. \u201cAlan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>McWhirter, the public defender for the judicial district of Waterbury, represented Mundo on the underlying burglary and assault charges. The state\u2019s attorney, John Connelly, originally handled the prosecution of the three codefendants himself and was adamant that he did not want the cooperation of Mundo. In the judicial district of Waterbury, the state\u2019s attorney personally controls all part A and some part B sentencing offers to defendants. The sentencing offer to each of the three codefendants involved in this case was eight years, which was set by the state\u2019s attorney. The state\u2019s attorney assigned assistant state\u2019s attorney [Mariani] to the cases when they were called in for trial. All three codefendants were offered plea bargains of eight years incarceration; Michael Ortiz and Mundo accepted the offers and pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cAlthough the state\u2019s attorney was adamant that he did not want cooperation from Mundo, the public defender concluded from the beginning that if the defendant's] . . . case ever went to trial, the state might find Mundo\u2019s testimony to be useful in its prosecution. His rationale was that Mundo and Michael Ortiz had been apprehended inside the victim\u2019s apartment while committing the criminal acts, whereas the defendant . . . was outside in a vehicle. Once Mariani began preparing the case against [the defendant] for trial, he called the public defender to determine if Mundo was still interested in cooperating. Thereafter, Mariani met with Mundo and his attorney in the lockup at the Water<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>bury courthouse. An agreement was reached that the prosecutor would bring Mundo\u2019s cooperation to the attention of the sentencing judge. The public defender testified that \u2018when my client agreed to testify in [the defendant\u2019s] trial, the only understanding that existed was that his \u2014 the fact of his testifying would be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge at the time my client was sentenced. There was no discussion whatsoever as to numbers, promises of any kind. Simply that his act of testifying would be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge for whatever benefit the sentencing judge might feel was appropriate.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s trial attorney was unaware and had not been told of any agreement between the state and Mundo\u2019s attorney to bring Mundo\u2019s cooperation to the attention of Mundo\u2019s sentencing judge during the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant\u2019s trial attorney also was unaware of this agreement at the defendant\u2019s disposition, although Mariani stated on the record just prior to the defendant\u2019s sentencing that the state would bring Mundo\u2019s cooperation to the attention of Mundo\u2019s sentencing judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The trial court further noted that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201crepeated references\u201d during the examination of Mundo \u201cto an agreed recommendation were misleading,\u201d notwithstanding the fact that, \u201c[i]n the colloquy with the court held outside the jury\u2019s presence . . . the prosecutor did admit that the recommendation could be changed prior to disposition. Additionally, at the defendant\u2019s disposition, the prosecutor did inform the court that he would make the sentencing court aware of Mundo\u2019s cooperation at Mundo\u2019s disposition.\u201d As noted previously, after being made aware of Mundo\u2019s cooperation at the defendant\u2019s trial, the sentencing court, <em>latino tti, J., </em>sentenced Mundo to six years imprisonment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>The trial court found that the state had entered into an agreement whereby Mundo\u2019s testimony would be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge, and that the state improperly had failed to disclose that agreement to the court or to the defendant prior to or during the defendant\u2019s trial and sentencing. The trial court also concluded, however, that there was no \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d that this suppression would have affected the outcome of the trial or sentencing. The court found \u201ctroubling\u201d the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s repeated references during the trial proceedings to the \u2018agreed recommendation\u2019 of an eight year sentence for the witness while at the same time having this undisclosed agreement with the witness and the witness\u2019 attorney to bring the witness\u2019 cooperation to the attention of the sentencing judge. . . . The repeated references to an agreed recommendation were misleading.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Nevertheless, the court concluded that the \u201cdefendant, even in the absence of full disclosure, received a fair trial. The court\u2019s confidence in the outcome of the jury trial is steadfast.\u201d The court concluded similarly with respect to the defendant\u2019s sentence. The court relied on the fact that it and the defendant were aware during trial that the sentence was subject to change, as well as the \u201ccomprehensive cross-examination\u201d of Mundo by a \u201cveteran trial attorney\u201d that demonstrated that he was \u201ca drug addicted thug from Brooklyn, New York, with a lengthy criminal record.\u201d The trial court further noted that \u201cMundo was subjected to cross-examination about the details of the underlying offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>charged in this case, his use of a false name when arrested, his concoction of a false story for the police, and his knowledge of firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\u201cOur analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim begins with the pertinent standard, set forth in <em>Brady </em>and its progeny, by which we determine whether the state\u2019s failure to disclose evidence has violated a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. In <em>Brady, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. ... In <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, [281-82] 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1999), the United States Supreme Court identified the three essential components of a <em>Brady </em>claim, all of which must be established to warrant a new trial: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the [s]tate, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued. . . . Under the last <em>Brady </em>prong, the prejudice that the defendant suffered as a result of the impropriety must have been material to the case, such that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 699-700, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006), discussing <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434-35, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cA plea agreement between the state and a key witness is impeachment evidence falling within the definition of exculpatory evidence contained in <em>Brady.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 737. With respect to <em>Brady\u2019s </em>third prong, \u201ca showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal. . . . The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. . . . The United States Supreme Court also emphasized that the [relevant test under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985)] is not a sufficiency of the evidence test. ... A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict. . . . One does not show a <em>Brady </em>violation by demonstrating that some of the inculpatory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict. . . . Accordingly, the focus is not whether, based upon a threshold standard, the result of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been admitted. We instead concentrate on the overall fairness of the trial and whether nondisclosure of the evidence was so unfair as to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 454, 758 A.2d 824 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Before turning to the record in the present case, we clarify the standard by which we review a trial court\u2019s determination that suppressed evidence was not \u201cmaterial\u201d under <em>Brady, </em>because our prior cases have not squarely articulated the standard for the appellate review of such claims. Compare, e.g., id., 452-55 (reciting governing legal principles without stating standard of appellate review) with <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 147-49, 531 A.2d 125 (1987) (noting that \u201cthe determination of materiality has been said to be \u2018inevitably fact-bound\u2019 and like other factual issues is committed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>the trial court in the first instance,\u201d but characterizing trial court\u2019s determinations about whether there was \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that the result of the trial would have been different,\u201d as \u201cconclusions of law,\u201d but also recognizing \u201cthe difficulty inherent in measuring the effect of nondisclosure in the course of a lengthy trial with many witnesses and exhibits such as this; this lack of certitude suggests deference by a reviewing court especially in the weighing of evidence\u201d) and <em>State </em>v.

We agree with the defendant, and join our sister state and federal jurisdictions that have concluded that a trial court\u2019s determination as to materiality under <em>Brady </em>presents a mixed question of law and fact subject to plenary review, with the underlying historical facts subject to review for clear error.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zagari, </em>111 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>307, 320 (2d Cir.)

Our confidence in the overall fairness of the trial and in the jury\u2019s verdict has not been undermined, as Mundo\u2019s credibility and motives for testifying already had been impeached via defense counsel\u2019s comprehensive and skillful cross-examination. Specifically, the jury was exposed to Mundo\u2019s ample criminal record spanning nineteen pages, use of aliases, illicit drug use and, most significantly, the facts that he desired a shorter sentence and had not yet been sentenced for his participation in the crimes at issue. Although disclosure of the agreement would have permitted further development of this line of questioning by the defendant\u2019s counsel, our review of the record demonstrates that the defendant had impeached Mundo\u2019s credibility as extensively and thoroughly during cross-examination as could be expected. Moreover, Mundo\u2019s testimony, while significant, was not dispositive; the defendant\u2019s own statement to the police, admitted into evidence; see footnote 6 of this opinion; as well as the gloves and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>matching walkie-talkie found in his car at the scene of the crime, further inculpate him in the planning of, and participation in, the attack on the victim, thus bolstering our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.

His name is Raymond Munoz and I have known him for a couple of years now through mutual friends. We ended up in an argument and then a fight and Raymond nearly bit the middle finger on my right hand off. A neighbor in the building heard the fight and called police but Raymond left before the police could get him. I ended up in the emergency room and later found out that the finger was broken and that I would have to be operated on. They just put a small splint on it for now and left it unwrapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\u201cOn Christmas Day I [took] my family down to New York to drop off Christmas presents for my mother. When I got there I told my mother and my brother that I had gotten in a car accident and that is how I hurt my finger. My brother Michael Ortiz didn\u2019t believe that was how I had hurt my finger because he could see bite marks on it. Out of earshot of my mother Michael asked me what really happened to my finger and I told him the truth. Michael got real mad and asked me what I was going to do to Raymond for not only fooling around with my wife but also for biting me. Michael wanted to beat Raymond\u2019s ass but I told him no because I was going to sue him civilly to get my doctor\u2019s bills taken care of. Michael still wanted to beat Raymond for me, because I couldn\u2019t do it myself because of my hand. We didn\u2019t talk about Raymond any more that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\u201cThe day after Christmas I was operated on at Waterbury Hospital for my finger. They put some pins and some type of traction splint on it and I ended up staying over night.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\u201cI didn\u2019t hear from my brother Michael again until Sunday on December thirtieth. He called me from New York and said that he was coming to Waterbury and that he would be here sometime Sunday night and that he would call me when he got here. He doesn\u2019t have a car so I figured he would need a ride from the bus station or train station when he got here. Michael said that he was coming to give Raymond Munoz his beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\u201cOn Sunday night, just before midnight my phone rang. Annette took the call and talked for only a minute. I figured it might be Michael and when [I] asked Annette who it was, she reluctantly told me that it was Raymond Munoz and that he was still bothering her. I got really mad because the guy was still calling my wife even after she told him that she wanted no more to do with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\u201cA few minutes later the phone rang again, this time it was Michael and he told me that he was in Waterbury and he needed a ride. He said that he [was] someplace in the Brooklyn section of Waterbury and was walking. I got in my 1988 Buick LeSabre and found Michael walking near St. Patrick\u2019s Church. He wasn\u2019t alone though. He had a friend of his from New York whom I never met before. His name was Angel according to my brother but they never told me his last name. Michael said that Angel was going to help him kick Raymond Munoz\u2019s ass. Michael asked me to show them where Raymond\u2019s house was. I drove them to 38 Fifth St. and pointed out Raymond\u2019s house. I told them that Raymond lived alone on the third floor. I told them Raymond always carries guns so I told Michael to be careful. Michael said that they were going to go to the back door and that they would get him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>to open the door somehow or just lack the door in and then rush him and beat his ass. Michael told me to pull up the street a little bit and just wait for them in the car until they finished beating him. I had a set of my daughter\u2019s play [walkie-talkies] in my car. Michael took one of <em>them </em>with <em>him </em>and I had the other. Michael was going to call me on the radio and tell me where to pick him and Angel up after <em>they </em>finished. They both pulled up the hoods they were wearing onto their heads to hide their faces and got out of the car and walked towards Raymond\u2019s. I turned on the [walkie-talkie] I had and it was then that I reali[z]ed the battery was dead and wouldn\u2019t work. I just stayed parked where I was because they wouldn\u2019t be able to tell me where to pick them up because my radio was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\u201cI only waited for only a couple of minutes when a bunch of police cars showed up. The police asked me what I was doing there and I told them that my wife was cheating on me with a man who lived on Fifth St. and I was trying to catch her with him. I gave them my identification but they would not let me leave. Moments later they came out of Raymond\u2019s house with my brother Michael Ortiz and his [friend] Angel. They were both under arrest. [Evidently] they caught them in Raymond\u2019s house. An ambulance showed up and I saw them put Raymond inside. The police then found out that Michael was my brother and they searched my car. They found the [walkie-talkie] I had in my car and matched it with the one they found inside Raymond\u2019s house. They also found a latex glove on my passenger seat and told me that this matched the latex gloves that Michael and Angel had on when they were caught inside Raymond\u2019s house after they had beaten him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">\u201cI was taken to the police station by some uniformed] officers and then taken to the detective bureau. At first I told the detectives that I didn\u2019t know anything about this but sometime later Sgt. Coyle talked with me and advised me of my rights.

We take the opportunity to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\"><em>Floyd </em>hearings to explore claims of potential <em>Brady </em>violations are ordered pursuant to the appellate courts\u2019 supervisory authority under Practice Book \u00a7 60-2, which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe supervision and control of the proceedings on appeal shall be in the court having appellate jurisdiction from the time the appeal is filed, or earlier, if appropriate, and, except as otherwise provided in these rules, any motion the purpose of which is to complete or perfect the trial court record for presentation on appeal shall be made to the court in which the appeal is pending.

(9) remand any pending matter to the trial court for the resolution of factual issues where necessary . . . .\u201d We will order a <em>Floyd </em>hearing to develop a potential <em>Brady </em>violation only in \u201cthe unusual situation in which a defendant was precluded from perfecting the record due to new information obtained after judgment. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>90 Conn.

A <em>Floyd </em>hearing is not a license to engage in a posttrial fishing expedition, as the court will not hold a hearing in the absence of sufficient prima facie evidence, direct or circumstantial, of a <em>Brady </em>violation unascertainable at trial.

The trial court\u2019s decision with respect to whether to hold a <em>Floyd </em>hearing is reviewable by motion for review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-7, which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the action of the trial judge as regards rectification of the appeal or articulation under Section 66-5 may, within ten days of the issuance of notice of the order sought to be reviewed, make a written motion for review to the court, to be filed with the appellate clerk, and the court may, upon such a motion, direct any action it deems proper. . .

This approach, however, fosters delay as the proceedings on direct appeal are exhausted prior to the commencement of habeas proceedings, and deprives a trial court already familiar with the matter of the opportunity to address <em>Brady </em>claims in a timely fashion. In contrast, <em>Floyd </em>hearings permit the rapid resolution of these fact sensitive constitutional issues and mitigate the effects of the passage of time that would accompany requiring defendants to wait to address these matters until after the conclusion of direct appellate review.

The court then told the parties of its intention to take that cooperation into consideration, and to sentence Mundo to less than eight years.

In reviewing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had not been deprived of his right to a fair trial, despite the suppression of the statement, this court stated that the \u201cdetermination of materiality has been said to be \u2018inevitably fact-bound\u2019 and like other factual issues is committed to the trial court in the first instance.\u201d Id., 147, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>790 F.2d 130, 136 (D.C. Cir. 1986). This court also, however, characterized the trial court\u2019s determinations with respect to whether the failure of the state to disclose a witness\u2019 allegedly exculpatory statement deprived the defendant of a fair trial, namely, whether there was a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that the result of the trial would have been different,\u201d as \u201cconclusions of law.\u201d <em>State v.

The court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pollitt </em>also recognized the \u201cdifficulty inherent in measuring the effect of nondisclosure in the course of a lengthy trial with many witnesses and exhibits such as this; this lack of certitude suggests deference by a reviewing court especially in the weighing of evidence.\u201d Id., 149. The court, did not, however, articulate precisely the exact standard of review applicable to materiality determinations on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Thereafter, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 400, this court cited <em>Pollitt, </em>deferred to the factual character of the materiality finding, and concluded that the trial court properly had denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation. In so concluding, the court applied the standard of review applicable to motions for a new trial, and concluded that \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the impeachment value of the [suppressed] statement was merely cumulative.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Cases from this court and the Appellate Court in the nineteen years following <em>Pollitt </em>and <em>Shannon </em>have been divergent in their treatment of the applicable standard of review. Some opinions merely state the well established governing legal principles before analyzing the record. See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 452-55. Other cases cite <em>State </em>v. Pollitt, supra, 205 Conn. 149, and note that the trial court\u2019s materiality determination is fact bound and entitled to some deference, but do not state whether appellate review is plenary, for clear error or for abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James </em>G., supra, 268 Conn. 402-404 (affirming trial court\u2019s determination that department of children and families files did not contain <em>Brady </em>material, and stating that \u201cwe have held that \u2018[t]he determination of materiality .. . [is] inevitably fact-bound and like other factual issues is committed to the trial court in the first instance\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>252 Conn. 533, 545 \u2014 46, 747 A.2d 487 (2000) (citing <em>Shannon, </em>but not its abuse of discretion standard, in upholding trial court\u2019s determination that suppressed police report was not material); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 92, 621 A.2d 728 (1993) (noting deference to trial court\u2019s materiality determination with respect to allegedly undisclosed information about telephone calls to defendant\u2019s place of business by unidentified caller); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jaynes, </em>36 Conn. App. 417, 423, 650 A.2d 1261 (1994) (citing <em>Pollitt </em>deference with respect to undisclosed police report containing witnesses\u2019 contradictory descriptions of gun involved in case), cert. denied, 233 Conn. 908, 658 A.2d 980 (1995). Finally, this court has applied <em>Shannon\u2019s </em>abuse of discretion standard only once, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 294, 604 A.2d 793 (1992), wherein it remanded a <em>Brady </em>claim arising from the trial court\u2019s denial of a posttrial motion for DNA profiling of untested swabs and smears to the trial court for action in the first instance, concluding that the trial court was entitled to rule first in light of new developments in the then novel area of DNA testing. Id., 294-95. The Appellate Court has, however, cited and relied on <em>Shannon's </em>abuse of discretion standard four times in evaluating trial court assessments of materiality under <em>Brady. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sells, </em>82 Conn. App. 332, 351, 844 A.2d 235, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 911, 853 A.2d 529 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sitkiewicz, </em>64 Conn.
