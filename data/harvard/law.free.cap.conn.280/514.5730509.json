The petitioner claims on appeal that the habeas court: (1) committed plain error when the habeas judge failed to disqualify himself in violation of canon 3 (c) (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) improperly dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the petitioner was not in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-466<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when his habeas petition was filed; and (3) improperly failed to construe his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a writ of error coram nobis. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The petitioner is a citizen of Nigeria who entered the United States as a visitor in 1991, and became a lawful permanent resident on September 8, 1994. <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, 378 </em>F.3d 173, 174 (2d Cir. 2004), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>546 U.S. 1036, 126 S. Ct. 734, 163 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005). On July 10, 1995, in the judicial district of StamfordNorwalk, geographical area number one, located in the city of Stamford, the petitioner pleaded guilty to two counts of credit card fraud in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>utes \u00a7 53a-128d (Stamford conviction). The petitioner received a total effective sentence of two years incarceration, execution suspended, and three years probation. Thereafter, on November 5,1997, in the judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, geographical area number twenty, located in the city of Norwalk, the petitioner pleaded guilty pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to one count of larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124. The petitioner was not sentenced at that time, and the matter was continued to December 2,1997. When the petitioner failed to appear on December 2, the court ordered his rearrest. On May 7, 1999, the petitioner again pleaded guilty to larceny in the third degree and received a sentence of one year incarceration (Norwalk conviction). At the same proceeding, the petitioner also pleaded guilty to failure to appear in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172, and was sentenced to one year incarceration to run concurrent to his larceny sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Meanwhile, on February 24, 1997, the petitioner pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York to bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>supra, 378 F.3d 174. \u201cIn June 1999, based on the federal conviction, the Immigration and Nationalization Service [INS]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> served [the petitioner] with a notice to appear. The INS sought [the petitioner\u2019s] removal pursuant to \u00a7 237 (a) (2) (A) (iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [INA], 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227 (a) (2) (A) (iii), for an aggravated felony conviction as defined under INA \u00a7 101 (a) (43) (G) [and] 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a) (43) (G) . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>supra, 174. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>June 19,2000, the commissioner of correction (commissioner), paroled the petitioner into the physical custody of the INS. On October 5, 2000, the petitioner, who had served fully the sentences for both his Stamford and Norwalk convictions, was discharged from parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Thereafter, on October 30, 2000, the INS amended the notice to appear by adding the petitioner\u2019s Norwalk conviction as a basis for his removal. Specifically, the INS claimed that larceny in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-124 is an aggravated felony as defined by INA \u00a7 1101 (a) (43) (G). <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>supra, 378 F.3d 174. Meanwhile, during July, 2000, a series of removal hearings had begun before an immigration judge in Oakdale, Louisiana. <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 01-CV-5568, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16219 (E.D.N.Y. August 28, 2002). During these hearings, it came to light that the petitioner\u2019s appeal of his federal bank fraud conviction was still pending. Accordingly, in December, 2000, the INS withdrew the charge of removability based on that conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id.; see also <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>supra, 378 F.3d 174. On June 22, 2001, the immigration judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the petitioner removable as an aggravated felon based on his Norwalk conviction, and ordered him removed to Nigeria. <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>supra, 378 F.3d 174. The board of immigration appeals dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the immigration judge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 175. The petitioner currently is in the physical custody of the Department of Homeland Security; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and is being held at the Etoawh County Detention Center in Gadsen, Alabama, pending his removal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Abimbola </em>v. <em>Ridge, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:04CV856, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3699 (D. Conn. March 7, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>On April 20, 2004, the petitioner filed the present second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The petition alleges, in relevant part, that the petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with both his Stamford and Norwalk convictions because his attorneys: (1) failed to research adequately the immigration consequences of his convictions; (2) failed to advise the petitioner that his convictions could lead to deportation; (3) failed to negotiate an agreement with the state to reduce the charges; (4) failed to advise the petitioner to decline to plead guilty and to take his case to trial; (5) failed to advise the petitioner, following the imposition of his sentence, that he might be entitled to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-lj because the trial court improperly had informed the petitioner of the immigration consequences of his plea; and (6) affirmatively misadvised the petitioner that his guilty pleas would not expose him to adverse immigration consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The commissioner moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the commissioner claimed that the petitioner was not in \u201c \u2018custody\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466 because the petitioner\u2019s sentences for his Stamford and Norwalk convictions had expired completely by the time he filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The habeas court, <em>White, J., </em>held a brief hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion and, thereafter, dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>that \u201c[t]he petition in this case was filed after the petitioner\u2019s underlying sentence expired. Because the petitioner was not in custody for the underlying conviction when he filed his petition, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear his claims. The petition is dismissed. See <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>59 Conn. App. 823 [758 A.2d 853] (2000) and [Practice Book \u00a7] 23-29 (2).\u201d The petitioner subsequently petitioned for certification to appeal from the judgment of the habeas court. The habeas court denied the petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">During the pendency of the present appeal, the petitioner, who was not present at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, discovered the identity of the habeas judge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The petitioner thereafter informed his appellate counsel that the habeas judge previously had served as his attorney with respect to plea negotiations for his Norwalk conviction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is undisputed that neither Judge White, the petitioner nor counsel for the parties previously realized that Judge White formerly had represented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>petitioner with respect to one of the criminal convictions underlying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On appeal, the petitioner claims that Judge White improperly failed to disqualify himself in violation of canon 3 (c) (1) (B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Practice Book \u00a7 1-22 (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because he had \u201c \u2018served as [a] lawyer in the matter in controversy . . . The petitioner further claims that Judge White\u2019s improper participation in the present case constitutes plain error that neither can be waived nor remitted by the parties. Alternatively, if this court reaches the propriety of the habeas court\u2019s rulings, the petitioner claims that the habeas court: (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal because \u201cthe purely legal issues presented [therein were] nonfrivolous matters of first impression in Connecticut and [were] matters about which there is at least a split of authority in other jurisdictions\u201d; and (2) improperly concluded that the petitioner was not in custody when he filed his habeas petition. With respect to the latter claim, the petitioner contends that he was in custody pursuant to <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>515 U.S. 39, 45-46, 115 S. Ct. 1948, 132 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1995), because his current confinement is part of a continuous stream of custody, and reversal of his underlying criminal conviction will advance his release date. Alternatively, the petitioner contends that he was in custody pursuant to <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 121 S. Ct. 1567, 149 L. Ed. 2d 608 (2001), because the present case is one of those \u201c \u2018rare cases in which no channel of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>was actually available to a [petitioner] with respect to a prior conviction, due to no fault of his own.\u2019 <em>Daniels </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 383-84, 121 S. Ct. 1578, 149 L. Ed. 2d 590 (2001)].\u201d If we conclude, however, that the petitioner was not in custody when he filed his habeas petition, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly failed to construe his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The commissioner concedes that canon 3 (c) (1) (B) required Judge White to disqualify himself from the present case. The commissioner claims, however, that the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise Judge White\u2019s disqualification dining the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss is the functional equivalent of \u201c \u2018consent in open court\u2019 \u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 51-39 (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Alternatively, the commissioner claims that Judge White\u2019s failure to disqualify himself does not constitute plain error. If we conclude, however, that it does constitute plain error, the commissioner contends that nonetheless we are \u201cindependently obligated\u201d to determine whether the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition. With respect to the jurisdiction of the habeas court, the commissioner claims that the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 507, 530, 876 A.2d 1178 (2005), because the petitioner had served fully the sentences for both his Stamford and Norwalk convictions before he filed his habeas petition and, therefore, he was not in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466. Lastly, the commissioner claims that the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition does not fulfill the requirements of the writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>We conclude that Judge White\u2019s failure to disqualify himself in violation of canon 3 (c) (1) (B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Practice Book \u00a7 1-22 (a) constitutes plain error. Despite the existence of plain error, we nonetheless review the commissioner\u2019s claim that the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition. After conducting an independent review of the jurisdiction of the habeas court, we conclude that the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the petitioner was not in custody when he filed his petition. Lastly, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s writ of error coram nobis claim is not preserved for our review. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The petitioner first claims that it was plain error for Judge White to preside over his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and his petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because canon 3 (c) (1) (B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Practice Book \u00a7 1-22 (a) required Judge White to disqualify himself from the present case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We note that the petitioner did not preserve his disqualification claim in the habeas court and, therefore, seeks to prevail on this claim pursuant to the plain error doctrine. \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine . . . has been codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part that [t]he court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines . . . that the decision is . . . erroneous in law. . . . The plain error doctrine is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 669, 877 A.2d 696 (2005). We conclude that the plain error doctrine is applicable to the present case because a habeas judge\u2019s alleged improper failure to disqualify himself in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and our rules of practice \u201cstrikes at the very core of judicial integrity and tends to undermine public confidence in the established judiciary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168, 444 A.2d 915 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(1982) (reviewing unpreserved claim of judicial bias pursuant to plain error doctrine); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>supra, 670-74 (plain error review of unpreserved claim of judicial disqualification).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">We begin our analysis with the Code of Judicial Conduct and our rules of practice. Canon 3 (c) (1) (B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cA judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where . . . the judge served as lawyer in the matter in controversy . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 1-22 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA judicial authority shall, upon motion of either party or upon its own motion, be disqualified from acting in a matter if such judicial authority is disqualified from acting therein pursuant to Canon 3 (c) of the Code of Judicial Conduct . . . .\u201d Pursuant to the plain language of canon 3 (c) (1) (B), a judge\u2019s impartiality reasonably might be questioned if the judge previously had served as a lawyer in the \u201cmatter in controversy . . . .\u201d We previously have observed that canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct \u201crequires a judge to disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The reasonableness standard is an objective one. Thus, the question is not only whether the particular judge is, in fact, impartial but whether a reasonable person would question the judge\u2019s impartiality on the basis of all the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 460, 680 A.2d 147 (1996), aff d after remand, 252 Conn. 128, 750 A.2d 448, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 835, 121 S. Ct. 93, 148 L. Ed. 2d 53 (2000). Moreover, it is well established that \u201c[e]ven in the absence of actual bias, a judge must disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, because the appearance and the existence of impartiality are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>both essential elements of a fair exercise of judicial authority.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 460-61; see also R. Flamm, Judicial Disqualification (1996) \u00a7 5.4.1, p. 150 (\u201cJudicial decisions rendered under circumstances suggesting bias or favoritism tend to breed skepticism, undermine the integrity of the courts, and generally thwart the principles upon which our jurisprudential system is based. Since an appearance of bias may be just as damaging to public confidence in the administration of justice as the actual presence of bias, acts or conduct giving the appearance of bias should generally be avoided in the same way as acts or conduct that inexorably bespeak partiality.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In the present case, the commissioner does not dispute that the convictions underlying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, namely, the Stamford and Nor-walk convictions, constitute the \u201cmatter in controversy.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Mixon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>620 F.2d 486 (5th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (habeas judge who reviewed petition for writ of habeas corpus after he had prosecuted petitioner in underlying criminal conviction was required to disqualify himself from habeas proceeding); <em>People </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>307 Ill. App. 3d 670, 673-74, 718 N.E.2d 356 (1999) (same), leave to appeal denied, 187 iLL. 2d 589, 724 N.E.2d 1274 (2000); J. Shaman, S. Lubet &amp; J. Alfini, Judicial Conduct and Ethics (3d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 4.16, p. 142 (\u201c[o]bviously, a judge would be disqualified from presiding over a case involving the same matter or arising from the same fact situation in which he or she previously served as an attorney\u201d). Additionally, the commissioner concedes that Judge White formerly had represented the petitioner with respect to the charges that led to the petitioner\u2019s Nor-walk conviction. Lastly, the commissioner concedes that canon 3 (c) (1) (B) and Practice Book \u00a7 1-22 (a) required Judge White to disqualify himself sua sponte from the present case. In light of these concessions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>we conclude that Judge White improperly failed to disqualify himself because he previously had served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We further conclude that Judge White\u2019s failure to disqualify himself constitutes plain error. Judge White presided over a habeas petition that initially had alleged, in relevant part, that his own prior representation of the petitioner was so deficient that it deprived the petitioner of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment to the federal constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because a reasonable person would question Judge White\u2019s impartiality under the present circumstances, we conclude that his participation in the present case resulted in plain error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 681 (\u201cbefore reversing a judgment of conviction and a concomitant sentence, we must . . . review the record as a whole for evidence of actual or <em>apparent prejudice </em>to the defendant\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We emphasize that the petitioner does not claim, and nothing in the record suggests, that Judge White actually harbored a personal bias or prejudice against the petitioner. Indeed, the parties agree that, at the time of the habeas proceedings, Judge White was unaware of his former representation of the petitioner. Regardless, because the appearance of impartiality is one of the \u201cessential elements of a fair exercise of judicial authority\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>supra, 238 Conn. 461; we conclude that plain error exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The commissioner claims, however, that the petitioner implicitly had consented to Judge White\u2019s improper adjudication of the present case pursuant to \u00a7 51-39 (c). We reject this claim. Section 51-39 (c) provides: \u201cWhen any judge or family support magistrate is disqualified to act in any proceeding before him, he may act if the parties thereto consent in open court.\u201d \u201cIt is well settled that, in both civil and criminal cases, the failure to raise the issue of [judicial] disqualification either before or during the trial, can be construed as the functional equivalent of consent in open court . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 671. This is because \u201cwe will not permit parties to anticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them, <em>for a cause which was well known to them before or during the trial. </em>We have repeatedly indicated our disfavor with the failure, whether because of a mistake of law, inattention or design, to object to errors occurring in the course of a trial until it is too late for them to be corrected, and thereafter, if the outcome of the trial proves unsatisfactory, with the assignment of such errors as grounds of appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 205, 487 A.2d 191 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Thus, to consent in open court, the parties must know or have reason to know of the judge\u2019s participation in the trial proceedings and the facts that require the judge to disqualify himself, but, nonetheless, fail to object in a timely manner.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>supra, 274 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Conn. 671 (judge who had presided over plea negotiations also presided over trial); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>257 Conn. 106, 116-17, 777 A.2d 580 (2001) (judge informed of part B information in open court in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 37-11); <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 203-205 (judge who had presided over settlement conferences also presided over trial); <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>155 Conn. 609, 614-15, 236 A.2d 466 (1967) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kohlfuss, 152 </em>Conn. 625, 628-31, 211 A.2d 143 (1965) (judge who had served on defendant\u2019s sentence review committee also presided over defendant\u2019s trial on separate criminal charges; defendant apparently had recognized disqualified judge but did not raise objection during trial); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeGennaro, </em>147 Conn. 296, 303-304, 160 A.2d 480 (judge who had presided over defendant\u2019s first trial also presided over defendant\u2019s second trial), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 873, 81 S. Ct. 116, 5 L. Ed. 2d 95 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In the present case, the petitioner was not present at the hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss and did not become aware of the identity of the habeas judge until <em>after </em>the habeas proceedings had concluded completely. Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s habeas counsel did not know, nor did he have any reason to know, of Judge White\u2019s prior representation of the petitioner until <em>after </em>the habeas proceedings had concluded completely. See footnote 12 of this opinion. On the basis of this record, we conclude that the petitioner did not consent in open court pursuant to \u00a7 51-39 (c).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The commissioner claims that, despite the existence of plain error in the habeas proceedings, we independently are obligated to determine whether the habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The commissioner further claims that the habeas court lacked jurisdiction under <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 530, because the petitioner was not in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466 when he filed his habeas petition. The petitioner responds that, in light of the plain error in the habeas proceedings, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the jurisdiction of the habeas court. If this court reaches the merits of the commissioner\u2019s jurisdictional claim, however, the petitioner claims that he was in custody when he filed his habeas petition and, therefore, jurisdiction existed in the habeas court. Alternatively, if this court concludes that the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly failed to construe his habeas petition as a writ of error coram nobis, a pleading over which the habeas court properly could have exercised jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In light of the unique nature of subject matter jurisdiction, we conclude that we independently are obligated to address the commissioner\u2019s jurisdictional claim. After conducting an independent review of the record and the case law concerning the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466, we conclude that the petitioner was not in custody when his habeas petition was filed and, therefore, the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Moreover, because the petitioner\u2019s writ of error coram nobis claim was not raised in the habeas court, we conclude that it is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subj ect matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Moreover, [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>diction at any time. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. ... [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... The subject matter jurisdiction requirement may not be waived by any party, and also may be raised by a party, or by the court sua sponte, at any stage of the proceedings, including on appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>273 Conn. 434, 441, 870 A.2d 448 (2005); see also <em>Johnson v.

The court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case. . . . Whenever a court finds that it has no jurisdiction, it must dismiss the case, without regard to previous rulings.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). \u201c[W]here the court rendering the judgment lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter the judgment itself is void.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain, LLC, </em>277 Conn. 696, 725, 894 A.2d 259 (2006).

In support of this claim, the petitioner relies on General Statutes \u00a7 51-183d, which provides in relevant part that, \u201c[i]f a judge acts in any legal proceeding in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>is disqualified, the proceeding shall not by reason thereof be void, but such action shall constitute an irregularity of which advantage may be taken by appeal or, where no appeal lies, by proceedings in error.\u201d We reject this claim. We previously have observed that \u00a7 51-183d plainly provides that \u201cproceedings before a disqualified judge are not void but merely <em>voidable.\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kohlfuss, </em>supra, 152 Conn. 630; see also General Statutes \u00a7 51-39 (c) (parties may waive judge\u2019s disqualification). \u201cA voidable judgment is a judgment entered erroneously by a court having jurisdiction.\u201d 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 28 (2006). Although a voidable judgment may be reversed on appeal because \u201can action by a court is contrary to a statute, constitutional provision, or rule of civil or appellate procedure,\u201d the judgment itself is valid and binding on all parties. Id.; see also Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 1 (1982) (judgment is valid if court had subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction and adequate notice was afforded to all parties). Although the habeas judge\u2019s failure to disqualify himself constitutes plain error, the judgment rendered by the habeas court was valid and binding. Because a valid final judgment exists, we have jurisdiction over the present appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Having determined that this court has appellate jurisdiction to consider the commissioner\u2019s jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>claim, we next address whether it is appropriate for us to do so. As previously explained, \u201c[s]ubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 441; and a judgment rendered without subject matter jurisdiction is void. See <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain, LLC, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 725. Further, it is well established that a reviewing court properly may address jurisdictional claims that neither were raised nor ruled on in the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Commins, </em>276 Conn. 503, 512, 886 A. 2d 824 (2005) (reviewing jurisdictional claim raised by defendant for first time on appeal); <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 440 n.8 (reviewing jurisdictional claim raised by Appellate Court sua sponte). Indeed, \u201c[o]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised, [it] <em>must be disposed of </em>no matter in what form it is presented. . . . <em>The court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 813 (reviewing jurisdictional claim raised by respondent for first time on appeal). In the present case, the jurisdictional facts are not in dispute,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the parties fully have briefed and argued the merits of the jurisdictional issue. Under such circumstances, we conclude that we are obligated to determine whether the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We recognize, however, that the habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>court also addressed the jurisdictional question, and that plain error existed in the habeas proceedings. See part I of this opinion. As such, we do not review the propriety of the habeas court\u2019s factual findings or legal conclusions, but, instead, conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the present case. Essentially, we treat the commissioner\u2019s claim as if it had been raised for the first time on appeal before this court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We next address the jurisdiction of the habeas court. The commissioner claims that, because the petitioner\u2019s Stamford and Norwalk convictions had expired completely by the time the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition was filed, the petitioner was not in custody on those convictions as required by \u00a7 52-466. The petitioner claims, however, that he was in custody on his Stamford and Norwalk convictions when he filed his habeas petition because, pursuant to <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 45-46, the petitioner\u2019s current confinement is part of a continuous stream of custody and reversal of his Stamford and Norwalk convictions would advance his release date. Alternatively, the petitioner claims that, under <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 405, he was in custody because \u201cno channel of review was actually available to [the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tioner] with respect to [his] prior conviction, due to no fault of his own.\u201d We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Section 52-466 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the superior court or to a judge thereof for the judicial district in which the person whose <em>custody is in question is claimed to be illegally confined or deprived of his liberty </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 526, we concluded that the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 is jurisdictional in nature because the \u201chistory and purpose of the writ of habeas corpus establish that the habeas court lacks the power to act on a habeas petition absent the petitioner\u2019s allegedly unlawful custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In <em>Lebr\u00f3n, </em>the petitioner, who was incarcerated pursuant to a 1999 state conviction, filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging an expired 1992 state conviction. Id., 509-10. The petition challenged the 1992 conviction on grounds of actual innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel. Id., 510. The petition further alleged that the 1992 conviction enhanced the petitioner\u2019s sentence and inmate security classification for the 1999 conviction. Id. The habeas court dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, reasoning that \u201cthe petitioner no longer was in custody under the 1992 conviction because the sentence imposed for that conviction had been served fully by the time the habeas petition was filed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We concluded that the habeas court properly had dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id., 526-30. Specifically, we concluded that the petitioner was not in \u201c \u2018custody\u2019 \u201d on the 1992 conviction because that conviction had expired fully by the time the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition had been filed. Id., 530. We further concluded that the collateral consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of the expired 1992 conviction, namely, the enhancement of the petitioner\u2019s sentence and security classification for the 1999 conviction, were insufficient to render the petitioner in custody on that conviction. Id., 530-31. To conclude otherwise, we noted, would \u201c[stretch] the language [of \u00a7 52-466] too far. . . . Although the custody requirement has been construed liberally<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> ... it has never been extended to the situation where a habeas petitioner <em>suffers no present restraint from a conviction. . . . </em>Such an interpretation would mean that a petitioner whose sentence has completely expired could nonetheless challenge the conviction for which it was imposed at any time through a state petition for habeas corpus and would read the in custody requirement out of the statute. ... To the extent that the petitioner in the present matter claims that the alleged enhancement of his current sentence and security classification has deprived [him] of his liberty under \u00a7 52-466 and has rendered him in custody, his loss of liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>stems solely from his current conviction.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., citing <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 491-93, 109 S. Ct. 1923, 104 L.

Because the petitioner\u2019s Stamford and Norwalk convictions had expired completely by the time the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition had been filed, and because the current deportation proceedings are a collateral consequence of the petitioner\u2019s expired Norwalk conviction, the petitioner is not in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466. Cf. <em>Kandiel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>964 F.2d 794, 796 (8th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (\u201c[bjecause [the petitioner\u2019s] sentence was fully expired by the time he filed his [federal habeas petition] and the current deportation proceedings against him are merely a collateral consequence of his conviction, he is not \u2018in custody\u2019 \u201d); <em>Neyor </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>155 F. Sup. 2d 127, 131-34 (D.N.J. 2001) (petitioner not in custody on expired state conviction, despite deportation proceedings predicated on that conviction). Simply stated, the collateral consequences of the petitioner\u2019s expired convictions, although severe, are insufficient to render the petitioner in custody on those convictions and, therefore, to invoke the jurisdiction of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The petitioner claims, nonetheless, that he is in custody on his expired Norwalk conviction pursuant to <em>Garlotte v. Fordice, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 39, because reversal of that conviction would terminate his current federal custody. We reject this claim. In <em>Garlotte, </em>the petitioner was serving a series of consecutive sentences imposed by the state of Mississippi when he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Id., 41-42. The petition sought \u201cto attack a conviction underlying the sentence that ran first in a consecutive series, a sentence already served, but one that nonetheless persisted] to postpone [his] eligibility for parole.\u201d Id., 41. To determine whether the petitioner was in custody on his expired conviction, the court looked to its prior case law construing the custody requirement. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>observed that, in <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1968), it had held that the term \u201cin custody\u201d encompassed a future consecutive sentence that a habeas petitioner had not yet begun to serve when his habeas petition had been filed. <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 40. The court noted that, \u201c[l]ike the habeas petitioners in <em>Peyton, </em>[the] petitioner [in <em>Garlotte] </em>is incarcerated under consecutive sentences. Unlike the <em>Peyton </em>petitioners, however, [the petitioner in <em>Garlotte] </em>does not challenge a conviction underlying a sentence yet to be served,\u201d but, instead, challenges a conviction underlying a sentence previously served. Id., 41. The court concluded that, despite this factual distinction, \u201c [\u00b6] ollowing <em>Peyton, </em>we do not disaggregate [consecutive] sentences, but comprehend them as composing a continuous stream,\u201d and, therefore, the petitioner in <em>Garlotte </em>was in custody on his expired conviction. Id. In arriving at this conclusion, the court recognized that, in <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 492, it had determined that a petitioner is not in custody on a conviction if the sentence for that conviction had expired completely by the time the habeas petition had been filed. The court distinguished <em>Maleng, </em>however, by noting that the petitioner in <em>Garlotte, </em>\u201c[u]nlike the habeas petitioner in <em>Maleng </em>... is serving consecutive sentences. . . . Having construed the statutory term \u2018in custody\u2019 to require that consecutive sentences be viewed in the aggregate, we will not now adopt a different construction simply because the sentence imposed under the challenged conviction lies in the past rather than in the future.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In <em>Maleng, </em>the court explicitly rejected the claim that a habeas petitioner is in custody on an expired conviction because reversal of that conviction would advance the date of the petitioner\u2019s release from his current confinement. See also <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>rection, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 526-27 and n.14 (habeas petitioner not in custody on expired conviction under \u00a7 52-466, even though reversal of conviction would advance petitioner\u2019s date of release from current confinement). <em>Garlotte </em>did not overrule <em>Maleng </em>in this respect, but simply determined that a series of consecutive sentences, unlike other forms of custody, are viewed in \u201cthe aggregate, not as discrete segments.\u201d <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 47. Therefore, a petitioner serving consecutive sentences \u201cremains \u2018in custody\u2019 under all of [the] sentences until all are served . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Id., 41. Because the petitioner in the present case is not serving consecutive sentences, we conclude that <em>Maleng </em>and <em>Lebr\u00f3n, </em>rather than <em>Garlotte, </em>dictate the outcome of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The petitioner claims, nonetheless, that he is in custody on his expired convictions because a criminal conviction followed by the commencement of deportation proceedings, like the imposition of consecutive sentences, should be treated as a continuous stream of custody. We are not persuaded. In <em>Peyton </em>and <em>Garlotte, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that consecutive sentences constitute a continuous stream of custody because most states aggregate consecutive sentences for various penological purposes, such as parole eligibility and accrual of good time credit. See <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 64 (\u201cPractically speaking, [the respondent] is in custody <em>for [fifty] </em>years, or for the aggregate of his [thirty] and [twenty] year sentences. For purposes of his parole eligibility, under Virginia law he is incarcerated for [fifty] years.\u201d); <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 46 n.5 (\u201cThat Mississippi itself views consecutive sentences in the aggregate for various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>penological purposes reveals the difficulties that courts and prisoners would face trying to determine when one sentence ends and a consecutive sentence begins. For example, Mississippi aggregates consecutive sentences for purposes of determining parole eligibility . . . and for the purpose of determining commutation of sentences for meritorious eamed-time credit.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). Moreover, the court was cognizant of the fact that the order in which criminal prosecutions are commenced, and consecutive sentences are imposed, often is arbitrary. See, e.g., <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 55-56 (noting that petitioner was charged and convicted of rape, and subsequently was charged and convicted of crime that arose out of same sequence of events); <em>Garlotte </em>v. <em>Fordice, </em>supra, 44 (observing that prosecutor had expressed indifference about order in which petitioner\u2019s consecutive sentences should be imposed). These concerns, however, are not implicated in the present factual context. Specifically, we are not aware of any jurisdiction that aggregates a criminal conviction and a subsequent deportation proceeding for penological purposes. Further, a criminal prosecution and a deportation proceeding cannot be commenced in an arbitrary order. Indeed, a deportation proceeding, like all collateral consequences, necessarily arises out of, and is successive to, the conviction of a particular crime. Accordingly, we conclude that the reasoning of <em>Peyton </em>and <em>Garlotte </em>is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The petitioner claims, however, that <em>Simmonds </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>326 F.3d 351 (2d Cir. 2003), stands for the proposition that a criminal conviction followed by a deportation proceeding constitutes a continuous stream of custody.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We disagree. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Simmonds, </em>the petitioner was incarcerated pursuant to a state conviction when he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, challenging a final order of removal issued by the INS. Id., 353. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit observed that, ordinarily, a final order of removal is sufficient, by itself, to render a habeas petitioner in the custody of the INS. Id., 354. The INS claimed, however, that the petitioner was not in INS custody because the order of removal could not be executed until after the petitioner had finished serving his state sentences. Id., 355. The Court of Appeals rejected this claim, reasoning that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cposition is the same as that of an ordinary habeas petitioner who seeks to attack a sentence of incarceration, in one jurisdiction, when that sentence was made consecutive to the one the petitioner is then serving in another jurisdiction. In such circumstances, it is well established that custody exists in both jurisdictions and hence that habeas may lie to attack <em>the future </em>sentence . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The court did not conclude, as the petitioner in this case suggests, that the petitioner in <em>Simmonds </em>was in INS custody because a state sentence and a final order of removal constitute a continuous stream of custody. Rather, the court simply acknowledged that <em>future </em>custody may operate as a <em>present </em>restraint on liberty sufficient to render the petitioner in the custody of <em>the future custo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>dian, </em>even in the absence of a continuous stream of custody. See id., 354 (\u201c[a]lthough [the petitioner] is not, literally, a prisoner of the INS, courts have long recognized that the writ is available to those who, although not actually imprisoned, suffer such a curtailment of liberty as to render them \u2018in custody\u2019 \u201d); see also <em>Braden </em>v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, </em>410 U.S. 484, 488-89, 93 S. Ct. 1123, 35 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1973) (petitioner, who was serving Alabama state sentence when habeas petition was filed, was in custody of state of Kentucky because he was subject to outstanding Kentucky indictment and interstate detainer); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>842 F.2d 42, 43-45 (2d Cir.) (petitioner, who was serving federal sentence when habeas petition was filed, was in custody of state of New York, despite absence of detainer, because there was reasonable basis to apprehend that New York would require petitioner to serve his state sentence), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 842, 109 S. Ct. 114, 102 L. Ed. 2d 88 (1988); cf. 28 J.

See footnote 11 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> We recognize that various jurisdictions have reevaluated whether deportation is a collateral consequence of a criminal conviction in light of recent amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., which render deportation virtually automatic for a noncitizen defendant convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a) (43). See Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 505, 104 Stat. 4978, 5050 (1990) (eliminating judge\u2019s authority to issue recommendation against deportation); Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 442 (a) (5), 110 Stat. 1214, 1279-80 (1996) (eliminating United States attorney general\u2019s discretion to grant relief from deportation for aliens who are not permanent residents); Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 348, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-639 (1996) (eliminating United States attorney general\u2019s discretion to grant relief from deportation for aliens who are permanent residents). Because the petitioner in the present case does not challenge the collateral nature of deportation, we need not consider what effect, if any, these amendments to the INA would have on our jurisprudence regarding the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction. We note, however, that most jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have concluded that immigration consequences continue to be collateral in nature, despite their virtual inevitability, because they are beyond the control and responsibility of the court in which the defendant was convicted.

In <em>Omosefunmi, </em>the petitioner filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging various expired state convictions. Id., 46-52. The District Court concluded that the petitioner was not in custody on the state convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>under attack because those convictions had expired completely by the time the habeas petition had been filed. Id., 53. The court, proceeded to observe, however, that the petitioner was subject to an outstanding order of deportation, and that the INS actively was attempting t,o deport the petitioner. Because deportation proceedings constitute \u201ca sufficient restraint on [the] petitioner\u2019s liberty to satisfy the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement,\u201d the District Court concluded that the petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of the federal habeas statute.

Because the District Court concluded that the petitioner was not in custody on his expired state convictions, but, rather, was in the custody of the INS pending deportation, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Omosefunmi </em>is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\"> In <em>Lebron, </em>we expressly \u201crejected] tire petitioner\u2019s argument thatLacfca<em>wanna County District Attorney </em>represents an exception to the rule in <em>Maleng </em>that the collateral consequences of an expired conviction are insufficient to render a petitioner in custody on the expired conviction at the time the petition is filed.\u201d <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 527 n.15.
