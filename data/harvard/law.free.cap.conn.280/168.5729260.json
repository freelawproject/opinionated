Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that their June 26, 2003 disclosure (June disclosure) of Peter H. Wiemik as an expert witness failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant procedural history. \u201cBy amended complaint filed August 7, 1998, the plaintiffs brought [a medical malpractice] action against the defendant physicians, John T. DeMaio, John M. DaSilva, Michael J. Tortora and Lynn K. Davis,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging [that they negligently had diagnosed and treated Howard Wexler\u2019s recurrent infections and hairy cell leukemia] . . . between November, 1994, and January, 1996. The defendants filed interrogatories and requests for production in the spring of 1998, in which they asked the plaintiffs to identify any expert witness to be called at trial, and to disclose the subject matter, facts and opinions on which the expert was expected to testily, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. The plaintiffs responded in August, 1998, that the expert disclosure would be \u2018supplied in accordance with [\u00a7 13-4] . . . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cOn July 10,2002, the court issued a scheduling order requiring the plaintiffs to disclose their experts by November 30, 2002. The plaintiffs disclosed no expert. On May 5, 2003, Davis filed a motion for summary judgment, maintaining that because the plaintiffs had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to disclose an expert witness to testify as to the standard of care, they could not meet their burden of proof in the case. On May 19, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a motion for extension of time until July 2, 2003, in which to disclose their expert witness, alleging that the expert retained prior to the commencement of the action was retired and would not testify. At a June 9, 2003 hearing on the motion, the court ordered the plaintiffs to provide an affidavit no later than June 11, 2003, by Thomas J. Airone, the attorney responsible for the case, stating when the expert was hired, when counsel discovered that the expert would be unable to testify and whether another expert was immediately available. An affidavit was filed on June 10, 2003, by attorney William F. Gallagher, [a member of the same law firm with which Airone was associated; see footnote 6 of this opinion] in which he stated that the expert had refused to appear in another case handled by his law firm in the spring of 2002, but that it was not until February or March, 2003, that Airone learned that the expert was unavailable. Gallagher stated in the affidavit that he was uncertain whether another expert was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u201cThe court issued a memorandum of decision on June 12, 2003, granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to extend time until noon on June 26, 2003. The court found that although the failure to disclose an expert resulted from the negligence of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the defense would not be prejudiced by the late disclosure, provided certain conditions were met. The disclosure was to comply fully with \u00a7 13-4 (4) and to include the expert\u2019s curriculum vitae, a list of all materials and information viewed or considered by the expert and a copy of all such materials not yet disclosed, as well as a list of all cases in which the expert had testified since January, 1999.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs were also ordered to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>expert available for a deposition on specific dates during the first two weeks of July and to bear all costs associated with the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cThe plaintiffs filed a disclosure of physician Peter H. Wiemik on the morning of June 26, 2003, which stated that he was expected to testily as to the standards of care that the defendants should have observed in treating Howard Wexler, the deviations from those standards of care and the causal relationship between the two. It further stated that Wiemik was expected to testify that DeMaio, DaSilva and Tortora missed and delayed the effective diagnosis of Howard Wexler\u2019s condition, that Davis failed to provide proper treatment once the condition was discovered, and that those failings subjected Howard Wexler to an unnecessary and more risky medical procedure, contributing to his current condition. [Wiemik\u2019s] opinions were based on his training, education, experience and background, on hospital records, office notes and medical records of the defendants, and on the transcripts of the depositions of Howard Wexler and the defendants. Attached to the disclosure was [Wiemik\u2019s] curriculum vitae.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u201cOn July 3, 2003, Davis filed a motion to preclude Wiemik\u2019s testimony, maintaining that the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure was vague, lacked sufficient detail and failed to comply with the court\u2019s order and \u00a7 13-4. Davis claimed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>inter alia, that the disclosure was deficient in that it did not state [Wiemik\u2019s] opinion as to the standard of care, how that standard had been breached, and how the breach affected Howard Wexler\u2019s life and health. In addition, the plaintiffs had provided no list of cases in which [Wiemik] had testified. The plaintiffs objected to the motion on the grounds that the disclosure complied with the requirements of \u00a7 13-4 (4) and that [Wiernik] had provided a short list of cases in which he had served as an expert witness, none of which had resulted in testimony. Davis responded that he had found at least two cases in which [Wiemik] had testified as an expert witness during the relevant period. The other defendants also filed a motion to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u201cA hearing on Davis\u2019 motion to preclude was held on September 4, 2003. The plaintiffs, now represented by Gallagher,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> proffered a July 7, 2003 e-mail from [Wiernik] that listed three cases in which he had been deposed. The plaintiffs claimed that prior to the disclosure, Wiemik had stated that he had no recollection of any testimony offered since January, 1999, and that it was his understanding that the defendants had been provided a copy of the e-mail. The defendants denied having received the e-mail. The court refused to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they had provided the defendants with all the information they possessed regarding prior testimony by Wiemik without testimony from Air-one on the matter. The plaintiffs also stated that [Wiernik] had been made available for a deposition on the dates required by the court\u2019s order. The court found that the disclosure was inadequate because, in addition to the absence of the ordered list of testimony, no detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>was provided with respect to the standard of care and the deviation therefrom.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u201cNevertheless, the court gave the plaintiffs a third opportunity to comply with the expert disclosure requirements. The court ordered the plaintiffs to provide the defendants with a written report from [Wiemik] by September 10, 2003, complying with the minimum requirements of \u00a7 13-4 (4), which the court proceeded to define in detail. The court also directed the plaintiffs to provide a list of all billings for those cases on which [Wiemik] had worked and transcripts of any testimony he had given since January, 1999. It further ordered that Wiemik be available for deposition within two weeks. The plaintiffs stated that it would be difficult to comply within the time frame ordered, that supplying the transcripts would be impossible and that although that kind of disclosure was standard practice in the federal courts, it was not provided for by \u00a7 13-4. The court responded that it had ordered transcripts to be supplied several months ago and that it was \u2018giving [the plaintiffs] the opportunity to have what amounts to a thirteenth hour compliance.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u201cThe plaintiffs filed a supplemental disclosure of their expert on September 25, 2003, which provided more detail as to [Wiemik\u2019s] expected testimony, but no written report, billing list or transcripts of prior testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>At a hearing on September 29,2003, the plaintiffs admitted that they had not complied with the court\u2019s order of September 4, 2003. The defendants renewed their motions to preclude and, based thereon, their motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs acknowledged that were the court to grant the motions to preclude, they could not meet their burden of proof in the case and that summary judgment in favor of the defendants would necessarily follow. The court noted that without the plaintiffs\u2019 expert disclosure, the defendants could not adequately prepare for trial. The court thereafter granted the defendants\u2019 motions to preclude and their motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Wexler </em>v. <em>DeMaio, 88 </em>Conn. App. 818, 820-24, 871 A.2d 1071 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the plaintiffs claimed that: \u201c(1) the court\u2019s articulation on September 4, 2003, of its June 12, 2003 order was not reasonably clear and that their disclosure on June 26, 2003, complied with the reasonable meaning of the court\u2019s June 12, 2003 order, and (2) the court abused its discretion by requiring that the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure of their expert witness meet the federal standard for disclosure of expert witnesses.\u201d Id., 824-25. In a divided opinion, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. First, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s discovery order on September 4, 2003 (September order) was not an articulation of the June 12, 2003 discovery order (June order) because the September order had required the plaintiffs to produce additional materials beyond those previously ordered in June.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>826. Second, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court properly had sanctioned the plaintiffs for a violation of the June order. Id., 831-32. Specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that the June order was reasonably clear, and that it plainly required the plaintiffs to disclose \u201cas to each defendant individually . . . the standard of care, the action or inaction of the defendant who breached that standard, the specific harm that flowed from the breach and the basis for each of [Wiemik\u2019s] conclusions.\u201d Id., 828. The Appellate Court further concluded that the trial court properly had found that the plaintiffs had violated the June order because their disclosure had failed to: (1) distinguish between the several defendants; (2) disclose a standard of care; (3) allege any deviations from the standard of care with specificity; (4) state the nature of the harm allegedly caused by the defendants\u2019 actions or inactions; (5) link the sources relied on by Wiemik in forming his opinions to his particular opinions; and (6) provide a list of cases in which Wiemik had testified. Id., 830-31. Moreover, the Appellate Court concluded that the sanction imposed by the trial court, namely, the issuance of the September order, was proportional to the violation. Id., 831-32. Finally, the Appellate Court concluded that the September order was reasonably clear, that the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure failed to comply with that order and that the sanction imposed by the trial court, namely, preclusion of Wiemik\u2019s testimony, was proportional to the violation. Id., 832-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In a dissenting opinion, Chief Judge Lavery concluded that the trial court\u2019s September order \u201cserved as an articulation of the June order insofar as it elucidated what the court was contemplating when it mandated \u2018a written disclosure fully complying with ... \u00a7 13-4 (4) . . . .\u2019 Putting aside the question of whether standard disclosure of the detailed information included in the September order would promote desirable litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>policy, the requirements articulated by the court simply have no basis in the plain language of the rule or in the appellate jurisprudence interpreting the rule.\u201d Id., 834. \u201cAlternatively, looking to the plain language of the June . . . order without the benefit of the court\u2019s later articulation,\u201d Chief Judge Lavery concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 June 26, 2003 response was compliant and . . . the September . . . order was unwarranted.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In this certified appeal, the plaintiffs renew the claims that they raised in the Appellate Court. Before addressing the substance of these claims, we clarify what is not at issue in the present case. The plaintiffs do not dispute that the trial court had the authority to order them to disclose the expected testimony of Wiemik, and the basis for that testimony, with more specificity and detail than \u00a7 13-4 (4) requires. See id., 832-33 n.6 (trial court had power to order plaintiffs to produce detailed written report of expert witness\u2019 expected testimony because court \u201chas inherent power to regulate proceedings before it to the extent reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ably necessary to discharge its judicial responsibilities and to provide for the efficient administration of justice\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Rather, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 June disclosure lacked sufficient detail to satisfy \u00a7 13-4 (4) and, consequently, failed to comply with the court\u2019s June order. After reviewing the plain language of \u00a7 13-4 (4), prior case law concerning the scope of disclosure required by that provision, the purpose and history of \u00a7 13-4 (4) and the record in the present case, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 June disclosure complied, albeit minimally, with the requirements of \u00a7 13-4 (4). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cIn order for a trial court\u2019s order of sanctions for violation of a discovery order to withstand scrutiny, three requirements must be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cFirst, the order to be complied with must be reasonably clear. In this connection, however, we also state that even an order that does not meet this standard may form the basis of a sanction if the record establishes that, notwithstanding the lack of such clarity, the party sanctioned in fact understood the trial court\u2019s intended meaning. This requirement poses a legal question that we will review de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cSecond, the record must establish that the order was in fact violated. This requirement poses a question of fact that we will review using a clearly erroneous standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u201cThird, the sanction imposed must be proportional to the violation. This requirement poses a question of the discretion of the trial court that we will review for abuse of that discretion. \u201d <em>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Standard, </em>257 Conn. 1, 17-18, 776 A.2d 1115 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>We begin our analysis with the issue of the clarity of the trial court\u2019s June order, which required the plaintiffs, inter alia, to file \u201c[a]t or before 12:00 noon on Thursday, June 26, 2003 ... a written disclosure fully complying with ... \u00a7 13-4 (4) as to each expert [witness] whom they intend to call at trial in support of their claims against any defendant on the issues of standard of care, deviation from the standard of care and/or resulting causation of injuries or losses.\u201d We conclude that this order is reasonably clear and that it plainly required the plaintiffs to file, in accordance with \u00a7 13-4 (4), a written disclosure with respect to each expert witness they expected to call to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Because the trial court ordered the plaintiffs to disclose their expert witnesses in accordance with \u00a7 13-4 (4), we next address whether the disclosure requirements set forth therein are reasonably clear. Section 13-4 (4) provides in relevant part that \u201cany plaintiff expecting to call an expert witness at trial shall disclose the name of that expert, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion, to all other parties within a reasonable time prior to trial. ...\u201d See footnote 3 of this opinion. We conclude that this provision is reasonably clear and plainly requires a plaintiff to disclose: (1) the name of the expert witness; (2) the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify; (3) the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify; and (4) a summary of the grounds for each opinion. See <em>Menna </em>v. <em>Jaiman, </em>80 Conn. App. 131, 135, 832 A.2d 1219 (2003) (\u201cmandates of ... \u00a7 13-4 are \u2018reasonably clear\u2019 and satisfy the first prong of the test under <em>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc. \"); Advanced Financial Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Appraisal Services, Inc., </em>79 Conn. App. 22, 46, 830 A.2d 240 (2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(\u201cthe order with which the defendants were required to comply was reasonably clear, and the defendants knew that in complying with the order they had to comply with ... \u00a7 13-4 [4]\u201d); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, Inc., </em>64 Conn. App. 750, 759, 785 A.2d 588 (2001) (\u201cWe conclude that the court\u2019s discovery order satisfied the first prong of the <em>Millbrook [Owners Assn., Inc.] </em>test in that it was \u2018reasonably clear.\u2019 The order merely required the substitute plaintiff to comply with [\u00a7 13-4].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We next consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs had violated the June order. Ordinarily, the question of whether a trial court\u2019s discovery order was in fact violated presents this court with \u201ca question of fact that we will review using a clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d <em>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Standard, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 17-18. In the present case, however, the trial court found that the plaintiffs had violated the June order solely because the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure lacked the specificity and detail required by \u00a7 13-4 (4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See footnote 7 of this opinion. Because the propriety of that finding necessarily depends on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion concerning the breadth of disclosure required by \u00a7 13-4 (4), our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaporta, </em>237 Conn. 58, 64 n.5, 676 A.2d 814 (1996) (\u201cthe proper construction of a Practice Book section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>involves a question of law, [over which] our review ... is plenary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">To determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 June disclosure is sufficiently detailed to satisfy \u00a7 13-4 (4), we turn to the content of that disclosure. The June disclosure provides in relevant part: \u201cB. Subject Matter of Testimony: The plaintiff[s] [expect] that [Wiemik] will testify as to the standard of care [Davis] should have observed in attempting to treat the recurrent infectious process and [h]airy [c]ell leukemia of Howard Wexler on or about October 10, 1995. [Wiemik] is also expected to testify as to the deviations from the identified standards of care by [Davis], and as to the causal relationship between these deviations and the resultant need for [the] splenectomy suffered by Howard Wexler.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201c[Wiemik] is further expected to testify as to the standard of care . . . [DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva] should have observed in attempting to treat the recurrent infectious process and [h]airy [c]ell leukemia of Howard Wexler commencing on or about July 8, 1995. [Wiemik] is also expected to testify as to the deviations from the identified standards of care by . . . [DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva], and as to the causal relationship between these deviations and the resultant need for [the] splenectomy suffered by Howard Wexler.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u201cC. Substance of Facts and Opinions to Which the Expert is Expected to Testify: [Wiemik] is expected to testify that all the defendants missed and delayed the effective diagnosis of [Howard] Wexler\u2019s condition. In addition, [Wiemik] is expected to testify that [Davis] should have immediately treated [Howard] Wexler with chemotherapy when the first diagnosis of [h]airy [c]ell leukemia was made, and if [Howard] Wexler had been effectively treated with chemotherapy, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, he would not have required the resultant splenectomy. These deviations from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>standard of care were substantial factors in contributing to [Howard] Wexler\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cFurther, [Wiemik] is expected to testify that if . . . [DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva] had not missed and delayed the diagnosis, by continuing to mask the symptoms with antibiotics, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, [Howard] Wexler would not have needed a splenectomy. Further, because . . . [DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva] missed and delayed the diagnosis, the performance of the splenectomy on January 23, 1996 was much more risky, and subjected [Howard] Wexler to a much higher potential rate of mortality. These deviations from the standard of care were substantial factors in contributing to [Howard] Wexler\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cD. Summary of Grounds for Each Opinion: [Wiernik\u2019s] opinions are based upon his training, education, experience and background as an oncologist and internal medicine specialist, director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center, a member of the [Our Lady of Mercy] Cancer Center Department of Medical Oncology, and professor of medicine and radiation oncology, New York Medical College. He is also [b]oard [certified in [i]ntemal [m]edicine and the subspecialty [b]oard of [m]edical [o]ncology .... [Wiemik] will use, as a basis for his opinions:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u201c1. Medical records and reports contained in the entire [Saint] Francis [Hospital and] Medical Center record of Howard Wexler;</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u201c2. The office notes and medical records of [DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva];</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u201c3. The office notes and medical records of [Davis];</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u201c4. The deposition transcripts of Howard Wexler, and reports and exhibits marked therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u201c5. The deposition transcripts of testimony to be given by [DeMaio, Tortora, DaSilva and Davis], and reports and exhibits marked therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Although the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure is not a model of clarity and detail, we conclude that it is sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 13-4 (4). First, the disclosure adequately describes the subject matter of Wiemik\u2019s expected testimony, namely, the essential elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical malpractice claim, i.e., the standard of care, the defendants\u2019 deviation therefrom and a causal connection between the alleged deviation and the harm suffered by Howard Wexler. Second, although the disclosure does not delineate explicitly and individually Wiemik\u2019s expected testimony with respect to each of these essential elements, we conclude that it adequately sets forth the <em>substance </em>of Wiemik\u2019s expected testimony concerning each element. Specifically, with respect to Davis, a hematologist, it is apparent from the face of the disclosure that Wiemik was expected to testify that the applicable standard of care required Davis to administer chemotherapy immediately after Howard Wexler first had been diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia, and that Davis deviated from the standard of care by failing to do so. With respect to DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva, all general surgeons, it is apparent from the face of the disclosure that Wiemik was expected to testify that the applicable standard of care required DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva promptly to diagnose the recurrent infectious process and hairy cell leukemia of Howard Wexler, and to refrain from administering antibiotics that would mask the symptoms of these conditions and, further, that, DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva deviated from the standard of care by failing to do so. Moreover, with respect to causation, it is apparent from the face of the disclosure that Wiemik was expected to testify that the defendants\u2019 deviations from the standard of care proximately caused Howard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Wexler to undergo a risky and otherwise unnecessary splenectomy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, the disclosure provides a detailed list of the documents and materials on which Wiemik relied to form his opinions and, as such, adequately identifies the grounds for each opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 June disclosure, when read in its entirety, is sufficiently detailed to comply with \u00a7 13-4 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The Appellate Court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure failed to comply with \u00a7 13-4 (4) because it did not distinguish between DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva. <em>Wexler </em>v. <em>DeMaio, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 830-31. Although we encourage plaintiffs to describe separately an expert witness\u2019 proposed testimony concerning each defendant, we cannot conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to do so violates \u00a7 13-4 (4) under the present circumstances. As an initial matter, we note that \u201c\u00a7 13-4 (4) does not address explicitly the need to distinguish among defendants against whom expert testimony will be offered.\u201d <em>Vitone </em>v. <em>Waterbury Hospital, </em>88 Conn. App. 347, 355, 869 A.2d 672 (2005). As we previously have explained, however, it does require a plaintiff to disclose the \u201csubstance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (4). It is only logical to conclude that the substance of an expert witness\u2019 opinions, and the facts on which he or she relies to form those opinions, may differ significantly with respect to each defendant in a multiparty action. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the standard of care applicable to a hematologist in connection with the diagnosis and treatment of hairy cell leukemia may differ significantly from the standard of care applicable to a general surgeon and, in turn, the standard of care applicable to both medical specialties may differ significantly depending on the time period during which treatment was rendered. In the present case, however, the record reflects that DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva all are general surgeons who work in the same medical practice, and that each provided the same or similar medical treatment to Howard Wexler for the same or similar medical condition during the same limited time period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In light of this unique set of facts, we cannot conclude that the substance of Wiemik\u2019s expert opinions, and the sources on which he relied to form his opinions, would differ significantly with respect to these three defendants. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to distinguish between DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva does not violate \u00a7 13-4 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The Appellate Court further concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure failed to comply \u00a7 13-4 (4) because it \u201cfailed to link [the documents on which Wiemik relied to form his opinions] in any way to any particular opinion.\u201d <em>Wexler </em>v. <em>DeMaio, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 830-31. We encourage all parties to explain the rationale and support for each of their expert witness\u2019 opinions individually and in as much detail as possible, but, nonetheless, we cannot conclude that such specificity is required by \u00a7 13-4 (4). Although \u00a7 13-4 (4) requires a plaintiff to disclose \u201ca summary of the grounds for <em>each </em>opinion\u201d; (emphasis added) Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (4); it does not require the summary, or the particular documents upon which the expert witness relied, to be linked explicitly to each individual opinion. We conclude that it is sufficient under the plain language of \u00a7 13-4 (4) to provide a separate and detailed list of materials on which the expert witness relied to form his opinions. In the present case, because the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure contained such a list, we conclude that it complied with \u00a7 13-4 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Our review of the case law addressing the breadth of disclosure required by \u00a7 13-4 (4), as well as our research into the purpose and history of that provision, provides further support for our conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure was adequate under the present circumstances. The Appellate Court previously has concluded that a disclosure fails to comply with \u00a7 13-4 (4) only when the disclosure fails to apprise the defendant of the basic details of the plaintiffs claim. See, e.g., <em>Vitone </em>v. <em>Waterbury Hospital, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 350 n.3 (upholding preclusion of expert testimony when disclosure had stated that expert was expected to testify as to \u201c[standards of care which the [defendants failed to maintain\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Menna </em>v. <em>Jaiman, </em>supra, 80 Conn. App. 134-35 (upholding preclusion of expert testimony when disclosure had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>stated that experts were expected to testify \u201caccording to their expertise on their diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff as well as any prognosis for future care and permanent disability\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 757-58 n.4 (upholding preclusion of expert testimony when disclosure had stated that expert was expected to testify that \u201cthe care and treatment provided to [the plaintiff] . . . was not within the accepted standard of care and was a serious departure from then prevailing standards of care\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>Falco, </em>74 Conn. App. 86, 89-90, 812 A.2d 63 (2002) (upholding admission of expert testimony when disclosure had stated that expert was expected to testify \u201cin accordance with his treatment notes and evaluation and consultation reports\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The prior judicial construction of \u00a7 13-4 (4) is consistent with the purpose of that provision, which is to assist the defendant in the preparation of his case, and to eliminate unfair surprise by furnishing the defendant with the essential elements of a plaintiffs claim. See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Castaneda, </em>38 Conn. App. 628, 632, 662 A.2d 1308 (1995) (\u00a7 13-4 [4] is \u201cintended to furnish a defendant with details of a plaintiffs medical claim to assist in the preparation of the defendant\u2019s case\u201d); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S.

Indeed, the text of \u00a7 13-4 (4) was modeled on the interrogatory requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (1) (A),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which was not intended to elicit \u201can overly detailed exposition of the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> R.

[DeMaio], [DaSilva], [Tortora] and [Davis], and Howard Wexler\u2019s resultant condition and the need for a risky splenectomy. The pertinent time frame was identified. Regarding the standard of care, the disclosure posited that the three general surgeon defendants [DeMaio, DaSilva and Tortora], who practiced together and provided similar treatment to Howard Wexler, should have diagnosed him timely and accurately rather than masking his symptoms with antibiotics. As to the fourth defendant [Davis], a hematologist, the plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure revealed the theory that on making the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia, he should have treated Howard Wexler immediately with chemotherapy. According to the disclosure, the aforementioned deviations led to the need for a splenectomy and, further, that performance of the splenectomy was delayed to apoint that made it more risky and exposed Howard Wexler to a much higher rate of mortality. The plaintiffs also disclosed fully Wiemik\u2019s credentials and that his opinion was grounded in the defendants\u2019 office notes, medical records and deposition testimony.\u201d <em>Wexler </em>v. <em>DeMaio, </em>supra, 88 Conn.

We need not address the propriety of this factual finding, however, because the record reflects that although the trial court considered the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to submit the list of cases to be important, it was not the \u201ccenterpiece of [the court\u2019s] concern.\u201d Indeed, the court stated that the \u201ccenterpiece of [its] concern,\" and, thus, the basis for its finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 had violated the June order, was \u201cthe extraordinarily general nature of the disclosure\u201d and its failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13-4 (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> We farther note that the June disclosure identifies the time frame during which these events allegedly occurred. Specifically, the disclosure reveals that Wiemik was expected to testify as to the treatment that Davis provided to Howard Wexler commencing \u201con or about October 10, 1995,\u201d and the treatment that DeMaio, Tortora and DaSilva provided to Howard Wexler commencing \u201con or about July 8, 1995.\u201d The disclosure further reveals that Wiemik was expected to testify that these deviations from the standard of care proximately caused Howard Wexler to undergo a splenectomy \u201con January 23, 1996 . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b210-5\"> The defendants claim that reference to the facts contained in the record is improper when assessing the adequacy of a \u00a7 13-4 (4) disclosure.
