Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998). The defendant, Dalco Electric, Inc. (Dalco), appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, David Prentice, following a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted certain expert testimony because the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>lacked the required scientific foundation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the testimony in question was scientific evidence that required a validity assessment designed to ensure reliability pursuant to our analysis in <em>Porter. </em>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The plaintiff brought this personal injury action against the defendant alleging negligence. Prior to trial, the plaintiff identified Mervin Strauss, a professional forensic engineer and accident reconstructionist, as an expert witness. The defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude Strauss\u2019 testimony and requested a <em>Porter </em>hearing. The trial court declined to rule on this motion prior to trial and, over the defendant\u2019s repeated objection, allowed Strauss\u2019 expert testimony to be entered into evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff awarding the plaintiff $1.2 million in damages. Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict. Following extensive posttrial hearings, the trial court concluded that Strauss\u2019 testimony was admissible and did not constitute scientific evidence that required a validity assessment under <em>Porter.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em> <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict and rendered judgment thereon. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiff was employed by B.G. Graphics, Inc., a sign making company hired by the defendant to install a sign on the front of its building in Meriden. The plaintiff accompanied Benedict Gagliardi, Jr., a partner at B.G. Graphics, Inc., to complete the installation. Upon arriving at the defendant\u2019s building in Meriden and learning of the precise location on the building where the sign was to be installed, the plaintiff and Gagliardi informed Daniel Luft, a part owner of the defendant, that they would be unable to complete the work that day because the ladders that they had with them were too short. Luft offered Gagliardi the use of one of the defendant\u2019s extension ladders in order to install the sign. Gagliardi accepted Luft\u2019s offer solely to enable the plaintiff to take the necessary measurements to facilitate the installation of the sign on a future date. Gagliardi and the plaintiff informed Luft, however, that two people and two extension ladders were required to install the sign and that borrowing an extension ladder did not mean that the sign would go up that day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Luft offered the plaintiff the use of another one of the defendant\u2019s extension ladders and informed him that he was willing to provide any help necessary to complete the installation. Neither the plaintiff nor Gagliardi accepted Luft\u2019s offer to locate a second ladder or to provide assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The plaintiff and Gagliardi used the first extension ladder provided by the defendant and positioned it at the front of the building so that the plaintiff could take the necessary measurements for the sign\u2019s future instal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>lation. Although Gagliardi and the plaintiff had decided to take measurements only, and to install the defendant\u2019s sign on another day, Luft located a second extension ladder in one of the defendant\u2019s storage areas and, with the assistance of one of his employees, brought it to the front of the building where the sign was to be installed. Luft leaned the second ladder against the side of the building approximately eight to ten feet to the left of where the plaintiff had positioned the first ladder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff informed Luft that he and Gagliardi would not use the second ladder because it was in poor condition and because they were only taking measurements, which did not require multiple people or ladders to complete. In particular, the plaintiff noticed that the second ladder was missing braces required for stability and that someone had tried to repair it by bolting pieces of iron to the bottom of the ladder\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The plaintiff fully extended the first ladder and rested the top section of the ladder against the aluminum edge of the building\u2019s roof. The plaintiff then climbed approximately ten feet up the first ladder to take measurements for the sign\u2019s future installation. As the plaintiff was completing his work, the second ladder, which was positioned approximately ten feet to the left of where the plaintiff was working, fell to the right, slid against the edge of the defendant\u2019s roof and struck the first ladder, on which the plaintiff was standing, causing him to fall to the ground and to sustain serious injuries. No one was standing on or touching the second ladder when it fell and collided with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On the day of the incident, Meriden and the surrounding area experienced sustained winds of 11.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>miles per hour, with gusts of wind up to 18 miles per hour. The safety label on the ladder that collided with the plaintiff stated that it should not be used in high wind. Meteorologically, a high wind warning occurs when winds exceed thirty-nine miles per hour, and a high wind advisory occurs when a sustained wind exceeds forty-five miles per hour. Neither a high wind advisory nor a high wind warning had been issued for Meriden on the day the plaintiff was injured. Building on the facts surrounding the weather conditions on the day of the accident, the plaintiff introduced Strauss\u2019 expert testimony in an attempt to demonstrate that it would have been physically impossible for the prevailing winds to have overturned a ladder that was properly set up and free from defects. Additional facts Mull be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We begin with the standard of review that governs this case. It is well established that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>250 Conn. 172, 180, 738 A.2d 586 (1999). Concerning expert testimony specifically, \u201cthe trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. . . . Expert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u201cBeyond these general requirements regarding the admissibility of expert testimony, [t]here is a further hurdle to the admissibility of expert testimony when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that testimony is based on . . . scientific [evidence]. In those situations, the scientific evidence that forms the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion must undergo a validity assessment to ensure reliability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 68-69. In <em>Porter, </em>this court followed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), and held that scientific evidence should be subjected to a flexible test, with differing factors that are applied on a case-by-case basis, to determine the reliability of the scientific evidence. . . . Following <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 81-84, scientific evidence, and expert testimony based thereon, usually is to be evaluated under a threshold admissibility standard assessing the reliability of the methodology underlying the evidence and whether the evidence at issue is, in fact, derived from and based upon that methodology . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 154, 168, 847 A.2d 978 (2004). Accordingly, we limit the scope of our review to whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that Strauss\u2019 opinion was not scientific evidence and that a <em>Porter </em>hearing was not required. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>263 Conn. 390, 399, 820 A.2d 236 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>256 Conn. 854, 878, 776 A.2d 1091 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">By way of further background, we are also mindful that \u201c[i]n <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 78-80, we expressly recognized that, because the term scientific evidence houses such a large and diverse variety of topics, the formulation of a mechanical evidentiary standard of admissibility designed to apply universally to the many forms scientific evidence may take is an unworkable concept. Rather, the better formulation is a general, overarching approach to the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence .... In accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>this philosophy, we set forth in <em>Porter </em>a number of different factors, nonexclusive and whose application to a particular set of circumstances could vary, as relevant in the determination of the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence. ... In particular, we recognized the following considerations: general acceptance in the relevant scientific community; whether the methodology underlying the scientific evidence has been tested and subjected to peer review; the known or potential rate of error; the prestige and background of the expert witness supporting the evidence; the extent to which the technique at issue relies upon subjective judgments made by the expert rather than on objectively verifiable criteria; whether the expert can present and explain the data and methodology underlying the testimony in a manner that assists the jury in drawing conclusions therefrom; and whether the technique or methodology was developed solely for purposes of litigation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In <em>Porter, </em>we also set forth a \u201cfit\u201d requirement for scientific evidence. Id., 180. We stated that the \u201cproposed scientific testimony must be demonstrably relevant to the facts of the particular case in which it is offered, and not simply be valid in the abstract. . . . Put another way, the proponent of scientific evidence must establish that the specific scientific testimony at issue is, in fact, derived from and based upon [the scientifically reliable] methodology. . . . [Although some conclusions can be reasonably inferred from the methodology employed, others cannot.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Similarly, we recognized in <em>Porter </em>that \u201ca critical postulate that underlies the <em>Porter </em>factors and indeed underlies the entire <em>Porter </em>analysis [is that] in order for the trial court, in the performance of its role as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>gatekeeper for scientific evidence, properly to assess the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence, the proponent of the evidence must provide a sufficient articulation of the methodology underlying the scientific evidence. Without such an articulation, the trial court is entirely ill-equipped to determine if the scientific evidence is reliable upon consideration of the various <em>Porter </em>factors. Furthermore, without a clear understanding as to the methodology and its workings, the trial court also cannot properly undertake its analysis under the fit requirement of <em>Porter, </em>ensuring that the proffered scientific evidence, in fact, is based upon the reliable methodology articulated.\u201d Id., 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The defendant claims that a new trial is necessary because the trial court improperly admitted Strauss\u2019 expert opinion testimony. In particular, the defendant contends that Strauss\u2019 testimony was scientific evidence that lacked the required scientific foundation and was, therefore, inadmissible because it had not been subjected to a reliability and validity assessment under <em>Porter. </em>Conversely, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly concluded that Strauss\u2019 testimony was not scientific evidence and, therefore, that its admissibility was not dependent on the outcome of a <em>Porter </em>hearing. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our analysis of the question of whether a <em>Porter </em>hearing was required in this case. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had erected a defective ladder, which \u201cgave out at the defective portion of the foot, and began to slide across the front of the building striking the ladder [that] the [p]laintiff was on . . . .\u201d In particular, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant was negligent due to its numerous acts and omissions related to the \u201cdefective condition\u201d of the ladder and its improper installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Strauss was qualified by the trial court, without objection, as an expert in the field of mechanical and forensic engineering. At trial, Strauss opined, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the prevailing wind conditions in Meriden on the day of the accident would not have caused a properly set up ladder, free of defects, to fall from the building and collide with the plaintiff. Strauss further testified, however, that he could not state, within a reasonable degree of engineering probability, that the wind conditions on the day of the accident were not the sole cause of the second ladder\u2019s becoming dislodged from its resting position and colliding with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Strauss also acknowledged at trial that determining the amount of force required to move a particular object is an exercise within the realm of physics that requires the accumulation of certain factual data and the completion of mathematical calculations. Specifically, Strauss noted that, in order to make the necessary calculations in this case, an expert would need to know the wind speed, the weight of the ladder, and the coefficient of friction applicable to the ladder and to the aluminum edge of the defendant\u2019s roof. Equipped with this information, an engineer could then calculate whether an 11.5 to 18 mile per hour wind could apply sufficient force to cause a properly set up ladder of the same size, weight, and condition as the ladder in this case, to fall. Strauss acknowledged that he had not acquired any of this information as part of his investigation and experimentation at the accident site, and had not performed the scientific calculations that would allow him to express his opinion to a \u201creasonable degree of engineering probability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Indeed, Strauss testified that his conclusions were based on his experience as an engineer and that, despite his ability to undertake such an effort, at no point had he attempted to apply the readily available and applicable tools of physics and mathematics with which he could have tested his hypothesis. We also note that Strauss asserted that common experience may allow a layperson to conclude that a ladder will fall only if it is set up improperly, is defective, or is subjected to sufficient external force to knock it over. Strauss maintained, however, that common experience was not sufficient to enable a layperson to assess the likely effect of a wind at a certain speed on an immobile ladder. To the contrary, Strauss asserted that what distinguished him from an ordinary layperson was his engineering experience and education, which allowed him to apply the laws of physics to make such a calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The trial court concluded that Strauss\u2019 opinion testimony did not require a \u201cpreliminary gatekeeper <em>Porter-type </em>validity assessment.\u201d In particular, it noted that \u201c[t]he opinion testimony [that Strauss] provided . . . regarding the effect of certain wind speeds on a properly setup ladder in good condition was supported by other evidence [and was] thoroughly tested on cross-examination . . . .\u201d Additionally, the trial court ruled that a <em>Porter </em>hearing was not required because, although Strauss\u2019 testimony was rooted in scientific principles, it was \u201cnot the sort of scientific evidence that would place the jury in the position of abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment to the expert\u2019s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We conclude that Strauss\u2019 opinion was scientific evidence within the meaning of <em>Porter, </em>and that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Strauss\u2019 expert opinion testimony without first assessing the validity of the methodology underlying his opinion as part of a <em>Porter </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>First, by concluding that a separate validity assessment was not required under <em>Porter, </em>at least in part because Strauss\u2019 opinion testimony was supported by other evidence and was tested thoroughly on cross-examination,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court misconstrued the task that was before it. Specifically, the fact that there was other evidence in the record concerning the wind, namely, the subjective impressions of laypersons, a meteorologist\u2019s description of the prevailing winds on the day of the accident,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the warning that the ladder should not be used in high winds, does not render Strauss\u2019 opinion unscientific per se. In short, otherwise scientific evidence does not become unscientific simply because the opposing party has had an opportunity for cross-examination, or because there is unscientific evidence that tends to corroborate the expert\u2019s testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Indeed, all scientific evidence is subject to cross-examination and likely will find some corroboration from other evidence in the record. This fact, however, does not obviate the need for the trial court separately to determine whether Strauss\u2019 testimony required a validity assessment under <em>Porter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Second, with respect to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that <em>a. Porter </em>hearing was not required because Strauss\u2019 testimony, although rooted in scientific principles, would not place the jury in the position of abandoning common sense and sacrificing its independent judgment, Strauss\u2019 own statements at trial do not support the trial court\u2019s ruling. As discussed previously, Strauss acknowledged that common experience was not sufficient to enable a layperson to assess the likely effect of a wind at a certain speed on an immobile ladder. To the contrary, Strauss testified that the determination of the <em>amount </em>of force required to move a particular object is an exercise within the realm of physics, and requires the accumulation of certain factual data and the completion of mathematical calculations. This exercise is very different from an understanding of the general principle, which may be known to the average layperson, that if an external force is exerted on an object, that object may fall over. Indeed, an understanding of how to apply the sciences of physics and mathematics is necessary to determine the <em>amount </em>of force required to dislodge the defendant\u2019s ladder from the building, and whether that force could have been exerted by the prevailing winds in Meriden on the day of the accident, and the average person does not possess such an understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Strauss acknowledged this reality when he testified that he would need to know several variables, including the weight of the ladder and the coefficient of friction between the ladder and the building. Additionally, Strauss testified that physics and mathematics are sci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>entific tools relied upon by engineers, but that he was unable to state his opinion to a \u201creasonable degree of engineering probability\u201d because his investigation of the accident did not include any scientific calculations concerning what forces were applied to the ladder by the wind.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, although Strauss failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>gather the relevant data that would have enabled him to complete the required calculations,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> his opinion that the force created by the prevailing wind conditions in Meriden on the day of the accident was not sufficient to have caused a ladder that had been set up properly and was free of defects to fall over, was dependent on the result of scientific measurement and calculation. This opinion, therefore, constituted scientific evidence that required a validity assessment pursuant to our analysis in <em>Porter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Additionally, by exempting Strauss\u2019 opinion from a validity assessment under <em>Porter, </em>the trial court ignored the \u201ccritical postulate\u201d that underlies the entire <em>Porter </em>analysis, which is that any exemption for scientific evidence that depends upon existing techniques must presuppose an ability on the part of the proponent of the evidence to \u201cprovide a sufficient articulation of the methodology underlying the scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Maher v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 181. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In this case, by Strauss\u2019 own admission, and despite his familiarity with the scientific calculations that would have allowed him to have tested his theory that the force of the prevailing wind was not sufficient to upset a ladder that was properly set up and was free from defects, he used no methodology to arrive at his conclusions. In light of our previous conclusion that Strauss\u2019 opinion on the effect of the wind was \u201cscientific evidence\u201d for the purposes of a <em>Porter </em>analysis, the trial court was obliged to hold a hearing and the plaintiff was obliged to explain the methodology underlying Strauss\u2019 opinion. This information was necessary to assess the scientific reliability and validity of Strauss\u2019 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The plaintiff argues that pursuant to our holdings in <em>State v. Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 546-49, 757 A.2d 482 (2000), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>205 Conn. 485, 490-91, 534 A.2d 877 (1987), a validity assessment by the trial court was not required in this case because not all testimony grounded in scientific principles requires a <em>Porter </em>hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In <em>Maher v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 170-71 n.22, we noted a line of cases dealing with scientific evidence that falls within a narrow category of exceptional situations wherein \u201calthough ostensibly rooted in scientific principles and presented by expert witnesses with scientific training, [the evidence is] not scientific for the purposes of our admissibility standard for scientific evidence, either before or after <em>Porter.\u201d </em>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) In particular, we referenced <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 547-49, in which we concluded that the testimony of a criminologist regarding visible characteristics of, and similarities between, strands of hair was not scientific evidence for <em>Porter </em>purposes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>supra, 205 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>490, in which we held that a podiatrist\u2019s testimony as to the likelihood that a certain pair of sneakers would fit on the defendant\u2019s feet was not scientific evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that Strauss\u2019 opinion does not fit within the category of expert opinion identified in these cases, nor does it fit within the rationale employed in those cases to conclude that a validity assessment pursuant to <em>Porter </em>was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">This narrow and distinct line of cases \u201cindicates that evidence, neither scientifically obscure nor instilled with an aura of mystic infallibility . . . which merely places a jury ... in a position to weigh the probative value of the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment to the expert\u2019s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge ... is not the type of scientific evidence within the contemplation of <em>Porter </em>. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 170 n.22. In particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>lar, we noted that <em>\u201cHasan </em>and <em>Reid </em>stand for the proposition that evidence, even evidence with its roots in scientific principles, which is within the comprehension of the average juror and which allows the jury to make its own conclusions based on its independent powers of observation and physical comparison, and without heavy reliance upon the testimony of an expert witness, need not be considered scientific in nature for the purposes of evidentiary admissibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 170-171 n.22. In short, in <em>Hasan </em>and <em>Reid, </em>the expert witness taught the jury how to look at physical evidence and then left the jury to look at that evidence and reach its own conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Strauss did not teach the jury how to calculate the force that a wind of 11.5 to 18 miles per hour would exert on a ladder or how much force is required to cause a ladder that is properly set up and in good condition to be set into motion and to slide against the aluminum edge of the defendant\u2019s roof. Similarly, Strauss did not provide the jury with the necessary factual data to undertake such a calculation because he never performed that analysis as part of his own investigation. Consequently, the jury in this case lacked any of the data, education or tools required to determine whether a particular wind speed could have overturned such a ladder. Contrary to the plaintiffs assertion, therefore, the jury largely was dependent on Strauss\u2019 assessment of the role that the wind played in the accident, and had no meaningful way to evaluate independently the amount of force that the prevailing wind would have exerted on a ladder leaning against the defendant\u2019s building. As a result, this case must be distinguished from <em>Reid </em>and <em>Hasan </em>because the jury in this case could not evaluate Strauss\u2019 hypothesis or compare the likely effect of the force of the prevailing wind on the ladder that collided with the plaintiff, as opposed to a ladder that was properly set up and free from defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The problem with the jury\u2019s dependence on Strauss\u2019 testimony is that his opinion, by his own admission, was based only on his experience, and was formed without the benefit of an established scientific methodology. Strauss\u2019 opinion nevertheless was introduced at trial under the seal of science because it came from an individual qualified as an expert in the fields of mechanical and forensic engineering. The implication of a scientific foundation for his opinion was especially misleading because, although Strauss testified that as a forensic engineer he had previous experience in assessing whether wind would overturn an object on the earth\u2019s surface and had examined \u201cat least a couple of dozen of ladders or more over the years\u201d in connection with accidents, he also acknowledged that he did not have experience in determining what force a wind must exert on a ladder to cause it to fall over, and that none of his previous ladder cases dealt with a fact pattern similar to this case. Strauss\u2019 experience, therefore, was hardly extensive with respect to the specific question on which he was asked to opine.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Furthermore, the trial court highlighted the perceived expert nature of Strauss\u2019 testimony by excluding the lay opinion of an eyewitness to the incident who testified that he believed that a gust of wind had caused the second ladder to fall and to collide with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>sum, if Strauss\u2019 expertise as a scientist made his opinion admissible, as compared to the opinion of a layperson who witnessed the accident but had no scientific training, then it was incumbent on the trial court to conduct a <em>Porter </em>hearing to determine whether Strauss had used his expertise to develop his opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the absence of such a validity assessment by the trial court in its role as gatekeeper, the jury in this case was confronted with a scientific conclusion, from an individual qualified as a scientific expert and presumably rooted in scientific principles, when in fact the opinion had no basis in science and was derived from the expert\u2019s limited experience with the particular factual situation at issue. The trial court\u2019s failure to characterize Strauss\u2019 testimony as scientific evidence and to carry out its role as a gatekeeper by conducting a <em>Porter </em>hearing, constituted an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The plaintiff also argues that a <em>Porter </em>hearing was not required because the underlying physical laws governing mass, force and motion were so fundamental and dealt with such low level forces on common objects that it was unnecessary for Strauss, given his experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ence and qualifications as an engineer, to conduct any experimentation or testing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">First, we reiterate that the question of whether the prevailing winds in Meriden on the day of the plaintiffs accident were capable of generating enough force to overturn an immobile ladder leaning against the defendant\u2019s building is more complicated than simply understanding that a force applied to an object may cause the object to fall over. Specifically, as Strauss acknowledged at trial, he never calculated the <em>amount </em>of force that was generated by the wind on the day of the accident or how this force was hindered by the coefficient of friction attributable to the building\u2019s roof when he investigated the accident. Moreover, both figures would have required scientific data gathering and experimentation that would have been inaccessible to the average juror and could not have been performed by the average juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Additionally, the general acceptance in the scientific community of Newtonian physics does not eliminate the need for a validity assessment in this case pursuant to <em>Porter. </em>In short, a party may not circumvent a validity assessment simply by asserting that generally recognized physical laws serve as the underpinnings for the scientific methodology on which they seek to rely. Most scientific methodologies are capable of being reduced to a well recognized set of scientific principles. Under <em>Porter, </em>however, it is the methodology itself that is subject to a validity assessment. See <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 179. Accordingly, if the stated methodology,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> apart from its foundational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>physical laws, is not accessible to the jury, as was the case here, the trial court is required to conduct a validity assessment pursuant to <em>Porter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s admission of Strauss\u2019 opinion without a preliminary <em>Porter </em>hearing and, therefore, any error was harmless. In particular, the plaintiff argues that the fact that there was other evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and that the defendant had the opportunity to take Strauss\u2019 deposition, to cross-examine him at trial, and to present rebuttal evidence, all negated any prejudice that may have occurred by admitting Strauss\u2019 expert opinion without an assessment of its reliability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We acknowledge that \u201c[e]ven when a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is deemed to be improper, [as is the case here] we [still] must determine whether that ruling was so harmful as to require a new trial. ... In other words, an evidentiary ruling will result in a new trial only if the ruling was both wrong <em>and </em>harmful. . . . [T]he standard in a civil case for determining whether an improper ruling was harmful is whether the . . . ruling [likely] would [have] affect[ed] the result.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ryan Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>M &amp; G Associates, </em>266 Conn. 520, 530, 832 A.2d 1180 (2003); see also <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>215 Conn. 148, 153, 575 A.2d 206 (1990) (rejecting standard that would have required treating as harmless error any evidentiary ruling, regardless of its effect upon verdict, so long as evidence not implicated by ruling was sufficient as matter of law to sustain verdict). Additionally, we have held that \u201cany error in the admission of evidence does not require reversal of the resulting judgment if the improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other validly admitted testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 211, 680 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>A.2d 1243 (1996). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s improper decision to admit Strauss\u2019 testimony without first conducting a <em>Porter </em>hearing likely affected the result of the trial and, therefore, warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">First, in the context of a harmless error analysis, it is not enough that there was other evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict. As noted previously, we specifically rejected such a standard in <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 153, in which we concluded that the \u201csufficient other evidence standard ... is too restrictive in that it does not encompass situations where the erroneously admitted evidence, while not necessary itself to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict, may nonetheless have affected the jury\u2019s perception of the remaining evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Similarly, the fact that the defendant had the opportunity to take Strauss\u2019 deposition, to cross-examine him at trial, and to present rebuttal evidence, while indicative of the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdict, does not demonstrate conclusively that the defendant was not harmed by the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. As noted previously, the relevant question is whether the \u201cruling . . . [likely] would [have] affect[ed] the [trial\u2019s] result\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ryan Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>M &amp; G Associates, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 530; and, as we stated in <em>Swenson, </em>this assessment can include merely whether the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201caffected the jury\u2019s perception of the remaining evidence.\u201d <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>supra, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Second, Strauss\u2019 opinion was the only evidence to support the plaintiffs principal theory of liability, namely, that the defendant\u2019s negligence in setting up the ladder, rather than the wind, was the proximate cause of the ladder\u2019s falling over. In this regard, Strauss\u2019 opinion regarding whether an 11.5 to 18 mile per hour wind could generate sufficient force to dislodge a ladder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that was properly set up and free from defects, from its resting place against the roof of the defendant\u2019s building, was critical to the plaintiffs case. Simply put, the plaintiff could not make his case that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the ladder in this case to fall unless he could establish that it was impossible for the prevailing wind on the day of the accident to knock over a ladder that had been set up properly and was in good condition. Once the wind was eliminated as a potential cause of the collision, the plaintiff was able to argue to the jury, under a theory of res ipsa loquitur, that the second ladder must have fallen: (1) because the defendant negligently had set up the device; (2) because the defendant had erected a damaged and unstable ladder next to where the plaintiff was working; or (3) due to some combination of these two actions. Accordingly, Strauss\u2019 opinion as to the effect of the wind on a ladder that was properly set up and in good condition likely played a role in how the jury viewed the other evidence presented by the plaintiff regarding the defendant\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Moreover, during closing argument, counsel for the plaintiff noted that the \u201cissue of the wind [was] critical,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and read to the jury the opinion Strauss had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>offered during direct examination regarding the effect of the wind on a properly set up ladder.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, the plaintiff devoted a significant portion of his closing argument to Strauss\u2019 opinion about the prevailing winds on the day of the accident. His emphasis on Strauss\u2019 opinion about the wind further suggests that Strauss\u2019 opinion affected the jury\u2019s evaluation of the remaining evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> The named defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. We then transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\"> The plaintiff\u2019s employer, B.G. Graphics, Inc., was permitted to intervene as a plaintiff in this matter but did not file a brief and waived its right to oral argument. For convenience, we refer to Prentice as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">In addition, the plaintiff also brought this action against 125 Research, LLC, which owns the building where Dalco operates its business and where the negligence at issue allegedly occurred. After the jury returned a verdict in favor of 125 Research, LLC, the trial court rendered judgment accordingly and the plaintiff has not appealed from that judgment. As a result, 125 Research, LLC, is not a party to this appeal and we refer to Dalco as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\"> The defendant also claims that the evidence was inadmissible on other grounds, and that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the theory of res ipsa loquitur. In light of our order for a new trial on the issue of a <em>Porter </em>hearing, we decline to review these claims because we conclude that it is unlikely that they will arise on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"><em> </em>The trial court declined to rule on several other motions filed by the defendant to exclude Strauss\u2019 expert testimony, including a motion to strike, which was filed immediately following the conclusion of Strauss\u2019 testimony at trial, and a motion for a directed verdict, which was filed at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case. Additionally, throughout the four days of Strauss\u2019 testimony, the defendant repeatedly reiterated its objection to Strauss\u2019 expert opinion and asked the trial court to conduct a <em>Porter </em>hearing. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court declined to make a ruling on the issue and allowed Strauss\u2019 testimony to proceed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> The trial court also concluded that Strauss\u2019 testimony was not so speculative as to be irrelevant, and that it had properly instructed the jury regarding the plaintiffs theory of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> Gagliardi also informed Luft that the plaintiff was able to climb an extension ladder, but that Gagliardi was afraid of heights and was unable to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> The second ladder subsequently was fully extended to the roof of the building. The record is unclear as to who fully extended the second ladder and completed its set up. The plaintiff and Gagliardi testified, however, that they never touched the second ladder and had observed only Luft, and his employees handle it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> Strauss\u2019 recognition that he could not offer an opinion about the wind\u2019s effect on the ladder within a \u201creasonable degree of engineering probability\u201d was a disclaimer about his expert opinion that was also echoed in his deposition testimony prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\"> Over the course of four days of testimony, Strauss was asked several times for his opinion as to whether the wind could have caused a ladder that had been set up properly and was in good condition to fall over. On direct examination, he offered the opinion that an 11.5 to 18 mile per horn wind would not cause such a ladder to fall. On cross-examination, however, Strauss testified, as he had at his deposition, that he could not offer such an opinion \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of engineering probability.\u201d As part of redirect examination by the plaintiff, Strauss changed his answer and testified that an 11.5 to 18 mile per hour wind would not have caused such a ladder to fall \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of engineering probability.\u201d On recross-examination, however, Strauss contradicted this statement once again and stated that he could not rule out an 11.5 mile per hour wind as the sole cause of the plaintiffs accident \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of engineering probability.\u201d The equivocal nature of Strauss\u2019 testimony during cross-examination does not render his opinion unscientific. Strauss\u2019 contradictory testimony, however, does highlight the importance of a trial court conducting a reliability and validity assessment of Strauss\u2019 methodology pursuant to our analysis in <em>Porter.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> In particular, in addition to testifying that the prevailing winds in Meriden ranged from 11.5 and 18 miles per hour on the day of the accident, Robert Cox, a meteorologist, testified that the winds likely would move leaves and small branches on trees, but not stable objects on the earth\u2019s surface. The plaintiff does not claim, however, that the testimony of Cox, who is a meteorologist but is not an engineer, would have been sufficient for the jury to find liability. It is clear from the record that it was Strauss\u2019 testimony that formed the necessary basis for the plaintiffs claim of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b374-5\"> Specifically, during cross-examination at trial, the foEowing coEoquy took place between Strauss and the defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cQ.

In particular, as we stated in <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 181, the \u201ccritical postulate\u201d underlying the entire <em>Porter </em>analysis is that \u201cthe proponent of the evidence must provide a sufficient articulation of the methodology underlying the scientific evidence. Without such an articulation, the trial court is entirely ill-equipped to determine if the scientific evidence is reliable [and] also cannot properly undertake its analysis under the \u2018fit\u2019 requirement . . . ensuring that the proffered scientific evidence, in fact, is based upon the reliable methodology articulated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Specifically, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 545-49, we held that a validity assessment was unnecessary when the state sought to present the expert testimony of a criminologist who had performed a microscopic analysis and comparison of hair samples. The witness presented enlarged photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>graphs of the hair samples and explained to the jury how he had compared them. The jurors were then free to make their own comparison and decide for themselves whether the hairs matched, leading us to conclude that a <em>Porter </em>hearing was not required because the criminologist\u2019s testimony \u201csimply required the jurors to use their own powers of observation and comparison.\u201d Id., 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> Specifically, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 493-95, we upheld the admission of a podiatrist\u2019s testimony as to the likelihood that a pair of sneakers would fit the defendant\u2019s feet.
