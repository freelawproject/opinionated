On appeal, the defendant challenges his conviction under \u00a7 53a-223 on the ground that the state failed to proffer sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that he had violated the protective order. In addition, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly enhanced, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40b,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his sentence for violating \u00a7 14-223 (b). Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly revoked his probation and imposed the remaining unexecuted portion of his sentence resulting from a prior conviction. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On June 24, 2003, the defendant was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct on the basis of a complaint by Karen Johnson, the mother of his child, from whom he is estranged. He was released on a $15,000 bond, and aprotective order was issued barring the defendant from coming within 100 yards of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>At approximately 11 p.m. on July 27, 2003, the department of children and families received a call from an individual purporting to be the defendant and claiming that he had shot Johnson. Police officers from the Hartford police department subsequently were dispatched to Johnson\u2019s home at 59 Lenox Street in Hartford. Officer Giuseppe Uccello and several other officers arrived at Johnson\u2019s home at approximately 1:30 a.m. and found her unharmed. While in Johnson\u2019s home, Uccello observed the defendant\u2019s car, which had been described to the police by Johnson, passing directly in front of the home. Uccello then entered his police car and followed the defendant\u2019s car until it stopped at his home at 154 Edgewood Street in Hartford, which was one block away from Johnson\u2019s home. Uccello activated his overhead lights and pulled up behind the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant immediately sped off and led Uccello and other responding officers on a high speed chase that ended with the defendant\u2019s apprehension on Edgewood Street, near his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct in the early morning hours of July 28, 2003, he was charged, in part A of a two part information, with one count of second degree harassment in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (3), one count of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of \u00a7 53a-223, one count of reckless driving in violation of \u00a7 14-222, one count of attempt to escape or elude a police officer in violation of \u00a7 14-223 (b), one count of attempt to assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-59 (a) (1), and one count of attempt to assault a public safety officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-167c (a) (1). In part B of the information, the defendant was charged with being subject to a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b for committing an offense while released on bond. A jury trial was held on part A of the information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>after which the defendant was found guilty of criminal violation of a protective order, reckless driving, and attempt to escape or elude a police officer. The jury acquitted the defendant on the remaining three counts. After the jury had rendered its verdict on part A of the information, the defendant entered a plea of guilty on part B of the information. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and sentenced the defendant to prison terms of five years, execution suspended after one year, for violation of the protective order, thirty days for reckless driving, and one year for attempt to escape or elude a police officer, said sentences to be served consecutively. The court also sentenced the defendant to a one year sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40b. In addition, because the trial court found that the defendant had violated a condition of his probation stemming from a 1999 conviction, the trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and imposed the full six year unexecuted portion of the defendant\u2019s 1999 sentence to be served consecutive to the sentence imposed under the present conviction. This appeal followed. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The defendant first claims that the state failed to proffer sufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty of violating the June, 2003 protective order. The defendant does not challenge that he was subject to a valid protective order issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38c (e)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that he, in fact, violated the protective order\u2019s provision ordering him to \u201c [r] efrain from coming within 100 yards of [Johnson].\u201d Rather, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>claims that the jury reasonably could not have found that he had the requisite intent to violate the protective order\u2019s condition that he refrain from coming within 100 yards of Johnson because there was no evidence that the defendant knew that Johnson was home when he drove down her street.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, the state contends that, although there was no direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to come within 100 yards of Johnson, it proffered ample circumstantial evidence from which the jury reasonably could have inferred such an intent. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">This court has held that proof of the criminal violation of a protective order pursuant to \u00a7 53a-223 \u201cmerely requires the issuance of a protective order against the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 46b-38c (e) . . . and the defendant\u2019s violation of that order.\u201d State v. <em>Wright, </em>273 Conn. 418, 432, 870 A.2d 1039 (2005). This court has not considered previously whether a violation of \u00a7 53a-223 (a) requires that the act constituting the violation of the protective order be accompanied by a specific mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Appellate Court, however, has considered this question on numerous occasions, and it has concluded that, \u201ca violation of a protective order does not incorporate the specific intent to harass. ... All that is necessary is a general intent that one intend to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>activities that constitute the violation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafsal, </em>94 Conn. App. 741, 745, 894 A.2d 372 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Binnette, </em>86 Conn. App. 491, 497, 861 A.2d 1197 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 902, 868 A.2d 745 (2005); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>78 Conn. App. 141, 162, 826 A.2d 1183, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 903, 832 A.2d65 (2003); <em>State v. Charles, </em>78 Conn. App. 125, 130-31, 826 A.2d 1172, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 908, 832 A.2d 73 (2003). The Appellate Court further has explained that, \u201c[h]aving declined to adoptthe argument that criminal responsibility for the violation of a protective order requires specific intent, we have not, nevertheless, held that the statute is one of strict liability. Rather, we believe that it is a general intent statute, requiring proof that one charged with its violation intended to perform the activities that constituted a violation of the protection order.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u201cGeneral intent is the term used to define the requisite mens rea for a crime that has no stated mens rea; the term refers to whether a defendant intended deliberate, conscious or puiposeful action, as opposed to causing a prohibited result through accident, mistake, carelessness, or absent-mindedness. Where a particular crime requires only a showing of general intent, the prosecution need not establish that the accused intended the precise harm or precise result which resulted from his acts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 78 Conn. App. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We agree with the Appellate Court that the intent required to prove a violation of \u00a7 53a-223 (a) is only that the defendant intended to perform the activities that constituted the violation of the protective order. In the present case, the activity that constituted the violation of the protective order was coming within 100 yards of Johnson. Thus, the state needed to prove that the defendant came within 100 yards of Johnson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that this act resulted from intentional conduct rather than accident or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The following additional facts are necessary to determining whether the state met this burden. At trial, Johnson offered the following testimony. She previously had a relationship with the defendant for approximately seven years and during the course of their relationship, they had a child together. At some subsequent point in time, their relationship became hostile. On July 27, 2003, Johnson worked at Hartford Hospital, her place of employment, until 11:30 p.m. and she returned to her home after work. She had lived at the Lenox Street address for thirty years. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on July 28, 2003, police officers had come to her home to check on the well-being of her and her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The state also presented evidence that, at approximately 11 p.m. on July 27, 2003, a male identifying himself as the defendant had called the hotline for the department of children and families (department) and stated that he just had shot and killed the mother of his child when she got home from work.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Johnson identified the male voice on the recording of the telephone call as that of the defendant. Roxana Cileza, the employee for the department who had received the hotline call, testified that, based on information available to the department, she had determined that the individual to whom the caller was referring was Johnson. Cileza testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>fied that, due to the concern raised by this telephone call, she had contacted the Hartford police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Officer Uccello offered the following testimony as to the defendant\u2019s conduct. He and other officers were dispatched to Johnson\u2019s home to check on her well-being. While Uccello was interviewing Johnson in her home, he observed the defendant\u2019s car pass in front of her home at a distance of no more than thirty-three feet from Johnson. After seeing the defendant drive past Johnson\u2019s home, Uccello entered his marked police patrol car, followed the defendant for approximately thirty seconds until the defendant had reached his home, which was one block from Johnson\u2019s home. Uccello pulled his car behind the defendant\u2019s car with the lights on his patrol car activated, at which point the defendant immediately sped away. Uccello and other responding police officers<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> testified that the defendant had led them on a high speed chase through Hartford and Bloomfield for more than ten minutes before he eventually was apprehended near his home. These officers testified that, during the pursuit, the defendant\u2019s vehicle had reached speeds in excess of seventy miles per hour, at one point reaching 100 miles per hour, that the defendant had continued to try to elude police even after his tire had blown out, and that he had driven in the dark without his headlights on. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defendant declined to present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We next turn to whether this evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that the defendant had the requisite intent to perform the activity that constituted the violation of the protective order \u2014 coming within 100 yards of Johnson. \u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u201c [A]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. . . . Furthermore, [i]n [our] process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorabella, </em>277 Conn. 155, 177-78, 891 A.2d 897 (2006). \u201cIndeed, direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 239-40, 745 A.2d 800 (2000). \u201c[A]ny such inference cannot be based on possibilities, surmise or conjecture. ... It is axiomatic, therefore, that [a]ny [inference] drawn must be rational and founded upon the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 93, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Turning to the present case, we conclude that, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, the state presented sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct and other circumstantial evidence from which the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant had the intent to come within 100 yards of Johnson, irrespective of his purpose for doing so. Common sense and experience dictate, and the record in the present case does not contradict the fact, that most people, including the mother of a young child, such as Johnson, are likely to be in their homes in the middle of the night and that the defendant equally would have been aware of this fact. Thus, the defendant\u2019s decision to drive past Johnson\u2019s home at 1:30 a.m., given the likelihood that Johnson would be home at such a late hour, justifies the inference that the defendant intended to come within 100 yards of her as he drove past her home.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Although this fact alone provides a reasonable basis to infer that the defendant had the requisite intent to come within 100 yards of Johnson, the record reveals additional evidence that further strengthens this inference. In particular, the state presented the undisputed evidence that the defendant\u2019s immediate reaction to Uccello\u2019s marked patrol car pulling up behind him with its overhead lights activated was to speed away and engage in a high speed chase that lasted for more than ten minutes. The defendant\u2019s flight from the police is circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer reasonably that the defendant was conscious that he was guilty of violating the condition of the protective order. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 521-22, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003) (unexplained flight is circumstantial evidence that tends to prove consciousness of guilt); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>176 Conn. 508, 517, 408 A.2d 265 (1979) (\u201cflight of the person accused of crime is a circumstance which, when considered together with all the facts of the case, may justify an inference of the accused\u2019s guilt\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In addition, there was testimony from numerous witnesses that, despite the fact that it was 1:30 a.m., the headlights on the defendant\u2019s car were off when he drove by Johnson\u2019s house and during the ensuing high speed chase. It is reasonable to infer from this fact that the defendant kept his headlights off as he passed Johnson\u2019s home in an effort to avoid detection. This behavior also supports a reasonable inference of a guilty conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The final evidence adduced by the state that supports the inference that the defendant intended to come within 100 yards of Johnson was that the defendant was identified as the person who had called the department\u2019s hotline and had stated that he just shot the mother of his child. In conjunction with the fact that the defendant shortly thereafter drove by Johnson\u2019s house, a jury reasonably could have inferred that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>defendant\u2019s presence on Johnson\u2019s street just hours after making this telephone call was an intentional effort to see the effect wrought on Johnson by his call to the hotline. In sum, we conclude that the state proffered sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to infer that the defendant had intended to come within 100 yards of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The defendant claims, however, that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient because it merely establishes that the defendant\u2019s actions in coming within 100 yards of Johnson were the result of carelessness or absentmindedness. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s circumstantial evidence does not support the inference that the defendant was intending to come within 100 yards of Johnson, but instead supports the inference that he reflexively was taking the most direct route to his home. In support of this contention, the defendant points to three pieces of evidence. First, the defendant drove down Johnson\u2019s street even though several police cars were present. Second, he calmly pulled up to his home before Uccello\u2019s patrol car pulled up behind him. Third, Johnson lived one block over from the defendant and both of the streets on which they lived are one way streets running in opposite directions. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Although the evidence cited by the defendant could support an inference that he did not purposefully drive down Johnson\u2019s street in order to come within 100 yards of her, the defendant misapplies the standard by which we review sufficiency of the evidence claims. \u201cOn appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorabella, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 177. For the reasons we have discussed previously, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>that there is a reasonable view of the evidence from which the jury inferred that the defendant had intended to come within 100 yards of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a one year sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b; see footnote 4 of this opinion; was improper on two grounds. First, the defendant claims that the sentence enhancement was improper because he was not given written notice, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-64e (b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that, if he were to be convicted of an offense committed while released on bond, he could be subject to a sentence enhancement. Second, the defendant claims that the sentence enhancement was improper because his guilty plea to having violated \u00a7 53a-40b by committing a crime while released on bond resulted from a constitutionally inadequate plea canvass and, therefore, was not a knowing and voluntary plea. We conclude that the trial court properly imposed the enhanced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The following additional undisputed facts are relevant to the resolution of these claims. Prior to his release on probation in May, 2003, the defendant had signed a form stating the conditions of his release. That form did not contain an advisement that the defendant could be subject to a sentence enhancement if convicted of a crime committed while on release. Thereafter, the defendant was charged, in the present case, in a two part information. In part B of the information, the state charged the defendant with committing a crime while released on bond in violation of \u00a7 53a-40b. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The state also filed, approximately one week prior to trial, an enhancement warning, which had advised the defendant that the state was going to seek an additional term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40b if he was convicted of a felony or misdemeanor at trial. In the enhancement warning, the state alleged that such an enhancement would be factually warranted because the defendant was released on bond from his June, 2003 disorderly conduct arrest when he allegedly committed the crimes for which he was charged in part A of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">After the jury returned guilty verdicts on three of the six counts set forth in part A of the information, the court excused the jury and instructed the clerk to put the defendant to plea on part B of the information, which charged that the defendant was subject to a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b. The defendant entered a plea of guilty, which the trial court accepted without conducting a canvass. The court subsequently enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence for attempt to escape or elude a police officer by an additional year pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40b.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We first turn to the defendant\u2019s nonconstitutional claim that the trial court improperly enhanced his sentence under \u00a7 53a-40b because, upon his release from custody after his June, 2003 arrest for disorderly conduct, the defendant had not received the written notification required under \u00a7 54-64e that he might be subject to a sentence enhancement if convicted of a crime committed while on release. The defendant contends that these provisions are ambiguous as to whether the notice requirement under \u00a7 54-64e is a legal predicate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>application of \u00a7 53a-40b to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence. The defendant urges us to resolve this ambiguity against the state and cites to federal case law in support of such a construction. Specifically, he notes that there is a split of authority among the federal Circuit Courts of Appeals that have considered this question as applied to the federal scheme, but asserts that the courts that have held that the notice requirement is not a legal predicate to application of the sentence enhancement provision have reached that conclusion solely on the ground that the federal enhancement provision is a <em>mandatory, </em>self-executing provision of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because, under our state scheme, \u00a7 53a-40b gives the trial court discretion to impose a sentence enhancement and is, therefore, not a mandatory, self-executing provision of law, the defendant claims that the federal case law supports his construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The defendant concedes, however, that he did not raise this claim before the trial court and therefore seeks plain error review. \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine, which is now codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>judgment, for reasons of policy. ... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice. . . . Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion, explained previously, that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 507-508 n.14, 857 A.2d 908 (2004). \u201c[Thus, a] defendant cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] . . . unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 235 n.85, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s alleged impropriety in imposing an additional one year sentence under \u00a7 53a-40b in the absence of written notice in compliance with \u00a7 54-64e does not constitute one of the \u201ctruly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 507-508 n.14. At the outset, we note that the defendant never brought to the trial court\u2019s attention the fact that he had not received written notice of the possibility of a sentence enhancement when he was released on bond from the June, 2003 disorderly conduct charges. Rather, the defendant simply pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>guilty to committing an offense while on release in violation of \u00a7 53a-40b.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Even if we were to assume, however, that the lack of written notice was known by the trial court, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s imposition of the sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b was such a clear and obvious impropriety that requires reversal of the judgment under the plain error doctrine. The defendant essentially concedes that, by their express terms, \u00a7 53a-40b does not condition its application on compliance with \u00a7 54-64e, nor does \u00a7 54-64e provide that the failure to comply with that section deprives the trial court of discretion to impose a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b. In addition, the question of whether compliance with the notice provision of \u00a7 54-64e is a legal predicate to the application of \u00a7 53a-40b is an issue of first impression. Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court committed a clear and obvious error by exercising its discretion under the express provisions of a presumptively valid statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>269 Conn. 442, 453, 849 A.2d 375 (2004) (not plain error for trial court to find that defendant had committed felony for sexual purposes and require defendant to register with sex offender registry pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-254 when trial court complied with \u00a7 54-254 as written); <em>Scanlon </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>258 Conn. 436, 442 n.9, 782 A.2d 87 (2001) (not plain error for trial court to submit to jury claim of emotional distress arising from harm negligently caused to livestock, pets or property in part because this court previously had not considered whether jury may award damages for such claims). Indeed, the split of federal authority cited by the defendant, although not directly relevant, merely underscores this conclusion. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not commit plain error by enhanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ing the defendant\u2019s sentence despite his lack of written notice as required under \u00a7 54-64e.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s imposition of an additional one year sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b was improper because the court failed to canvass the defendant adequately, in violation of his due process rights, to ensure that his guilty plea on part B of the information was made knowingly and voluntarily. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court failed to inform him that he had the right to have a jury determine whether the crimes for which he had been convicted in part A of the information were committed while he was on release. At the outset, the defendant concedes that this claim was not preserved in the trial court, but he seeks to prevail under the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ing conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Heredia, </em>253 Conn. 543, 559-60, 754 A.2d 114 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The record in the present case is adequate for our review because it contains the full transcript of the trial court hearing at which the defendant pleaded guilty to part B of the information. Further, this court previously has recognized that a claim of an inadequate plea canvass implicates the defendant\u2019s due process rights and, therefore, is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>277 Conn. 764, 781, 894 A.2d 963 (2006). Accordingly, we conclude that the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim are reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Turning to the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis, we first set forth the applicable principles that guide our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cIt is axiomatic that unless a plea of guilty is made knowingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable. ... A plea of guilty is, in effect, a conviction, the equivalent of a guilty verdict by a jury. . . . [As noted in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969), the defendant, in] choosing to plead guilty ... is waiving several constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers. . . . The <em>Boykin </em>constitutional essentials for the acceptance of a plea of guilty are included in our rules and are reflected in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 [39-19<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 39-20],<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> . . . Those rules provide that the trial court must not accept a guilty plea without first addressing the defendant personally in open court and determining that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in \u00a7 39-19, and that the plea is made voluntarily pursuant to \u00a7 39-20.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fara</em>day, 268 Conn. 174, 200-201, 842 A.2d 567 (2004). \u201cThese considerations demand the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and its consequences. . . . We, therefore, require the trial court affirmatively to clarify on the record that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>made intelligently and voluntarily.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 310, 699 A.2d 921 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We never have considered previously whether the same due process protections that apply to a defendant\u2019s guilty plea to substantive offenses apply equally to a guilty plea to part B of an information charging the defendant with a sentence enhancement based on the fact that the defendant was released on bond from an arrest at the time he committed the subsequent offense. As we have discussed previously herein, a plea canvass is required when a defendant pleads guilty because, by doing so, he or she is waiving several constitutional rights, including the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront his or her accusers. Therefore, a plea canvass was required in the present case if, in fact, any of the aforementioned constitutional rights attached to the proceeding at which the defendant\u2019s exposure to a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b was under consideration. Specifically, in the present case, the defendant contends that he was entitled to a jury finding on the question of whether he was released on bond from an arrest at the time he committed the present offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">We begin with certain well established fundamental principles. A two part information is required under our rules of practice whenever the state seeks an enhanced penalty. Practice Book \u00a7 36-14. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the defendant is given adequate notice of the charge against him so that he properly may prepare his defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 339, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>LaSelva, </em>163 Conn. 229, 233-34, 303 A.2d 721 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>54 Conn. App. 258, 262, 737 A.2d 922 (1999), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 257 Conn. 106, 777 A.2d 580 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 173-75, 113 A. 452 (1921) (determining method for setting forth these allegations: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>first part of information to allege commission of current violation; and second part to allege prior conviction, thereby allowing trier of fact to determine factual questions of first part, without knowledge of allegations in second part, and hence ensuring fair determination as to whether defendant committed current offense). Thus, although a prosecution involving a two part information requires two separate proceedings, it nevertheless remains a single prosecution under one information. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>139 Conn. 234, 241, 93 A.2d 154 (1952) (characterizing process required under <em>Ferrone </em>as \u201ca trial of a case in two successive stages\u201d). The second part of the information must be proven, however, before the enhanced penalty can be imposed. <em>State </em>v. <em>LaSelva, </em>supra, 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301-304, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant who is subject to an enhanced penalty has a right to a jury finding on facts, other than the issue of whether he has a previous conviction. It seems clear that the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases does not disturb this court\u2019s jurisprudence as to the notice and proof requirements of the two part information.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The question remains, however, whether <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny would require that the defendant in this case be given a jury trial, or a plea canvass pursuant to <em>Boykin </em>before waiving that right, on the issue of whether he was on release from an arrest at the time he committed the crimes charged in part A of the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>mation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under the reasoning expressed by <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny, we conclude that, once convicted of having committed the crimes in part A of the information, the defendant\u2019s status at the time he committed those crimes involved a legal determination, not a factual one, and that, accordingly, he was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We, therefore, turn to <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 460. In that case, the Supreme Court considered whether the trial judge properly had enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of its determination by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct had been motivated by racial bias, rather than based on a jury determination of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 469-71. In concluding that this procedure was constitutionally deficient, the Supreme Court stated in sweeping language that the federal constitution requires that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 490. As Apprendi\u2019s progeny more specifically explained, judges are precluded from finding \u201cadditional facts\u201d that increase a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the \u201cstatutory maximum,\u201d which it defined as the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>\u201csolely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 542 U.S. 303; see id., 303-305 (concluding that judge unconstitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ally imposed sentence beyond statutory maximum after finding that defendant had acted with deliberate cruelty in committing crime); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 232, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005) (concluding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 [b] [1], which makes Federal Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, is incompatible with <em>Blakely </em>and must be invalidated).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Although we are bound by the language in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>stating that only the fact of a prior conviction is exempt from being proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, numerous federal courts that have applied <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny have understood that these cases clearly do not limit a judge\u2019s authority to make legal determinations that precede a jury\u2019s fact-finding and imposition of sentence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>422 F.3d 715, 723 (8th Cir. 2005) (noting that court consistently has rejected applicability of <em>Booker </em>to legal determination of whether prior conviction may be categorized as \u201ccrime of violence\u201d), cert, denied sub <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>nom. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 U.S. 1127, 126 S.

Ed. 2d 921 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>417 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir. 2005) (categorization of prior conviction as \u201cviolent felony\u201d or \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is legal question, not factual question, coming within purview of <em>Apprendi, Blakely </em>and Booker); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mincks, </em>409 F.3d 898, 901 (8th Cir. 2005) (whether prior conviction is violent felony under Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 [e], \u201cis distinctly a question of law for the court, not a jury\u201d under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker), </em>cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1176, 126 S.

See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>Court of Appeals, Docket No. 03CA0696,2006 Colo. App. LEXIS 220, *6-7 (Colo. App. February 23, 2006) (concluding that fact that defendant was on parole or probation is \u201cinextricably linked to his prior conviction\u201d and does not \u201cimplicate the type of prohibited fact-finding detailed in <em>Apprendi\u201d); State </em>v. <em>Calloway, </em>914 So. 2d 12, 14 (Fla.

App. 34, 43, 771 A.2d 149, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 905, 772 A.2d 599 (2001), the only Connecticut case to touch upon this issue, the Appellate Court determined that the defendant was not deprived unconstitutionally of a jury trial when the trial court enhanced his sentence under \u00a7 53a-40b after the defendant\u2019s counsel had conceded at the sentencing hearing that the defendant was released on a written promise to appear following a conviction for a prior crime when he committed the subsequent offense. The court concluded that no jury trial was required because there was no issue of fact, noting that, in most instances, \u201ca defendant\u2019s status under [\u00a7 53a-40b] arises out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>some antecedent encounter with the criminal justice system. The record of that antecedent encounter is a judicial record of which a court may take judicial notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>228 Conn. 487, 497, 636 A.2d 840 (1994).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanko, </em>supra, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Similarly, in <em>Ryle </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 842 N.E.2d 324-25, the Indiana Supreme Court, in reliance on <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005), wherein the Supreme Court reaffirmed, in accordance with <em>Apprendi, </em>the trial court\u2019s proper use of certain documents to determine the character of a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes, concluded that the trial court properly had found that the defendant was on parole based on prior judicial records as reflected in the presentence investigation report prepared by the probation officer because these types of judicial records bear the same hallmark of conclusive significance as those enumerated in <em>Shepard. </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pineda-Rodriquez, </em>133 Fed. Appx. 455, 458 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that fact of date of defendant\u2019s release from custody and fact that defendant was on supervision during commission of current offense fall under prior conviction exception because they are \u201c \u2018subsidiary findings\u2019 \u201d that are \u201cmerely aspects of the defendant\u2019s recidivist potential . . . easily verified, and . . .

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>201 Ariz. 41, 44, 31 P.3d 815 (App. 2001), the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that the enhancement of the defendant\u2019s sentence based on the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant had committed the subsequent offenses while on release awaiting trial on a separate felony count violated <em>Apprendi. </em>The court reasoned that, because the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>that the defendant was on release status resulted in a sentence beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum and fell outside the plain language of the \u201cprior conviction\u201d exception, <em>Apprendi </em>required that the defendant\u2019s release status be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wissink, </em>172 N.C. App. 829, 837, 617 S.E.2d 319 (2005) (concluding that, although probationary status is not far removed from prior conviction, rule set forth in <em>Apprendi </em>requires this fact to be found by jury and noting that fact of probationary status \u201cdid not have the procedural safeguards of a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt recognized in <em>Apprendi </em>as providing the necessary protection for defendants at sentencing\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>196 Or. App. 364, 371-73,102 P.3d 705 (2004) (concluding that fact defendant was on parole or probation was related to prior conviction, but procedural safeguards discussed in <em>Apprendi </em>did not apply to this fact, and, therefore, fact must be proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 340 Or. 310, 131 P.3d 168 (2006); <em>State v. Jones, </em>126 Wash. App. 136, 142-46, 107 P.3d 755 (2005) (concluding that whether defendant was in community placement at time offense was committed does not fall within prior conviction exception because procedural safeguards attaching to prior conviction are not satisfied and rejecting notion that prior conviction exception should be viewed to encompass facts <em>related </em>to past conviction because <em>Apprendi </em>plainly stated that exception was narrow). Some of these cases take a formalistic view of <em>Apprendi </em>and conclude that courts should not examine the nature of the fact in issue in deciding whether the defendant was entitled to a jury determination. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wissink, </em>supra, 837. In other cases, however, wherein the court apparently recognized a more nuanced and context driven approach, the application of the enhancement factor involved not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>merely the defendant\u2019s status, but, rather, turned on a complicated and intensively factual inquiry that clearly would fall within the jury\u2019s traditional province. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 142-46 (noting that community placement status involves many variables);<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> see also <em>Markwood </em>v. <em>Renard, </em>203 Or. App. 145, 150, 125 P.3d 39 (2005) (noting that, under Oregon law, \u201can upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u2018requires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In the present case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s status as to whether he lawfully had been on release at the time of the offense for which he was convicted, a fact that he not only reasonably could not dispute but conceded in his briefs to this court, was a question that also did not require a jury determination. Under our rules of practice, a defendant may be released upon the execution of a written promise to appear or he may be released on bond. See generally Practice Book c. 38. Whether the defendant was released pursuant to a bond or his promise to appear and when he was so released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>are questions that properly can be answered by mere reference to the court file. Indeed, once the defendant was convicted under part A of the information, demonstrating that he had committed the crimes charged on the date specified, the only issue left open \u2014 whether he was on release from an arrest at the time \u2014 properly could have been the subject of judicial notice. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>213 Conn. 289, 293, 567 A.2d 1187 (1989) (\u201c[w]e may . . . take judicial notice of the court files in another suit between the parties, especially when the relevance of that litigation was expressly made an issue at this trial\u201d), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 939, 110 S. Ct. 3220, 110 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1990). \u201cThe true conception of what is judicially known is that of something which is not, or rather need not be, the subject of either evidence or argument, unless the tribunal wishes it, \u2014 something which is already in the court\u2019s possession, or, at any rate, is so accessible that there is no occasion to use any means to make the court aware of it. 1 B.

App. 699, 704 n.5, 700 A.2d 1179 (1997). That the defendant concedes in his briefs to this court the fact of his release at the time of the crimes alleged in part A of the information is merely a further demonstration of the propriety of judicial notice of the defendant\u2019s release status.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, because no jury determination was necessary and consequently no canvass pursuant to <em>Boykin </em>was required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>we conclude that the trial court properly enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence upon his entering a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstating the full six years remaining on his sentence for a 1999 conviction. Specifically, the defendant contends that it was excessive and unfair for the trial court to impose the full six year sentence on the basis of the defendant\u2019s two misdemeanor convictions for reckless driving and attempting to escape or elude a police officer. In addition, the defendant contends that the trial court failed to consider, in its determination of whether the purposes of probation could no longer be served, the specific circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest on July 28, 2003. Specifically, the defendant asserts that his conduct on that night was not puiposeful, but, rather, the result of frustration and panic stemming from his stormy relationship with Johnson, who he claims had made false accusations that led to his June, 2003 arrest on the charge of disorderly conduct. The defendant contends that his response to the police on July 28 was motivated by a fear that Johnson had made another false accusation that the police would credit, which would put his probation in jeopardy. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The following facts are necessary to the resolution of this claim. In 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) and possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a). He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after four years, with five years probation. On January 2, 2003, the defendant, while on work release, was arrested for disorderly conduct stemming from an altercation with Johnson. He subsequently pleaded guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>this charge and was sentenced to sixty days to be served concurrently with the remainder of his 1999 sentence. On May 5, 2003, the defendant was released on probation. Later that month, the defendant submitted a urine sample to his probation officer that tested positive for marijuana. The defendant thereafter admitted to his probation officer that he had smoked marijuana the week prior to the urine test. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s drug use and his subsequent arrest for his conduct on July 27 and 28, 2003, the state filed a substitute information on May 11, 2004, charging the defendant with having violated the conditions of his probation of his 1999 sentence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">After the jury returned its verdict, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the violation of probation charge. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, the trial court found that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation by using marijuana, violating the protective order, engaging in reckless driving, and attempting to escape or elude a police officer. The trial court then, with the parties\u2019 consent, combined the sentencing hearings for the 2003 charges on which the jury had convicted the defendant and for the violation of probation charge. At the conclusion of this combined hearing, because it concluded that the beneficial purposes of probation were no longer being served, the trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstated the remaining six years on the defendant\u2019s 1999 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The defendant acknowledges that this claim was not preserved in the trial court, and, accordingly, he seeks to appeal under <em>Golding. </em>We conclude that the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 294, 641 A.2d 370 (1994) (\u201cdue process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires that certain minimum procedural safeguards be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>observed in the process of revoking the conditional liberty created by probation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We further conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim fails under Golding\u2019s third prong because he has failed to demonstrate a clear constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We begin by setting forth the standard that guides our review of revocation of probation proceedings. \u201cA revocation of probation hearing has two distinct components .... A factual determination by a trial court as to whether a probationer has violated a condition of probation must first be made. If a violation is found, a court must next determine whether probation should be revoked because the beneficial aspects of probation are no longer being served. . . . Since there are two distinct components of the revocation hearing, our standard of review differs depending on which part of the hearing we are reviewing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In the present case, the defendant concedes that the trial court correctly found that he had violated the conditions of his probation. He contends, however, that the trial court improperly revoked his probation and reinstated the six unexecuted years of his sentence for the 1999 conviction. We review a trial court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation by asking \u201cwhether the trial court exercised its discretion properly by reinstating the original sentence and ordering incarceration. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 185-86. \u201cA defendant who seeks to reverse the exercise of judicial discretion assumes a heavy burden.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Carey, 228 Conn. 487, 495, 636 A.2d 840 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Our determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation is guided by the following principles. \u201cWe previously have recognized that [t]o a greater or lesser degree, it is always true of probationers . . . that they do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only . . . conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions. . . . These restrictions are meant to assure that the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s being at large. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u201cA revocation proceeding is held to determine whether the goals of rehabilitation thought to be served by probation have faltered, requiring an end to the conditional freedom obtained by a defendant at a sentencing that allowed him or her to serve less than a full sentence. . . . [T]he ultimate question [in the probation process is] whether the probationer is still a good risk .... This determination involves the consideration of the goals of probation, including whether the probationer\u2019s behavior is mimical to his own rehabilitation, as well as to the safety of the public.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>256 Conn. 412, 426-27, 773 A.2d 931 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Turning to the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstating the six year unexecuted portion of his 1999 sentence. Specifically, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have found from the defendant\u2019s behavior before and after he was released on probation that he was no longer a \u201cgood risk.\u201d Id., 427. The record reveals that, while the defendant was on work release a few months prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>being released on probation, he was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct to which he pleaded guilty. In addition, just weeks after being released on probation, the defendant violated a condition of his probation by using marijuana. A violation of a probation condition requiring that a defendant remain free from drug use alone has been deemed a sufficient ground to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Conn. App. 251, 252, 259, 527 A.2d 250 (1987) (concluding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant\u2019s probation and imposing original sentence when condition of probation required defendant to remain free from drug use and he thereafter tested positive for cocaine use).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The defendant\u2019s subsequent probation violation, just two months after his release, constituted further grounds to revoke his probation. As determined by the trial court, the defendant violated his probation a second time when he was found guilty of violating a protective order, reckless driving, and attempting to escape or elude the police. The defendant\u2019s violation of a protective order was a felony, and we previously have stated that a felony conviction is a sufficient ground upon which to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pecoraro, </em>196 Conn. 305, 307, 493 A.2d 180 (1985) (criminal conviction is \u201cmore than sufficient basis for revocation of probation\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>165 Conn. 73, 77, 327 A.2d 556 (1973) (\u201ccommission of a felony would . . . constitute a violation sufficient to authorize revocation of probation\u201d). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s conduct that led to his convictions on the two misdemeanor charges \u2014 reckless driving and attempting to escape or elude a police officer \u2014 is more troubling because it evidences the defendant\u2019s willingness to put both police officers and the public at risk. Specifically, as recounted in part I of this opinion, the defendant led the police on a nighttime, high speed chase through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Hartford and Bloomfield, without his headlights on, and at speeds that reached 100 miles per hour. The defendant continued his attempt to evade the police even after one of the tires on his car had blown out. Thus, his behavior demonstrated a serious lack of concern for the safety of both the police officers involved in the chase and members of the public with whom the defendant may have come into contact. Accordingly, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant no longer was a good risk because his behavior was \u201cinimical to his own rehabilitation, as well as to the safety of the public.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 427. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstating the remainder of his 1999 sentence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C.

Typically, a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error only if he or she satisfies all four prongs of the test this court set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). See part II B of this opinion setting forth the four prongs of the <em>Golding </em>test. This court has stated previously, however, that \u201cany defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of <em>Golding.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 275 n.3, 623 A.2d 42 (1993). Accordingly, because there is no practical significance in analyzing an unpreserved claim of insufficiency of the evidence under the <em>Golding </em>rubric, we review such a claim as we would any properly preserved claim.

The court also rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the federal constitution requires that the fact of his prior convictions \u2014 or more generally recidivism \u2014 be treated as an element of the crime and therefore be stated in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

Too many variables are involved. For example, a defendant may receive credit for preconviction incarceration, the length of which may not be specified in the judgment and sentence. The defendant may receive additional credit for preconviction incarceration if the local detention facility awarded him good conduct time. And even if both of these determinations are in the relevant judgment and sentence, there is no possible way for the sentence to reflect whether the defendant will eventually become entitled to [ejarned release time . . . which may be as much as 50 percent of the sentence imposed. . . .

It is clear that, given the judicial record evidencing that the defendant was on release at the time of the offenses for which he was convicted, along with his admission to that fact, the failure to submit this factor to a jury necessarily would be harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b131-5\"> To the extent that the defendant claims that it was excessive for the trial court to impose the full remaining six years of his 1999 sentence, we note that, \u201c[t]he element of \u2018punishment\u2019 in probation revocation of [the] defendant is attributable to the crime for which he [or she] was originally convicted and sentenced. Thus, any sentence [the] defendant had to serve as the result of the [probation] violation . . . was \u2018punishment\u2019 for the crime of which he [or she] had originally been convicted. Revocation is a continuing consequence of the original conviction from which probation was granted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 178, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s argument is misplaced because the six year sentence is punishment for the criminal conduct that led to his 1999 conviction. As the state properly recognizes, a challenge to the length of the sentence should be made through the sentence review process under General Statutes \u00a7 51-195.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In addition, to the extent the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion because it failed to consider the specific circumstances under which he was acting on July 28, 2003, we conclude that this argument also lacks merit. During the sentencing hearing, the trial court allowed the defendant to address the court, wherein he described his belief that his relationship with Johnson, and more particularly her false statements that led to his June, 2003 disorderly conduct arrest, precipitated his behavior on that night. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s attempt to place the blame for his actions on Johnson. On the basis of the record of the defendant\u2019s behavior before and during his release on probation, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that \u201cthe beneficial aspects of [the defendant\u2019s] probation no longer [were] being served.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 185.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b132-6\">VERTEFEUILLE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\">dissenting. Although I agree with parts I, II A and III of the majority opinion, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part IIB of its opinion that the trial court properly enhanced the sentence of the defendant, Damon Fagan, under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40b, despite the fact that it failed to canvass the defendant to ascertain whether his guilty plea to part B of the information was made knowingly and voluntarily. Specifically, I disagree with the majority\u2019s underlying conclusion that no plea canvass was required constitutionally because the defendant was not entitled to have a jury find whether his sentence could be enhanced under \u00a7 53a-40b. Instead, I conclude that in accordance with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), a jury must find the operative fact that underlies the defendant\u2019s sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b, namely, whether he was released on bond at the time he committed the present offenses with which he is charged. Because I believe that the defendant would be entitled to a jury finding, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure adequately to canvass him prior to accepting his guilty plea violated his due process rights under the federal constitution. Thus, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect only to the defendant\u2019s one year sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b, and would remand the case to the trial court with direction to permit the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea to part B of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">I agree with the majority that the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s due process right to a plea canvass was violated turns on whether the defendant was, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>pleading guilty, waiving his right to a jury trial on the factual issues that triggered the enhancement of his sentence under part B of the information. I further agree that this inquiry is controlled by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>in Apprendi </em>and its progeny. I depart, however, from the reasoning of the majority opinion in its interpretation and application of the rule laid down in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the rule regarding when a defendant is entitled to a jury finding of facts that would increase his or her criminal penalty beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum. Id., 490. In that case, the defendant entered a guilty plea to two counts of second degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose and one count of third degree unlawful possession of an antipersonnel bomb. Id., 469-70. The trial court subsequently held a hearing regarding the applicability of New Jersey\u2019s hate crime statute, which provides for an extended term of imprisonment if the trial judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 468-69. The trial judge made the requisite finding under the hate crime statute and enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence accordingly. Id., 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that the New Jersey hate crime statute was unconstitutional because the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and the sixth amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial make it \u201cunconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 490. Accordingly, the court established the following rule: \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id.; accord <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301-304, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004) (invalidating defendant\u2019s sentence under rule set forth in <em>Apprendi </em>because sentence was enhanced beyond statutorily prescribed maximum on basis of trial court\u2019s determination that defendant acted with deliberate cruelty).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The <em>Apprendi </em>court excepted the fact of a prior conviction from the general rule on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1998). In that case, the court concluded that the defendant could be subject to a longer prison sentence based on the fact that he had been previously convicted for \u201caggravated felonies,\u201d despite the fact that such prior convictions were not charged in the defendant\u2019s indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 226-27. In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the federal constitution requires that the fact of his prior convictions also be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The court in <em>Apprendi </em>described <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as \u201cat best an exceptional departure from the historic practice\u201d; <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 487; of charging in an indictment all facts needed to inform the defendant of the crime charged and the subsequent penalty if found guilty, of trying such facts to a jury, and proving such facts to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 476. The court also intimated that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was decided wrongly and if the fact of prior conviction had been contested it would need to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but it declined to revisit the case because the defendant did not challenge its validity. Id., 489-90. Instead, the court treated <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as a narrow exception to the general rule requiring the jury to find any facts beyond a reasonable doubt that would increase the penalty beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The court reasoned that its decision in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>could be excepted from the general rule that it was announcing because that decision \u201cturned heavily upon the fact that the additional sentence to which the defendant was subject was the prior commission of a serious crime. . . . Both the certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any fact of prior conviction, and the reality that [the defendant in Almendarez-Torres] did not challenge the accuracy of that fact in his case, mitigated the due process and jsjixth [ajmendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>mine a fact increasing punishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 488; see also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 526 U.S. 227, 249, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1999) (noting that due process and sixth amendment concerns in <em>Almendarez- Torres </em>were mitigated because \u201cunlike virtually any other consideration used to enlarge the possible penalty for an offense ... a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees\u201d). Indeed, the court noted that \u201cthere is a vast difference between accepting the validity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and allowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Applying the plain language of the rule set forth in <em>Apprendi, </em>it is apparent that the fact of whether the defendant was released on bond from an arrest is not a fact of prior conviction and is therefore a fact that the due process clause and the sixth amendment require to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Arizona Court of Appeals, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>201 Ariz. 41, 44, 31 P.3d 815 (App. 2001), reached this same conclusion based on a sentence enhancement statute that is nearly identical to \u00a7 53a-40b. In that case, the defendant was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of forgery. Id. Prior to sentencing, the trial court took judicial notice of a Superior Court record and found that the defendant had committed the present offense while released on bond for another felony offense. Id., 43. Accordingly, the trial court enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence by two years on each count pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes Annotated \u00a7 13-604 (R) (West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>2001), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person who is convicted of committing any felony offense, which felony offense is committed while the person is released on bail or on the defendant\u2019s own recognizance on a separate felony offense . . . shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment two years longer than would otherwise be imposed for the felony offense committed while released on bond or on the defendant\u2019s own recognizance . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals concluded that the enhancement of the defendant\u2019s sentence based on the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant committed the present offenses while on release awaiting trial on a separate felony charge violated <em>Apprendi. State </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>supra, 201 Ariz. 44. The court reasoned that, because the fact that the defendant was on release status resulted in a sentence beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum, the plain language of <em>Apprendi </em>required that the defendant\u2019s release status be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. The court did acknowledge that it would be rather easy for the court to take judicial notice of a court record to determine the release date, but it concluded that \u201c[u]nder <em>Apprendi, </em>it is a defendant\u2019s exposure to additional punishment, not the ease or accuracy with which that fact can be determined by a trial court, that is pivotal in triggering a defendant\u2019s right to have a jury decide.\u201d Id., 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Despite the narrow wording of the prior conviction exception to the general rule set forth in <em>Apprendi, </em>the majority correctly notes that some courts have concluded that other facts, such as the defendant\u2019s status as being on probation or parole and the defendant\u2019s release date from prison, also fall within that exception because they arise from and are essentially analogous to a prior conviction. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>Court of Appeals, Docket No. 03CA0696, 2006 Colo. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>LEXIS 220, *6 (Colo. App. February 23, 2006) (concluding that \u201cfact that [the] defendant was on parole or probation is inextricably linked to his prior conviction and thus falls within the prior conviction exception\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Calloway, </em>914 So. 2d 12, 14 (Fla. App. 2005) (concluding that date defendant was released from prison falls within prior conviction exception because \u201cit is directly derivative of a prior conviction\u201d), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1080, 126 S. Ct. 1794, 164 L. Ed. 2d 534 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>706 N.W.2d 40, 48 (Minn. 2005) (concluding that fact defendant was on probation \u201carises from, and is so essentially analogous to, the fact of a prior conviction, that constitutional considerations do not require it to be determined by a jury\u201d), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1106, 126 S. Ct. 1884, 164 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2006). These courts reason that, because these facts are bound up in the prior conviction to which constitutionally required procedural safeguards attached, the sixth amendment concerns expressed in <em>Apprendi </em>are not implicated. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>supra, *6-7; <em>State </em>v. <em>Calloway, </em>supra, 14; <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Even if I were to assume that the prior conviction exception should be extended to facts that arise from and are so essentially analogous to a prior conviction, the exception nonetheless would be inapplicable in the present case. Here, the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on the fact that he was released on bond after an arrest at the time when the present offenses were committed. This fact plainly did not arise from a prior conviction. Further, this fact cannot be said to be essentially analogous to a prior conviction because the substantial procedural safeguards that attach to the factual finding of a prior conviction, namely, the rights to a jury trial and to have the state prove the relevant facts beyond a reasonable doubt, do not attach to a factual finding of a defendant\u2019s release status after an arrest. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tighe, </em>266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>F.3d 1187, 1194 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that \u201c \u2018prior conviction\u2019 exception to <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>general rule <em>must be limited to prior convictions that were themselves obtained through proceedings that included the right to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>879 So. 2d 1276, 1290 (La. 2004) (concluding that juvenile adjudication does not fall within prior conviction exception because it \u201cis not established through a procedure guaranteeing a jury trial\u201d); but cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>332 F.3d 688, 696 (3d Cir. 2003) (juvenile adjudication may fall within prior conviction exception if defendant was accorded \u201call the procedural safeguards that he [was] constitutionally due\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smalley, </em>294 F.3d 1030, 1032-33 (8th Cir. 2002) (same). Accordingly, I conclude that the due process and sixth amendment concerns at issue in <em>Apprendi </em>would be implicated by a trial court\u2019s factual finding of the defendant\u2019s release status after an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The majority opinion also relies on <em>Ryle </em>v. <em>State, </em>842 N.E.2d 320, 325 (Ind. 2005), in which the Indiana Supreme Court advanced an alternative reasoning for determining that the trial court could find that the defendant was on probation at the time his subsequent offense was committed. The court in <em>Ryle </em>noted that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005), reaffirmed the use of certain documents by the trial court to determine the character of a prior conviction for the purpose of determining whether a sentence enhancement applies. <em>Ryle </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 324-25. The court in <em>Ryle </em>concluded that the trial court properly had found that the defendant was on parole based on references in a presentence investigation report to case files from courts in which the defendant was convicted because these type of judicial records bear the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>hallmark of conclusive significance as those enumerated in <em>Shepard. </em>Id., 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">I am not persuaded that the <em>Shepard </em>decision provides a basis on which a trial court constitutionally can find the fact of the defendant\u2019s release status after an arrest under \u00a7 53a-40b. In <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 16, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to possessing a firearm as a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (g) (1). Because the defendant had four prior convictions under a Massachusetts state burglary statute, the government sought to apply the Armed Career Criminal Act (act), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 (e), which requires a minimum fifteen year sentence for anyone possessing a firearm after three prior convictions for violent felonies, and the act makes burglary a violent felony if it was committed in a building or enclosed space. Id., 15-16. Because the Massachusetts burglary statute was more expansive than the definition of burglary under the act, the government urged the District Court judge to consider police reports that were submitted with complaint applications in order to show that the burglaries were committed in a building or enclosed space. Id., 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The court in <em>Shepard </em>reaffirmed its decision in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990), in which it had allowed District Courts, in order to determine whether the prior convictions necessarily fell within the act\u2019s definition of burglary, to refer to the charging documents filed in the court of conviction and recorded judicial acts, such as the jury instructions, that could have limited the conviction to the type of burglary defined in the act. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 20. In order to encompass the scenario wherein the prior convictions arose from either a bench trial or a guilty plea, the <em>Shepard </em>court expanded the documents to which the District Court can refer to include: the judge\u2019s rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of law and finding of facts; the transcript of the plea colloquy or the written plea agreement; and any finding of facts adopted by the defendant upon entering his or her plea. Id. The court did, however, reject the government\u2019s use of police reports because they go \u201cbeyond conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt . . . .\u201d Id., 21. Instead, the court noted that the inquiry must be confined to reference to judicial records \u201cof the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction in a [state that defines burglary in the same manner as the act].\u201d Id., 23. Finally, Justice Souter, writing for four members of the court, noted that the court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Apprendi </em>also required that the District Court\u2019s inquiry be limited to judicial records that contain facts that <em>necessarily </em>had to be found by the convicting court. Id., 24-26. Justice Thomas, who concurred in the judgment of the court, took the position that any factual inquiry by the District Court into the judicial records of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi. </em>Id., 26-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Turning to the present case, I cannot conclude that <em>Shepard </em>provides any support for a trial judge to find, on the basis of a record contained in a court file, the fact that a defendant was released on bond from an arrest on a specific date. Unlike the types of judicial records discussed in <em>Shepard, </em>such a judicial record was not \u201cmade or used in adjudicating guilt\u201d; id., 21; and the facts contained in such a record were not necessarily found by a convicting court. Accordingly, such a fact does not approach the certainty of a prior conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Other courts, as the majority also correctly notes, have refused to extend the prior conviction exception to apply to facts such as the defendant\u2019s parole or probation status. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wissink, </em>172 N.C. App. 829, 837, 617 S.E.2d 319 (2005) (concluding that, although probationary status is not far removed from prior conviction, rule set forth in <em>Apprendi </em>requires this fact to be found by jury and noting that fact of probationary status \u201cdid not have the procedural safeguards of a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt recognized in <em>Apprendi </em>as providing the necessary protection for defendants at sentencing\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>196 Or. App. 364, 371-73, 102 P.3d 705 (2004) (concluding that fact defendant was on parole or probation was related to prior conviction, but procedural safeguards discussed in <em>Apprendi </em>did not apply to this fact, and, therefore, fact must be proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 340 Or. 310, 131 P.3d 168 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>126 Wash.

Not only did the court refer to <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the decision on which the exception is based, as \u201cat best an <em>exceptional </em>departure from the historic practice\u201d regarding criminal proceedings; (emphasis added) <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 487; it also stated its doubts regarding the correctness of this decision. Id., 489-90 and n.15; see also <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 27-28 (Thomas, J., concurring) (noting that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been eroded by court\u2019s sixth amendment jurisprudence and majority of court now believes it was decided wrongly). On the basis of these reservations, the court explicitly stated that the exception it was creating to accommodate the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>decision was a <em>\u201cnarrow exception </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 490; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tighe, </em>supra, 266 F.3d 1194 (noting that <em>\u201cApprendi </em>[c] ourt\u2019s serious reservations about the reasoning of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>counsel against any extension\u201d of prior conviction exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The majority opinion does, however, construe some of these decisions as adopting what it describes as a \u201ccontext driven approach,\u201d wherein a jury trial would be required only if the relevant inquiry was of the type of \u201ccomplicated and intensively factual inquiry that clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>would fall within the jury\u2019s traditional province.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Employing this context driven approach, the majority concludes that the fact of whether the defendant was released on bond after an arrest at the time of the subsequent offenses need not be tried to a jury because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>it can be proven easily by reference to a court file. The majority noted that \u201conce the defendant was convicted under part A of the information, demonstrating that he had committed the crimes charged on the date specified, the only issue left open \u2014 whether he was on release from an arrest at the time \u2014 properly could have been the subject of judicial notice.\u201d I agree that evidence found in a court file likely would be able to answer the factual question of the defendant\u2019s status and such evidence is amenable to judicial notice. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>213 Conn. 289, 293, 567 A.2d 1187 (1989) (\u201c[w]e may . . . take judicial notice of the court files in another suit between the parties, especially when the relevance of that litigation was expressly made an issue at this trial\u201d), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 939, 110 S.

Nevertheless, the ease of proof does not mean that no factual inquiry is necessary where the parties contest that fact. See <em>Ohio Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>301 U.S. 292, 301, 57 S. Ct. 724, 81 L. Ed. 1093 (1937) (\u201c[judicial] notice, even when taken, has no other effect than to relieve one of the parties to a controversy of the burden of resorting to the usual forms of evidence\u201d); see also <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Healey Ford-Subaru, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 707, 730 n.24, 652 A.2d 496 (1995) (\u201cdoctrine of judicial notice excuses the party having the burden of establishing a fact from introducing formal proof of the fact\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Further, the majority\u2019s reasoning, which hinges the right to a jury trial on the ease by which the underlying fact may be proven, finds no support in <em>Apprendi. </em>As we have noted previously herein, the court in <em>Apprendi </em>did not except the fact of prior convictions from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>general rule requiring jury fact-finding because the fact of prior conviction was easily proven by reference to a court file; rather, the court incoiporated this exception because of the procedural safeguards that attached to the fact of conviction and the reality that the defendant in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>did not contest the fact of his prior conviction. <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New </em>Jersey, supra, 530 U.S. 488. Indeed, the <em>Apprendi </em>court\u2019s dictum intimating that a jury finding would be required, under its reasoning, if the fact of prior conviction had been contested in <em>Almendarez-Torres</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>undermines the majority opinion\u2019s reasoning because the fact of prior conviction could also have been proven easily by reference to the court file. As the Arizona Court of Appeals stated, <em>\u201c[vender Apprendi, </em>it is a defendant\u2019s exposure to additional punishment, not the ease or accuracy with which that fact can be determined by a trial court, that is pivotal in triggering a defendant\u2019s right to have a jury decide.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>supra, 201 Ariz. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Finally, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to limit the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial on the basis of the majority opinion\u2019s context driven approach because it would require this court to engage in a subj ective analysis of how complicated or easy a given fact would be to prove and it is this type of subjective inquiry regarding the outer contours of the sixth amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial that the United States Supreme Court disapproved of in <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 542 U.S. 296. In <em>Blakely, </em>the court expressly rejected the view that legislatures should be allowed to, <em>within certain limits, </em>establish that certain factors are to be considered sentencing factors found by the trial court. Id., 307. The court noted that this view would mean, in operation, \u201cthat the law must not go too far \u2014 it must not exceed the judicial estimation of the proper role of the judge.\u201d Id. The court rejected the notion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>sixth amendment contains this subjective standard, as opposed to the bright line rule of <em>Apprendi. </em>Id., 308. The court stated that the right to a jury trial \u201cis no mere procedural formality, but a fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure. Just as suffrage ensures the people\u2019s ultimate control in the legislative and executive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary.\u201d Id., 305-306. Accordingly, the court expressed its doubt \u201cthat the [f]ramers would have left [the] definition of the scope of jury power up to judges\u2019 intuitive sense of how far is <em>too far.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id., 308. In the context of the majority\u2019s opinion, I must conclude that the framers also would not have wanted to limit the right to a jury trial based on a judge\u2019s intuitive sense of how easy or complicated a given fact would be to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I therefore conclude that, in the present case, if the defendant had not entered a guilty plea, he would have been entitled to a jury finding regarding whether he was released on bond from an arrest at the time he committed the crimes charged in part A of the information. Accordingly, by pleading guilty to the sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b, the defendant waived the same rights that were discussed in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>274 (1969), namely, his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his sixth amendment rights to a jury trial and to confront his accusers. To waive such fundamental constitutional rights validly under the due process clause, the waiver must be \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969). I therefore conclude that, if a trial court fails to canvass adequately the defendant to ensure that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea to part B of an information charging the defendant with a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53a-40b, such a guilty plea is obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">An examination of the record in the present case reveals that the trial court made no effort to ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. The complete exchange between the court and the defendant consisted of the court directing the clerk to put the defendant to plea on part B of the information, the clerk informing the defendant that he was charged under part B of the information with violating \u00a7 53a-40b and asking the defendant how he wished to plead, and the defendant responding that he pleaded guilty. Thus, the record in the present case does not reveal any facts from which a reasonable conclusion could be drawn that the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. Accordingly, I conclude that there was a clear violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights because his guilty plea to part B of the information did not comply with constitutional standards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 242 (\u201c[i]t was error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>plain on the face of the record, for the trial judge to accept [the] petitioner\u2019s guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 535-36, 290 A.2d 332 (1971) (concluding that, because trial court record was completely silent as to whether defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, plea was not in compliance with constitutional standards). The defendant should therefore be given the opportunity to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> The United States Supreme Court in <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.

Ed. 2d 403 (2004), defined the maximum sentence to be \u201cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d Accordingly, the current rule, as set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), is that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\"> The factual background of <em>the Almendarez-Torres </em>decision is described in detail in footnote 20 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> Specifically, the court in <em>Apprendi </em>stated: \u201cEven though it is arguable that <em>Almendareg-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided, and that a logical application of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested, [the defendant] does not contest the decision\u2019s validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rule we recalled at the outset. Given its unique facts, it surely does not warrant rejection of the otherwise uniform course of decision during the entire history of our jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 489-90.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> The majority opinion also relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanko, </em>62 Conn. App. 34, 42, 771 A.2d 149, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 905, 772 A.2d 599 (2001), in which the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant was not deprived unconstitutionally of a jury trial on whether his sentence could be enhanced under \u00a7 53a-40b. The basis for the Appellate Court\u2019s decision was twofold. First, the court concluded that no jury trial was required because there was no issue of fact. Id., 43. Specifically, the court noted that the defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>conceded at the sentencing hearing that the defendant was released on a written promise to appear following a conviction for a prior crime when he committed the subsequent offense. Id. Second, the court also determined that the due process and sixth amendment concerns were mitigated because of the defendant\u2019s concession regarding his prior conviction. Id., 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Sanko </em>because the defendant has not conceded that he was released on bond from an arrest at the time he committed the offenses with which he is charged. In his brief in this court, the defendant claims never to have stipulated as to his status at the time of the present offenses. Further, my review of the record in the present case reveals that, although the defendant, during his sentencing hearing, made numerous allusions to his prior arrest for disorderly conduct, he did not admit explicitly that he was, in fact, released on bond on the date of the subsequent offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\"> The majority identifies <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 126 Wash. App. 136, and <em>Markwood </em>v. <em>Renard, </em>203 Or. App. 145, 125 P.3d 39 (2005), as employing a context driven approach to determine whether a jury finding was necessary based on the complexity and intensively factual nature of the inquiry. I cannot agree that these courts employed such an analysis. In <em>Jones, </em>the court concluded that the fact that the defendant was in community placement does not fall within the prior conviction exception because the facts necessary to make this finding were contained in department of correction records and not within the judgment or sentence of the prior conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 143-44. Thus, the <em>Jones </em>court concluded that the facts contained within these records do not fall within the prior conviction exception because they \u201cdo not bear the same procedural protections as facts necessarily determined by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Id., 145. Accordingly, I cannot agree that the <em>Jones </em>court\u2019s decision was based on the \u201ccomplicated and intensively factual inquiry\u201d into the defendant\u2019s status as being in community placement at the time of the offenses. Rather, the fact of the defendant\u2019s status as being in community placement did not fall within the prior conviction exception because the procedural protections that apply to the fact of conviction do not apply to department of correction records.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In <em>Markwood </em>v. <em>Renard, </em>supra, 203 Or. App. 150, the court concluded that the defendant was entitled to a jury finding regarding an increased sentence based on his probationary status at the time he committed the offenses with which he was charged even though the defendant admitted that he was on probation at that time. The court reasoned that, under Oregon law, \u201can upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status requires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because the defendant did not admit to those further facts, the court concluded that the defendant was entitled under <em>Apprendi </em>to a jury finding of those additional facts. Id. The court did not consider whether a jury would have been required to find the fact that the defendant was on probation if he had not admitted to that fact. The court did, however, cite to its prior decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 196 Or. App. 371-72, in which it had concluded that the fact that the defendant was on parole or probation does not fall within the prior conviction exception because this fact \u201chas not been proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, so the same \u2018procedural safeguards\u2019 had not attached to that \u2018fact\u2019 . . . .\u201d Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the Oregon Court of Appeals has adopted such a context driven approach to determining when a jury finding is required under <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> Indeed, the framers had expressed the fear that \u201cthe jury right could be lost not only by gross denial, but by erosion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 483. As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 526 U.S. 248, \u201c[o]ne contributor to the ratification debates . . . commenting on the jury trial guarantee in [article three, \u00a7 2, of the United States constitution] . . . wamfed] of the need \u2018to guard with the most jealous circumspection against the introduction of new, and arbitrary methods of trial, which, under a variety of plausible pretenses, may in time, imperceptibly undermine this best preservative of LIBERTY.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, even though the present case presents a question that admittedly challenges the sixth amendment right to jury trial on the margins, I believe that this court should nonetheless view any expansion of the prior conviction exception with the <em>most </em>jealous circumspection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\"> Because the defendant\u2019s claim was unpreserved, he can prevail on this claim only if he satisfies the four-pronged test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Under <em>Golding, </em>the defendant can prevail on this claim only if the following conditions are met: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. I agree with the majority opinion that the first two prongs were satisfied. Because I conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to canvass adequately the defendant was a clear constitutional violation, I conclude that the third prong of <em>Golding </em>was satisfied. Under the fourth prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis, the state bears the burden of proving that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Estrella, </em>277 Conn. 458, 477, 893 A.2d 348 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 470, 678 A.2d 910 (1996). In the present case, the state has failed to meet its burden because it did not argue, in its brief in this court, that the constitutionally inadequate canvass was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
