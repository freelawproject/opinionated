With respect to the defendant\u2019s remaining claim, namely, that her sixth amendment rights to confront witnesses and to compulsory process<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were violated on the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision to quash a portion of a subpoena duces tecum (subpoena) that she had served on her former supervisor seeking documents relevant to the case, we agreed with the defendant that the trial court\u2019s decision to quash that portion of the subpoena was improper. See id., 258. Because, however, we could not determine, on the basis of the trial court record, whether that impropriety had resulted in a violation of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights, we remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on that issue. Id., 259. Following that hearing, the trial court determined that the defendant had received, in a timely manner, the documents that were the subject of the contested portion of the subpoena and, therefore, that the subpoena had been complied with. We agree with the trial court and further conclude that the defendant suffered no deprivation of her sixth amendment rights. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 229, we set forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cAt all relevant times, the defendant worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>as an account clerk for the . . . building department (department) [of the town of Westport (town)]. The department processes all applications for building permits. While the defendant was employed at the department, her immediate supervisor was the [town] building official, Stephen Smith. Smith, in turn, reported to the fire chief, Richard Gough. Among other tasks, the defendant collected permit fees. She also processed the permit applications on the department\u2019s computer and printed out each permit. A computer generated permit would not become valid, however, until it was signed by one of the department . . . officials. Hard copies of all signed permits were kept in manila file folders in the department offices. The defendant also prepared periodic reports . . . accounting for the permits issued and funds collected, by check or cash, over a particular time period, usually once every one or two weeks. These reports were used by the town controller, Donald Miklus, to prepare the fees for deposit. When the defendant went on vacation or was ill, no reports were generated until her return. Smith did not review the reports the defendant had prepared for Miklus.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201cThe defendant often complained about problems that she was having with the computer program, including inaccuracies in the function used to generate the reports for Miklus. Specifically, she complained that when she created these reports, permits often would be missing from the list. The defendant complained about this problem to Gough, who told her to type in the missing permits. The defendant also complained that she had difficulty retrieving information regarding permits from prior fiscal years.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201cIn April, 1994, an individual contacted the controller\u2019s office about a check that his bank had returned. Although the individual had issued the check to the department in October, 1993, in payment of a permit fee, the check had not been presented for payment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>his bank until April, 1994. While investigating the reason for this delay, the controller\u2019s office discovered that a substantial number of checks deposited during certain periods did not correspond to the permits listed on the reports for those periods. According to Smith, the checks should have been deposited during the same period that the permits were issued. The controller\u2019s office also found numerous instances in which a permit was listed on a report for a particular period, but the fee for the permit had been covered by a check in the name of someone other than the permit applicant, and the check corresponding to the permit had been deposited in a later period. Miklus informed both Smith and Gough of these irregularities and also expressed his concern that unusually small amounts of cash had been included in recent department deposits. Neither Smith nor Gough previously had been aware of the existence of any undeposited cash or checks, or of any discrepancies between the period in which a particular fee was received and the period in which that fee had been deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u201cAfter the close of business on or about May 11,1994, Gough conducted a search of the department offices. During the course of the search, he found an envelope in the defendant\u2019s desk containing a steno pad and approximately eighty-six checks totaling $2593. The checks bore dates ranging from December, 1993, through April, 1994. Gough also found cash in the defendant\u2019s desk in two separate locations totaling $82 and $30, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u201cDuring the next reporting period, Miklus and Gough noted that $112 in cash had been received by the defendant in payment for permit fees. Miklus and Gough waited to see if the cash and checks that Gough had discovered in the defendant\u2019s desk would be included in the defendant\u2019s next report. When the defendant had failed to include the checks or cash in her report, Gough, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Smith and Miklus arranged to meet with the defendant. At that meeting, which occurred on May 20, 1994, the defendant was asked why the checks did not correspond to the permits listed on the report. The defendant said that she was unaware of the discrepancy and attributed any discrepancy to her heavy workload. When asked about the cash and why it was not deposited, the defendant said that she must have used it to make change for someone who had overpaid with a check. The defendant also said that she was unaware of any undeposited checks from earlier reporting periods. She indicated that the only checks remaining in the department offices would be those checks that had been received during the current reporting period. Miklus then suggested that they search the department offices to see whether there were any checks there that should have been deposited during a prior period.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u201cGough, Smith and Miklus gave the defendant an opportunity to look for such checks, but she claimed to be unable to find any. Gough then retrieved from the defendant\u2019s desk the envelope that he had found earlier, containing the checks and a steno pad. The defendant tried to take the envelope from Gough, but he handed it to Miklus. The defendant was asked why the checks were in the envelope. She stated that they corresponded to permits not yet reflected in her reports. Miklus retained the checks and the pad, then asked the defendant if she could produce the permits corresponding to the checks in the envelope. The defendant agreed to do so, and some time thereafter, provided Gough with thirty-two documents that she claimed to be the corresponding permits. None of the thirty-two documents, however, was signed by a building official.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201cGough and the controller\u2019s office reviewed the thirty-two documents, which reflected a total of $3140 in fees, to determine whether they were legitimate and whether they corresponded to the checks found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>defendant\u2019s desk. On September 30, 1994, Gough and Miklus held another meeting with the defendant at which they reported their findings regarding the documents. Although their review indicated that some of the permits were legitimate in that they had not been issued previously, others related to projects for which the general contractor already had prepaid all applicable fees. Specifically, approximately ten of the permits, representing $326 worth of fees, corresponded to work for which permits previously had been issued at no fee as a result of general contractors\u2019 prepayments for anticipated subcontractor work. Thus, there was no reason for such permits to have been issued. Moreover, none of the checks found in the defendant\u2019s desk matched any of the thirty-two permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u201cWhen asked for an explanation, the defendant reported that she had not checked the manila file folders in preparing the documents. She indicated that, instead, she only had consulted the computer, and provided permits that, to the best of her knowledge, had not yet been issued. The defendant also was asked why there had been so little cash deposited recently. The defendant responded only that the department received cash in \u2018dribs and drabs.\u2019 Regarding the cash fees that the department had received in May, 1994, the defendant could not explain why that cash had not been deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u201cIn February, 1995, the police questioned the defendant about the various discrepancies and irregularities. Thereafter, the defendant went to Miklus\u2019 deputy, John Kondub, to point out that there was cash in the office, in three different locations, that had been received in payment for photocopying department records. She told Kondub that she \u2018wasn\u2019t going to take the blame for this money being here.\u2019 Kondub then collected and counted the cash, which totaled $367.85. The defendant also told Kondub that Smith knew about the cash, that Smith had used some of it for a building officials\u2019 meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ing and, finally, that Smith had authorized the defendant to take some money from the fund to buy flowers for a sick volunteer. Smith stated that he was aware of the cash payments for photocopying, but that he had assumed that the cash was deposited properly, on a regular basis. Smith also acknowledged that he had authorized the defendant to pay for the flowers out of the cash that had been collected for photocopying fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u201cThe defendant was terminated from her employment with the department on April 18,1995. Gough then hired a temporary secretary to go through the manila permit files and prepare a report for fiscal year 1993, listing, inter alia, each permit that had been issued, the issuance date, the fee charged, and whether the file copy had been signed. The report indicated that 2447 permits had been issued for a total of $351,911 in fees. For the same fiscal year, $358,557 in fees had been deposited, representing an excess of approximately $6500.\u201d Id., 233-38. The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with nine counts of forgery in the second degree and three counts of larceny in the second degree. A jury trial thereafter ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Our opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, sets forth the following additional relevant facts and procedural history relative to the defendant\u2019s trial. \u201cOn January 28, 1997, the second day of trial, the defendant served a subpoena on Smith that directed him to appear in court on that same day and to bring with him certain records and documents. Specifically, the subpoena directed Smith to produce the following three categories of materials:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u201cA. Any and all operators] manuals, procedure guidelines, memorand[a], or written instruments regarding building permit procedure in the . . . [department from 1993 to 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201cB. All computer records of the . . . [department from the later of Building Permit [No.] 52260 or June 30, 1993 until the present date.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u201cC. Any correspondence, statements, and/or memoranda to and/or from [the defendant] in possession of the . . . [d]epartment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201cThe defendant . . . claimed that she had a sixth amendment right to obtain the materials identified in [part A of] the subpoena. [Although the state had moved to quash that portion of the subpoena, the state nevertheless] indicated that it had no objection to the defendant\u2019s request for the documents sought thereunder. The trial [court] stated, however: T do. [The defendant] is charged with the crimes of [larceny in the second degree and forgery in the second degree]. She is not charged with using a computer improperly or the records didn\u2019t jive up right. I think [part] A is irrelevant and immaterial.\u2019 The court later stated: \u2018[The defendant] is charged with a very simple charge. She\u2019s charged with taking money and falsifying documents. I see no reason to have this court listen to or have the jury have to read operator\u2019s manuals [or] procedure guidelines .... I\u2019m going to . . . deny [part] A . . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 251-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The jury subsequently found the defendant guilty of the forgery charges but not guilty of the larceny charges. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, and the defendant appealed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that her sixth amendment rights to confront <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>witnesses <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to compulsory process<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were violated on the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena. As we explained in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 229, the defendant claimed, specifically, that \u201cthe trial court improperly [had] quashed part A of the subpoena because the materials sought thereunder, namely, \u2018[a]ny and all operator[\u2019s] manuals, procedure guidelines, memorandum [a], or written instruments regarding building permit procedure in the . . . [department from 1993 to 1995,\u2019 were central to her defense and likely would have assisted her in cross-examining the state\u2019s witnesses. The defendant emphasize [d] the fact that the forgery charges related directly to her preparation of permits and reports that did not correspond to the payments for the permits. The defendant maintain[ed] . . . that the claimed forgeries were not motivated by any intent to defraud, deceive or injure the town, but, rather, were the result of overwork, disorganization and an honest attempt to reconcile the permits with the checks. According to the defendant, therefore, information as to any written policies cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ering the practices of the department with respect to permits and accounting was essential to enable her to mount an effective defense and to refute the state\u2019s claims. The defendant assert[ed], for example, that she could have used the information requested under part A of the subpoena to substantiate a claim that her conduct was not inconsistent with any formal department policy, whether or not any such policy existed.\u201d Id., 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The state maintained that the trial court had not abused its discretion in quashing part A of the subpoena because compliance \u201cwould have been unduly burdensome\u201d; id.; and because the defendant\u2019s request was nothing more than a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 256. The state further maintained that the defendant had made an insufficient showing that the materials sought under part A would have been useful to her defense \u201cbecause she ha[d] not demonstrated that the department was subject to any written policies or procedures.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">After reviewing the applicable legal principles, we concluded that the trial court improperly had quashed part A of the subpoena because the materials sought thereunder were highly relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim that her conduct did not violate any official department policy and because the request was sufficiently particularized and not unduly burdensome. See id., 258. We then stated: \u201cNevertheless, on the present record, we cannot determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena violated the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected rights under the compulsory process or confrontation clauses. Because the trial court prohibited the defendant from obtaining the materials sought under part A of the subpoena, we do not know whether any such materials exist. If such written policies and procedures do exist, we do not know the extent to which they may support the defendant\u2019s claim that her conduct, though sloppy or negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>gent, was not criminal. Moreover, we do not know whether the defendant followed some or all of the policies, or none at all. In the absence of such facts, we cannot determine the harm, if any, [that the defendant suffered] as a result of the failure to produce those written policies and procedures. On the other hand, if the department maintained no such written guidelines, then the defendant still must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena so inhibited her ability to establish that fact, notwithstanding other evidence of the absence of any written policies or procedures . . . that she is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u201cUnder the circumstances, therefore, we are persuaded that an initial determination of the foregoing issues should be made by the trial court, which will have the opportunity to do so on the basis of a full factual record developed after a hearing. Thereafter, the parties will be able to present to this court whatever arguments may be appropriate regarding whether the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were violated and whether she suffered harm as a result of the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena issued to Smith.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 258-59. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on the issues raised by that court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">At that hearing, the senior assistant state\u2019s attorney (state\u2019s attorney) informed the trial court that, notwithstanding the court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena, the town, at the direction of the state\u2019s attorney, had, in fact, complied in a timely manner with part A of the subpoena. Specifically, the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>explained that he had requested that the town provide him with the documents sought under that portion of the subpoena. The town did so, and the state\u2019s attorney then made those documents available to defense counsel. Associates of defense counsel's firm reviewed them in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. The state\u2019s attorney also informed the court that defense counsel had been provided with those documents in advance of his cross-examination of Smith and that certain of those documents had been introduced into evidence by the defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although defense counsel agreed with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations, he maintained that the defendant nevertheless was entitled to a new trial because the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena had compromised the defendant\u2019s ability to establish that the department had no written policies or procedures regarding the processing of building permits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Following the hearing, the trial court determined that part A of the subpoena had been complied with and, therefore, that no further action by the trial court was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Thereafter, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs with respect to whether, in view of the facts and circumstances adduced at the hearing, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In her brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the defendant maintains that she is entitled to a new trial because, regardless of whether the defense actually received the documents sought under part A of the subpoena, her sixth amendment rights were violated on the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena. In particular, the defendant contends that the court\u2019s decision to quash unduly compromised her ability to ask certain questions regarding the subpoenaed documents, including whether written policies existed with respect to the department\u2019s building permit procedures and, if so, why they had not been produced. The defendant further asserts that the opportunity to have engaged in such questioning likely would have bolstered her defense by making it more possible for her to have discredited one or more of the state\u2019s witnesses. The state counters that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated because the defendant did receive the subpoenaed documents and because, at trial, defense counsel was afforded an opportunity to inquire \u2014 and did inquire of Smith in particular\u2014 about the department\u2019s policies and procedures concerning the processing of building permits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We agree with the state that, under the circumstances, the defendant suffered no deprivation of her sixth amendment rights. It is undisputed that the defendant received, in a timely manner, the documents that she sought under part A of the subpoena. Moreover, defense counsel had an opportunity to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses concerning their knowledge of written policies or procedures concerning the processing of building permits, and defense counsel took advantage of that opportunity in connection with his cross-examination of Smith. See footnote 11 of this opinion. Thus, even though the trial court had quashed part A of the subpoena, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the court limited the defendant\u2019s inquiry into the existence or nonexistence of such written policies or procedures; indeed, as defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Smith reflects, the court did not do so. The record also contains no suggestion that the court would have limited the defendant\u2019s opportunity to call any witness or witnesses of her choosing for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>pose of making that same inquiry. Aside from the defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated and speculative assertion that the trial court\u2019s decision to quash part A of the subpoena compromised defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of one or more of the state\u2019s witnesses, the defendant has identified no harm that even arguably resulted from that decision to quash part A of the subpoena.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, because of the defendant\u2019s timely receipt of the documents that she had sought under part A of the subpoena, and because the trial court did not prohibit or otherwise limit the defendant\u2019s opportunity to adduce testimony concerning the procedures and policies that were the subject of that portion of the subpoena, we can conceive of no harm that could have flowed from the court\u2019s decision to quash. Consequently, the defendant was not deprived of her sixth amendment rights to confront witnesses and to compulsory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of three counts of larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . .

You struck that.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u201cThe Court: I ruled against [the defendant] on those.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Whereupon the jury was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: But what I am asking the witness is, whether he was called [on] to produce those things and whether, in review of his records, he came up with anything, and then I am going to ask him what those procedures are. I\u2019m not going to call for the documents, and he is under no obligation to have brought them here. I am aware of the court\u2019s [decision to quash part A of the subpoena], I am also aware of what I am entitled to ask this man under cross-examination, direct examination having focused for a good bit of it, on the policies and procedures of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"ANs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: But he\u2019s not entitled to phrase his question as if this man is obligated to bring that stuff here today, which is what he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cThe Court: I agree with you. There\u2019s no question, [defense counsel], that you can ask him all about the procedures in the building department.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And I can ask him whether yesterday, before [3 p.m.], he was looking for those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201cThe Court: I think you can ask that, too. But I think that it is unfair, it\u2019s prejudicial in my mind to the jury, to bring up a subpoena which I\u2019ve ruled on.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I will not ask that question, Your Honor.

As we have explained, the defendant has provided no persuasive argument to support her contention. We note, moreover, that the record is devoid of any evidence to suggest that the department had any such procedures or policies; indeed, the evidence bearing on that question quite clearly is to the contrary.

I continue to adhere to my dissent in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 745 A.2d 800 (2000). In that case, I would have ordered a new trial upon a finding that the trial court improperly quashed the defendant\u2019s subpoena seeking highly relevant written building permit procedures and guidelines. The majority, to the contrary, ordered a further hearing before the trial court, which was held in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The majority now holds that the quashing of the subpoena was harmless because the defendant, Rita DeCaro, did not dispute receiving the requested material from the senior assistant state\u2019s attorney (state\u2019s attorney). I disagree because there is a real difference between obtaining all of the town\u2019s documents on the subject directly from the town building supervisor by subpoena and acquiring from the state\u2019s attorney all of the documents that, upon the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s request, the town gave to the state\u2019s attorney. Simply because the state\u2019s attorney gave the defendant all of the documents that the state\u2019s attorney had received does not mean that the town necessarily turned over everything it had. Defense counsel stated to the trial court in 2001 that the documents made available to the defendant \u201cseemed to be in compliance,\u201d and that he had \u201cno factual basis on which to dispute\u201d the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s representation and therefore accepted it. Defense counsel also stated, however, that he did not know whether he \u201cdid\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d receive all of the information. Because the defendant did not refute the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations regarding the subpoenaed documents, the court found that there was full compliance with the subpoena. This was not a reasonable finding as the defendant could not dispute the town\u2019s full compliance without a subpoena and cross-examination of town officials. The defendant faced a \u201cCatch-22\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from which there was no escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Donald Miklus, the town controller, testified before the jury that there had been adequate cash and check management controls in place. The defendant nevertheless was restricted from asking Stephen Smith, the defendant\u2019s supervisor, before the jury whether he, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>response to the subpoena, had searched for and found any written building procedures or guidelines regarding the handling of cash. Thus, no evidence was presented to the jury from the witness under subpoena to produce such records to show that no such written procedures or guidelines existed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smith testified before the jury only that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any written policies or procedures, thus giving an equivocal answer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Documents that are not produced when required by subpoena would be, of course, the strongest evidence of their nonexistence. I would conclude that the defendant was entitled to present such testimony and was prejudiced because she could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It cannot be claimed that disclosure by the state is a bar to a subpoena seeking the material to be presented to the jury. I would conclude that the sixth amendment guarantee of the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in a criminal defendant\u2019s favor was not met by such disclosure of documents obtained from a secondary source not subject to the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">I would finally conclude that the restrictions on compulsory process deprived the defendant of testimony from witnesses that plausibly would have been material and favorable to her defense. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 868, 102 S. Ct. 3440, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1193 (1982). Accordingly, I would order a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> Catch-22 is defined as \u201c[a] situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or conditions . . . .\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th Ed. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> Defense counsel stated at the 2001 hearing that there were no such procedures or guidelines in the disclosed material, and the court stated that it would have to \u201cbother\u201d the state\u2019s attorney about that, after which the state\u2019s attorney did not reply or dispute defense counsel\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\"> See footnote 11 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
