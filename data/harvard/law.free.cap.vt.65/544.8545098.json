L., as amended by section 3, No. 42, Acts of 1886, made it the duty of the plaintiff\u2019s overseer to provide for the pauper\u2019s relief, she being found in that town .and in need of immediate assistance. The question is whether the plaintiff has a legal claim upon the defendant for the expenditure.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The evidence introduced by the plaintiff, that when the pauper was taken to that town under the contracts mentioned she and her father\u2019s family were being supported by the defendant, tended to show that her actual residence was in the latter town, and that she was in Leicester by the defendant\u2019s procurement by virtue of the contracts made for its benefit. These facts, if established, would have shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the pauper transient in Leicester, while her relation to Brandon would have remained the same as if she had' not been removed therefrom. In legal contemplation her actual residence was in Brandon while she was transient in Leicester. <em>Barnet </em>v. Ray, 33 Vt. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The word \u201c resides,\u201d as amended into section 2,818, R. L. by section 4, Acts of 1886, does not mean the same as \u201c residence,\u201d as defined by section 13 of that act. It means an actual residing and not a legal three years\u2019 residence. As this pauper was <em>non com-fios </em>no question as to a legal residence under section 13 arises. We think the court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>yudgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-7\">Start, J. dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
