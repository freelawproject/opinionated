For those two half years it'had treated its entire system as one railroad, computed and paid taxes to the State upon that theory, and charged the Rutland company with that proportion of the entire. tax paid which the length of its line bore to the length of the-entire system of the Central Vermont. By this method of computation the gross amount of taxes paid to the State was decreased, but the amount charged to the Rutland company was increased.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">The petitioner contended that the Central Vermont com-panjr could only pay taxes for it, in accordance with the provisions of .the act of 1882, upon the gross receipts accruing upon the line of its railroads, and that it could not, under the mandate of the supreme court, deduct from the rent due a greater sum than the taxes would amount to, if so computed, upon its own gross receipts. The chancellor so decreed, and from his decree in that respect the Central Vermont company appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-6\"><em>B. F.

According to that act the petitioner was in equity bound to pay the tax computed upon its own gross receipts, but was not bound to pay any portion of the taxes computed upon the gross receipts of the Central Vermont company. The chancellor decreed that the petitionee should only be allowed for taxes upon the actual gross receipts of the railroads of the petitionee, and that decree should be affirmed. <em>Rutland R. R.

It related to the imposition of taxes under a legislative act approved November 28, 1882, entitled \u201cAn act to provide revenue for the payment of State expenses,\u201d and it was adjudged that the petitionee was entitled to apply as payments in extinguishment of rent due from it to the petitioner, all taxes paid by it to the State, upon the petitioner\u2019s account in accordance with the provisions of said act. The taxes imposed by the act were upon the gross earnings of railroads. The petitionee was in possession of various roads, two of which belonged to the petitioner, and the taxes upon the two roads were properly assessed to the petitionee as the lessee in possession of them. The petitionee paid the taxes as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>sessed upon all the roads in its possession, and charged the petitioner a proportion thereof, determined by the mileage of the respective roads. The sum so paid and charged was in excess of what it paid as a tax upon the actual gross receipts derived from the business done upon the petitioner\u2019s roads. The amount of the tax upon the actual gross receipts of the Rutland and Addison roads was all that the petitionee paid upon the petitioner\u2019s account, in accordance with the provisions of the act of 1882, and that is all that the peti-tionee can apply in payment of rent for the time in question. This sum was allowed the petitionee by the decree appealed from, which was strictly in accordance with the mandate, and the same is</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">\n<em>Affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-4\">Start and Thompson, JJ., did not sit, having been of counsel.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
