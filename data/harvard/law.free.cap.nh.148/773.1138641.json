Moreau Companies, Inc. (the developer). The court held that RSA 674:39 (1996) barred the imposition of these impact fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The following facts were found by the trial court or are uncontested in the record. The developer owns lots in two subdivisions in the Town of Litchfield: the Sawmill Reserve and Brookview Place subdivisions. On October 5,1999, the town\u2019s planning board approved plans for the Sawmill Reserve subdivision. This approval was recorded on October 13, 1999. On August 1, 2000, the planning board approved the plans for the Brookview Place subdivision. This approval was recorded on August 17,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The town imposes impact fees on new developments. The purpose of the fees is to provide funding to offset the increased demand on municipal facilities and schools caused by such development. Under the town ordinances, impact fee schedules can be reviewed and revised periodically by the town\u2019s planning board, subject to the approval of the town\u2019s board of selectmen. The town\u2019s original impact fee schedule was set at about $0.91 per square foot of living area. On March 14, 2000, the town \u00bfmended its ordinances by authorizing the planning board to modify its method of calculating impact fees. Under this authority, the planning board met on August 22, 2000, and adopted a new impact fee schedule set at $3,801 per square foot of living area, more than four times the original fee. The town\u2019s board of selectmen approved the new schedule on August 28, 2000, effective immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">When the developer subsequently applied for building permits for its lots, the town required it to pay impact fees under the new schedule. The developer did so, but then appealed to the planning board, challenging the imposition of the higher fees. The developer argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that RSA 674:39 prevented application of the new impact fee schedule because the planning board had adopted it after the approval and recording of the developer\u2019s subdivision plans. The planning board rejected this argument and ruled that the developer was subject to the new fee schedule. The developer appealed to superior court, <em>see </em>RSA 677:15 (Supp. 2002), which reversed the planning board and held that the town was statutorily barred from imposing the new fee. The town appeals this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u2018We will affirm the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are unsupported by the evidence, and will affirm the trial court\u2019s legal rulings unless they are erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Morgenstern v. Town of Rye, </em>147 N.H. 558, 561 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>RSA 674:39 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-3\">Every plat or site plan approved by the planning board and properly recorded in the registry of deeds shall be exempt from all subsequent changes in subdivision regulations, site plan review regulations, and zoning ordinances adopted by any city, town, or county ... except those regulations and ordinances which expressly protect public health standards, such as water quality and sewage treatment requirements, for a period of 4 years after the date of the recording... provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-4\">I. Active and substantial development or building has begun on the site by the owner or the owner\u2019s successor in interest in accordance with the approved plat within 12 months after the date of approval____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The statute allows developers to rely upon the status quo of a municipality\u2019s zoning ordinances, even before they complete substantial construction on their projects. <em>See AWL Power v. City of Rochester, </em>148 N.H. 603 (2002). Thus, if a developer begins \u201cactive or substantial development or building\u201d on its project within twelve months of approval, the developer obtains a four-year exemption from any zoning ordinances passed after its site plan\u2019s approval and recording, subject only to the exceptions provided in the statute. <em>See </em>RSA 674:39. The four-year exemption runs from the date the project\u2019s approval is recorded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In New Hampshire, a municipality\u2019s power to adopt \u201cinnovative land use controls\u201d such as impact fees derives not from a general police or taxation power, but from its statutory power to enact zoning ordinances. <em>See </em>RSA 674:16, II (Supp. 2002); RSA 674:21 (Supp. 2002). Thus, the town\u2019s revision of its impact fee schedule constituted an amendment to its zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The language of RSA 674:39 makes the revised schedule inapplicable to R.J. Moreau\u2019s approved site plans. The town, however, argues that RSA 674:39 should be limited to zoning ordinances that \u201chave the effect of prohibiting completion of development of [a developer\u2019s] lots in accordance with their approved plans.\u201d It argues that impact fees do not prohibit a project\u2019s completion and instead are merely additional costs imposed on a developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">\u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear on its face, its meaning is not subject to modification.\u201d <em>Marcotte v. Timberlane/Hampstead School Dist., </em>143 N.H. 331, 337 (1999). RSA 674:39 plainly encompasses all zoning ordinances, whether or not they will have the effect or purpose of stopping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>a developer\u2019s approved project. If the legislature wanted to exempt impact fees, it could have included them in the statutory exceptions. <em>See </em>RSA 674:39 (excepting \u201cthose regulations and ordinances which expressly protect public health standards, such as water quality and sewage treatment requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\"><em>Morgenstern v. Town of Rye, </em>relied upon by the town, does not compel a contrary result. In <em>Morgenstern, </em>we held that RSA 674:39 incorporates the common law standard that a builder must complete \u201csubstantial construction\u201d before his right to complete a project becomes permanently vested against subsequent zoning changes, and does not establish an independent statutory vesting standard. <em>Morgenstern, </em>147 N.H. at 563. The instant case, however, does not involve the vesting provision of RSA 674:39. Instead, it concerns the preliminary four-year exemption from new zoning ordinances provided in the same statute. Unlike common law vesting, the four-year exemption is temporary, purely statutory in origin, and depends upon a developer\u2019s recording of its site plan approval and \u201cactive and substantial development,\u201d rather than completion of substantial construction. <em>Compare </em>RSA 674:39 <em>with Piper v. Meredith, </em>110 N.H. 291, 299 (1970). Morgenstern\u2019s deference to a common-law standard is thus inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The town also argues that the developer had no reliance interest in the impact fee schedule because such fees cannot be assessed until a building permit is issued, after the approval of a site plan. It is clear from the record, however, that the town\u2019s impact fees are not a matter of unfettered discretion, but instead depend upon a fixed schedule based upon the living area in the developer\u2019s planned houses. Any developer would likely take the existing impact fee schedule into account when proposing its site plan. RSA 674:39 thus protects a developer\u2019s reliance upon the existing fee schedule at the time of recording the subdivision approval just as it protects reliance upon the absence of zoning ordinances that would prohibit a planned use of the property. <em>See Morgenstern, </em>147 N.H. at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Because the Sawmill Reserve subdivision was approved before both the passage of the March 14, 2000 amendment to the town\u2019s zoning ordinance and the planning board\u2019s August 22 adoption of the new ordinance, it is exempt from these changes under RSA 674:39. The town, however, argues that because the Brookview Place subdivision was approved after the March 14, 2000 amendment, though before the planning board\u2019s adoption of the new fee schedule, it is subject to the new impact fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">In essence, the town argues that because the impact fee schedule \u201cremained subject to review and revision\u201d by the planning board under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>March 14 amendment, the developer had no \u201clegitimate investment-backed expectations\u201d in the original fee schedule after its passage. A town, however, possesses the statutory authority to amend any of its zoning ordinances \u201c[f]or the purpose of promoting the health, safety, or the general welfare of the community.\u201d RSA 674:16, I. Thus, <em>every </em>zoning ordinance remains subject to constant review and revision. The effect of the statutory four-year exemption, nevertheless, is to grant a developer a reliance interest in the status quo of a municipality\u2019s zoning ordinances as they exist at the time the approval is recorded. <em>See </em>RSA 674:39.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The March amendment did not substantively change the town\u2019s impact fee schedule. Rather, it delegated authority to change the schedule to its planning board. The amendment thus did not affect the developer\u2019s statutory reliance interest in the fee schedule existing when the Brookview Place site plan approval was recorded. <em>See </em>RSA 674:39. For this reason, we affirm the superior court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b857-7\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
