Lurvey, appeals an order of the Brentwood Family Division <em>(Taube, </em>J.) increasing the amount and extending the duration of alimony due the petitioner, Jean Lurvey. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">The parties were divorced in February 1999. The divorce decree incorporated the parties\u2019 permanent stipulations and provided that the respondent would pay monthly alimony of $1,000 through June 2001. The alimony would then be reduced gradually: two years at $750 per month, followed by two years at $500 per month and two years at $250 per month, with alimony to end on June 30,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">In May 2001, the petitioner sought to increase the alimony award. She argued that increases in her rent and the cost of medical supplies required by her Crohn\u2019s disease, along with the limited increase in her teaching salary, had forced her into debt. She also argued that the respondent\u2019s financial situation had substantially improved as shown by the fact that he had been able to purchase a lakefront home and travel extensively. The trial court adopted the petitioner\u2019s proposed findings of fact and rulings of law, and ordered an increase in alimony to $1,000 per month for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">The trial court\u2019s order notes that the petitioner\u2019s income failed to keep pace with the planned reductions in alimony. The trial court found that the petitioner\u2019s Crohn\u2019s disease persisted with greater costs and more inconvenience than anticipated. The trial court further found that the petitioner\u2019s capacity to earn was compromised by Crohn\u2019s disease after the divorce. At the modification hearing, however, the petitioner\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>represented that the petitioner\u2019s medical condition \u201chas not changed except that she is going back to her doctor\u2019s again to be monitored so that she will not become sick again as she has been in the past. She does not have any surgeries currently scheduled ... [; the surgeries occurred] ... prior to the divorce, and for a few years before the divorce.\u201d The record does not reveal the symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease or its effect upon the petitioner\u2019s capacity to earn. Furthermore, the petitioner\u2019s financial affidavits indicate an increase in medical expenses from seventy dollars a month in 1999 to eighty-six dollars a month in 2001. The record does not indicate that the disease affected her ability to receive a master\u2019s degree, prepare lesson plans or take courses in order to remain accredited as a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The trial court found that the petitioner\u2019s salary increased from $30,625 at the time of the divorce to $34,908 and that her necessary living expenses have increased from $3,483 a month to $4,231. The petitioner also decided not to supplement her teacher\u2019s salary with summer employment, as she had done before the divorce. She replaced her 1988 Toyota with a 1997 Honda Accord, thereby incurring the monthly expense of a car payment. This purchase, however, occurred in January 1999, the same month she agreed to the permanent stipulations. The trial court concluded that the petitioner\u2019s net income did not keep pace with the planned reductions in alimony and \u201cthis was a substantial and unforeseen result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On appeal, the respondent raises three issues: (1) whether the trial court adopted the wrong standard when reviewing the petition to modify the alimony award; (2) whether the evidence did not support the trial court\u2019s factual findings because the petitioner\u2019s changed circumstances were voluntary and foreseeable; and (3) whether the trial court erred in ordering indefinite alimony because the respondent has few retirement assets. Because we agree with the respondent on the first issue, we do not address the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We recognize that the trial court has broad discretion in ordering the initial alimony award and we will uphold the award absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>In the Matter of Fowler and Fowler, </em>145 N.H. 516, 519 (2000); <em>see also State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). \u201cWe sustain the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Fowler, </em>145 N.H. at 519 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The trial court adopted the petitioner\u2019s requested rulings of law, including the standard that \u201c[t]o obtain a modification of an alimony award, a change in circumstances of the parties must be shown which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>make the continuance of the original provisions \u2018improper and unfair.\u2019 <em>Noddin v. Noddin, </em>123 N.H. 73, 76 (1983).\u201d We agree with the respondent that <em>Noddin </em>does not fully articulate the standard for modification of an alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In <em>Laflamme v. Laflamme, </em>144 N.H. 524, 527 (1999), we held that a trial court cannot modify an award unless the petitioner shows \u201cthat a substantial change in circumstances has arisen since the initial award, making the current support amount either improper or unfair.\u201d <em>Laflamme </em>further explained that \u201c[c]hanges to a party\u2019s condition that are both anticipated and foreseeable at the time of the decree cannot rise to the level of a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of an alimony award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528-29. There is no reference to <em>Laflamme </em>in the petitioner\u2019s rulings adopted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">As noted above, the trial court found that the failure of the petitioner\u2019s income to keep pace with the reductions in alimony was \u201ca substantial and unforeseen result.\u201d However, the trial court did not find, as required by <em>Laflamme, </em>that there had been a substantial change in circumstances that was neither anticipated nor foreseeable at the time of the divorce decree which led to this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We therefore vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-8\">Brock, C.
