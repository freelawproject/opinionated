The plaintiff has failed to increase the security as required and now sues out a writ of error to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>review the order requiring it. The court below, being of the opinion that the existing security was insufficient, was certainly justified in increasing it. Its action was in no sense final, but was purely discretionary, and intended only to give the defendant additional security covering the fees and costs incurred by it subsequent to the order of March 4, 1911. Such an order is not reviewable on writ of error. Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, 106 U. S. 3, 1 Sup. Ct. 15, 27 L. Ed. 73; Leitensdorfer v. Webb, 20 How. 176, 15 L. Ed. 891; Atlantic Lumber Co. v. L.
