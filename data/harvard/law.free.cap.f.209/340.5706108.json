Appellant, complainant below, alleged complete performance on his part, tendered a deed to the land, and demanded judgment for the purchase price of $10,000. An amendment'to the bill, filed June 29, 1912, set forth the contract as embodied in correspondence filed as exhibits and lettered from <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>to \u201cY,\u201d inclusive. To the bill, as thus amended, the defendant interposed a demurrer, the material specifications of which are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">\u201c(3) That said amended bill shows that no contract for the purchase and sale of the property described therein ever existed between the plaintiff and defendant, and that if any ever did exist, or was ever entered into, between the parties, it is so vague, uncertain, and ambiguous as not to be capable of specific execution through a decree of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">\u201c(4) Said amended bill fails to allege the time of performance of said alleged contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">\"(5) Said bill upon its face shows that the complainant has a complete and adequate remedy at law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">The demurrer was sustained, and the bill dismissed; and from this action of the trial court complainant prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">That part of the correspondence disclosing the contract declared upon may be said to consist of Exhibits A to I, inclusive, which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">Exhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">\u201cNovember 25th, 09.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-20\">\u201cMessrs.

Also advise me as to whether an arrangement could be made with him for surface rights on the Carbonate Lode of this group. I own the Indiana Group at the top of the mountain and if I could make proper arrangements I would be tempted to drive a tunnel from near the railroad to cut the Indiana vein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-19\">\u201cVery truly yours, Thos.

Two or three years ago, when Mr. McClurg was approached upon the subject, he intimated that he would be willing to accept $25,000, but we have no doubt that if the property is not, by reason of lack of development or for other reasons, in condition to justify such a high valuation, he will be glad to consider an offer of a lower, sum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-23\">\u201cWe should be very glad indeed if you would make us a proposition and upon receiving same, we will promptly submit it to M. McClurg, and if the amount you offer does not seem entirely below reason, we have no doubt that he will give 'the same his careful attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-24\">\u201cYours very truly, Rogers, Ellis <em>&amp; </em>Johnson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-25\">\u201cJHS\u2014H\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-26\">Exhibit D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-27\">\u201cDenver, Colorado, December 8,1909.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-28\">\u201cRogers, Ellis <em>&amp; </em>Johnson, Denver, Colorado\u2014Gentlemen: Your letter of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-29\">the 7th just received. You might offer for me to Mr. McClurg $10,000.00 for the claims at Red Mountain. There is absolutely nothing there at this time to justify even that price, but as I wrote you in my former letter it is my purpose, if I can properly arrange matters, to drive, a tunnel from the foot of the mountain cutting through the property owned by Mr. McClurg and two claims (laying) beyond him and between my property and his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-30\">\u201cNothing can be done up there until about May 1st in any event, but I would like to conclude the negotiations and know where I stand, because if I do not succeed in getting the properties I will abandon the idea of driving the tunnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-31\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-32\">Thos.

Roger, Ellis &amp; Johnson, Denver, Colorado\u2014Gentlemen: Yours of the 9th with reference to the Ogden T. McClurg property received. I meant the Jay Eye See group of claims at the foot of the mountain. However, if Mr. McClurg is wise he will be like the Kansas homesteader who was deeding his property and discovered that the man to whom he was deeding it could not read. Instead of deeding him eighty acres as agreed, he put in the whole- 160 acres, so I think it would be money in Mr; McGlurg\u2019s pocket to deed all of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">\u201cVery truly yours, Thos.

My friend advises me definitely and beyond question and assures me that I can make you this definite promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-27\">\u201cVery truly yours, Thos. B. Crawford.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We think these letters make a complete, binding, and enforceable written contract for the sale of the real estate. The laws of Colorado relating to the sale of realty provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">\u201cEvery contract for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of any lands or any interest in lands, shall be void, unless the contract, or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consideration, be in writing, and be subscribed by the party by whom the lease or sale is to be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cEvery instrument required to be subscribed by any party under the last preceding section, may be subscribed by the agent of such party, lawfully authorized by writing.\u201d Rev. St. of Colorado, 1908, \u00a7\u00a7 2662, 2663.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Messrs. Rogers, Ellis &amp; Johnson, whose names are subscribed to the letters addressed to Messrs. York &amp; Rathnell, and to the defendant, are alleged to be the duly authorized agents of complainant. The contract, which the parties have made, may be gathered from letters which have passed in correspondence between them. It is not necessary that every paper should contain all the necessary elements of the contract, which may be authenticated and established through the medium of letters and separate writings and documents provided they refer to each other and to the same persons and things, and manifestly relate to the same contract and transaction. Beckwith v. Talbot, 2 Colo. 639; s. c., 95 U. S. 289, 24 L. Ed. 496; Crystal Palace Flouring Co. v. Butterfield, 15 Colo. App. 246, 61 Pac. 479; Brown on Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 346b; Wood on Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 345, p. 645. It is held that the recitals of the contract should disclose the following essentials : (1)_ The names of the parties, vendor and vendee; (2) the terms and conditions of the contract;, (3) the interest or property affected; (4) the consideration to be paid therefor. It is apparent that all these elements clearly appear in the quoted correspondence embodying the contract. The letters are neither vague, uncertain, nor ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In the absence of special provision respecting the payment of the purchase price, the law presumes that it is to be paid in cash at the close of the transaction; that is to say, within any reasonable time when demanded by the seller. The remaining letters filed as exhibits need not be considered here; they consist, in the main, of repeated insistence on the part of appellant that the transaction be closed by the payment of the purchase price, and repeated plausible explanations and excuses for delay on the part of appellee. Nothing in them can be construed as tendering or accepting any material modification of or departure from the previously completed contract. Additional time was repeatedly requested by appellee, and granted by appellant. Having invited, for his own accommodation, the delay which resulted, appellee cannot evoke therefrom the defense of laches amounting to waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The contention that the bill will not lie, because it shows upon its face that complainant has a complete and adequate remedy at law, cannot be sustained. The vendor had a right to come into a court of equity to enforce specific performance. Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264-278, 8 L. Ed. 120; Raymond v. San Gabriel Land &amp; Water Co. (C. C. A.) 53 Fed. 883-885, 4 C. C. A. 89; Nelson v. Husted et al. (C. C.) 182 Fed. 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Our conclusion is that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the bill. The decree must be reversed, and the pause remanded, 'with directions that the demurrer he overruled, and that further proceedings be taken in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
