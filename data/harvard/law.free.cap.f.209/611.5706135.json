C. C. La. art. 3536), affects the remedy primarily; and while it may extinguish the right in Louisiana at the expiration of one year, it is not applicable in the courts of another state, to which the injured party has lawfully removed while the right of action in Louisiana subsisted. For authorities, see 25 Cyc. 1020, 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
