See Powell v. Leavitt, 150 Fed. 89, 80 C. C. A. 43; Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, 197 U. S. 356, 25 Sup. Ct. 443, 49 L. Ed. 790; Page v. Rogers, 211 U. S. 575, 29 Sup. Ct. 159, 53 L. Ed. 332,</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">The decree appealed from is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with instructions to allow the appellant to prove as presented his unsecured debt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
