T. Dooling, Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-12\">Writs of error by David C. Norcross and the Western Fuel Company to review a judgment adjudging said Norcross guilty of contempt, for disobedience of a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to produce books of the fuel company before the grand jury.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AUt\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-13\">The following is the statement of facts and opinion of Dooling, District Judge, in the trial court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-14\">A subpoena duces tecum having been issued by the clerk of the court directed to D. C. Norcross, secretary of the Western Fuel Company, a corporation, and to the company itself, requiring the production before the grand jury of practically all of the books and records of the company which would show the amount of coal imported by it, and the amount sold by it and to whom, the said Norcross, for himself and for said company appeared before the grand jury, and refused to produce the books and documents called for, basing his refusal upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-15\">1. That said subpoena had been issued irregularly and without authority, in that no order of court was ever made directing it to issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-16\">2. That no proceeding or charge was pending before said grand jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-17\">3. That said subpoena did not state that there was any charge, matter, or proceeding pending before said grand jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-18\">4. That certain officers of the said company were under indictment, the date set for their trial was almost at hand, and they needed the books and documents in the preparation of their defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-19\">5. That the books and documents were not desired by the grand jury in any investigation, which it was then pursuing, but were desired by the assistants to the Attorney General for the purpose of securing evidence against the in-dieted officials in support of the indictments already found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-20\">6. That the subpoena was of such a sweeping character as to amount to an unreasonable search and seizure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The fact of such refusal having been presented to the court, by the grand jury, and a citation having issued directed to said Norcross and said company to show cause why thej should not be punished for contempt, the foregoing reasons were by them hrged in court in response to such citation, and the matter submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\">The court thereafter rendered the following decision upon the questions involved :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">In this matter my conclusions, briefly stated, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">1. No order of court is required, either by statute or by the practice in this, district as a prerequisite to the valid issuance by the clerk of a subpoena duces tecum to compel the attendance of a witness before the grand jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">2. No formal or other charge need be pending before the grand jury to warrant the examination of witnesses by such grand jury. But the grand jury has the power and it is its duty to conduct investigations, either upon its own motion, or upon the initiative of the United States attorney, to ascertain whether a crime cognizable by the court has been committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">3. This power should not be used for the purpose of' securing evidence against defendants under indictment in support of the indictments already found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">4. If the grand jury so desire, it may decline to proceed unless informed by the United States attorney of the purpose for which a witness has been called; but, if the jury be content to let the attorney develop the matter from the witnesses as they are called without being previously advised as to the purpose in view or the matter to he investigated, the witness is in no way injured thereby and may not refuse to answer because of such fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\">5. A witness before the grand jury may properly decline to answer any question, the answer to which would have a tendency to convict Mm of a felony; hut it would seriously affect the efficiency of the jury, and cripple its power of investigating offenses, to hold that each witness may decline to answer until informed of the purpose of the investigation and the name of the individual against whom information is sought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-11\">6. In the present case the presentments state that respondent D. O. Nor-cross, as secretary of the Western- Fuel Company, a corporation, was duly-sworn by the foreman \u00f3f the grand jury to testify as a witness in an investigation then being pursued by said grand jury concerning certain frauds alleged to have been perpetrated and committed by said Wesd-rn Fuel Company against the United States. And the assistant to the Attorney General in open court made the following statements: \u201cIiut I will state in good faith to counsel that there are other parties involved in these frauds who have not yet been indicted. And I will state that it is the intention of the government to ascertain to what extent these other parties have been involved, and if their action is criminal then the government will take such course as it deems proper in the premises.\u201d This statement of counsel, while not under oath, may, it seems to me. be considered by the court in passing upon the good faith of the assistants to the Attorney General and of the grand jury in calling the witness Norcross and in demanding the documents called for by the subpoena. And while the court would not come to the assistance of the grand jury if it appeared that its purpose was only to secure evidence against defendants already indicted, it should assist the grand jury in every way to discover other offenders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-12\"><em>7. </em>Therefore the only serious question which presents itself is as to whether the subpoena which respondents have refused to obey is too sweeping in its demands. It is quite true that its requirements are very broad, but it seems to me that the power of the grand jury must be commensurate with the requirements of the matter under investigation. And I am not prepared to say that the documents desired are not essential for the purpose for which they are sought; that is, an investigation as to the complicity of others in frauds alleged to have been committed against the United States. That the documents are numerous, and their production would be inconvenient, cannot be urged as a reason for refusing to produce them, if they be essential to the investigation proposed, and are sought in good faith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-13\">8. My conclusion is that under the principles laid down in Hale v. Henkel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>201 U. S. 43, 26 Sup. Ct. 370, 50 L. Ed. 652, Wilson v. U.

Cas. 1912D, 558, and later cases following them, the respondents should be required by the court to produce before the grand jury the documents as commanded by the subpoena duces tecum, and that a failure to do so should be punished as a contempt of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">Such will be the order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-5\">Samuel Knight and Stanley Moore, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant and plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-6\">Matthew I.

All of them depend upon the same facts, concerning which there is no substantial dispute; indeed, most of the facts are expressly agreed to. Norcross was at the times mentioned in the record, and still is, secretary of the Western Fuel Company, a corporation, and as such was and is in possession of all of the records, books, and papers of that company which were not destroyed by the great fire in San Francisco of April 18, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The record shows that at the November, 1912, term of the court below, two indictments were presented and filed against certain named individuals charging them with having entered into a certain conspiracy with divers other persons whose names were unknown to the grand jurors, \u201cunder the guise and name\u201d of the said Western Fuel Company, to defraud the United States out of a large part of the import duties on coal imported and brought into this country by the fuel company directly and through other persons, firms, and corporations, by making and causing to be made false weights and false and fraudulent returns of weights of such importations, and in various other ways specifically set out in the indictments, the first of which charged the conspiracy to have been formed on the 1st day of January, 1904, the second charged it to have been formed on the 1st day of April, 1906, and a third and last indictment against the same defendants charged, in a somewhat altered form, the same conspiracy, alleging it to have been formed on the 1st day of April, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">It appears from the record that the trial of the defendants on one' of the indictments was first set for August 26, 1913, which time of trial was subsequently several times postponed, and that on the 14th day of August, 1913, the government\u2019s attorney procured to be issued out of the trial court a subpoena duces tecum in the words and figures following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\"><em>\u201cThe </em>President of the United States of America, to D.

B. Maling, Clerk,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">\u201cBy Lyle S. Morris, Deputy Clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">It will be observed that the subpoena did not contain the usual ad testificandum clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">The record shows that pursuant to the subpoena Norcross appeared before the grand jury at the time specified therein, and then and there read the following paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\u201cI have been instructed by counsel that I am not obliged under this subpoena to testify before the grand jury or to produce the books and papers of the Western Fuel Company, accordingly, and without any disrespect to the grand jury, I must decline to testify further or to produce the books and papers until the court has passed upon the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Such refusal having been duly reported to the court by the grand jury, Norcross was cited to show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt of court, and in response to that citation appeared with counsel, and, the matter having been duly heard upon evidence, the court entered an order directing him, as secretary of the corporation mentioned, to produce before the said grand jury at a designated time and place the books, papers, records, vouchers, and documents described and referred to in the subpoena and so in his possession and under his control, and, the said Norcross having failed and refused to comply with the said last-mentioned order,- the matter was again brought before the court, and, having been heard upon a practical agreement in respect to the facts, the court adjudged him guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment until he should conform to the requirements of the subpoena, from which judgment the present appeal comes; and upon stipulation of the respective parties the writs of error are made to depend upon the disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">The record shows, among other things, that at the last hearing mentioned it was agreed between counsel that at the time Norcross was by the subpoena required to appear there were no proceedings pending before the grand jury against any of the defendants to the indictments looking to their further indictment, nor was there any statement made by the government\u2019s attorney to the grand jury to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">\u201cTbe government desired the grand jury-to take up or consider an investigation having in view the presentation of further indictments as against these defendants or any other individuals connected with the Western Fuel Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">Upon careful consideration, we are of the opinion that the case is ruled by the decisions of the Supreme Court in the cases of Wilson v. United States, 221 U. S. 361, 31 Sup. Ct. 538, 55 L. Ed. <em>771, </em>Ann. Cas. 1912D, 558; Warren B. Wheeler v. United States (No. 658); Stillman Shaw v. United States (No. 659); Warren B.
