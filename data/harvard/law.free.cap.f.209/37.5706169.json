The trade-mark-was registered June 26, 1908, No. 54,282, being described as \u201cthe word \u2018Ideal' \u201d shown in script, appropriated to brushes; the particular class of brushes to which it is appropriated being stated to he hairbrushes. It was registered by Henry D. Hughes, his application stating that \u201cthis trade-mark has been continuously used in his business since December 21, 1886.\u201d This business, as the testimony showed, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>conducted 'originally by predecessors of Hughes to whose rights he succeeded. The defendant is selling agent in this country of the successors of the original house of Mason Pearson located in England, which manufactures hairbrushes and has sold them here under the name \u201cIdeal.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ab-\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-4\">The opinion of Judge Ray will be found in 205 Fed. 302,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-5\">J.

In this opinion, unless otherwise indicated the word \u201cPearson\u201d will be used as including the' original Pearson and his successors and the word \u201cHughes\u201d will be used as including complainant\u2019s predecessors in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">On December 21, 1886, Pearson obtained United States Letters Patent, No. 345,583, for a single bristle rubber cushion \u201chair or other brush.\u201d He had already taken out an English patent for the same device, so that his American patent expired, probably, in 1899. Heat once began the manufacture and sale of hairbrushes made in conformity to the patent, in England, under the name \u201cVery.\u201d In 1888 one Reid and some other of Hughes\u2019 predecessors undertook the selling of like brushes in this country. Reid had talked with Pearson about the matter and an arrangement was entered into whereby Pearson was to sell his brushes, in the United States,'solely to Reid and his associates. It was decided that the brushes sold here should be called \u201cIdeal\u201d and it is a controverted question of fact, who selected that name. Complainant\u2019s evidence tends to show that was one of his predecessors. The widow of the original Pearson testified that her husband suggested it to Reid. We do not find her recollection of a conversation listened to many years before she testified especially persuasive; it appears that, whoever suggested the word, it was adopted by Reid and his associates and the first die for stamping on the handle was made here and sent to Pearson. Subsequently another die\u2014containing the word \u201cEngland,\u201d in compliance with Custom House requirements\u2014was made in England. Hughes\u2019 predecessors apparently were not the mere consignees or agents of Pearson; they bought the brushes outright and resold them here as a business of their own and they had exclusive license for sale of the same in this country. Without rehearsing the evidence we concur with Judge Ray that the word \u201cIdeal\u201d was used and understood in this country as indicating brushes sold by Plughes and his predecessors, not as brushes made exclusively by Pearson. Application for a registered trade-mark, therefore, accompanied by declaration that it had been used ten years in his business, was properly made by Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We \u00e1re satisfied that the word \u201cIdeal\u201d so applied to a brush is not descriptive and therefore was entitled to registration as a trademark. But even if. it were descriptive, it was in use for ten years prior to the passage of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905. It would therefore be entitled to registration under our decision in Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, 178 Fed. 801, 102 C. C. A. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">. [3] A technical objection is raised to the validity of the registration on .the ground that it does not appear that the applicant made oath to the actual use of the mark as a trade-mark. Neither does it appear that he did not make such oath. The certificate of. the office is sufficient prima facie to indicate compliance with all its regulations; the burden of showing noncompliance is on the person asserting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Defendant contends that in 1906 the word \u201cIdeal\u201d could not have been appropriated by any one as a trade-mark for the reason that it had been so associated with the patented article as to become the \u201cgeneric name\u201d of the patented article, so that persons wishing to buy a brush constructed in conformity to the specifications pf the patent would express their wish by asldng for the \u201cIdeal.\u201d This contention is based on Singer v. June, 163 U. S. 169, 16 Sup. Ct. 1002, 41 L. Ed. 118, and similar cases. The difficulty with it, however, is that the facts are different from those in the Singer Case. The only use of the word \u201cIdeal\u201d was specific, not generic; it was applied to a hairbrush of a particular shape and of a particular grade sold by Hughes\u2019 predecessors. Irrespective of what happened in England, the testimony shows that during the life of the patent Hughes himself sold here a cheaper grade of the patented brush under the mark-\u201cHughes,\u201d also another variety of the patented brush, known as military brushes, which were not stamped \u201cIdeal.\u201d Brushes in shape exactly like the \u201cIdeal\u201d and \u201cHughes,\u201d manufactured by Pearson and marked \u201cVery,\u201d 'were sold in England, sent over here by the purchaser, and sold in this market as \u201cVery\u201d brushes. Customers who knew and liked the \u201cHughes\u201d brush, or the \u201cVery\u201d brush, and who wished to purchase another, would presumably ask for it by the only name they knew, \u201cHughes\u201d or \u201cVery.\u201d Purchasers of military brushes would ask for them in some way which would indicate that they wanted such brushes made in accordance with the patent like those they had bought before. Certainly these purchasers would not ask for \u201cIdeal,\u201d although it was a brush having the features of the patent, which they wanted. Under these circumstances we do not see how it can be found that, during the life of the patent the name \u201cIdeal\u201d became the \u201cidentifying and generic name of the thing patented.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On all other points covered by his opinion we concur generally with Judge Ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The decree is affirmed, with costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
