In the event the appeal is so docketed, this stay is to remain in effect pending this Court\u2019s ruling on the jurisdictional aspect of the case. Should the Court summarily affirm the judgment or dismiss the appeal, this stay shall automatically expire. In the event the Court notes probable jurisdiction or postpones consideration of the jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits, this stay is to remain in effect pending issuance of the judgment of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Issuance of this stay in no way represents an adjudication that this Court has jurisdiction of an appeal from the order of the United States District Court hereby stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">[For earlier order herein, see 389 U.
