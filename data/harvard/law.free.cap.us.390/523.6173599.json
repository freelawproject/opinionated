After the California Supreme Court returned to petitioner unfiled his petition for hearing in that court, with the notation that it was not timely, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court. The District Court issued the writ, holding that the prosecutor\u2019s comment on the failure of petitioner to testify at his trial, made in violation of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U. S. 609, was not harmless error. The State appealed. One week after oral argument, our decision in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18, was handed down. Applying the <em>Chapman </em>standard, the majority of the Court of Appeals concluded that the <em>Griffin </em>error was harmless \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>379 F. 2d 330, 335. Judge Ely dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">We agree with Judge Ely that comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify cannot be labeled harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>error in a case where such comment is extensive, where an inference of guilt from silence is stressed to the jury as a basis of conviction, and where there is evidence that could have supported acquittal. We find this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The bookkeeper for a trucking firm had written a $196 payroll check to employee Michael Pittman and had placed it in the firm\u2019s office. The check disappeared at a time either shortly before or after petitioner was in the firm\u2019s office asking for a job. Two days later petitioner had possession of the check and asked gasoline station operator Kernen to cash it for him. According to Kernen, petitioner told him he had been working for the trucking firm and it was his payroll check. Kernen was acquainted with petitioner, knew him as Willy, and knew he was the brother of Jim Anderson, who had a charge account with Kernen. Kernen told petitioner he did not have enough money on hand to cash the $196 check, but they agreed to apply $112 to Jim Anderson\u2019s account, with petitioner taking $84. According to Kernen\u2019s testimony, petitioner then borrowed a pen from him and endorsed the name Michael Pittman on the check. When the check was returned to Kernen by the bank, he met with police and identified petitioner from a police \"mug shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The arresting officer testified that he asked petitioner about the incident and that petitioner admitted cashing the check but denied he endorsed it. Petitioner told the officer he was in a bar when an unknown person came up to him and said he wanted to cash a check. Petitioner took it to the service station and substituted $112 he had on his person for the amount withheld by Kernen.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Petitioner did not testify and presented no evidence. The trial court instructed the jury on inferences to be drawn from petitioner\u2019s silence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cAs to any evidence or facts against him which the defendant can reasonably be expected to deny or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>explain because of facts within his knowledge, if he does not testify . . . the jury may take that failure into consideration as tending to indicate the truth of such evidence and as indicating that among the inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom, those unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">It is conceded that those instructions violated <em>Griffin. </em>It is also conceded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> violated <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">While the evidence against petitioner was sufficient to convict, the facts that petitioner allegedly forged the name Michael Pittman in the presence of an acquaintance of petitioner\u2019s who knew him as Willy, the brother of Jim Anderson, that petitioner allegedly chose to cash a worthless check at a place where he was known and openly agreed to have the major portion of the proceeds applied to his brother\u2019s account and yet, after all this, did not flee the county could be viewed as casting doubt on the prosecution\u2019s case, perhaps on Kernen\u2019s veracity. In this posture, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s extensive argument asking the jury to overlook inferences favorable to petitioner because he invoked his constitutional right not to testify was, in the words of <em>Chapman, </em>\u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 386 U. S., at 24. Since petitioner is entitled to relief for this reason, we do not reach the other questions he seeks to raise. Nor are we persuaded by respondent\u2019s contention that petitioner\u2019s late filing of a petition for hearing in the State Supreme Court constituted a deliberate bypass of state remedies, precluding him from habeas corpus relief in federal courts. See <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U. S. 391. Cf. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>379 U. S. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-5\">Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Harlan would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</judges>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">APPENDIX TO PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The prosecutor stated in argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201cNow, one other thing the Judge will instruct you\u2014 he told you \u2014 he touched on this when we were picking the jury: The defendant, as Mr. Anderson has done, in a criminal case, he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand. That\u2019s his choice. He can take the stand if he chooses. He doesn\u2019t have to. I can\u2019t call him to the stand; the Judge can\u2019t demand that he get on the stand. That\u2019s completely up to him. He is not required to, under our law, to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">\u201cThe Judge will also instruct you that the jury may consider that, because of his failure to testify, that if he had certain facts which would be expected to be within his knowledge, that he could explain or deny certain things, that the jury may consider this. In other words, by that I mean such as in this case, Mr. Anderson could have gotten on the stand and told you, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t sign that,\u2019 or, T wasn\u2019t up to the Calverts [trucking firm] and somebody else told me about it, as I told Sergeant Sonberg [the arresting officer].\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">\u201cIn other words, you can consider that, when a person could be expected to know something about something, and he doesn\u2019t tell you what obviously he must know, why, then you can draw certain inferences from that.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">\u201cAnd, as I say, ladies and gentlemen, there is no evidence on behalf \u2014 that the defendant has put in here.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cSo, the only way we can be attacked is that we haven\u2019t proven case, we haven\u2019t made out a case because of certain suspicions or inferences or something like that, showing there was another man, or something like that. That hasn\u2019t been testified to here.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\u201cNow, you can\u2019t guess as to what Mr. Anderson would or would not have testified to if he did get on the stand, because you haven\u2019t heard it. You will have to base your decision on those documents and the people you have heard here. If you don\u2019t believe any of them, you will probably not find him guilty; but if you do believe them \u2014 there has been no contradiction, nobody has contradicted them at all \u2014 then you are only led to one conclusion, and that simply is the fact that the defendant is the one that passed that check, and is guilty here.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cRemember, you have no conflicting evidence on the other side. You either would have to disbelieve the Calverts, Michael Pittman, and Mr. Kernen and Sergeant Sonberg and the rest of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">\u201cNo one came in and said, 'No, that isn\u2019t it; he was somewhere else.\u2019 You heard nothing like that, ladies and gentlemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any evidence that has been produced to controvert it. Nobody has come in here and told you Mr. Anderson was somewhere else, or he didn\u2019t do it, or he didn\u2019t come up and get that check, and 'I didn\u2019t know anything about it, and I went in there innocently to pass it.\u2019 He didn\u2019t tell you that at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">\u201cI give him credit for not getting up on the stand and trying to tell you a lie. At least he had the ability to sit there and not say anything, rather than try to get up and tell you a whole lot of hogwash. I\u2019ll at least give him that much credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">\u201cThere is some disputed evidence that Mr. Anderson showed up with this check and passed it on Kernen on the 29th.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201cNow, if he got it some innocent way, if somebody gave it to him, that he didn\u2019t know, then he should have gotten up on the stand to tell us about it. And don\u2019t you think if that is what happened, he would have? I would; you would. You would beat a path to that stand, at least to get up there and tell them what happened. But that isn\u2019t the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\u201cNow, we don\u2019t know what Mr. Anderson\u2019s story is, because you haven\u2019t heard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\u201cThat\u2019s what he told Sergeant Sonberg, three completely phony, different versions of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201cYou didn\u2019t see him get up, you didn\u2019t hear the words from him, because he didn\u2019t get up on the stand. You don\u2019t know what his story may be today. He might have told you another story, that he was flying around up in Alaska, or something like that. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">See the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
