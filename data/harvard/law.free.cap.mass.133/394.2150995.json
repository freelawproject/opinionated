Thayer,\u201d alleging that the defendant, \u201c on the twenty-fifth day of May,\u201d 1882, at Ware, unlawfully kept intoxicating liquors, with intent unlawfully to sell the same in this Commonwealth; was dated \u201cthis twenty-fifth day of June,\u201d 1882; and was signed by \u201c Austin W. Kellogg, complainant.\u201d It was sworn to by Austin W. Kellogg; and the jurat was dated \u201c this twenty-fifth day of May,\u201d 1882. The warrant issued by the trial justice directed the officer to arrest the defendant, to answer \u201c on the foregoing complaint of Austin W. Kellogg, this day made on oath before me;\u201d and was dated \u201cthis twenty-fifth day of May,\u201d 1882. The return of the officer stated that he arrested the defendant \u201c on June 1st, 1882.\u201d The record further showed that a hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>had on the complaint before the magistrate on June 3,1882, and the defendant was adjudged guilty and sentenced; from which sentence he appealed to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">In that court, after a verdict of guilty, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment, \u201cbecause the trial justice had no lawful jurisdiction to try the defendant upon the complaint, the said complaint not having been sworn to by the proper complainant, and because it was sworn to long after the arrest and trial of this defendant on said complaint, and because this court has no jurisdiction to try said complaint on appeal.\u201d This motion was overruled; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>C. </em>Delano, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">Neither of the reasons assigned for arresting the judgment can prevail. The complaint is dated by mistake on the twenty-fifth day of June, 1882; but the dates of the jurat and of the warrant show that it was made and sworn to on the twenty-fifth day of May, 1882, thus furnishing internal and plenary evidenc\u00e9 that the complaint was duly made before the arrest and trial, and that the date of the complaint was a mere clerical error, which could not mislead the defendant. <em>Donahoe </em>v. <em>Shed, </em>8 Met. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The mistake in describing the complainant in the body of the complaint as \u201c Austin W. Thayer \u201d was also clearly a clerical one. The signature to the complaint, the jurat and the warrant show that the complainant was Austin W. Kellogg. Such a clerical error, which cannot mislead or prejudice the defendant, furnishes no reason for arresting the judgment against him. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, </em>103 Mass. 71. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>4 Gray, 36. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
