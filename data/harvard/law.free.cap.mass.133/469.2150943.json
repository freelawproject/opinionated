It appeared in evidence that, about a year before the will was executed, the testator had been prostrated by a shock of paralysis ; and it was contended by the appellants that the testator\u2019s mental incompetency was mainly occasioned by such shock. A witness called by the appellants testified that he saw the testator a short time before, and again after, the shock. For the purpose of showing the testator\u2019s mental and physical condition after the shock, and shortly before the time of the execution of the will, the appellants\u2019 counsel put to the witness the following question: \u201c What was the testator\u2019s condition and appearance, as regarding his conduct and conversation at the latter interview, as compared with his conduct and conversation at the former interview ? \u201d This question was objected to by the appellee, and excluded by the judge, in. this form, the judge stating that, though any facts observed by the witness before or after the shock might be stated, having relation to the condition of the testator, the question as proposed called for an expression of opinion and comparison of opinion, and not a comparison of facts. To this ruling the appellants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-9\"><em>E. </em>Davis, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-10\">P.

It might, and probably would, be understood by the witness as calling for his opinion as to the mental-condition of the testator. It was competent for the court to require the appellants\u2019 counsel to change the form of his question so as to avoid this ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
