Writ dated November 26, 1880. The case was- referred to an auditor, whose, report was in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\">The plaintiffs are furniture-dealers in Boston, and the defendant is the owner of a summer hotel in Maine. During- the summer of 1880, the defendant carried on the hotel, and employed one Porter as general manager and clerk, and one Tuttle as a second clerk, who was subordinate to Porter, and under his orders. The hotel was open from June 1 to September 1, 1880, and Porter was at the hotel all this time and managed it for the defendant. All the goods, which consisted of furniture, for the price of which the action is brought, were delivered: at the hotel during the summer of 1880, were suitable for the- house, and used in its equipment, and the prices charged are reasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\">Some of the goods in question were ordered by- the defendant, others by Porter, and others partly by Porter, and partly by Tuttle with the knowledge of Porter. The defendant did not contest his liability for the goods ordered by himself, but contended that he was not liable for the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-9\">The defendant visited the hotel usually each week, spending two or three days there; and, while there, he had the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>(oversight of the business, and gave directions concerning it. \u25a0Porter had no authority from the defendant to purchase any of ;the goods in question, except such as may be implied from the \u2022facts herein reported. The plaintiffs had no knowledge as to ithe scope of Porter\u2019s agency, except as herein appears. They \u2022did know, before the goods were sold, that the hotel was com \u25a0ducted in the name of Porter, and that the defendant was the \u25a0owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">Among the goods ordered by Porter were two tables which were -used in the dining-room of the hotel. The defendant was unformed, when these tables arrived, that Porter had ordered \u2022.them; -and no objection is made to his being charged for them. [The ..defendant gave no notice to the plaintiffs that Porter \u25a0had no .authority to purchase said tables. All the goods sued for, ever .since their delivery, have remained at said hotel, and .have all been .in the possession and under the control of the \u25a0defendant.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">Except-as above stated, there was no evidence that the defendant knew of said -orders by Porter and Tuttle, or of the delivery of the .goods, nmtil September 1880. In that month, bills \u25a0for all of the goods -were delivered by Porter to the defendant. 'The plaintiffs called upon the defendant for payment of their account, and the defendant was then fully informed of all the facts respecting the goods and the purchase thereof. He then told the plaintiffs that Porter had no authority to purchase the goods as his agent. [The defendant never offered to return to the plaintiffs any of said goods, and never notified or requested the plaintiffs to take any of them from said hotel.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">On these facts, the auditor reported that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the whole amount sued for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">In the Superior Court, the defendant moved to strike out, as immaterial, those parts of the auditor\u2019s report which, as printed above, are enclosed in brackets, or to recommit the report to the auditor for that purpose. This motion was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\">At the trial, before Pitman, J., the only evidence offered was the auditor\u2019s report. The defendant objected to the parts enclosed in brackets being read to the jury. The judge permitted them to be read. The defendant then requested the judge to rule that, upon the facts reported in the auditor\u2019s report, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>plaintiffs could not recover for the goods ordered by Porter, except the tables, or for those ordered partly by Porter and partly by Tuttle; and that the jury should not consider, in making up their verdict, the parts of the auditor\u2019s report enclosed in brackets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-4\">The judge refused to rule as requested; the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the full amount sued for; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-5\"><em>C. P. Weston, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-6\"><em>T. F. Nutter, </em>for the plaintiffs, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b579-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AMY\">The questions, whether Porter and Tutttle had authority to buy the goods sued for, upon the credit of the defendant, and whether, if they had not original authority, the defendant ratified their acts, were questions of fact. The parts of the auditor\u2019s report objected to were pertinent and material upon these questions. The court properly submitted the auditor\u2019s report and these questions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
