Trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before <em>Knowlton, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">The defendant was a common victualler, duly licensed to sell intoxicating liquors upon the premises described in the complaint. It appeared in evidence that the act complained of was committed on the Lord\u2019s day, and consisted of maintaining in a window of said premises, outside the sash, a frame covered with wire netting, which was submitted by the defendant to the inspection of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that, it being unlawful for the defendant to do business upon said premises on the Lord\u2019s day, he had a right to close up the premises, and obstruct the view to them in any way he saw fit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">The judge refused so to rule; but, against the defendant\u2019s objection, instructed the jury that the law applied to the manner in which the defendant kept the premises, the same upon the Lord\u2019s day as upon any other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">The defendant also asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could not convict, unless they should find the article complained of and exhibited to them to be a screen or other article specifically named in the complaint; which instruction the judge gave, with this qualification, \u201c or something in the nature of a screen.\u201d To this qualification the defendant objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>After a verdict of guilty, the. defendant filed a motion in arrest of judgment, \u201cfor the reason that no offence is set out in the complaint upon which said judgment is founded.\u201d This motion was overruled; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-4\"><em>H.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQr\">The defendant\u2019s license was made by statute subject to various conditions, such as that he should not keep a public bar; that he should hold a license as a common victualler or innholder; that no sale of intoxicating liquor should be made between the hours of twelve at night and six in the morning, nor on the Lord\u2019s day; that no sale of liquor should be made to an intoxicated person or to a minor; and that there should be no disorder or illegal gaming on the premises. The defendant contends that the effect of the condition that no sale should be made on the Lord\u2019s day is, that he was not licensed to sell on that day, and was therefore, although actually engaged in selling intoxicating liquor,- not acting as licensee, nor carrying on the licensed business at the time he committed the act complained of; and that the prohibition against placing an obstruction so as to interfere with a view of the business conducted \"upon the premises, in the Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>100, \u00a7 12, is limited to an act done by a licensee while carrying on the business under his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">One purpose of the prohibition is to expose violations of the conditions of the license; and to hold that it applies only when the business is carried on according to the conditions, and does not apply when it is carried on in violation of them, would do violence to the language of the statute, and defeat its obvious intent. The instructions asked were therefore properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The'motion in arrest was properly overruled; and the instructions given in regard to proof of the obstruction were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
