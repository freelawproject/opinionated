The conversation testified to took place in the absence of A.

J., Joseph E. Palmer testified that he was a police officer; that in the morning of March 26, 1882, he went with other officers to the defendant Essam\u2019s house, on Bunker Hill Street; that they saw Essam\u2019s sister, who informed them that Essam had been out late the night before^ that he was up-stairs, and she would call him down; that Essam came down-stairs, related to the witness where he had been the night before, and also stated that he \u25a0 was with the defendant Keating and a man they called Jack; that when they were on Chelsea Street, near Gray Street, Keating was making a noise; that an officer came up to them and asked them to stop their noise; that Keating made an offensive remark to the officer; that the officer was about to arrest Keating, whereupon Essam requested him to make some allowance for the man,- as he was intoxicated, and said that he, Essam, would take Keating home; that the officer then let them pass on, and they walked down Gray Street, and, when down the street a little way, Keating turned and struck the officer; and that Essam, when he saw this, thought it was about time to leave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">This conversation took place between Palmer and Essam in the absence of Keating. So much of this testimony as related to Keating was objected to by him; but the judge admitted it, as affecting Essam\u2019s connection with the assault only, and so ruled; but, in charging the jury, no specific direction was given on this evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty against Keating and Essam; and Keating alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-7\"><em>J.

This evidence was clearly competent against Essam. It was admitted solely for the purpose of showing Essam\u2019s connection with the assault charged, and the judge so ruled. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>defendant Keating wished the judge in his charge again to call the attention of the jury to the purpose of the evidence, he should have called the attention of the judge to it by requesting an instruction. <em>Exceptions overruled-</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
