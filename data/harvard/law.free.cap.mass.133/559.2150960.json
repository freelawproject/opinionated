Sts. <em>c. </em>72.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Gardner, </em>J., the complainant introduced evidence tending to show that, on November 6, 1881, she was delivered of a child, which was begotten by the respondent on or about March 6, 1881; and that she never saw the child, and was unconscious at the time of the delivery. The respondent called, as a witness, the physician who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>attended upon the complainant at the hospital, and he testified that she was delivered of a still-born foetus, which the witness considered to be about eight months old; that it had been dead some days before it was born; and that his impression was that it was buried by the city of Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\">There being no controversy as to the facts testified to, the judge ruled, as matter of law, solely on the ground that the child was still-born, that the complaint could not be maintained; and ordered a verdict of not guilty for the respondent. The complainant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-5\"><em>H.

Sts. <em>c. </em>72. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>85. Until born, the child is not the subject of maintenance. It is clear that the statute applies only to the case of a bastard child born alive, and not to a case like the present one, of a still-born child. The only order the court can issue, applied to the last-named case, would be inoperative and absurd. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>5 Mass. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
