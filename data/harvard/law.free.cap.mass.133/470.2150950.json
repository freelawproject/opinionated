Of this, $20 was for the original debt, and $1.16 for interest from the date of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In <em>Joannes </em>v. <em>Pangborn, </em>6 Allen, 243, it was held that, where a plaintiff in a personal action recovered a verdict of $20, he was entitled to no costs, although by our statutes interest is to be added to the verdict in making up the judgment, which in such case must therefore exceed $20. The court there say, \u201c The question of costs or no costs must properly rest on the verdict itself, and any addition thereto, arising from an allowance of interest thereon subsequently, does not affect this question.\u201d But interest which accrues before the verdict stands upon different ground. Whether it accrues by way of contract or by way of damages after a refusal to pay the original debt upon a demand, it is a part of the debt or damages for which the jury must render their verdict. In this case, the form of the verdict is not important; it is a verdict assessing damages in the sum of $21.16. The plaintiff \u201c finally recovers \u201d that amount \u201c for debt or damages,\u201d and is therefore entitled to his full costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The cases of <em>Kidder </em>v. Oxford, 116 Mass. 165, and <em>First Baptist Society </em>v. <em>Fall </em>River, 119 Mass. 95, cited by the defendant, arose under a different statute, and have no bearing upon the question before us. <em>Taxation affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
