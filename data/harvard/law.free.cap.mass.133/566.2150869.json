Writ dated September 28, 1878. Trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-10\">The plaintiff offered the note in evidence; and the signatures of the defendant and of the attesting witness were proved. It appeared that the note, after its delivery to the plaintiff, who could neither read nor write, had been changed in the following respects: the figures \u201c $100 \u201d had been made to read \u201c $136,\u201d or \u201c $156; \u201d the word \u201c dollars \u201d had been made to read \u201c fifty,\u201d or \u201cthirty,\u201d the word \u201csix\u201d being interpolated thereafter; and the word \u201con\u201d changed to \u201cdollars,\u201d and another word \u201con\u201d interpolated before the word \u201cdemand.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-11\">The plaintiff testified that he knew nothing about the erasures and changes above described, and neither made them himself, nor directly or indirectly authorized the same to be made; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>agent of the plaintiff, in whose possession the note was left for a time, testified the same as the plaintiff, as to her knowledge of, and relation to, said erasures and changes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\">The defendant objected that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover upon the note, unless he first explained and accounted for said changes and erasures; and that there was a variance between the plaintiff\u2019s allegations and the proofs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">The plaintiff asked the judge t\u00f3 instruct the jury as follows: \u201c If the jury believe that said $100 note was altered without the knowledge or consent of- the plaintiff, and without his agency, directly or indirectly, it is not, in law, an alteration, but a mutilation or spoliation; and the note would be good for, and according to, its original tenor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The judge declined to give this instruction; but instructed the jury as follows: \u201c The note of $100, appearing to be materially altered, is void, unless the plaintiff proves that it was altered by consent of the defendant, or proves the circumstances of its alteration, as well as that he did not make or procure it; the alteration would not be sufficiently explained by proof that the plaintiff did not make, direct or procure it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-8\"><em>J. M. Day, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-9\"><em>H. P. Harriman, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b583-10\">Colburn, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7yA\">The note declared on in this case was for $100, signed by the defendant, and payable to the plaintiff, or order. Upon the production of the note, it appeared to have been changed from a note for $100 to a note for $136, or $156, in the manner stated in the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">It was proved at the trial, that this note was originally a valid note for $100, and it was not pretended that it had ever been changed with the knowledge or consent of the defendant. The note was not indorsed, and, so far as appears, had always been owned by the plaintiff, and in his possession or in that of his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">These changes, under the circumstances, rendered the note <em>prima facie </em>void, and the burden was upon the plaintiff to explain them. If the changes had been made by the plaintiff, or by his authority or consent, directly or indirectly, the note was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>absolutely void. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>3 Met. 103. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Allen, 477. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 564. But if the changes had been made by a stranger, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, directly or indirectly, the note remained a valid note, according to its original tenor. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Frye, ubi supra. </em>1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">If the plaintiff proved that the note had never rightfully, or to his knowledge, been in the possession of any one but himself and his agent, and that the alterations were not made by him or his agent, or with the knowledge or consent, directly or indirectly, of either of them, he was entitled to recover on the note, as originally written, though he might not be able to prove the circumstances of its alteration; and there was evidence tending to show that these were the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We are of opinion that the judge erred in instructing the jury, as he apparently did, in effect, that proof of the state of facts above supposed would not entitle the plaintiff to recover. Of course, we express no opinion as to the credibility of the evidence at the trial, or the probability that such changes as were made in the note would have been made by a stranger. These are considerations for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">If, as we infer from the exceptions, the tenor of the note, as originally written, was apparent upon inspection of the note, it was sufficient to declare upon it in the usual way; and, upon showing that the changes in the note were mere spoliations, there would be no variance between the allegation and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
