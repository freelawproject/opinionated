J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ4\">Defendant appeals from an order of the Acting Director, Division of Motor Yehicles, suspending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>liis motor vehicle \"driving privileges\u201d for a period of one year. The administrative proceedings under review were initiated as the result of an accident on October <em>25. I960 </em>in which an automobile owned and operated by defendant struck and killed a pedestrian on a public street in the City of Camden.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">By this appeal defendant challenges the propriety of the aforesaid action of the Acting Director oil the ground that the violation forming the basis of that action was at variance with the charge set forth in the notice of. revocation initiating the proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We desire to note, parenthetically, that in view of the recent opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Atkinson v. Parsekian, N. J. </em>143 (1962), there is no doubt that the Acting Director had jurisdiction to act in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In the ease at bar, on application of defendant, a hearing on the proposed revocation of his license was held by a hearing officer in the Division. Following the filing of that officer\u2019s report with the Acting Director, the latter adjudged that defendant \"did violate the intent of <em>R. S. </em>[N. <em>J. S. </em>A.] 39 :4-36\u201d and directed the aforesaid suspension of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The record before ns does not include a transcript of the testimony given at the hearing. Instead thereof, the hearing officer\u2019s report contains a summary only of such testimony, together with certain exhibits, including photographs and diagrams of the accident scene, reports of police officers, a written statement by defendant, and a statement by an officer outlining the information given to him by the sole eyewitness of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The accident in question occurred at 11:30 A. M. on October 25, 1960. Defendant, who had been operating his ear in a southbound direction on River Boad in Camden, brought the vehicle to a stop in obedience to a red signal on a traffic light at that road\u2019s intersection with East State Street. While waiting for the light to change, defendant saw decedent (who was an 86-year-old man) standing near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>a telephone pole on the southeast corner of the intersection. The report recited a police officer\u2019s testimony (concerning defendant\u2019s explanation to him of the circumstances surrounding the happening of the accident) as follows: \u201c* * * as soon as [the light] turned green [defendant] started out again and as he entered the intersection of State St., the pedestrian stepped off the curb in front of him; * * * that he attempted to stop but was unable to stop before he hit the pedestrian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The hearing officer\u2019s report summarized the testimony of a woman motorist (the eyewitness above mentioned) as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201c*\u25a0 * * she noticed that the pedestrian was on the sidewalk and that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was approaching from the east; * * * that the pedestrian waited for the light to change and as it changed green in his favor he started to cross the street. She is not sure if the pedestrian was in the cross-walk or not. She thinks he was but she could not definitely state that he was. She said that he was in the street before being struck and that he was walking slow and he held up his left hand just before being hit as though to ward off the vehicle. * * * She said the defendant was not going fast, that he had just started out as he had been stopped for the red light. She stated that she thinks that the victim was hit by the left side of the defendant\u2019s car. * * * She stated that she believes the defendant\u2019s vehicle and the pedestrian both started out at the same time. She said the victim had not reached the center of the street when struck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">The hearing officer in his summary of her cross-examination stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201c[S]he is not positive that both the vehicle and the pedestrian started out at the same time. She feels there was no careless driving on the part of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Summarizing a portion of the testimony of a police detective, who had prepared a diagram of the accident scene, the hearing officer stated that the detective testified \u201cthat the telephone pole was about 4 to 8 ft. from the crosswalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Defendant\u2019s testimony, as summarized by the hearing officer, included a statement that the collision occurred when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>decedent was \u201c3 to 4 feet out from the curb\u201d and that the \"right front of the car\u201d struck decedent, but that on subsequent inspection the vehicle bore no evidence of the point of impact. The summary of defendant\u2019s testimony included no reference to the crosswalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">By a written notice dated March 13, 1961 (stated by the Acting Director to be authorized by the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:5-30), defendant was informed of the proposed revocation of his driver\u2019s license, to become effective ten days from the aforesaid date, for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cReason: involved in 'an accident on October 25, 1960 on Bast State Street, River Road, Camden, N. J., while operating a motor vehicle in violation of the law; to wit: Section 39:4-36 R. S. (failed to yield to pedestrian <em>crossing on a crosswalh) </em>resulting in the death of Charles Levick, Camden, N. J.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Pursuant to defendant\u2019s application for a hearing, the Acting Director, by letter, directed defendant to appear on a specified date \u201cfor a hearing <em>on the charge outlined in our proposed notice of revocation </em>of your driver\u2019s license privilege.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Following the hearing, the hearing officer submitted his aforesaid report to the Acting Director in which he specifically found that decedent was \u201cnot * * * in the crosswalk\u201d at the time he was struck by defendant\u2019s car. Our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that the proofs support the accuracy of that finding. In fact, implicit in the State\u2019s argument on this appeal is recognition of the finding that decedent was not within the crosswalk when he was struck by defendant\u2019s ear. The hearing officer, in recommending the suspension of defendant\u2019s license for one year, expressed his conclusions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">\u201cThere is some question as to whether the pedestrian was crossing the street in the crosswalk or not. The only eye-witness could not definitely place the victim in the crosswalk. She thinks he was in the walk or close to it. The testimony indicates that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>failed to perceive the pedestrian even though he knew he was there on the curb and might cross the street in front of him. Also there were no obstructions between him and the pedestrian to prevent him from seeing him. The fact that the pedestrian may not have been in the crosswalk does not relieve the driver of the responsibility to yield and to allow him to continue to cross the street, he was in the street when struck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">I find that the defendant failed to yield the right of way to the pedestrian. The testimony indicates that the pedestrian contributed to the accident by walking out into the street and <em>not being in the crosswalk. </em>The lack of skid marks and the fact that the defendant\u2019s vehicle travelled about 40 some feet from the crosswalk would indicate that he did not apply his brakes in an emergency manner.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">In view of the <em>contribution by the pedestrian </em>it is my recommendation that the defendant\u2019s driving privilege be revoked for a period of only one year.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Following defendant\u2019s \u201cexception to the Hearing Officer\u2019s recommendation,\u201d the Acting Director in a memorandum decision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201c* * \u00ab Testimony from the disinterested witness indicates that if the victim was not in the crosswalk, he was at least in close proximity to it. It is my opinion that the Legislature did not intend that a pedestrian who is crossing a street with a green light would be fair game for a motorist executing a left turn merely because the pedestrian was not in the precise confines of a cross-walk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">It is my finding that Edward T. Martin did violate <em>the intent </em>of R. S. 39:4-36 (failing to yield to a pedestrian <em>crossing on a </em>cross-walk) and as a result of this violation, an accident occurred which took the life of Charles Levick.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The formal order of suspension recited the reason for suspension as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">\u201cREASON EOR SUSPENSION:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">involved in an accident on Oct. 25, 1960 on East State St., River Road, Camden, N. J., while operating a motor vehicle in violation of the law; to wit: Section 39:4^-36 R. S. (failed to yield to pedestrian crossing on a crosswalk) resulting in the death of Charles Levick, Camden, N. J.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">As hereinabove stated, defendant\u2019s contention on appeal is that the Division\u2019s aforesaid notice of the proposed rev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ocation of Ms license inadequately apprised him of the charge on the basis of which his license was suspended; that the notice charged him with the <em>actual violation </em>of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :4-36, while the basis of his license suspension was made to rest upon a determination that the <em>intent </em>of the statute had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The pertinent part of said section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cThe driver of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway <em>within a crosswalk </em>except at crosswalks when the movement of traffic is being regulated by police officers or traffic control signals, and except where a pedestrian tunnel or overhead pedestrian crossing has been provided, but no pedestrian shall suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle which is so close that it is impossible for the driver to yield.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In urging a reversal of his license suspension, defendant argues that since decedent was not within the crosswalk, defendant was not in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-36 and a suspension of Ms license could not validly be based thereon. The State claims that defendant at least violated the <em>intent </em>of the statute and urges that this court should not \u201cexalt technical and literal strictness to the sacrifice of essential justice.\u201d It is claimed by the State in its brief that defendant was not prejudiced by the content of the notice because it served to advise him that \u201cthe reasons for the proposed revocation were grounded in the facts thus set out in the notice.\u201d Moreover, argues the State, there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for suspension of defendant\u2019s license other than the violation of the <em>intent </em>of the aforesaid statutory section <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-36).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In resolving the issue presented, we initially analyze the Acting Director\u2019s authority to suspend drivers\u2019 licenses. N. <em>J. S. A. </em>39:5-30 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cEvery registration certificate and every license certificate to drive motor vehicles may be suspended or revoked, * * * for a violation of any of the provisions of this Title or on any other reasonable grounds, after due notice in writing of such proposed suspension, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>revocation or prohibition <em>and the ground thereof.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The above-quoted statute empowered the Acting Director to revoke or suspend a driver\u2019s license on either of two grounds: (a) \u201ca violation of any of the provisions of\u201d <em>Title </em>39, or (b) \u201con any other reasonable grounds.\u201d The statute specifically required that the Acting Director notify the licensee (in this case defendant) of the ground on which he elected to institute proceedings referable to defendant\u2019s license. The Acting Director selected as the basis for his action the alleged violation of a provision of <em>Title </em>39 <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-36). However, his aforesaid \u201cmemorandum decision\u201d incontrovertibly demonstrates that his suspension of defendant\u2019s license was based, not on a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :4-36, but on a violation of the <em>intent </em>of that statute. We are in disagreement with the suggestion that a finding of the alleged violation of the <em>intent </em>of the foregoing statute is equivalent to a finding of its actual violation as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In contending that he was justified in his action, the Acting Director relies in part upon his power to suspend \u201con any other reasonable grounds.\u201d There is no doubt that had he selected another \u201creasonable ground\u201d as the basis for his action against defendant, his decision, if supported by adequate proofs, would be sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">If, as contended by the Acting Director, the true basis for his suspension of defendant\u2019s license is his conclusion of the existence of \u201cother reasonable grounds\u201d therefor, he was obliged to notify defendant of those grounds. A licensee, situated as was defendant, is entitled to be apprised of the specific charge he is called upon to meet. <em>Bechler v. Parsekian, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>242, 257 (1961). A suspension of his license based on a charge other than the specific one of which he received notice cannot stand. <em>Parsekian v. Cresse, </em>75 <em>N. J. Super. </em>405 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The aforesaid order of the Acting Director, suspending defendant\u2019s driving privileges, is reversed. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
