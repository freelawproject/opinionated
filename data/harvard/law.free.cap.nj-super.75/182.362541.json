S. </em>18:5\u201451, as amended by <em>L. </em>1938, <em>c. </em>247. (Hearings on charges preferred against any employee of a board of education who is under tenure in any office, position or employment covered by <em>Title </em>18 of the <em>Revised Statutes </em>must now be conducted in accordance with the Tenure Employees Hearing Act, <em>L. </em>1960, <em>c. </em>136; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:3-23 <em>et seq., </em>which became effective October 5, 1960, after Hoek\u2019s dismissal on April 22, 1958.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Eollowing an investigation of the Asbury Park school system by a committee of the board of education, 14 charges were preferred against Hoek in August 1957. Board member Novogrod then preferred 17 additional charges on October 21, 1957, followed by 9 more on January 14, 1958 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and 1 on January 29, 1958. These additional charges were accepted by the board for hearing. The board opened its hearings on February 25, 1958 and concluded them on April 21, 1958. At the very outset respondent, through his attorney, moved to disqualify Novogrod by reason of his malice, ill will and prejudice toward respondent, his personal interest in having him dismissed, his sitting in judgment upon charges which he personally had brought, and his prejudgment of the validity and seriousness of the charges. Novogrod participated in the hearings on the motion for disqualification, although he did not take part in the board conference preceding the vote on disqualification, nor did he vote on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The board refused to disqualify Novogrod by a vote of 3-0, a fourth member abstaining. It then proceeded to hear the charges. Of the 41 (14 by the board and 27 by Novogrod), all but 17 were dropped at some time during the proceedings. The 17 comprised one charge that had been brought by the board and 16 by Novogrod. The board found appellant guilty of nine, all of them brought by Novogrod. Novogrod cast the deciding vote in seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">There is no need to detail the nine charges on which Hoek was found guilty. They may generally be described as alleging conversion of foodstuffs and other property of the board of education to his own use or the use of others; failure to declare in his inventory certain surplus foods and their destruction without justification; falsification of the board minutes so that they did not properly reflect the action allegedly taken by the board at a meeting; employment of maintenance and cafeteria help without board approval; directing the use of school property for the benefit of one of the board members, without authority; and directing a board employee to obtain a motor vehicle license for a third party, on school time and without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The State Commissioner of Education agreed with the local board\u2019s finding of guilt on eight of the nine charges. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>He also determined that Fovogrod was not disqualified from participating in the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Although respondent Hoek, on appeal to the State Board of Education, attacked his dismissal on several grounds, the Board determined that it need consider only one of them, deeming it dispositive of the appeal. That ground was Fovogrod\u2019s disqualification to participate in the local board hearings because of possible prejudgment of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The now generally accepted gauge of administrative factual finality is whether the factual findings of the administrative agency are supported by substantial evidence. The decision of the State Board of Education reflects a careful consideration of the disqualification hearings record. We have read that record and find ourselves in complete agreement with the conclusion reached by the State Board. We need not consider Fovogrod\u2019s deep involvement in the Hoek matter, as exemplified by his personally conducting an investigation into the affairs of the secretary-business manager\u2019s office, interviewing witnesses, and his preparation and bringing of additional charges after the local board had acted. (We recognize that the bringing of charges by a board of education member does not in itself disqualify him from participation in hearing the charges, <em>Maclcler v. Camden Board of </em>Education, 16 <em>N. J. </em>362 (1954), although we question whether such a member can sit in judgment with a mind wholly unconditioned by charges personally brought. <em>Cf. N. J. S. A. </em>18:5\u201451, permitting charges to be filed by any person, whether a member of the school board or not.) We conclude that the State Board\u2019s decision is well supported by substantial evidence; like the Board, we find uncontradicted evidence that Fovogrod was disqualified from hearing the Hoek charges because, whether consciously or unconsciously, he prejudged the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The most damaging evidence against Fovogrod came from two attorneys, Abraham Frankel and Harry Green, witnesses produced by Hoek on his motion for disqualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tion. Erankel. who had represented TToek until January 8, 1958, testified that Novogrod had'' phoned him the next afternoon, January 9, regarding a rumor that he was withdrawing from the case. Erankel confirmed the fact and told Novogrod that Edward W. Currie, Esquire, now represented Hoek. Novogrod said that he felt Hoek ought to resign; he told Erankel, \u201cIf you knew what I have in my file against Mr. Hoek, why then you would understand why I am suggesting this.\u201d Ho went on to say, \u201cYou know that there are criminal charges, that there may be an indictment.\u201d When Erankel asked Novogrod when he wanted Hoek to resign, he replied, \u201cAs of Eebruary 1st,\u201d and insisted upon that date. Novogrod suggested that Erankel speak to Hoek to determine his attitude about resigning. Later in the conversation Novogrod said that unless Hoek resigned, he intended to move for his suspension at the next board meeting on January 14. Then he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cYou know, I \u00ederl a groat responsibility as a member of the board, and this man Hoek is a thief, and I don\u2019t trust him, and he exercises a great deal of authority on that board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Erankel again reminded Novogrod that he no longer represented Hoek, but promised he would talk to him that evening. Erankel did speak to Hoek, and Hoek said he had no intention of resigning.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Green had been attorney for the board of education before the Hoek hearings. He testified that sometime in December of 1957 Novogrod had suggested that an attempt be made to obtain Hook\u2019s resignation, effective immediately, and he would then withdraw the charges and make an appropriate statement. Novogrod had said, in effect, that if Hoek did not resign, the probabilities were that the matter would come up before the grand jury. Green further testified that he had had several telephone conversations with Novogrod in an attempt to find a plan acceptable to Erankel, then representing Hoek, that would result in a resignation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Novogrod had agreed to Green\u2019s suggestion that Hoek he permitted to resign without prejudice, and, instead of resigning immediately, be given until January 31, 1958 to do so. Asked to describe Novogrod\u2019s attitude toward Hoek, Green said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cIt is hard to characterize. I would say he was opposed to Mr. Hoek. I don\u2019t see how I can put it any other way. As to what motivated it, or whether it sprang from ill will or malice or something like that, I can\u2019t tell. He was opposed to Mr. Hoek.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony of the witnesses produced on Hoek\u2019s motion for disqualification, Novogrod said he wished to make a statement. In the course of that statement, Erankel, who was present at the hearings, insisted that Novogrod be placed under oath, like the other witnesses. Novogrod resisted the demand, and the board sustained him.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We find it significant that Novogrod did not contradict Erankel\u2019s testimony regarding the telephone conversation when Novogrod is alleged to have said, \u201cHoek is a thief, and I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d He dismissed Erankel\u2019s testimony with the observation, \u201cI would not cross-examine him as I consider his very presence as a witness a betrayal of the common confidence in confidential communication between attorney and attorney.\u201d Nor did Novogrod meet Green\u2019s testimony head-on.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The State Board concluded that it could read Novogrod\u2019s statement that Hoek was a thief \u201cin no other way than that he [Novogrod] was then convinced, before trial, of Hoek\u2019s guilt on at least those charges which implied that Hoek had taken school property for his own use.\u201d Although the State Board could not determine to a certainty \u201cwhether the subjective processes of Mr. Novogrod\u2019s mind in adjudging the evidence were truly impartial and uninfluenced by his stated conviction that in his opinion Hoek was <em>\u2018a, </em>thief,\u2019 \u201d it held that the evidence presented through Erankel\u2019s testimony demonstrated the evil that resided in the \u201cpossibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>of his consciously or unconsciously doing so.\u201d Since Novogrod was sitting in judgment, the State Board found it \"of the very essence that justice avoid even the appearance of injustice,\u201d\u2014referring to <em>James v. State, 56 N. J. Super. </em>213, 217, 218 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959). We join in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The State Board found that the taint of Novogrod\u2019s disqualification permeated the entire membership of the board of education, so that the action taken by the board was voidable by reason of his disqualification alone. Such is the law. <em>Pyatt v. Mayor, etc., of Dunellen, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>548, 557 (1952). It therefore reversed the decision of the State Commissioner of Education and set respondent\u2019s dismissal aside. The State Board emphasized that in so doing it was not to be understood as passing in any way upon the question of whether the charges leveled against Iloek were supported by the proofs. Nor was it passing upon the question of whether Iioek was a fit employee, or should be retained as secretary-business manager. In conclusion it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201c* * \u00a1i Our decision, however, is without prejudice to the right of the local Board, or any other proper person, to file charges and prosecute them for hearing pursuant to the \u2018Tenure Employees Hearing Act\u2019 <em>[L. </em>1960, c. 136; N. <em>J. S. A. </em>18:3-23 <em>et </em>seg.] before the Commissioner, if it is deemed, in the public interest, that such charges should be brought. Under that procedure, the vice in the former system of prosecution and hearing by the local Board will not be present, and the Commissioner, or his deputized Hearer, rather than reviewing the written record as he did below, will have an opportune y to observe such witnesses as may testify before him. The proofs here are peculiarly in that area where credibility of witnesses is crucial and the long-recognized aid of personal observation of witnesses would be available in determining that credibility. We likewise add that, if such reinstitution of charges is deemed in the public interest, the charges can be framed with more clarity and specificity than those below and the hearing can proceed without the prolixity which characterized the record below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Accordingly, we find that the State Board of Education did not, as appellant contends, err in finding that Novogrod <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>was disqualified and that his presence at the hearings on the charges tainted the entire proceedings and denied respondent a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The second point raised by appellant in its brief is that assuming the State Board was correct in reversing the decision of the State Commissioner of Education, it erred in not remanding the entire matter to the local board of education for final hearing, citing <em>Laba v. Newark Board of </em>Education, 23 <em>N. J. </em>364 (1957), and <em>Lowenstein v. Newark Board of </em>Education, 35 <em>N. J. </em>94 (1960), in support. <em>Laba </em>was decided before the passage of the Tenure Employees Hearing Act in 1960, and therefore has no pertinence. The reference to what was said in <em>Lowenstein </em>(at <em>page </em>118) regarding a remand to the local board of education, is <em>dictum </em>since the Supreme Court itself undertook to bring the case to a final conclusion because of the six years of controversy and litigation that had attended the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Whatever the argument made by appellant in its brief, its counsel agreed at oral hearing that the matter should go back to the local board for the filing of charges by it or any other proper person, and the prosecution of those charges before the State Commissioner of Education under the Tenure Employees Hearing Act, if the local board deemed it in the public interest that charges be brought. Counsel for appellant conceded that this was the preferred procedure, and he informed the court that he had so agreed before the State Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">A hearing before the State Commissioner on charges that might be brought by the local board or any person (see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:5-51; <em>L. </em>1960, <em>c. </em>137, <em>sec. </em>1) would eliminate the vice which inhered in the former practice, authorized by <em>R. S. </em>18:5\u201451, as amended by <em>L. </em>1938, <em>c. </em>247, of the board\u2019s being at one and the same time investigator, prosecutor and judge. The procedure now called for by the Tenure Employees Hearing Act was initiated and supported by the New Jersey Education Association. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>32 <em>N. J. E. A. Review, pp. </em>178 and 220 (1958-59) ; 33 <em>N. J. E. A. Review </em>251 (1959-60); and see the Statement attached to <em>Senate Bill No. </em>54 and <em>Assembly Bill No. </em>104, introduced in the 1960 Legislature, and which became <em>L. </em>1960, c. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">It seems clear from the concluding quotation of the State Board\u2019s decision, quoted above, that it left the way open for the filing of new charges, or at the least the reinstitution of charges, deemed in the public interest, which charges could be framed \u201cwith more clarity and specificity\u201d than those considered by the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As was said in <em>Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>372, 381 (1954), a remedial and procedural statute is ordinarily applicable to procedural steps in pending actions, absent a clear indication of a legislative intent <em>contra. </em>Such a statute is given retrospective effect insofar as it provides a change in the form of remedy or provides a new remedy for an existing wrong. <em>Cf. City of Wildwood v. Neiman, </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>209, 214 (1957), where we observed that our courts have consistently held that where a statute deals with procedure only, it applies to all actions and proceedings\u2014those which have accrued or are pending, as well as those yet to be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We therefore affirm the State Board\u2019s determination that the setting aside of respondent Hoek\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice to the right of the Asbury Park Board of Education, or any other person, to file charges and prosecute them for hearing before the State Commissioner of Education, pursuant to the Tenure Employees Hearing Act, if it is deemed in the public interest that such charges be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
