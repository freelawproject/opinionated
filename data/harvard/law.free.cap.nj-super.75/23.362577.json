R. </em>4:51-2. Plaintiff charged that defendants Sehiavone-Bonomo Corporation (S-B) and Herman T. Stichman, trustee in bankruptcy of the Hudson <em>&amp; </em>Manhattan Railroad Company (H &amp; M), negligently damaged plaintiff\u2019s motor truck scale by attempting to weigh a truck \u201ccarrying a total weight in excess of the legal limit of the said truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\"> In assessing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action we are limited to a determination as to whether the proofs were such as to raise issues of fact requiring submission to a jury. They must be so submitted in \u201cany case in which reasonable men might honestly differ as to the conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>J. L. Querner, etc., Inc. v. Safeway Truck Lines, Inc., 65 N. J. Super. </em>554, 560 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), affirmed 35 <em>N. J. </em>564 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The facts viewed most favorably for plaintiff, giving it the \u2018^benefit of all legitimate inferences which are to be drawn therefrom\u201d in its favor <em>(Querner, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>560), revealed that on December 2, 1957 plaintiff\u2019s motor truck scale, installed in 1946, was located on land in Jersey City which it had leased to C &amp; C Trucking, Inc. (C &amp; C), \u201can affiliate family corporation.\u201d C &amp; C customarily used this scale in connection with its trucking business. On infrequent occasions, \u201cmaybe ten a year,\u201d S-B, a scrap dealer, was permitted to use the scale. On those occasions one Clinton Ruble, vice-president of C &amp; C, who was a licensed public weighmaster, would do the weighing and for a fee of 50 cents would provide S-B with a certified weight slip. No charge was made for the use of the scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The truck, owned by S-B, was operated by its employee, who was accompanied by an H &amp; M stock foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The proofs showed that pursuant to a contract between S-B and H &amp; M dated November 6, 1957, the former, on December 2 aforesaid, was removing three lots of motors and motor shells, purchased by it from H &amp; M, from the latter\u2019s yards located a few blocks from plaintiff\u2019s premises. Pursuant to the aforesaid contract the motors and motor shells were to be removed by S-B and, at the seller\u2019s expense, weighed by a certified weighmaster to .be designated by H &amp; M. The purchase price of the scrap was dependent upon its weight so established. The contract estimated the weights of the three lots in gross tons which, when converted to pounds, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201cLot A\u201411 General Electric Traction Motors, Model No. 259 complete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">[37,408 pounds]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201cLot B-\u2014-3 General Electric Traction Motor Shells, Model No. 259.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-12\">[6,048 pounds]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u201cLot C\u201416 General Electric Traction Motors, Model No. 212 Complete (armatures and shells not all assembled).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">[87,673.6 pounds]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">To determine the \u201cload\u201d weight the procedure employed was first to weigh the empty truck to find the tare weight; the loaded truck was then weighed to ascertain the gross weight, the difference reflecting the net weight of the load.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The scale <em>was </em>built above a pit located adjacent to the building. The scale platform consisted of a \u201cforty foot concrete deck.\u201d The \u201cscale house\u201d located inside the building contained a dial calibrated to 50,000 pounds and a \u201cbeam\u201d marked to 30,000 pounds, but the manufacturer\u2019s rated capacity of the scale was 60,000 pounds with \u201cten to fifteen percent\u201d tolerance. Plaintiff conceded that it did not advise defendants as to the scale\u2019s capacity either by direct statement or by posted notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On December 2 one Bruno Tomaszewicv, an employee of S-B, accompanied by an II <em>&amp; </em>If stock foreman as aforesaid, drove the truck, then empty, onto plaintiff\u2019s scale where the weighing as designated by H &amp; M was to take place The truck was a three-axle dump truck, with double wheels on the rear axles. (Whether it was a six or ten-wheeled vehicle will be hereinafter considered.) The New Jersey registration certificate for the truck listed its \u201clicense load capacity\u201d at \u201c40,000 pounds.\u201d The manufacturer\u2019s weight rating was, gross weight, 45.000 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">By use of the scale the tare weight of the truck was initially determined to be 19,620 pounds. The truck was then driven to the II <em>&amp; </em>M yards and there loaded with \u201c11 G-. E. 259 motors complete\u201d (its \u201cfirst load\u201d on the morning of December 2) and, upon its return to the scale, the gross weight was determined to be 55,580 pounds, the motors weighing 35,960 pounds. Following delivery of that material to the S-B property the truck was again driven on the scale at about 1 :30 p. m. Its tare weight was then determined to be 19,500 pounds (the 120-pound differential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>between the first and second weighings of the truck was stated to be caused by the consumption of gasoline in the truck\u2019s tank). Three \u201cG. E. 259 motors complete\u201d were then loaded on the truck and a gross weight of 25,300 pounds determined, the motors weighing 5,800 pounds. The truck then proceeded to the H &amp; M yards where eight G. E. 212 motors with shells were added to the load. .Tomaszewicy and Ernest H. Heinen, stock foreman of H <em>&amp; </em>M, returned to the Eortugno scale for the third time that afternoon to weigh the truck and contents. Ruble said he did not see the truck come on the scale as he was then in the office, but that he \u201cheard a boom outside\u201d and saw \u201cthis red truck sitting on this scale\u201d and one end of the scale * * * down into the pit.\u201d Tomaszewicy, in his deposition, part of which was read into the record at trial, stated: \u201c[W]hen I pull on the scale, when all wheels was on the scale, right away I hear something cracked and truck went down.\u201d The truck and contents were then taken to the S-B scale where the gross weight was determined to be 69,280 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s proofs the trial court reserved decision on defendants\u2019 motion for an involuntary dismissal. Defendants thereupon rested and moved for judgment of dismissal. The trial court, finding that there was \u201cno evidence of any negligence of the defendants and that there\u201d was \u201cno issue for determination by the jury,\u201d granted defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Plaintiff urges several grounds for reversal of the judgment of dismissal. We now only consider the arguments that the trial court erroneously held that (a) <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3-84 had no applicability to the issues involved herein, and (b) there was no proof of any negligence on defendants\u2019 part.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84 is a section of the Motor Vehicle Act regulating the weight of commercial vehicles, including load, operating on any highway in this State. Under said section of the act the allowable maximum combined weight of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>three-axle, six-wheeled vehicle is 40,000 pounds. There is no specific provision covering a three-axle, ten-wheeled vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">S-B argues that its truck was a three-axle, ten-wheeled vehicle, because its rear wheels were double wheels, and therefore the 40,000 pound limitation specified in the statute was inapplicable. We think it clear that the truck was a three-axle, six-wheeled vehicle within the meaning of the statute and subject to the 40,000-pound limitation. This is confirmed by the truck\u2019s New Jersey registration certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The trial court, without deciding whether the S-B truck came under the three-axle, six-wheel provision, held the statute inapplicable to the instant case because it related solely to the operation of commercial vehicles on any highway in this State, whereas the accident to plaintiff\u2019s scale happened on its privately owned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">We conclude that, as to defendant H &amp; M, the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint was proper. But as to S-B, the owner and operator of the truck, we find that there was evidence of negligence which should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Concededly, the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84 were not directly applicable to the instant case for the reasons stated by the trial court. The purpose of this statute is the protection of our highway and highway structures. <em>State v. Gratale Bros. Inc., </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>581 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953). This incident occurred on private property. However, the charge, of negligence was that plaintiff\u2019s scale had been damaged by an overweighted truck. In order to prove this allegation plaintiff had to establish some norm or standard fixing a reasonable weight for truck and load from which S-B had deviated. Certainly if the truck with its load was overweighted for operation on any highway in this State and liable to cause damage to the highway or highway structures, that fact would be relevant and material to a consideration of whether it was negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to drive such truck upon someone\u2019s driveway or truck scale and damage the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Aside from the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3-84, there was evidence that the weight of the truck and load greatly exceeded the license load capacity set forth on the New Jersey registration for the truck as well as the weight rating set by the manufacturer of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The conclusion is that there was evidence, actually presented or proffered, from which the jury could have found as follows: Plaintiff as an accommodation to S-B allowed S-B to use its scale to weigh trucks loaded with scrap metal. The scale had ample capacity to weigh any truck and load operating on the highway of this State which was not over-weighted (save vehicles operating under special \u201cconstructor\u201d license plates, not here involved). S-B loaded a truck with scrap metal far beyond the truck\u2019s registration load capacitjr, far beyond the manufacturer\u2019s weight rating, and far beyond the statutory weight limit for operating such truck on the highway. S-B either knew or should have known that the truck was so overweighted. The truck was then driven on plaintiff\u2019s scale without the making of any inquiry as to what the rated weight capacity of the scale was, or whether the scale could take such a heavy load. As a result of the combined weight of the truck and load, the scale was broken. On such findings, the negligence of S-B would have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The judgment in favor of defendant S-B is set aside and the matter remanded for retrial. Costs to abide the outcome.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b46-8\">Price, S. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq\">(dissenting). I desire to record my respectful disagreement with the conclusion reached by my colleagues and to express my reasons for such variance in opinion. In determining, as I do, that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, I desire not only to express the bases for my decision but to register my dissent from the thesis on which the majority opinion is predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The pertinent facts are set forth in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Plaintiff urges several grounds for reversal of the judgment of dismissal entered on defendants\u2019 motion <em>(R. B. </em>4:51\u20142). They are that: (a) the trial court erroneously held that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3-84 had no applicability to the issues involved herein and improperly excluded \u201cexpert testimony\u201d concerning \u201cthe meaning of technical words in the [aforesaid] Statute under the custom and usage of the trucking industry\u201d; (b) erroneously granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment of dismissal as, so plaintiff asserts, \u201cproof of negligence\u201d existed apart from the provisions of the aforesaid statute; (c) improperly failed to give any weight to an alleged \u201cadmission of liability\u201d by employees of defendant S-B; and (d) refrained from \u201cruling on plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendants breached an implied contract that they would not place more than the legal weight limit on plaintiff\u2019s scale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Plaintiff contends that the limitations imposed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3-84 were pertinent to its claim that defendants\u2019 negligence caused the damage to plaintiff\u2019s scale. The statutory provisions, asserted by plaintiff to be applicable, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cSubject to the provisions of section 39:3-82 and the axle weight limitations of this section, no commercial motor vehicle, tractor, trailer or semi-trailer shall be operated on any highway in this State having a combined weight of vehicle and load of more than (a) 30,000 pounds in the case of a 2-axle 4-wheeled vehicle, (b) 40,000 pounds in the case of a 3-axle 6-wheelod vehicle, (c) 60,000 pounds in the case of a tractor and semitrailer combination, and (d) 60,000 pounds in the case of a truck and trailer combination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">The gross weight imposed on the highway by the wheels of any 1 axle of a vehicle shall not exceed 22,400 pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">For the purpose of this Title the gross weight imposed on the highway by the wheels of any 1 axle of a vehicle shall be deemed to mean the total load transmitted to the road by all wheels whose centers are included between 2 parallel transverse vertical planes less than 40 inches apart, extending across the full -width of the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The trial court\u2019s rejection of plaintiff\u2019s contention was based on its holding that the statute bars operations \u201con any highway in this state\u201d of vehicles having a maximum gross weight in excess of the limits specified therein; that the particular sections have no application to the issue flowing from the damage to plaintiff\u2019s scale located on its privately owned property; and that the purpose of the statutory weight restrictions is to prevent damage to the highways by overweight vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">To resolve the issue as to applicability of the aforesaid statute it is essential to determine its objective and the persons to be benefited thereby. In <em>Lambe v. Reardon, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>57, 68 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certif. den. 36 <em>N. J. </em>138 (1961), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201cWhere a statute establishes a certain standard of conduct, one of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted obtains its benefit in an action in negligence, if the breach of the statute was the efficient cause of the injury of which he complains. <em>Moore\u2019s Trucking Co. v. Gulf Tire &amp; Supply Co., </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>467 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), certification denied 10 <em>N. J. </em>22 (1952).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">See also, <em>Guse v. Martin, </em>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>262, 265 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In <em>State v. Gratale Brothers, Inc., </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>581, 584 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), we had occasion to consider the objective of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84. We there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cThe evil or mischief intended to be suppressed by the statute in question was the loading of a vehicle in excess of the weight authorized by the terms of its certificate of registration. What the Legislature clearly had in mind at the time it amended and supplemented <em>R. S. </em>39:3-84 in 1950 <em>(L. </em>1950, c. 142), <em>N. J. S. A., </em>was the protection of our highways and highway structures\u2014subject as they are to the extraordinary use and ever-increasing volume of commercial traffic crossing and recrossing our State-\u2014-from damage by overweight vehicles. <em>Cf. N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84 and 84.4.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The aforesaid interpretation of the statute\u2019s purpose has been recognized in subsequent decisions. <em>State v. E. H. Miller Transportation Company, Inc., </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>474 <em>(App. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Div. </em>1962); <em>State v. Metropolitan Iron and Steel Co., </em>62 <em>N. J. Super. </em>412, 416 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1960); <em>State v. Levitan Interstate Transport, Inc., </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>345, 351 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1959); and <em>State v. Olean Transportation Corp., </em>39 <em>N. J. Super. </em>236, 240-241 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Added emphasis on the aforesaid objective of the section of the statute with which we are here concerned <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3\u201484) is supplied by the contrasting interpretation given to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :4-50, in which section specific reference to highway operation is omitted. <em>State v. Sisti, </em>62 <em>N. J. Super. </em>84, 87 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">It is incontrovertible that the purpose of the aforesaid statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:3\u201484), regulating the weight of trucks and their respective load capacities, is to protect the public highways. The legislation was enacted for the benefit of organized government and not for the protection of individual citizens in connection with their privately owned property. <em>Cf. Lambe v. Reardon, supra, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>68; <em>Fielders v. North Jersey St. Ry. Co., </em>68 <em>N. J. L. </em>343, 352 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Eurther proof that the statutory purpose is designed for the exclusive benefit of the government is furnished by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84.4, which authorizes the institution of a civil action by the \u201cauthorities in control of such highway or highway structure\u201d for damages caused by violations of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Plaintiff in its brief contends that, even though the aforesaid statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3-84) does not provide for a \u201cprivate right of action, it does afford plaintiff a claim of negligence against defendants,\u201d and in suggested support of that contention cites <em>Evers v. Davis, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>196 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914). That no support for plaintiff\u2019s contention is furnished by <em>Evers </em>is evident from the following language of Mr. Justice Garrison in that case at <em>p. </em>204: \u201cthe plaintiff in an action of negligence obtains the benefit of the statute if he be one of the class for whose protection it was enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>In passing, I desire to note that, in view of the conclusion I reach herein, I perceive no purpose to be achieved by resolving the opposing contentions of the parties as to the detailed truck classifications and the respective permissible gross weights, with reference to which subject a major portion of each brief is devoted. Drawing, as is required, all inferences in favor of plaintiff in assessing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action, I have assumed that the S-B truck was loaded beyond its rated eapacitj'' as expressed in the aforesaid statute. However, as plaintiff is not a beneficiary of the statute, the assumed violation thereof by defendants is completely irrelevant to the issue of their negligence upon which plaintiff grounds its cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">I turn to an analysis of the reasons on which the majority members of the court rest their conclusion that the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :3-84 were, as against S-B, pertinent to the issues involved. It is conceded in the majority opinion that the aforesaid statutory provisions \u201cwere not directly applicable to the instant case for the reasons stated by the trial court,\u201d citing <em>State v. Gratale Bros. Inc., supra, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>581. However, noting that plaintiff charged that its \u201cscale had been damaged by an overweighted truck,\u201d it is stated by the majority that \u201cin order to prove this allegation plaintiff had to establish some norm or standard fixing a reasonable weight for truck and load from which S-B had deviated.\u201d From this premise the majority concludes that \u201cif the truck with its load was overweighted for operation on any highway in this State and liable to cause damage to the highway or highway structures, that fact would be relevant and material to a consideration of whether it was negligent to drive such truck upon someone\u2019s driveway or truck scale and damage the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">I respectfully disagree with the foregoing conclusion as well as the premise on which it is made to rest. The statutory provisions referable to the presence of overweighted trucks on highways establish no \u201cnorm or standard,\u201d a deviation from which may be deemed to constitute the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>for a finding of negligence proximately causing the breaking of plaintiff\u2019s scale. I hold, as did the trial court, that there exists no relationship whatever between the violation of the aforesaid highway regulation and the negligence here charged against defendants. To conclude otherwise constitutes, in my opinion, a repudiation of the principles enunciated in the above-cited cases, all holding that to obtain the benefit of a statute a plaintiff must be \u201cone of the class for whose protection it was enacted.\u201d <em>Evers, supra, </em>86 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>204; <em>Lambe, supra, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>68; <em>Fielders, supra, </em>68 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>352; <em>Moore\u2019s Trucking Co., supra, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>472. There is no doubt that the Legislature, by the aforesaid statute, has established a certain standard of conduct governing the operators of trucks on the highways in this State, but not only is plaintiff not one of those for whoso protection the statute was enacted, but defendants alleged breach thereof was not the efficient cause or even a contributing cause of the injury of which plaintiff complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The majority opinion states that \u201cthe jury could have found\u201d that \u201cthe scale had ample capacity to weigh any truck and load operating on the highways of this State which was not overweighted * * and that an inference of negligence arises because the \u201coverweighted\u201d truck was driven on plaintiff\u2019s scale without defendants\u2019 making \u201cany inquiry as to what the rated weight capacity of the scale was, or whether the scale could take such a heavy load.\u201d Such a conclusion must of necessity rest on a presumption that scales normally will not take more than 60,000 pounds (the maximum combined weight of. commercial truck and trailer combination, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84, \u201csave vehicles [as noted in the majority opinion] operating under special \u2018constructor\u2019 license plates, not here involved.\u201d). No such presumption is justified. From what source does it spring? If statutory highway limitations constitute a \u201cnorm or standard,\u201d and scales are used to determine whether highway operated trucks are overweighted, it seems to me far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>more logical to presume that a scale would \u201ctake\u201d more weight instead of less than the statutory limitation. However, as stated, I am convinced that an infraction of the statutory provisions has nothing whatever to do with the alleged negligence here involved. As a matter of fact, in negation of plaintiff\u2019s contention, it is noted that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84.3 even recognizes under certain conditions the propriety of the operation of an overweighted truck on the highway. It is therein provided, <em>inter </em>alia, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201cNo vehicle shall be deemed to be in violation of the overweight provisions of this act when, upon examination by an officer or inspector, the vehicle\u2019s dispatch papers show it is proceeding from its last preceding freight pick-up point within the State of New Jersey by a reasonably expeditious route to the nearest available scales or to the first available scales in the general direction towards which the vehicle has been dispatched, or is returning from such scales after weighing-in to the last preceding pick-up point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">How, then, can there be justification for saying that the existence or absence of an infraction stemming from highway operation has any possible bearing on alleged negligence in the contractual use of plaintiff\u2019s private scale here involved?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Next, the majority opinion holds that a <em>prima facie </em>inference of negligence may arise from the fact that \u201cthe weight of the truck and load greatly exceeded the license load capacity set forth on the New Jersey registration for the truck [40,000 pounds].\u201d Again, this is a statutory violation referable to the licensing of commercial vehicles based on the permissible gross weight of the vehicle and load, which statute fixes the fee therefor depending on such gross weight, and provides that it \u201cshall be unlawful for any vehicle having gross weight of load and vehicle in excess of the gross weight provided on the registration certificate <em>to be operated on the highways of this State.\u201d (N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-20) (emphasis supplied). For the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reasons hereinbefore presented it is clear that the fact that the movement on a highway of a loaded truck, having a gross weight in excess of that set forth on the registration certificate, might constitute a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-20 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84 has no relationship to the issue in the instant case. The fact that, to the knowledge of defendants, the \u201coverweighted\u201d S-B truck had a registration certificate\u2014limitation of 40,000 pounds\u2014should not have resulted in imposing an obligation on defendants to inquire of plaintiff the estimated capacity of its scale or, as the majority opinion holds, to have permitted an inference of negligence from their failure to make such inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Furthermore, I find no justification for holding, as the majority opinion does, that the fact that the gross weight (truck and load) exceeded the \u201cweight rating set by the manufacturer of the truck\u201d has any bearing on the alleged negligence here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that the manufacturer\u2019s rating (in this case 45,000 pounds) was designated by the manufacturer for any purpose other than to guard against possible damage to the truck itself by overloading it. Certainly its weight rating may not be considered as a basis for a third party\u2019s (in this case Fortugno\u2019s) cause for action under the circumstances here involved. The truck, with manufacturer\u2019s rating of 45,000 pounds, might be loaded beyond that estimated capacity and still have a gross weight less than the scale\u2019s capacity. Specifically applying that hypothesis to the case at bar would mean that the S-B truck, with a manufacturer\u2019s rating of 45,000 pounds, could, by that rating, be overloaded by 15,000 pounds and still be within plaintiff\u2019s scale capacity. This is conclusive proof, in my opinion, that the manufacturer\u2019s rating is completely irrelevant to the issue involved in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Por all the reasons above set forth, such factor, in my opinion, may not result in imposing an obligation on defendants to make inquiry as to the scale\u2019s capacity or in raising an inference of negligence for jury resolution if such inquiry be not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The basic foundation of the majority opinion is that, because the truck was \u201coverweighted\u201d to the knowledge of S-B, there was a burden on said defendant to make inquiry as to the scale\u2019s rated capacity and specifically whether it could \u201ctake\u201d the load then on the S-B truck. That responsibility (the failure to meet which the majority opinion finds raises a jury question as to the negligence of defendant S-B) is said to be based on the statutory provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:3-84, the load\u2019s gross weight in excess of its licensed load capacity, and its gross weight in excess of the truck manufacturer\u2019s weight rating, all of which, for the reasons previously set forth, I am convinced have no relationship to the issues here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As above noted (b), plaintiff further contends that, apart from the aforesaid statutory provisions, the proofs demonstrate negligence of the defendants on which it may ground its claim for damages, contending that \u201cat least\u201d the driver of the S-B truck \u201cknew that the truck was overloaded.\u201d Because thereof, plaintiff asserts that a jury question was raised as to defendants\u2019 duty to inquire of plaintiff as to the scale\u2019s capacity. Absent the statute, the nonapplication of which has in my opinion been demonstrated, there was no \u201coverloading of the truck\u201d by defendants as far as their use of plaintiff\u2019s privately owned scale was concerned. The case is devoid of any proof that defendants knew or should have known, or were under a duty to inquire, as to the capacity of plaintiff\u2019s scale. No such duty arises automatic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ally, and plaintiff\u2019s contention that such duty exists, when analyzed, is in fact based only on its reiteration of the aforesaid statutory violation and its claim that the manufacturer\u2019s rating was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The asserted \u201cadmission of liability\u201d by employees of S-B was properly treated by the trial court as of no evidential value in assessing the propriety of defendants\u2019 motion for entry of a judgment of dismissal. The issue arose because three alleged \u201crepresentatives\u201d of S-B came to plaintiff\u2019s property following the accident. Plaintiff claimed that one of them said, \u201cGet estimates on it to repair it and send the bills to Schiavone and Bonomo Corporation.\u201d There was no proof whatever that the \u201crepresentatives\u201d of the defendant company had any authority to bind the company by an admission of liability in the premises. <em>Hansen v. Eagle-Picher Lead Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>133, 145 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The final argument advanced by plaintiff that defendants breached an implied contract not to overload the S-B truck is merely a reiteration of its argument that the aforesaid statutory violation, the violation of the registration certificate, and the ignored manufacturer\u2019s rating constituted the evidence from which liability could be inferred. This contention of plaintiff is rejected for the reasons hereinabove expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">I am of the opinion that the judgment in favor of defendants should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
