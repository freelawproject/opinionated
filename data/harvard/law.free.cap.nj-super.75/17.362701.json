A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">The Township of North Bergen, County of Hudson, appeals from a judgment of the Division of Tax Appeals, Department of the Treasury, reducing the 1959 tax assessment of $80,000 to the sum of $500 on a \u201cTV Transmitter Building\u201d owned by respondent Thomas S. Lee Enterprises, Inc. (hereafter Enterprises).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The subject property was originally constructed in 1949 as a part of the WOE-TV broadcasting facilities. In 1953 the operations of this nnit were transferred to New York City. A 775 foot broadcasting tower, formerly on taxpayer\u2019s property, was demolished shortly after the disaster on November 8, 1956 which resulted from an airplane collision with the tower. The special purpose (transmitter) building, which was adjacent to said tower, remains and is unoccupied; it is of brick construction, with a concrete plank roof, cement flooring, and \u201cextra heavy walls with an extra heavy foundation to avoid vibration.\u201d The structure contains 3290 square feet previously devoted to service and equipment space, and 1666 square feet of garage area. The interior of the edifice is presently dismantled to the extent that the broadcasting and soundproofing equipment, wiring, ducts, and floor covering have been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The municipal tax assessment for the year 1959 was land $40,800, improvements $80,000, aggregating $120,800. The Hudson County Board of Taxation sustained the assessment as to the land, but reduced the improvement assessment to $32,000. The township filed a petition of appeal with the Division of Tax Appeals, and the taxpayer cross-appealed. Both reviews were limited to the assessment on the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Joseph Bubenstein, an expert for the township whose qualifications as a realtor were admitted, testified that he evaluated the property in question at $80,000 (replacement costs, depreciation and obsolescence were taken into consideration) and that, in his opinion, it was \u201cvery desirable office space, and, of course, the garage on account of the type of construction could be converted for additional office space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>or so used for garage purpose. It is a very excellent building.\u201d He voiced the opinion that the property could be used for such purposes under the existing zoning laws of the township and without an application for a variance. Under cross-examination he explained, \u201cThat is my understanding of the zoning law now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Kenneth Eisk, a realtor, after stating his qualifications as a specialist in appraising real estate, gave evidence on behalf of Enterprises. His testimony did not conflict with that of Rubenstein concerning the nature of the improvement and its substantial construction. However, he expressed his conviction that the building \u201cno longer had a purpose in life\u201d since it was \u201cvacated by the broadcasting people and the tower torn down\u201d; because of the zoning restrictions it could only be used for residential purposes; and it would be too expensive and impractical to. convert the property into such a use. Eisk maintained that the building \u201cis almost 100 per cent obsolete because of the zoning,\u201d and that it did not have any commercial value and \u201ccould not be sold, in my opinion, to be used for anything.\u201d He testified that \u201cthe building would have to be moved before you could use the land under the existing zoning law,\u201d and that he considered the building to be of \u201cno value\u2014nominal value perhaps $500 or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">It was stipulated that the taxpayer had received an offer from the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company to purchase the property (land and building); informal discussions were had with responsible township officers relating to the \u201cpossibility of a change in the zoning of the area\u201d; and that no formal application for a variance had been made \u201cbecause the indications were that, if made, it would be denied.\u201d The evidence, however, does not disclose that a variance under the circumstances was or was not in fact necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The Division of Tax Appeals in its \u201cBindings of Eact and Order for Judgment\u201d concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201cWe find as facts that the building in question was specially constructed as a broadcasting studio and this use has been abandoned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The property is in a residential zone and the building cannot be used for residential purposes. While originally a non-conforming use, the property is now governed by the applicable zoning ordinance. We find that the building is not saleable and therefore has no market value except as salvage. We find as a fact that the true value of the building for the tax year under review is $500.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">This court recently, in <em>Arkam, Machine &amp; Tool Co. v. Township of Lyndhurst, 73 N. J. Super. </em>528, 532, 533 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962), pointed out that a nonconforming use is not restricted to the identical particular use which was in existence at the time of the enactment of the zoning ordinance, but embraces the same or a substantially similar use within the zoning classification, citing <em>North American Building &amp; Loan Ass'n. v. Board of Adjustment of City of New Brunswick, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>63 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936); <em>Schaible v. Board of Adjustment, Twp. of Millburn, </em>15 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>707, 194 <em>A. </em>388 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937); <em>Lane v. Bigelow, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>195 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947); <em>Stout v. Mitschele, </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>406 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947); <em>Kramer v. Town of Montclair, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>16 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954); <em>Heagen v. Borough of Allendale, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>472 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); <em>Moore v. Bridgewater Twp., </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961); 1 <em>Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice (2d ed. </em>1953), <em>sec. </em>149, <em>p. </em>366; 2 <em>Metzenbaum, Law of Zoning (2d ed. </em>1955), <em>c. </em>X-g(3), <em>pp. </em>1241-1243; 8 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed. rev.), sec. </em>25.202, <em>p. </em>505.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The rights of a nonconforming user are protected by statute <em>R. S. </em>40 :55-48, but they \u201cmust be contained, consonant with the spirit of a unified zoning plan.\u201d See <em>Grundlehner v. Dangler </em>(concurring opinion by Justice Burling), 29 <em>N. J. </em>256, 274 (1959). A variance is not required for a continuation of a nonconforming use. <em>National Lumber Products Co. v. Ponzio, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>95, 96 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The vital question posited by the issue of abandonment of the nonconforming use status was not limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the mere determination that the use of the property as a broadcasting station had been discontinued. Abandonment is the intentional relinquishment of a known right and presents an issue of fact. <em>Donovan v. Gabriel and </em>Gruber, 57 <em>N. J. Super. </em>542, 553, 554 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959). Judge Goldmann, in writing a concurring opinion in that case, further declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">\u201c\u00ab= * * To establish abandonment of a nonconforming use there must be an intention to abandon as well as an external act (or omission to act) by which such intention is carried into effect. These elements must concur.\u201d (Authorities cited)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Neither the applicable zoning ordinance or ordinances nor an excerpt of any pertinent provisions thereof appears in the record before us. A footnote in appellant\u2019s brief furnishes this general information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cNorth Bergen is zoned into five districts, Residential \u2018A\u2019, Residential \u2018B\u2019, Business \u2018O\u2019, Commercial or Light Industrial \u2018D\u2019 and Heavy Industrial \u2018E\u2019. On June 23rd, 1948 zoning changed from Residential \u2018B\u2019 to Light Industrial \u2018D\u2019 to provide for the WOR-TV broadcasting station. On July 10th, 1957 the property was zoned back from \u2018D\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> The proofs as to true value, proffered by Enterprises, were predicated upon the assumption of total obsolescence due to zoning restrictions. Such testimony could reasonably support the conclusions of the Division only if it had been established by competent evidence that there had been an actual abandonment of the nonconforming use status and that the prevailing zoning ordinance prohibited the use of the subject property except for dwelling purposes. The findings of the Division must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>City of Passaic v. Botany </em>Mills, 72 <em>N. J. Super. </em>449, 454 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Competent reliable evidence is lacking in these proceedings (1) as to the prevailing zoning provisions and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>specific effect upon the present available use of the taxpayer\u2019s property, and (2) concerning the elements of intent and overt acts (other than the discontinuance of a single use) essentially necessary for consideration in determining an abandonment of a nonconforming use status.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The inconclusiveness of the proofs and the inadequacy of the record preclude us from making a rational conclusion on the merits of the issues involved. Accordingly, <em>we </em>are impelled to remand the case to the Division of Tax Appeals for a further hearing, and a determination consonant with its subsequent findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
