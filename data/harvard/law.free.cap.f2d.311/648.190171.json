BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">The question raised on this appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support a determination by the Hearing Examiner of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare that Claimant Hayes was not entitled to Social Security disability benefits. Our answer is in the negative and therefore we reverse the decision of the District Court upholding the Secretary\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">A brief statement of Claimant\u2019s background is helpful. He was born in 1898. He attained a fifth grade education and is able to read and write \u201ca little \u2014 not too well\u201d; he can get the general understanding from newspapers. Claimant was in World War I and is presently receiving a non-service connected disability pension from the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">Claimant has spent his entire life doing manual labor. He was raised on the farm, worked in a foundry, on \u201cpublic works,\u201d in a sawmill and then returned to the foundry. He worked as a molder, pouring iron and lifting heavy molds. Claimant remained there until 1952 when he was forced to go to the hospital. Upon his release and on advice of his doctor he obtained a lighter job in the foundry which he kept until April 1957. At that time, so he states, he was advised by his personal doctor either to quit work or quit living.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">In November of 1957, Claimant filed application for disability freeze and disability benefits, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416, 423. He asserted \u2022 that his condition satisfied the statutory test of an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(c) (2). His application was administratively denied and Claimant requested a hearing. After a consultative examination arranged by the State Agency, the Alabama Division of Vocational Rehabilitation found that Claimant was not totally disabled. It is ironic, Claimant contends, that although this was their finding, they refused to accept him for vocational rehabilitation because his physical \u201c(a) impairment [was] too severe,\u201d and there were \u201c(b) no employment opportunities\u201d for one in his condition. A formal hearing was then held. After hearing the testimony of Claimant and considering the medical evidence, all of which was in the form of written reports, the Hearing Examiner found that Claimant was not totally dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>abled. This decision became final upon a denial of review by the Appeals Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Claimant then sought relief from the District Court, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 205(g). That Court affirmed the agency findings with the determination that these findings were supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">At this point, we see no need for a lengthy discussion of the standards applicable when courts deal with administrative determinations. The statute provides that \u201c[t]he findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, * * 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g). The question of what amounts to substantial evidence is a matter of law for the reviewing court to determine upon a considered evaluation of the whole record. Efforts to verbalize the process are seldom helpful since the standard is question-begging, with all quite clear once the conclusion is reached. Cf. Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. v. F. P. C., 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 345, 347; Hattaway v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 304 F.2d 5, 9. Occasionally the problem is directly likened to the acceptance or rejection of jury verdicts. At other times it is in terms that substantial evidence \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., 1939, 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660. Of course one thing of critical importance is the nature of the proceeding. That makes it essential to bear in mind what Judge Friendly emphasized in Kerner v. Flemming, 2 Cir., 1960, 283 F.2d 916, 921-922, that these so-called records lack much of the formal comprehensive attributes of a typical administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The record contains reports of four physicians who examined Claimant in connection with his claim. Two of these were personal physicians who had known Claimant for some years. The other two examined Claimant as consultants at the request of the State Agency. No two of the four doctors were in agreement as to the exact nature of Claimant\u2019s impairment. However, one fact is paramount \u2014 each doctor found that Claimant had a substantial impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">A brief consideration of these reports reflects the impression we gain that in his treatment of ostensibly conflicting medical reports, the Examiner made some crucial findings which are really not supported at all in the record, and furthermore did not really resolve these conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">We begin with the report of Dr. Watts who treated Claimant intermittently from 1952 until the time of his examination in November 1957. At that time Dr. Watts found him to be suffering from a slowly progressive condition of severe hypertrophic arthritis and bronchiectasis. Dr. Watts found this arthritic condition to extend throughout the entire spine, shoulders and knees, causing marked limitation of motion in the spine. Dr. Watts was emphatic that he had advised Claimant not to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">As we shall later see, the Examiner\u2019s decision does not really treat with this as a medical proposition. This is emphasized by the substantially parallel finding of \u201costeoarthritis of the entire spine\u201d in the consultative report of Dr. Holland which the Examiner in no way discredits. As to this we have the strong impression that the Examiner was laboring under the approach which the Secretary\u2019s brief in this Court importunes us to take. The Secretary persists in the notion that no matter how painful in fact this must be, it does not satisfy the statute since this is one of life\u2019s burdens. Supporting this the brief lays stress on the words from Adams v. Flemming, 2 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 901, 904, that \u201cJudicial notice can be taken of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>* * *. There are undoubtedly millions of people suffering daily from some infirmity: * * * those whose arthritic and rheumatic symptoms flare up and subside; * * * and those who suffer from various spinal ailments and discomforts.\u201d Responding to a like argument, this Court in Butler v. Flemming, 5 Cir., 1961, 288 F.2d 591, 595, in the plainest of terms rejected as out of keeping with legislation whose \u201c * * * purpose * * * is to ameliorate some of these rigors that life imposes,\u201d the ideas once expressed by Judge Hand in Theberge v. United States, 2 Cir., 1937, 87 F.2d 697, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">After the first adverse determination by the State Agency, Claimant requested reconsideration and in support of it submitted the report of Dr. Leyden of April 7, 1959. This report reflects that Dr. Leyden had first examined Claimant in 1957, had been treating him for heart disease which he currently found to be progressive. The diagnosis was that Claimant was suffering from hypertensive heart disease with marked angina cyanosis. He, as did other doctors, found a \u201chuge enlarged heart.\u201d The condition was diagnosed by him as progressive and \u201cvery little, if any,\u201d improvement can be expected. The doctor stated Claimant \u201cis unable to walk up steps, unable to hoe, or sweep\u201d and that \u201che has angina on slight exertion.\u201d His positive conclusion was that Claimant was \u201ctotally disabled to work, unable to climb steps, run or face wind and walk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">During this reconsideration the State Agency referred Claimant to Dr. Holland for a consultative examination and report. While his report revealed that \u201c * * * there is no limitation in motion or movement of the spine,\u201d he went on to acknowledge that Claimant \u201c * * * states that * * * pain is elicited in the lower back and upper thorasic and cervical region on extreme motions.\u201d Indicating strongly that the doctor credits the general truthfulness and reliability of Claimant, the report then states that he <em>\u201c </em>* * * is extremely cooperative in these tests and makes an effort to go through the motions, even though it apparently does give pain.\u201d In addition, the report found that \u201celectrocardiogram [is] consistent with old posterior myocardial infarction.\u201d The report concluded with this opinion which, for reasons later discussed, we think highly significant :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">\u201cOPINION: I feel that this man has: 1. osteoarthritis of the entire spine. 2. arteriosclerotic heart disease, functional Class II, but I doubt if the chest pain described above is due to angina pectoris. In regard to the points of requested emphasis not covered above: a. Response to therapy \u2014 He apparently has not been too greatly benefited as far as the back pain or chest pain is concerned. b. Estimate work tolerance \u2014This is difficult to evaluate since his complaints are not well substantiated objectively, but if they be true, it would be difficult for him to pursue any type of manual labor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The State Agency again redetermined that Claimant was not disabled. In connection with the requested Examiner\u2019s hearing, the Agency arranged for him to be examined by another consultant, Dr. Hawley, on November 10, 1959. This report describes his usual complaints of pain on exercise, but physical examination was essentially negative. The diagnosis was, however, \u201c1. Hypertensive cardiovascular disease. 2. Obesity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">In addition to these medical reports, the Hearing Examiner had before him the record of the Veterans Administration used in connection with its allowance of Claimant\u2019s non-service connected disability. That record likewise reflected a diagnosis of \u201c1. Hypertensive vascular disease.\u201d The X rays of the dorsal and lumbar spine revealed \u201cminimal to moderate degenerative arthritis * * \u201d with manifestations \u201cpredominantly localized at the lumbo-dorsal junction area and the lower lumbar area\u201d together with \u201cfairly large anterior and anterolateral boney spurs * * * fused in areas. * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number> We recognize, of course, that it is not our function or that of the District Court to resolve factual conflicts including contrary opinions expressed by doctors. But a consideration of the Examiner\u2019s report leaves us with the definite impression that he did not really perform the function of drawing the critical inferences of facts and law. On the contrary, the structure of his report and the wording used leaves us with a strong feeling that he was primarily reviewing the prior adverse determinations of the State Agency. Important as is the routine administrative determination concerning the merits of claims, the scheme of the statute and the implementing regulations call for an initial determination of all of the relevant questions by the Hearing Examiner entirely independent of the conclusions previously reached administratively. Of course this material is customarily before the Examiner, and in the usual situation may undoubtedly be significant as he draws his own conclusions. But in this function he is in no sense reviewing the prior decision of the administrative agencies or the sufficiency of the record to support their findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">But even if we are in error in this impression, we think that the Examiner\u2019s report and decision reveals deficiencies of a kind requiring further hearing and decision. The Examiner\u2019s report was a chronological discussion of the determinations and redeterminations by the State Agency and a paraphrase of the medical reports which we have discussed. In the Examiner\u2019s conclusions he first found that the \u201c * * * summary as recited by the State Agency in its decision of December 2, 1959 * * constituted] a fair and objective\u201d statement. The Examiner, thereupon adopting this formally as his own, reached \u201cthe conclusion * * * that the Record does not establish that Claimant was\u201d disabled within the meaning of the statute. In the course of adopting the findings of the State Agency, the Examiner expressly approved this very significant conclusion: \u201cThus, it would appear that this wage earner [Claimant] is able to sit, stand, walk and otherwise move about in the performance of moderately strenuous activity without developing significant symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">We may assume that in the ordinary situation the trier of fact could draw such conclusions from conflicting medical reports. But since the medical evidence consisted solely of medical reports unaided by explanatory oral testimony, there is nothing in this medical record which, in the present posture, adequately supports these critical findings. Drs. Watts and Leyden are clear against it, and Dr. Hawley\u2019s consultative report is neutral at most. It is essentially a report of objective findings but in none of them does Dr. Hawley undertake to draw a conclusion one way or the other on the medical fitness of Claimant to engage in gainful employment of a kind open to him considering his age, education, training and experience. Indeed, his formal diagnosis \u201chypertensive cardiovascular disease\u201d seems quite consistent with that of Drs. Watts and Leyden. He does not make any finding either as to the severity of this medical condition or its operative effect on employability. That leaves largely Dr. Holland. His opinion found definite osteoarthritis of the spine as well as a functional heart disease. Even more significant, Dr. Holland concluded that if the Claimant\u2019s complaints of pain and inability to exert himself are true, \u201cit would be difficult for him to pursue any type of manual labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">In the eyes of Dr. Holland, the critical thing then was the resolution of the question of whether the complaints of pain and inability to exert himself were genuine and well founded. The doctor did not undertake to pass on this question, and had he done so it would have been of tentative value only. For this was a run-of-the-mill issue for resolution by the Hearing Examiner. But the Hearing Examiner did not undertake, either inferentially or expressly, to resolve this' crucial subsidiary fact upon which nearly all of the medical contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>versy would depend. It may be that the Examiner labored under the misapprehension asserted here by the Secretary\u2019s brief that subjective pain is insignificant. If so, perhaps he felt that since Dr. Holland stated that these \u201ccomplaints are not well substantiated <em>objectively\u201d </em>there was no need for him to determine this point. But the statute does not require that disability or its cause be \u201csubstantiated objectively.\u201d Of course it must be \u201cby reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.\u201d But modem medicine is neither so scientific nor so helpless today that it either does, or must, evaluate only objective factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The result is that by the peculiar circumstances of this record, the Hearing Examiner either did not fulfill his role, made fact findings which are not adequately supported, or failed to resolve crucial issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">When the fact findings carry with them such operational finality as they do under this statutory plan, we must be certain that in arriving both at the ultimate decision and the essential subsidiary facts, the Examiner has evaluated all of the evidence under proper standards. Where these turn on credibility choices concerning things as elusive as the truthfulness of subjective symptoms and complaints, the Examiner\u2019s report should afford some indication <em>of the </em>choices made and the basis for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We do not have that assurance from this record. Consequently, while we do not regard this, as we have some records, as requiring a reversal and rendition in favor of the Claimant, we do think that the case should be remanded for further administrative hearings and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">The legal standards are now well outlined. For this sort of situation, they have been epitomized by the dual question (1) what can appellant do? and (2) what employment opportunities are available to a man who can only do what the Claimant can do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And in finding the answer \u201cmere theoretical ability to engage in substantial gainful activity is not enough if no reasonable opportunity for this is available.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stringent as is the statutory standard of disability, it is to be administered with reason. Were it otherwise few would ever be able to qualify. This was pointed out by Judge Rives in a decision which we have many times approved. \u201cNo matter how infirm, or disabled, or sick a man is, if he still possesses some of his faculties in some degree of mobility, he is not in the strictest sense unable to perform <em>\u2018any </em>substantial gainful activity<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.\u2019 \u201d For like reason once the Claimant makes a substantial showing, the burden resting generally on the Claimant to make out a claim is not to be carried to the logical extreme of forcing him to negative his capacity to do every possible job in the catalogue of the nation\u2019s industrial occupations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">We do not undertake to blueprint these proceedings on remand. But we think it appropriate to state that all of the present record may be used and the parties are free to, and undoubtedly will, supplement it by additional evidence, oral or written, or both.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>wise, rather than attempting to cast it in terms of whether the prior decision should or should not be sustained, an entirely new decision should be reached on that total record. We intimate nothing as to the result to be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\">. The District Judge also couched his ruling in terms that Claimant had failed to carry the burden of proving his disability. We feel it unnecessary to discuss this separately. See Kerner v.
