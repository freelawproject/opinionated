Appellant based its opposition on its prior use and registrations <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the trademark \u201cNEHI\u201d for non-alcoholic, maltless beverages sold as soft drinks and syrups and extracts for making the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The goods of the parties are identical, both comprising soft drink beverages. Appellant\u2019s priority of use is established by the record. The basic issue here is whether there is likelihood of confusion, mistake' or deception of purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1052(d)) when the trademark \u201cGINI\u201d is used by appellee on soft drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Appellant\u2019s position here, as it was before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, is aptly summarized in the board\u2019s opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-6\">\u201cCoined arbitrary marks, such as those here involved, are more difficult to retain in mind and, therefore, are more likely to be confused than marks comprised of everyday words of speech; one cannot ascertain with any degree of certainty the manner in which such marks will be pronounced by purchaser; applicant\u2019s mark \u2018GINI\u2019 is susceptible of being pronounced as though it were \u2018GEE-NIGH\u2019; when so pronounced, it bears such a strikingly similarity in sound to opposer\u2019s mark \u2018NEHI\u2019 that the marks \u2018would be practically idem sonans\u2019 and hence likely to be confused in use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s position as so stated and have compared the marks in issue. They do not look alike. As coined words they have little meaning except as marks identifying the source of the goods to which they are applied. They do not sound alike when pronounced as we think they are likely to be pronounced. As pointed out in appellee\u2019s brief;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-11\">\u201cAppellant asks this court to consider appellee\u2019s mark as being pronounced \u2018Gee-Nigh\u2019. It is perhaps susceptible to such pronunciation in the same way that \u2018Ghoti\u2019 is susceptible to being pronounced \u2018fish\u2019 (the \u2018gh\u2019 as in <em>\u2018laugh\u2019, </em>the \u2018o\u2019 as in \u2018women\u2019, and the \u2018ti\u2019 as in \u2018nation\u2019); this is, however, an improper pronunciation and a highly unlikely pronunciation. In the English language, \u2018gin\u2019 is pronounced \u2018jin\u2019 (as in <em>ginger) </em>or <em>\u2018gin\u2019 (begin). </em>Reference to any standard dictionary of the English language (such as Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition Unabridged, 1954, page 1058) will reveal that all of the English words beginning with \u2018gin\u2019 are pronounced as beginning with \u2018gin\u2019 or \u2018jin\u2019. Appellant offers no explanation for its conclusion that the purchasing public would adopt a pronunciation of \u2018GINI\u2019 for which there is no precedent in the English language, and <em>which </em>is entirely contrary to the conditioning of the purchasing public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in rendering its opinion noted that the appellant\u2019s suggested pronunciation of \u201cGINI\u201d as \u201cgee-nigh\u201d would not be \u201cat all likely\u201d. The board also expressed its opinion that even if appellee\u2019s mark were pronounced \u201cgee-nigh\u201d, it would differ sufficiently in sound from \u201cNEHI\u201d to obviate any reasonable likelihood of purchaser confusion, mistake or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">In the appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal filed October 24, 1961, and in Appellant\u2019s Brief, appellant complains that the board erred \u201cin failing to consider or follow the prior decisions of the Patent Office\u201d in Nehi Corporation v. Mid-Western Beverages, Inc. (Examiner of Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ferences, May 4, 1948), Opposition No. 25,472 (unreported), and Nehi Corporation v. Midwestern Beverage Laboratories, Inc. (Ex. Intf., March. 30, 1950), Opposition No. 27,657' (unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">We note that these decisions are those of the Examiner of Interferences and therefore are not binding as precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We agree with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers would be unlikely by reason of appellee\u2019s use of its mark \u201cGINI\u201d on soft drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\">.
