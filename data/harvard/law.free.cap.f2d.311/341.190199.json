Atty., Spokane, Wash., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b421-24\">Before HAMLEY and JERTBERG, Circuit Judges, and PLUMMER, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b421-25\">PLUMMER, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b421-26\">This is an appeal from a judgment dismissing the complaints in two actions to recover Federal Insurance Contributions taxes (paid under \u00a7 3121 et seq., Internal' Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3121 et seq.) and Federal Unemployment taxes paid under \u00a7 3306 et seq., Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3306 et seq.) alleged to have been erroneously paid and collected by the plaintiffs between the period ending September 30, 1954 and December 31, 1958, on the earnings of workers known as \u201cinstallers\u201d or \u201capplicators\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-27\">The single question presented is whether these \u201cinstallers\u201d were \u201cemployees\u201d of the taxpayer-plaintiffs within the meaning of that word as used in \u00a7\u00a7 3121(d) and 3306(i), Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3121(d), 3306 (i) as they read after the amendment of 1948 and the Treasury Regulations, \u00a7 31.3121 (d)-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-28\">There is no dispute as to the facts found by the District Court. Appellants contend that the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>concluding as a matter of law, on undisputed facts, that the \u201cinstallers\u201d were employees under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, \u00a7 3121(d), Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A, \u00a7 3121(d)], and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, \u00a7 3306 (i), Internal Revenue Code [26 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 3306(i) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Appellants further contend that the District Court failed to distinguish between control of results and control of details and methods of performance and that the Court\u2019s failure to appreciate this distinction led to the erroneous conclusion of law that the installers were employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">By its conclusions of law the District Court found that:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">(1) \u201cThe plaintiffs did exercise that degree of direction and control over the manner and method in which the installers performed their services to constitute the installers employees under the usual common-lav/ tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">(2) \u201cThe payments of Federal Insurance Contributions (FICA) and Federal Unemployment (FUTA) taxes made by plaintiffs were correct, since the installers were employees as defined under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, Sections 3121(d) and 3306(i), Internal Revenue Code of 1954.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The trial court found, as a fact, that \u201c(t)he manager (of taxpayers) had the power to instruct the installers as to the way the job should be done. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Neither this nor any other finding of fact is challenged on this appeal. But even if this finding had been challenged we would have been required to sustain it. Concerning the right of the taxpayers to control the activities of the installers as to the means and methods to be used for accomplishing the result, Milton L. Lee, manager of the taxpayer, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201c(Cross-examination at trial) A. * * * You asked me if I would tell a man how to do a specific job at a specific time. I don\u2019t remember ever doing it. Q. Now, I didn\u2019t ask you whether you told him how to do the whole job, I just asked you whether you have been out on jobs and ever given directions in reference to that job, maybe on only one particular point on that job? A. I said I couldn\u2019t remember having done it. Q. Well, is your testimony in the deposition correct, referring to page 17, line 1: \u2018A. Well, if I made a suggestion, I certainly would.\u2019 Indicating that you wanted them followed: \u2018Q. Have you ever given any directions? A. To an applicator? Q. Yes. A. If the occasion arose, I would, yes.\u2019 A. Yes,. I think that is accurate.\u201d (R. 60)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-18\">\u201c(Cross-examination at trial) Q.. (By Mr. Ewing): Later on, on the same page, and down at line 17: \u2018Q. Well, I am just speaking generally, not of any particular job, but just of all the jobs in general. You say you can\u2019t remember of your-own knowledge when you ever have given any direction, is that right? A. Well, no, I don\u2019t. Q. But you had the power to give the directions ?' A. Yes. Q. And if those directions weren\u2019t followed, what, if anything, would happen to the applicator? A. Well, we would be inclined not to give him another job.\u2019 Q. (By Mr. Ewing): Is that about, right? A. Yes.\u201d (R. 60-61)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-23\">\u201c(Deposition received in evidence for substantive purposes) \u2018Q. Did you have the power to give directions, Mr. Lee ? A. Yes, in making a deal with an applicator to apply a job, at least I would assume that you would have the power of instructing-him as to the way it should be done. Unwritten law in the business, you might say. Q. Did you, in fact, instruct installers as to how the job should be done? A. Oh, on occasion yes.\u2019 \u201d (R. 89)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-24\"> Under the statutory definition the usual common law rules are to be applied in determining whether an individual is an employee and within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>act or whether he is an independent contractor, thus making the act inapplicable. In making this determination it is the total situation that controls. Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U.S. 126, 130, 67 S.Ct. 1547, 91 L.Ed. 1947. But the fundamental test, giving due consideration to all the other factors in a particular situation, seems to be whether there exists a right to control the activities of the individuals whose status is in issue, not only as to results to be accomplished by the work but also as to the means and methods to be used for accomplishing the result. Radio City Music Hall Corp. v. United States, 135 F.2d 715 (2d Cir., 1943); Party Cab Co. v. United States, 172 F.2d 87, 10 A.L.R.2d 358 (7th Cir., 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Applying this governing rule to the unchallenged finding of fact referred to above, we hold the conclusions of law entered by the trial court to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
