General Foods Corporation opposes on prior registrations of \u201cKRINKLE\u201d for a food made of corn, sugar and salt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSUGAR KRIN-KLES\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cSUGAR RICE KRIN-KLES\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for cereal breakfast foods, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>on asserted prior use of \u201cKRINKLES\u201d and \u201cSUGAR COATED RICE KRIN-KLES\u201d on other breakfast foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board found that opposer was a manufacturer of a long line of grocery items including canned, mashed and sliced potatoes, frozen french fried potatoes, gelatin, dog foods, cocoa, baking powder, dry cereals, syrup, coffee and tea which it sells under different brand names through grocery wholesalers to the retail trade. The board found also that the opposer has since about 1949 used the word \u201cKRINKLES\u201d at various times alone or as a component of several trademarks for dry rice cereal. Sales of those cereal products bearing the term \u201cKRIN-KLES\u201d from 1951 through 1960 have amounted to more than $20,000,000. During the same period of time over $6,-000,000 was spent by opposer for advertising its \u201cKRINKLES\u201d product. In addition, the board relies on testimony to the effect that opposer uses the expression \u201ccrinkle cut\u201d in connection with its \u201cBird\u2019s Eye\u201d brand of frozen french fried potatoes to refer to the cut and appearance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In dismissing the opposition, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201c The specimen labels filed with applicant\u2019s application indicate that its product is a raw potato which has been \u2018crinkle cut\u2019 and otherwise prepared especially for making french fried potatoes. While applicant\u2019s product and opposer\u2019s dry cereal are specifically different grocery items, <em>they are usually purchased by the same class of purchasers in the same stores, and, hence, might be regarded as emanating from a common source if sold under the same or similar marks.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201cThe instant marks resemble each other to the extent that they comprise or include the term \u2018KRIN-KLES\u2019. <em>Considering, however, the nature of the term \u2018crinkle\u2019, as applied to french fried potatoes, it is believed that purchasers would assume that \u2018KRINKLES\u2019, as used by applicant in the expression \u2018E </em>\u2014 Z <em>KRINKLES\u2019, has reference to or suggests a french fried potato product which has been cut or sliced in a crinkly manner rather than another product marketed by opposer. </em>Under these circumstances, it is concluded that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is not likely to occur.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">While we appreciate the \u201ccrinkled\u201d nature of applicant\u2019s goods, we are unable to agree that that single factor is sufficient, in view of the other facts here, to preclude a likelihood of confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Even if there were doubt on that score, we would feel obliged to resolve it in favor of the first user and against the newcomer. Carlisle Shoe Co. v. Societe Anonyme: Roger Fare &amp; Cie, 278 F.2d 519, 47 CCPA 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Under such circumstances, we must reverse the decision appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"AOn\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-13\">. The application, Serial No. 44,887, filed January 29, 1958, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">Applicant disclaims the word \u201cKRIN-KLES\u201d apart from the mark shown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-24\">.
