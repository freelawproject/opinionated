No. 678,488 of May 12, 1959. It commenced to use that mark in 1952 and has used it ever since on a line of hosiery products, total sales of which to April, 1960, amounted to about three million dollars. Some 40 or 50 different styles of socks in the three general categories of crew socks, bobby socks, and knee-high socks appear to have been sold under the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-26\">Appellee is the owner of registrations on the Principal Register of SWEATER-MATES, Reg. No. 649,757 of August 6, 1957, and SWEATER SOFT, Reg. No. 650,960 of August 27, 1957. The only goods named in these registrations is hosiery. These are the registrations appellant has petitioned to cancel. The Patent Office Trademark Trial and Appeal Board denied the petition, from which decision this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-27\">Appellee admits the priority of use by appellant-petitioner of its mark and states in its brief that there is no dispute as to appellant\u2019s sales of its product or regarding advertisements of SWEATER KNIT, which appellant\u2019s president testified had been run in various trade magazines. Appellant alone took testimony and its sole witness was its' president. The significant matters, other than those already mentioned, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>which he testified, are that his company\u2019s socks retail at from 29 to around a .dollar; that they are sold to a large extent through chain stores, nation wide; that the socks sold under the trademark are knit socks; that though he had been in the knit socks business since 1929 he had never heard the term \u201cSweater Knit\u201d used descriptively in the knitting trade; and as to the selection of the trademark he said, \u201cwe pulled it out of the air like we do all the names we have.\u201d While appellee took no testimony on its own behalf, its counsel cross-examined appellant\u2019s president at length. Indeed, many of the above points were developed on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">An exhibit in evidence, a survey made in 1955 by the magazine \u201cThe American Girl,\u201d shows that appellant\u2019s SWEATER KNIT socks had attained a recognized degree of popularity in the year prior to appellee\u2019s claimed dates of first use of its marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In a brief opinion the board, after stating only the essential facts, set forth all of its reasons for dismissing the petition in the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">\u201cThe marks in question are similar only in that each commences with the word \u2018Sweater\u2019 which, as applied to hosiery, would more than likely suggest to purchasers that the goods are either knit like a sweater or are intended to be worn as a co-ordinate therewith. Giving due consideration to the suggestive nature of these marks, and to the differences between them when considered in their entireties, it is concluded that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers is not reasonably likely to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">On a request for reconsideration the board adhered to its decision, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE7\">\u201cUpon reconsideration, the Board remains of the opinion that the resemblances between the marks here involved are not such as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">We cannot agree with the decision of the board and we believe that, on careful analysis, it will be seen that the reasons it gave for its decision do not support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The argument in this case, and we presume it was the same before the board, revolves about the supposed \u201csuggestiveness\u201d of the word \u201csweater\u201d as applied to socks. Appellee bases its case on that notion and on it predicates arguments as to the persuasive value of a large number of precedents it has marshalled from the decisions of this court involving two-word marks one word of which was \u201csuggestive\u201d in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The first point made by the board is that SWEATER KNIT would \u201cmore than likely\u201d suggest that the socks are knit like a sweater. To us, this statement is practically devoid of meaning. We take judicial notice of the fact that both socks and sweaters are ordinarily knit. They 'resemble each other in that respect and the word \u201cknit\u201d aptly describes both. But what does \u201csweater knit\u201d mean, as applied to a sock? If knit <em>like </em>a sweater, then like what kind of a sweater ? The variety of knitting in sweaters would appear to equal the variety of knitting in socks, or even to exceed it. The only testimony on the point, which is uncontroverted, is to the effect that the term \u201csweater knit\u201d is unknown to the knitting industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Appellee, whose primary objective is to inject some definite meaning into the expression \u201csweater knit,\u201d contends that on the basis of the \u201cusual understanding of the words SWEATER and KNIT when combined together,\u201d the appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cis clearly suggestive as applied to bulky knit socks.\u201d Why bulky socks? Sweaters are not necessarily bulky. It is common knowledge that most sweaters are not bulky. Bulky sweaters, if we are correct in our understanding of the term, are but one type of sweater, wherefore the term \u201csweater\u201d as applied to a sock would not connote bulkiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">The most we can find in the term \u201csweater\u201d as part of a trademark for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>socks by way of suggestiveness is that it generates in the mind an <em>association </em>with something soft and warm. The generation of such mental associations, while avoiding the use of common descriptive terminology open to all to use, is one of the prime functions of trademarks of a certain type. It does not follow from the successful selection of such a suggestive trademark that others desirous of creating the same impression or association are free to imitate or copy the mark because of its suggestibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Appellant has referred us to the history of the prosecution of appellant\u2019s application to register its mark as proof of the \u201csuggestiveness\u201d of SWEATER KNIT. The prosecution referred to, however, is that wherein the examiner initially took the position that the mark was <em>descriptive </em>as applied to hosiery, within the meaning of section 2(e) (1) of the trademark act, a position from which the examiner withdrew. We are unable to see that this shows anything other than an admission of error on the part of the examiner as to his first impression. In any case, we are not in disagreement with the proposition that there is a suggestiveness of the kind we have referred to in appellant\u2019s mark, as there is suggestiveness in the trademark \u201cVelvet\u201d for smoking tobacco and in many other good trademarks which readily come to mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We feel that the board\u2019s other point, that SWEATER KNIT suggests that the hosiery is intended to be worn as \u201ccoordinates\u201d with sweaters, is even further afield.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Appellee has introduced five third-party registrations, \u201cFor the purpose of showing that the word SWEATER which is the only feature common to the trademarks here involved, is an apt term for various articles of wearing apparel * * The first is SWEAT-R-BLOUSE for knitted blouses and sweaters, Reg. No. 404,342. The next two are THE SWEATER GLOVE and THE SWEATERED HAND for knit gloves and mittens, Regs. No. 620,441-2. The last two are SWEATER GIRL and SWEATERETTE for brassieres, Regs. No. 586,494 and 655,887. The board made no mention of any of these registrations. None of them in any way relates to hosiery, the only goods here involved. There is no evidence that any of the marks are in use so as to have had an effect on the public mind. Four of the registrations issued from two to five years after appellant\u2019s adoption and first use of its mark. If these registrations show anything of significance here, it would seem to be that the term \u201csweater\u201d has no necessary connection with hosiery, is arbitrary when applied thereto as a trademark, and would not be likely to be considered suggestive of socks, as appellee contends, even when combined with the word \u201cknit.\u201d It is to be presumed that if anyone other than appellant and appellee had ever registered a mark including the word \u201csweater\u201d for socks or other hosiery that appellee would have cited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Finally, appellee argues that the \u201cequities\u201d of the situation favor it, basing this argument on the facts that its applications to register were copending with appellant\u2019s application and no interference was declared and that appellant did not file an opposition. The statute provides for cancellation proceedings as well as oppositions and interferences and we are inclined to believe that whatever \u201cequity\u201d may have accrued to appellee by virtue of appellant\u2019s choice of procedure, it is cancelled out by appellee\u2019s adoption of two marks including the word \u201csweater,\u201d the distinguishing feature of appellant\u2019s mark, long after the trademark SWEATER KNIT achieved a degree of popularity in the marketplace. The argument is also made that appellee obtained substantial rights by the registration of the marks SWEATER-MATES and SWEATER SOFT and should not be deprived of those rights unless a clear showing of error by the Patent Office is made. On the other hand, it is equally true that appellant obtained substantial rights not only from its registration but from its prior adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>tion and use and continuing use of SWEATER KNIT which appears to us from the record to have been quite distinctive until appellee came along. If the validity of appellee\u2019s arguments is accepted, however, the distinctive nature of appellant\u2019s mark would very likely be destroyed by other imitators following in appellee\u2019s footsteps.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">It is our opinion that with the three marks before us in concurrent use on identical goods confusion of the public would be likely; that the Patent Office was in error in granting appellee\u2019s registrations ; and that the board erred in dismissing the petition to cancel.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We have considered all of the prior decisions relied on by appellee but see no need to discuss them in detail. As we have often said, trademark issues of this character must be decided on the basis of the facts in each case. The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
