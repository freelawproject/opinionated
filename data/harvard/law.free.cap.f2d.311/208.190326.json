JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b288-20\">Petitioner\u2019s husband, David Essenfeld, on March 1, 1951 entered into an employment agreement with Supreme Sunrise Food Exchange, Inc., which hired him for 10 years, set his salary at fixed amounts plus a percentage of net profits above a certain sum, provided for payment upon his death while employed to his widow, or children if his wife predeceased him, of $25,000 per year for two years, and provided for termination of the contract on 6 months incapacity, with payments of $25,000 per year in monthly installments for two years, any balance on his death to go to widow or children, total of death and disability payments in no event to exceed $50,000. The contract also provided a retirement allowance if he retired after completing the 10 year contract term. The corporation, some months before the contract in question, had taken out life insurance with the corporation as beneficiary on three of the four principal shareholders including Essenfeld, in the amount of $75,000 each. None was taken out on the fourth, who was then 64 years of age. Essenfeld died on October 31,1952. The corporation received $75,000, the proceeds of the insurance on his life. The corporation voted to and did pay to taxpayer $25,000 per year for two years in equal monthly installments dating from Essenfeld\u2019s death. Taxpayer reported in her income tax return the $25,000 received in cal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>endar year 1953 less statutory exclusion of $5,000, later filing a timely claim for refund of the tax paid thereon. She did not include in her return for 1954 any of the amount, $20,833.34, received by her under the contract in that year. The Commissioner assessed deficiencies after eliminating $5,000 of the amount received, under the exclusion of \u00a7 22(b) (1) (B). The Tax Court, by Clarence V. Opper, Judge, held that the deficiencies were properly assessed, since the payments were not \u201clife insurance\u201d under \u00a7 22(b) (1) (A) and even if they could be so considered, would fall under \u00a7 22(b) (1) (B) as amounts received \u201cunder a contract of an employer providing for the payment of such amounts to the beneficiaries of an employee, paid by reason of the death of the employee;\u201d and so excludable only to the extent of $5,000. We hold that the employment contract under which the payments were made was not a life insurance contract, that the payments fall squarely within the provisions of \u00a7 22(b) (1) (B) and are excludable only in the amount of $5,000, and affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The evident purpose of the entire contract is to establish a coordinated system of payments to employees in consideration for their'services; payment in event of death is but one contingency for which the contract provides. We reject petitioner\u2019s attempt to consider the death-benefit provision in a vacuum. By no stretch of accepted meaning can this ordinary type of employment arrangement, with all its other provisions for compensation, be called a \u201clife insurance contract\u201d within the exclusion of \u00a7 22(b) (1) (A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even looking at the particular provision alone, we find no resemblance to life insurance. Premium payments are not required, nor is there a shifting and spreading of the risk of death in any meaningful sense. Cf. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531, 61 S.Ct. 646, 85 L.Ed. 996 (1941); Commissioner v. Treganowan, 183 F.2d 288 (2 Cir., 1950), cert. denied 340 U.S. 853, 71 S.Ct. 82, 95 L.Ed. 625. The payment is made under an employment contract, and is in terms taxable under \u00a7 22(b) (1) (B), except for the limited exclusion of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">Even assuming with petitioner that the contract in question may be called a \u201clife insurance contract\u201d and thus within \u00a7 22(b) (1) (A), although it seems more convincing to explain the addition of subsection (B) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as indicating that this type of contract is not within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the intendment of subsection (A), we see no reason why it is not within (B) as well. Where a particular and a general enactment may both be applicable, it is settled statutory construction that the particular, here subsection (B), will control.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">.

Section 22(b) (1) (B) was added to the 1939 Code in 1951. It was then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD7\">\u201cSection 22(b) (1) of the code excludes from gross income amounts received under a life-insurance contract paid by reason of the death of the insured, whether in a single sum or otherwise. However, by its terms, this provision is limited to life-insurance payments, and the exclusion does not extend to death benefits paid by an employer by reason of the death of an employee. In order to correct this hardship, section 302 of your committee\u2019s bill excludes from gross income death benefits not in excess of $5,000 paid by any one employer with respect to any single employee\u2019s beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with a preexisting contract. The limitation of the exclusion to payments not in excess of $5,000 will prevent abuses under this new provision.\u201d S.Rep. No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess.
