In summary, petitioner instituted suit under the federal antitrust laws against certain optical companies. The amended complaint in that suit listed nine different elements of damages including three recitals of loss of profits stemming from the wrongful acts alleged. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner in the amount of $325,000, and the court awarded triple this amount together with costs and charges, and attorneys\u2019 fees of $132,000. A motion for a new trial was granted, but the parties compromised their differences out of court \u2014 the petitioner receiving $478,142 in settlement, of which $132,000 was designated as attorneys\u2019 fees. No mention was made as to the proper alloca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tion of the remainder. In its tax return for 1951 the petitioner reported one-third of $478,142, or $159,880, as ordinary income; it reported the balance, $318,762, as nontaxable income with the explanation that it represented punitive damages awarded in the antitrust suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In 1955, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the punitive two-thirds portion of a treble-damage antitrust recovery constituted taxable income under Section 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426, 75 S.Ct. 473, 99 L.Ed. 483. This raling destroyed the basis for petitioner\u2019s claims in its 1951 return. In the instant Tax Court proceeding the petitioner took the position that, except for the $132,000 attorneys\u2019 fees included in the settlement, the remainder, or $346,142, consists of nontaxable return of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The Commissioner concluded and the Tax Court agreed that the $346,-142 remaining after deducting attorneys\u2019 fees constitutes reimbursement for lost profits. If this determination as to the nature of the recovery is sound, the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that it is taxable income is correct. Carter\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 298 F.2d 192 (8th Cir.1962), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 910, 82 S.Ct. 1257, 8 L.Ed.2d 404 (1962). The Co3nmissioner\u2019s determination has the support of a presumption of correctness and the taxpayer has the burden of proving it to be wrong. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933). A mere allegation of damages to \u201cgood will\u201d does not meet that burden. Carter\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">The Tax Court considered all the evidence presented to it. It noted particularly the fact that the settlement amount, after deducting attorneys\u2019 fees, was within $10.00 of the amount that Sager, petitioner\u2019s president, had claimed in the antitrust proceeding to be lost profits for the period January 1, 1936, through December 31, 1943.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also considered Sager\u2019s testimony in the instant case that the petitioner had invested some $50,000 in the destroyed business and that it valued the patronage and goodwill lost at $500,000. The Commissioner was not required to accept these estimates, made in a self-seiving context, as conclusive of the issue. Furthermore, he was not required to give undue weight to the many allegations in the antitrust complaint regarding injury to business and goodwill when the evidence supports rather pointedly a reimbursement-for-lost-profits determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">In order to carry its burden of proof, petitioner must do more than merely claim alternative designations for what it recovered \u2014 it must prove a designation so that some orderly tax treatment may be accorded it. The evidence adduced by petitioner is wanting in this respect. A conclusion made by taxpayer that the settlement payment was for destroyed capital or that goodwill was worth $500,000, or that $50,000 was invested in the business, is not that degree of proof necessary to overcome the presumptive correctness of the Commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>er\u2019s determination as a matter of law. Particularly is this so in view of the substantial evidence that supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding that only lost profits were accounted for in the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Petitioner relies heavily on the decision in Farmers\u2019 &amp; Merchants Bank v. Commissioner, 59 F.2d 912 (6th Cir., 1932), reversing 20 B.T.A. 622. In that case the petitioner had compromised a suit against the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and had listed the settlement amount, after deducting expenses, as nontaxable income. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals that had held the settlement proceeds to be taxable as reimbursement for lost earnings. In reversing the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cThe fund involved must be considered in the light of the claim from which it was realized and which is reflected in the petition filed in its action against the Reserve Bank. We find nothing therein to indicate, with the certainty required in the statement of a cause of action, that petitioner sought reparation for profits which petitioner\u2019s misconduct prevented it from earning in 1925. Charles E. Rous, petitioner\u2019s cashier, testified before the Board that the loss of such earnings <em>could not be definitely determined and this probably furnishes the explanation for the failure definitely to demand it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In its amended complaint in the antitrust proceeding, petitioner claimed damages for loss of profits in recitals (g), (h), and (i). As already mentioned, testimony of petitioner\u2019s president in that action showed lost profits of $346,-132 for the eight-year period in question. This sum plus attorneys\u2019 fees closely approximated the settlement amount. Obviously these facts clearly distinguish this case from that cited by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We are satisfied that the Tax Court\u2019s determination is based on substantial evidence. The Tax Court applied correct principles of tax law and therefore its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. Excerpts from testimony of Mr. Samuel N.
