MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b462-24\">This is an appeal from a final decree in an admiralty action in which the libellant (the shipper) sought damages for injury to cargo shipped on respondent\u2019s vessel, \u201cPalmetto State\u201d. The notice of appeal specifically seeks to review the questions \u201c(1) were the bulky heavy cases of libellant\u2019s cargo \u2018packages\u2019 within the terms of Section 4(5) of the U. S. Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (46 U.S.Code, Sec. 1304(5)), and of the bill of lading which incorporated that Act; (2) is respondent\u2019s liability for damage to libellant\u2019s cargo limited to $500 per boxed steel roll, as set out in the trial Court\u2019s Conclusions of Law Nos. 4 and 5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-25\">The cargo consisted of three rolls of steel, each weighing about 32% tons, and each fully boxed in separate wooden cases. The District Court held that the damage was attributable to respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>negligence in failing to adequately secure the cases, but limited respondent\u2019s liability to $500 per roll (i. e., per \u201cpackage\u201d) despite actual damage of approximately $31,000, pursuant to Section 4(5) of the Carriage of Goods at Sea Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(5) [hereafter cited as COGSA] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Once again presented to the courts is the troublesome conundrum: When is a package not a -package? The term \u201cpackage\u201d has been a subject of court consideration at least since 1874 when a British court decided that a four-wheeled wooden wagon without a top in which oil paintings were packed was a \u201cpackage or parcel\u201d and, hence, came within an Act limiting liability to \u00bfB10 per package. Whaite v. The Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Co., L.R. 9 Ex. 67 (1874). Cleasby, B., said: \u201cIt would be absurd to say that the wagon was too large to be a package; plainly, size cannot be a criterion.\u201d Although this may have been the British jurists\u2019 conception of a package at that date, some ninety years later a Federal trial judge found with equal certainty that \u201cA large tractor, weighing 43,319 pounds, is not within the purview of the layman\u2019s view of a \u2018package\u2019.\u201d Gulf Italia Co v. The Exiria, 160 F.Supp. 956, 959 (S.D.N.Y., 1958), affirmed sub. nom. Gulf Italia Co. v American Export Lines, Inc., 263 F.2d 135 (2d Cir., 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">However, the field of admiralty law is not an area in which the layman should venture to tread even if equipped with a Webster\u2019s Dictionary or Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. Black has defined a package as \u201cA bundle put up for transportation or commercial handling; a thing in form to become, as such, an article of merchandise or delivery from hand to hand.\u201d Paul Bunyan himself would have had difficulty in delivering three 32% ton crates \u201chand to hand\u201d. Appellant, therefore, argues (in brief) quite plausibly that \u201cit seems wholly unrealistic to characterize a 32% ton steel roll with the dimensions mentioned, as a \u2018bundle\u2019.\u201d But the layman\u2019s conception of a \u201cpackage\u201d as something carried under the arm from the comer grocery store is of no significance in deciding what is a package as specified in 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1304(5). No layman would have agreed with the three British jurists who were so certain that a wagon was a package.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">When Congress passed the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (49 Stat. 1207) in 1936 there had been several cases and some legislative discussion focusing attention upon the unusual concept of a \u201cpackage\u201d as a shipping term. The facts in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Reid v. Fargo, 241 U.S. 544, 36 S.Ct. 712, 60 L.Ed. 1156 (1916) dealing with an automobile in a crate were specifically referred to. Hearings before the Committee on Commerce, United States Senate, 74th Congress First Session, on a Bill relating to Carriage of Goods by Sea, May 10, 1935, pp. 38, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">It is unfortunate that no definition of a package was incorporated into the Act. It would have been comparatively easy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to have said that to be a \u201cpackage\u201d the article shipped must be in a completely enclosed box, or enclosed in a crate or even firmly secured to skids. Lacking any guides, the courts have had to cope with the situations as they have arisen. Not too surprisingly the results have not been uniform. Often, to bypass the \u201cpackage\u201d problem, the courts have resorted to the \u201cfreight unit\u201d clause of the Act, presumably trying thereby to minimize the differential between $500 and the actual loss. See Gulf Italia Co. v. American Export Lines, Inc., supra; Stirnimann v. The San Diego, 148 F.2d 141 (2d Cir., 1945); Middle East Agency v. The John B. Waterman, 86 F.Supp. 487 (S.D.N.Y., 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Only a limited number of cases have involved large heavy goods that were fully packaged. Deere &amp; Co. v. Mississippi Shipping Co., 170 F.Supp. 479 (E.D.La., 1959), held that liability for damage done to a boxed tractor would be limited to $500 but apparently the \u201cpackage\u201d problem was not argued to that court. Herd &amp; Co. v. Krawill Machinery Corp., 359 U.S. 297, 79 S.Ct. 766, 3 L.Ed. 2d 820 (1959) dealt with the question of whether this section was applicable to a negligent stevedore employed by the carrier to load cargo, the damaged article being a press fully crated, weighing 19 tons. Although rather implicit in the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the $500 limitation was not applicable to the stevedore is the thought that the limitation would have been applicable to the carrier, that question was not squarely decided by the Court. Nor does Gulf Italia Co. v. American Export Lines, Inc., supra, control this case, for there the majority clearly held the mere covering of certain portions of the tractor did not mean that the tractor was shipped in a package.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Appellant cites the opinions of the Superior Court of Genoa and the Genoa Court of Appeals holding that the $500 limitation was inapplicable to a fully boxed lathe weighing 25 tons. S.p.A. Fiat v. American Export Line, Appellant\u2019s Appendix at 42a, 57a. These opinions were reversed by the Supreme Court of Cassation, Appellant\u2019s Appendix at 69a, on grounds that need not concern us here, but which perhaps limit their precedential value. However, the rationale of the Genoa Court of Appeals would appear to be that the mere fact that an article is packaged does not preclude treatment of it in terms of freight units. If an article made up of several freight units be packaged, the court concluded that the limitation could be treated in terms of units. We do not read the statute in this way, but rather are of the opinion that treatment of packaged and nonpackaged goods was intended to be mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> We think that an article completely enclosed in a wooden box prepared for shipment is a \u201cpackage\u201d within Section 4(5) of COGSA, regardless of the size and weight of the package. We are met in this regard with the argument that this provision of COGSA was intended to \u201cprevent 'excessive claims in respect of small packages of great value,\u2019 but not to permit carriers to escape liability for just claims,\u201d Stirnimann v. The San Diego, supra, at 143 of 148 F.2d, and where the carrier is in fact aware of the greater value of an article fully packaged, the Act would be perverted to limit liability to $500. However, such a position is inconsistent with a policy obviously incorporated into the limitation of liability provision as applied to goods not shipped in packages. Petition of Isbrandtsen Co. v. United States, 201 F.2d 281 (2d Cir., 1952). In Isbrandtsen where damage was suffered by ten locomotives and tenders, the Court held that the unit for computing freight charges was a locomotive and tender and, therefore, limited liability to $5,000, the same result that would have been reached had the locomotives been in fact packaged. The policy behind the statute as interpreted in that case can hardly be said to be merely to prevent liability for excessive claims based on the undisclosed value of articles shipped at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">If the libellant had wished to escape this $500 limitation, it need only have inserted in the bill of lading the true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>value of the cargo and paid a higher freight rate to secure the greater coverage. In failing to do so in this case, libellant, by virtue of this statutory provision, took the risk of a greater loss on itself and cannot now be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, \u00a7 1304(5) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201cNeither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.
