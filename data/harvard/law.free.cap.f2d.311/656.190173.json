The case before us arises out of a dispute between the parties regarding provisions of the agreement covering deductions and checkoffs to be made by appellee from the wages of members of appellant, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj6\">\u201cSection 3.05. In the event an employee shall sign a deduction Authorization Card (the form is shown in Schedule \u2018C\u2019), and the card is in the Company\u2019s possession, the Company agrees, after the effective date of such card, to deduct the applicable initiation or reinstatement fee and/or Union membership dues from the first pay check issued the employee and thereafter the provisions of Section 3.06 shall govern. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4\">\u201cSection 3.06. When the employee has met the requirements of Section 3.05 above, the Company shall deduct from the earnings each month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>thereafter and pay to the Union the applicable Union membership dues, provided always that such deduction shall have been authorized by each employee from whose wages the deduction is made by written assignment filed with the Company as provided by Section 302(c) of the Labor Management Relations Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alr\">While the collective bargaining agreement was in force, members of appellant who were employed by appellee executed and delivered to appellee deduction authorization cards, addressed to appellee and in the form set out in Schedule \u201cC\u201d attached to the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In April, 1960, appellant\u2019s members voted an assessment of $10.00 per member per month as a special strike assessment to assist another local union with respect to a strike contemplated to be begun by the other local against the employer of its members. The assessment was to continue from month to month \u201cuntil the conclusion of negoti\u00e1tions in the Coeur d\u2019Alene and Metaline areas\u201d and was to be paid by appellant\u2019s members in addition to appellant\u2019s established $5.00 per month per member union dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Appellant notified appellee of the assessment vote and requested appellee to withhold the assessments from the wages of employees who had delivered deduction authorization cards to appellee, and to pay over the assessments to appellant, pursuant to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Appellee refused to check off the $10.00 strike assessment, though it continued to check off the $5.00 per month membership dues, and appellant thereupon filed its complaint in the district court. The complaint prayed, in a first cause of action, recovery of $3,145.00 and interest claimed to be due appellant from appellee for assessments due at the time of filing the complaint, and, in a second cause of action, recovery of the sums appellant claimed would be due it for assessments coming due by the date of trial. Each party moved in the district court for summary judgment in its favor. The district court, finding that there was no issue of fact in the case, denied appellant\u2019s motion and granted that of appellee, ruling (a) that the $10.00 strike assessments were not \u201cmembership dues\u201d within the meaning of Section 302(c) (4), Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 186(c) (4))<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> validating checkoffs, and (b) that such assessments were not \u201cdues, initiation fees or reinstatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fees\u201d within the meaning of the checkoff provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Judgment was entered dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint and awarding costs to appellee, and appellant appealed to this court. The district court had jurisdiction by .virtue of Section 301, Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185); and this court has jurisdiction under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Appellant asserts, and we agree, that the district court misconstrued Section 302, Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, when it held that the term \u201cmembership dues\u201d as used in the proviso (Section 302(c) (4)) does not include and thereby make lawful an employer\u2019s checkoff of \u201cassessments\u201d pursuant to written assignments from employee union members. The Department of Justice, the agency charged with enforcement of Section 302, after giving consideration to the penal character of the Section and its purpose, in an opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> construed the term \u201cmembership dues\u201d as used in Section 302 to cover \u201cassessments\u201d. This construction of Section 302 has been followed by the National Labor Relations Board<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was very recently approved in National Labor Relations Board v. Food Fair Stores, Inc. et al., 307 F.2d 3 (3d Cir., 1962). On the basis of these authorities, we find the district court\u2019s construction of Section 302(c) (4) incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">In urging upon us that the court below was accurate in its construction of Section 302(c) (4), appellee cites decisions of the National Labor Relations Board <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> holding that \u201cassessments\u201d are not within the term \u201cperiodic dues\u201d as used in Sections 8(a) (3) (B) and 8(b) (2) of the National Labor Relations Act; and appellee argues that such decisions should be followed in construing Section 302(c) (4). This contention is well answered by the Third Circuit\u2019s exposition in National Labor Relations Board v. Food Fair Stores, Inc., supra, of the differences in purposes and policies involved in the sections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-15\">\u201cIn acquiescing in the interpretation by the Department of Justice of Section 302 for the purpose of its administration of that statute in its penal aspects the Board did not bind itself to a similar construction in the administration of Sections 8(a) (3) and 8(b) (2). Two different policies are brought into play, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>operative effects of which create no conflict. Section 8(a) (3) prevents a union shop employer from discharging an employee at the request of the union unless he has reason to believe that only failure to pay uniform \u2018periodic dues\u2019 or \u2018initiation fees\u2019 is the sole cause of his lack of union membership, while Section 302, under the interpretation of the Department of Justice, permits an employer with a valid union security contract to deduct assessments, providing the employee has voluntarily signed an authorization as prescribed in the section. The broad construction granted in the administration of Section 302 by the Department of Justice is consistent with- the criminal character of the sanctions it embodies. The narrow construction applied by the Board to the enforcement of Sections 8(a) (3) and 8(b) (2) is consistent with the overall protection afforded by those sections to employees and equally creates no inconsistency with the enforcement of Section 302 for it is completely extrinsic thereto.\u201d 307 F.2d 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-3\">Turning to the alternative ground of the decision below \u2014 that assessments were not included within the term \u201cUnion membership dues\u201d as used in the checkoff provisions of the collective bargaining agreement \u2014 we hold that the district court\u2019s ruling on this question was premature and should not have been made on the motions for summary judgment. In the light of what has been pointed out earlier regarding the interpretation of the words \u201cmembership dues\u201d in Section 302, it is apparent that the meaning of the words \u201cUnion membership dues\u201d used in Sections 3.05 and 3.06 of the collective bargaining agreement (when considered together with the language of the agreement\u2019s Schedule \u201cC\u201d, Footnote 2, supra), is not so clear as to be self-evident; and that, accordingly, evidence outside the agreement itself is admissible to show what the parties meant by the words. What the parties meant by the words is a controlling issue of fact in this case, to be determined in a trial at which the parties may offer evidence in aid of their respective interpretations of the language used.

While entered into on March 6, 1957, the contract by its tei-ms covers the period July 1, 1956, to June 30, 1958, and thereafter so long as extended by mutual written agreement. The record discloses that a contract containing terms and provisions very similar to those in the agreement now before the court was made between the parties and was in force from July 1, 1955 to June 30, 1956. Other collective bargaining agreements between the parties were in effect for some period of time before July 1, 1955, but the provisions of these agreements are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-5\">. \u201cSchedule \u2018C\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\u201cTo ................</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">\u201cI hereby assign to Local Union No. 515, I.U.M.M. &amp; S.W., from my wages such sum per month as may be fixed hereafter by said Local Union as its uniform initiation fees, fines, assessments, and/or other monthly dues, as limited by the contract between the Union and the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">\u201cI hereby authorize and direct you to deduct such amounts as may be due by virtue of this assignment and authorization from my-pay each month and to remit such amounts to said Local Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">\u201cThis assignment and authorization shall be irrevocable for a period of one year from the date hereof or until the termination of the collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Union, whichever occurs sooner.

In a memorandum, dated July 10, 1947. we furnished the Attorney General with our views on this question, stating that initiation fees and assessments, being incidents of membership, should be considered as falling within the classification of \u2018membership dues\u2019.
