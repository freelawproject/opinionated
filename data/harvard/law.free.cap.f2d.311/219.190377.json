He was represented by counsel at the trial and at the imposition of sentence. Notice of appeal was filed on August 20, 1962, by permission of the sentencing court. The Government has filed a motion to docket and dismiss. The motion must be granted because the law is well settled that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional. United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259; Wilkinson v.
