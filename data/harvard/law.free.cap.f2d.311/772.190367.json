Miller and Wright, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b852-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">Appellant and his co-defendant, Flurry, were convicted of housebreaking, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1801, primarily on the testimony of two policemen. Appellant, taking the stand in his own behalf, admitted being in the vicinity of the store concerned in the charge at 3:00 o\u2019clock in the morning, but denied that either he or his companion, Flurry, had entered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-19\">While Flurry was on the witness stand, the following colloquy occurred in the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-20\">\u201cThe Court: How is it or why is it that you and Cunningham were out on the streets at three o\u2019clock in the morning ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-22\">\u201cDefendant Flurry: Well, Your Honor, I was g'oing to see Yernon Nelson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-23\">\u201cThe Court: At three o\u2019clock in the morning ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-25\">\u201cDefendant Flurry: Well sir, he gets off from work at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-26\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you could see him before he goes to work, couldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-28\">\u201cDefendant Flurry: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-29\">\u201cThe Court: You ought to have been in bed. Honest people are in bed at three o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-30\">Subsequently, counsel for the defendants objected to the remark of the court and requested that he withdraw it. The request was summarily denied. At that time the following colloquy between counsel for the defense, the trial judge and the prosecutor transpired out of the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-31\">\u201cMr. Burke: Your Honor, with humble apologies to Your Honor, but Your Honor made the statement, while Mr. Flurry was on the stand, that honest people are in bed at this hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-33\">\u201cThe Court: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-34\">\u201cMr. Burke: And I wonder if Your Honor will ask the jury to disregard that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cThe Court: No, I never ask the jury to disregard my statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkW\">\u201cMr. Burke: Wouldn\u2019t that be prejudicial against this witness? Wouldn\u2019t that be prejudicial against this witness ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-10\">\u201cThe Court: The circumstance is prejudicial, not my statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-12\">\u201cMr. Smith [Prosecutor]: I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear His Honor say honest\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-14\">\u201cThe Court: I said that honest people are in bed at three o\u2019clock in the morning. I said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-15\">\u201cMr. Smith: I didn\u2019t hear that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-17\">\u201cMr. Burke: Well, Your Honor, just to protect myself, I move at this time for a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">The Government, in an apparent effort to salvage its case, asked the court to charge the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-19\">\u201cNow, if perchance, during the course of this trial, the court made any statement about the case or the testimony of any witness, you are not to regard this statement as an expression by the court of the guilt or innocence of either defendant. Nor are you to regard such a statement as an expression by the court as to the credibility of any witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcP\">This request was summarily denied during the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-20\">\u201cMr. Smith [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, I wonder if I could submit a requested instruction which I have served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-22\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, you may do so. Have you given a copy to the other side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-24\">\u201cMr. Smith: Yes, Your Honor, to both attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-25\">\u201c(Brief Pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-26\">\u201cThe Court: No, I am going to deny that because the court has a right to express its opinion as to guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">\u201cMr. Smith: I wondered if Your Honor would charge the jury that this is not binding upon them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-27\">\u201cThe Court: I always do that. I appreciate the care that you have taken in preparing this, but it is really unnecessary labor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-28\">Included in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury was the following instruction, to which appellant took timely exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ars\">\u201cNow, at this point I want to say that if you accept the testimony of the officers \u2014 and there is no reason why you should not, they appeared to me to be perfectly disinterested; but it is for you to say, of course\u2014 the officers\u2019 testimony is sufficient, if you accept it, to constitute, without anything further, proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendants\u2019 guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-29\">Under the familiar principles announced in Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933); Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U.S. 135, 41 S.Ct. 53, 65 L.Ed. 185 (1920); United States v. DeSisto, 2 Cir., 289 F.2d 833 (1961); Blunt v. United States, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 244 F.2d 355 (1959); and Billeci v. United States, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 184 F.2d 394 (1950), we think the appellant should have a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-30\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b853-31\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AY8\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-32\">My view is that the quoted remarks of the trial judge did not prejudice the appellant. The evidence of his guilt was so strong and convincing that I think the jury inevitably would have found him guilty, even if the statements complained of had not been made. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
