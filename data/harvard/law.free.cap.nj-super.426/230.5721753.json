Although plaintiffs unrebutted testimony \u2014 that, one evening, she and defendant sat together, danced together, and were together for a few hours at the bar \u2014 may have been sufficient to support a finding that the parties were on a \u201cdate,\u201d there was no evidence of anything more than this single date and, thus, no evidence of the \u201cdating relationship\u201d required by the Act. We, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">To obtain a final restraining order pursuant to the Act, a plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence that: he or she is a \u201cvictim of domestic violence,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19(d); the defendant committed a predicate act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19(a); and a restraining order \u201cis necessary ... to protect the victim from an immediate danger or to prevent further abuse,\u201d <em>Silver v. Silver, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 127, 903 A.2d 446 (App.Div.2006) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Here, only plaintiff testified at trial. Defendant did not attend the hearing and appeared only through counsel. The parties stipulated to the records relating to defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution in Israel. Plaintiffs unrebutted testimony and the stipulated documents demonstrated that plaintiff was on a trip to Israel with approximately forty others, including defendant. The parties had not met before the trip began. On May 31, 2010, a few days after arriving in Israel, plaintiff, defendant and others attended a group function. Later that night, or in the early morning hours of June 1, 2010, plaintiff, a female friend of plaintiffs, and defendant walked to plaintiffs room. The Jerusalem District Court\u2019s decision, which the parties stipulated into evidence, contains a finding that defendant then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">attempted to kiss [plaintiff] and she pushed him back and immediately entered her room. When she went out again, in order to walk to her friend\u2019s room and ask her to wake her up in the morning, she was noticed by [defendant, who ran towards her, jumped on her, for no reason, and began attacking her harshly, even after she had become unconscious. The [defendant did not stop until a resident of the place pulled him away from her and removed him from the place. As a result of the assault, [plaintiff] incurred severe bruises, broken orbit, fractures in jaw, tooth, cuts that required stitching and injury to the left lung.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant admitted this conduct and was sentenced to an eight-and-one-half-month jail term, which was ordered to be served through community service with credit for defendant\u2019s incarceration for ten weeks following his arrest. Defendant was also ordered to pay plaintiff $57,000 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">These undisputed facts amply demonstrated the occurrence of a predicate act of such severity and viciousness that the need for a restraining order, as we said in <em>Silver, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 127, 903 A.2d 446, was \u201cperfunctory and self-evident.\u201d The only matter in dispute was whether plaintiff could be said to be a \u201cvictim of domestic violence\u201d as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Not every person injured by another is entitled to the Act\u2019s protections. The term \u201cvictim of domestic violence\u201d was originally limited to persons eighteen years of age or older, or emancipated minors, who were \u201csubjected to domestic violence by a spouse, former spouse, or any other person who is a present or former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>household member,\u201d as well as \u201ca person with whom the victim has a child in common, or with whom the victim anticipates having a child in common, if one of the parties is pregnant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff fits none of these descriptions. The term \u201cvictim of domestic violence,\u201d however, was amended in 1994, <em>see L. </em>1994, c. 93, \u00a7 1, to include \u201cany person who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person with whom the victim has had a dating relationship.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff asserted that her relationship to defendant met the requirements of this last description, and the trial judge agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Unlike its counterparts in other states, our Legislature has not defined what it meant by a \u201cdate\u201d or a \u201crelationship\u201d or by the words in tandem. Instead, the Legislature left it to the courts to ascertain the scope of this term. Even though the Act is remedial in nature and is to be liberally construed in favor of encompassing as many victims as reasonably permitted by the Act\u2019s language, <em>see Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400, 713 A.2d 390 (1998); <em>J.S. v. J.F., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611, 614-15, 983 A.2d 1151 (App.Div.2009), we conclude that the evidence did not support the judge\u2019s finding of a dating relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In 2003, one trial judge attempted to determine \u201cwhat constitutes a \u2018dating relationship.\u2019\u201d <em>Andrews v. Rutherford, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 253, 832 A.2d 379 (Ch.Div.2003). Based on common principles suggested by other state statutes, Judge Michael J. Hogan developed a six-question test for ascertaining the existence of a dating relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">1. Was there a minimal social interpersonal bonding of the parties over and above a mere casual fraternization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">2. How long did the alleged dating activities continue prior to the acts of domestic violence alleged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">3. What were the nature and frequency of the parties\u2019 interactions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">4. What were the parties\u2019 ongoing expectations with respect to the relationship, either individually or jointly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">5. Did the parties demonstrate an affirmation of their relationship before others by statement or conduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">6. Are there any other reasons unique to the case that support or detract from a finding that a \u201cdating relationship\u201d exists?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>[Id. at 260, 832 A.2d 379 (footnote omitted) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We conclude that <em>Andrews </em>poses the appropriate questions to be considered when the existence of a dating relationship is disputed while recognizing that, if applicable, other factors unique to the parties should also be weighed. <em>Cf. J.S., supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 614, 983 A.2d 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We embrace the <em>Andrews </em>factors mainly because they appear consistent with the common themes developed by the great majority of other states\u2019 domestic violence laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We adopt this approach because there is no evidence that our Legislature intended to recognize as a dating relationship anything other than what those words might ordinarily connote. <em>See Nobrega v. Edison Glen Assocs., </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 772 A.2d 368 (2001) (holding that, absent evidence of a contrary intention, the words of a statute should be given their ordinary meaning).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Although there are many variations in the domestic violence laws enacted in other states, those that have described the param<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>eters of a dating relationship<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have defined a date as a \u201csocial relationship of a romantic nature,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while excluding \u201ca casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between [two] individuals in a business or social context.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And many states, in describing the relationship required to invoke the protections of domestic violence laws emphasize, as relevant here, the frequency <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and duration<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the parties\u2019 interpersonal associations. Until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>our Legislature provides greater insight, we will assume the Legislature intended a meaning similar to the majority of other states and, therefore, conclude that <em>Andrews </em>provides the appropriate outline for such determinations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>Certainly, if there was a legislative intent to create a broader definition of \u201cdating relationship\u201d than recognized in nearly every other state that includes the concept in its domestic violence laws, there would be some evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">To be sure, the question posed is fact-sensitive. Here, the judge, in examining the facts in light of <em>Andrews, </em>found that the parties were on a \u201cbirthright trip\u201d to Israel with forty other persons. The judge determined that the parties \u201chung out together,<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> within this group,\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">on the night of ... the incident, the defendant sat next to the plaintiff at dinner; although there was other available seating. He asked her what she was doing later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>on that night, after dinner. They had, in fact, spoken throughout the dinner. And the plaintiff indicated that she would be hanging out at the bar with her friends, and the defendant asked to join them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">While at the bar, she danced with the defendant and he later walked, both she and her friend, to [her] room. Although his efforts to kiss her were rejected by the plaintiff, she believed that on the night of this incident, they were in fact on a date-<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">This evidence might arguably suggest an affirmative response to the first <em>Andrews </em>factor: that during the night in question there was \u201cinterpersonal bonding of the parties over and above a mere casual fraternization.\u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 260, 832 A.2d 379. Although the evidence could have led to a contrary conclusion, the judge\u2019s finding that the parties were on \u201ca date\u201d during the evening in question is entitled to our deference because it is supported by evidence the judge found credible. <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 411-13, 713 A.2d 390 (holding that \u201cfindings by the trial court are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence\u201d and recognizing that, \u201c[bjecause of the family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters, appellate courts should accord deference to family court factfinding\u201d). But the evidence precludes an affirmative answer to any of the other six <em>Andrews </em>factors. Prior to the night in question, there was no \u201congoing expectation ] with respect to the relationship,\u201d and the parties did not \u201cdemonstrate an affirmation of their relationship before others by statement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>conduct.\u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 260, 832 A.2d 379.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In short, the parties\u2019 interaction on the evening in question, prior to the assault, may arguably be viewed as a date but there had been no previous dates and, thus, no \u201cdating relationship.\u201d To take a more expansive view of the circumstances would lead to the unwarranted possibility that the Act would apply \u201cwhere two people meet for a lunch date or date at the movies only on one occasion,\u201d or \u201cwhere two individuals have a onetime casual lunch or \u2018dinner date.\u2019 \u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257, 832 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">To summarize, we hold that an interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19(d) that would apply the Act to two persons who had a single date would give far too much weight to the word \u201cdating\u201d and too little weight to the word \u201crelationship.\u201d If the Legislature intended to permit the Act\u2019s protections to apply to persons who had a single date, it would have defined \u201cvictim of domestic violence\u201d as any person who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person whom the victim has dated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By requiring evidence of a \u201cdating relationship,\u201d the Legislature undoubtedly intended something of greater frequency or longer duration than a single date.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The order under review is reversed and the matter remanded for entry of an order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> Not all states have included persons in dating relationships within the class of persons victimized by domestic violence. <em>See Fla.

That report was not offered during the trial. Defendant has provided this statement to rebut plaintiff's testimony at trial that she believed she was on a date with defendant on the evening in question. We also permitted supplementation of the record to include plaintiff's opposing certification, in which she asserted that the June 1, 2010 statement: is incomplete; is unreliable because it was translated from English to Hebrew and back to English; that it is otherwise not accurate; that she was \"groggy, confused and in great pain\u201d at the time; and that the broken bones in her face and jaw, and her other injuries, caused her speech to be \"slurred\u201d and likely misunderstood. Upon further consideration, we have decided the issues on appeal without resort to the June 1, 2010 statement or plaintiff's opposing certification because they were not part of the trial record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\"> It is also noteworthy that the parties to this action never seem to have been alone at any point during the evening. Even when they left the gathering that evening, plaintiff and defendant were not alone but walked to plaintiff\u2019s room in the company of another. The record suggests that the parties were only alone together when defendant suddenly appeared and viciously assaulted plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> Alaska describes one class of domestic violence victims as \"adults or minors who are dating <em>or have dated,\u201d Alaska Stat. </em>\u00a7 18.66.990 (2012) (emphasis added), and is, thus, the only state that might arguably permit the sufficiency of a single date as a ground for invoking the domestic violence laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
