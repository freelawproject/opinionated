Lyndhurst entered into a contract with defendant Daibes Brothers to be the construction manager for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Lyndhurst also entered into a contract with defendant Bravante Automatic Sprinkler to perform sprinkler work. This contract obligated Bravante to name Lyndhurst and Daibes as additional insureds under its comprehensive general liability policy, which had been issued by third-party defendant International Insurance of Hanover (Hanover). Bravante obtained an endorsement to its policy providing such additional insured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Salvatore Gabriele was employed by Bravante as its foreman for the sprinkler work it performed for Lyndhurst. On August 3, 2005, a pallet fell off the sixth floor of the building striking Gabriele in the head and killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Josephine Gabriele, as administratrix of Salvatore\u2019s estate and administratrix prosequendum, brought this survivorship and wrongful death action against Lyndhurst, Daibes and various other contractors on the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Lyndhurst and Daibes sought coverage from Hanover as additional insureds under the Bravante policy. Hanover disclaimed coverage pursuant to two exclusions in its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Daibes filed a third-party complaint against Hanover seeking a declaration that Hanover was obligated to provide a defense and indemnity for any judgment that might be entered in the Gabriele action. This third-party complaint was brought before the trial court for decision by cross-motions for summary judgment. The court concluded in a written decision that neither of the two exclusions relied upon by Hanover applied to the Gabriele claim against Daibes and therefore declared that Hanover was obligated to provide Daibes coverage in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">During trial, the claim against Daibes was settled for the $1 million liability limit of the Hanover policy, with Hanover reserving its right to appeal the declaration of its obligation to provide Daibes with coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>That appeal is now before us. Hanover argues that coverage for Daibes under the policy is precluded by exclusions both for a claim for personal injury to \u201can employee of any insured\u201d and for any liability for personal injury that does not arise solely out of the named insured Bravante\u2019s work. We conclude that the first of these exclusions applies to preclude coverage to Daibes for the Gabriele action. Thus, there is no need for us to consider the second of the exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Initially, we note that \u201c[exclusions in [an] insurance policy should be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>Nav-Its, Inc. v. Selective Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>110, 119, 869 A.2d 929 (2005). \u201cNevertheless, if [an] exclusion is \u2018specific, plain, clear, prominent, and not contrary to public policy,\u2019 it will be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>80, 95, 698 A.2d 9 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The exclusion we conclude is dispositive of this appeal, which is contained in an endorsement entitled \u201cExclusion-Employees, Persons &amp; Organization,\u201d and is referred to by Hanover as the CVX endorsement, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">1. the policy to which this endorsement attaches,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">It is agreed that <em>this insurance does not apply to \u201cBodily injury,\u201d </em>\u201cProperty Damage\u201d <em>or \u201cPersonal Injury\u201d to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">(1) <em>An \u201cemployee\u201d of any Insured </em>or to any \u201cperson\u201d or \u201corganization\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">(a) resulting from discrimination based on, but not limited to, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, handicap, political or sexual preference, whether or not for alleged violation of any federal, state or local governmental law or regulation prohibiting such discrimination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">(b) arising out of, caused by, or related to the employment practices of any insured including, but not limited to, hiring, negligent hiring or hiring practices, negligent training, or negligent supervision, termination, layoff, disciplinary procedures, promotion and failure to promote;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">(c) resulting from sexual harassment by any insured or by any other \u201cemployee\u201d of any insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(d) <em>arising out of or in the course of, or as a consequence of, employment by any insured;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">(e) arising out of or in the course of, or as a consequence of, association with any insured ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Hanover relies upon subsection (d) of this exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">In <em>American Wrecking Corp. v. Burlington Insurance Co., </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 281, 946 A.2d 1084 (App.Div.2008), we construed a nearly identical exclusion, which stated that \u201c[t]his insurance does not apply to any actual \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 [or] \u2018personal injury\u2019 ... to [an] ... employee of any insured[,]\u201d to exclude coverage for a personal injury claim by three workers against contractors at an industrial site who were named as additional insureds in the liability policy of another contractor. In rejecting the additional insureds\u2019 argument that this exclusion applied only to the named insured, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">Standing by itself, the phrase \u201cemployee of any insured\u201d is crystal clear. In short, \u201cany\u201d does not mean \u201cthe\u201d insured, it means \u201cany\u201d insured, which, of course, is its ordinary meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 283, 946 A.2d 1084.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Daibes does not dispute that, considered in isolation, the language of subsection (d) would exclude it from coverage under the Hanover policy for the Gabriele fatal accident. However, Daibes advances two arguments why subsection (d) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">First, Daibes argues that subsection (d) must be read in light of subsections (a), (b) and (c) to exclude coverage only for employment-related claims, such as for termination, discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, religion, sex or one of the other proscribed grounds set forth in subsection (a). Daibes argues that subsections (d) and (e) are simply \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions designed to extend the exclusions provided under subsections (a), (b) and (c) to employment-related claims that would not otherwise fall within the literal terms of those first three subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>On an initial review, it may appear incongruous that the exclusion provided by subsection (d), which would apply more frequently than the exclusions set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c), especially to insureds such as Bravante and Daibes who are involved in construction work, would be set forth in the fourth rather than the first subsection of the CVX endorsement. However, there is a historical explanation for the structure of this endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. v. L-C-A Sales Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>29, 31, 713 A.2d 1007 (1998), the Court was confronted with the question whether an \u201cemployee exclusion\u201d similar to the one set forth in subsection (d) excluded coverage for a wrongful termination claim under the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49, in the absence of exclusions similar to those set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (e) that specifically address such claims. In a preliminary section of its opinion, the Court indicated that insurance earners had devised more specific exclusions, such as those set forth in subsection (a), (b) and (c), out of concern that a general employee exclusion, such as the one set forth in subsection (d), would be found not to encompass employment-related claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQM\">The employee exclusion contained in the <em>Kemper </em>and <em>Michigan Mutual </em>policies [which was similar to subsection (d) of the endorsement in the Hanover policy] is the standard form of employee exclusion first introduced by insurers in the 1970s. See Jonathan S. Reed, <em>Shredding the Employment Exclusion, </em>152 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>324 (April 27,1998). As the number of employment-related discrimination and harassment claims has increased in recent years, the insurance industry strengthened the employee exclusion by inserting specific language barring coverage for injuries arising out of discrimination, termination and harassment of employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 34, 713 A.2d 1007.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The Court ultimately concluded that a general employee exclusion such as subsection (d) should be read to encompass an exclusion from coverage for a LAD wrongful termination claim. <em>Id. </em>at 38-44, 713 A.2d 1007. However, as we subsequently held in <em>American Wrecking, </em>there was never any question in <em>American Motorists </em>that a general employee exclusion applies to a personal injury or wrongful death claim such as the one asserted by the Gabriele estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>It arguably would have been more logical for the draftsman of the CVX endorsement to have placed the general employee exclusion first and the more specific exclusions for employment-related claims after that exclusion. However, we do not believe that the mere placement of the well-understood general employee exclusion after the new more specific exclusions for employment-related claims is a sufficient reason to give that general exclusion a more restrictive construction than it was given in cases such as <em>American Wrecking </em>when it stood alone unaccompanied by such specific exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Daibes\u2019s second argument why subsection (d) of the CVX endorsement does not exclude coverage for the Gabriele claim is that this exclusion is inconsistent with one of the exclusions in the basic coverage provisions of the policy, which only excludes coverage for a personal injury claim against \u201cthe named insured.\u201d The section of the Hanover policy upon which Daibes relies in support of this argument provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">SECTION 1 \u2014 COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">COVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY 2. Exclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">e. Employer\u2019s Liability \u201cBodily Injury\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">(1) An \u201cemployee\u201d of <em>the insured </em>arising out of and in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">(a) Employment by the insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">(b) Performing duties relating to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business;____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">Daibes argues that \u201cthe insured,\u201d as used in this section, unlike the term \u201cany insured\u201d used in subsection (d) of the CVX endorsement, refers solely to the named insured Bravante and not to additional insureds such as Daibes, <em>see Argent v. Brady, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 349-52, 901 A.2d 419 (App.Div.2006) (indicating that the term \u201cthe insured\u201d is generally understood to refer solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>to the named insured), and that this exclusion prevails over the more expansive exclusion contained in subsection (d), or at least creates an ambiguity concerning the scope of that exclusion that should be resolved in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We reject this argument because the language of the endorsement makes it clear that the exclusions set forth therein prevail over the general coverage provisions of the policy, including any exclusions contained in those provisions. The top of the page containing the CVX endorsement expressly states: \u201cTHIS ENDORSEMENT <em>CHANGES </em>THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.\u201d (emphasis added). By use of the word \u201cchanges,\u201d the endorsement clearly advised Hanover\u2019s insureds that it was making the scope of coverage different than what it would have been under the original policy, and that it was substituting the provisions in the endorsement for those in the basic policy. This conclusion is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cchange,\u201d and unless a contrary intent appears, \u201cthe words of an insurance policy should be given their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Moreover, the endorsement goes on to state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">1. <em>the policy to which this endorsement attaches</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">It is agreed that this insurance does not apply to____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Based upon Hanover\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in ... the policy to which this endorsement attaches,\u201d the CVX endorsement clearly notified the insureds that it would apply regardless of any seemingly inconsistent provision of the basic policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">Our conclusion that the exclusion contained in the CVX endorsement is controlling is also supported by the general principle of insurance law that \u201cwhen an order or endorsement modifies, qualifies or restricts the terms of the original policy, the order or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>endorsement controls.\u201d 2 G. Couch, <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d, \u00a7 21.22 (2010); <em>see also </em>4 Eric Mills Holmes, <em>Appleman on Insurance </em>2d, \u00a7 20.1 (1998) (\u201cIf any irreconcilable conflict exists between provisions of the policy and provisions of an endorsement, then the latter must control.\u201d). The rationale of this principle is that \u201cwhen a specific form of insurance is provided by an endorsement tailored to meet the particular needs of the insured and the [insurance] company, that language must be followed to carry out the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>655 F.2d 521, 524 (3d Cir.1981). Applying this principle, we are satisfied that the CVX endorsement excluding coverage to Daibes for the Gabriele accident reflects the intention of the Hanover policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Daibes argues in the final point of its brief that Hanover is \u201crequired to provide coverage to satisfy Bravante\u2019s contractual defense/indemnification obligation in favor of [Daibes].\u201d This argument was not presented to the trial court on Daibes\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the argument is not properly before us. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Accordingly, the summary judgment in Daibes\u2019 favor is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> Gabriele's claims against the other defendants were also settled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
