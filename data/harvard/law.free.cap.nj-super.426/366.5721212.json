HARRIS, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We view these back-to-back appeals upon the esoteric regulatory landscape of state-administered medical assistance programs funded by Title XIX (Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs) and Title XXI (State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) of the Social Security Act. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396; 42 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1397aa. Appellants S.J., R.H., and C.B. were precluded from receiving healthcare benefits by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services\u2019s (the Division) closure (to new applicants) of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which operated under the NJ FamilyCare rubric.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although once eligible for NJ FamilyCare benefits as part of a program funded and administered by AFDC-related Medicaid, appellants lost their eligibility due to their increased income. They appeal the Division\u2019s individualized determinations that after losing their AFDC-related Medicaid eligibility, they became new applicants for purposes of the SCHIP, which barred new enrollees after February 28, 2010. They contend that the Division was obliged to transfer their entitlement and continue their healthcare benefits under the auspices of the SCHIP within the NJ Family-Care program. We consolidate the appeals for purposes of this opinion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We derive the factual background of these appeals from three separate administrative proceedings. There do not appear to be many, if any, genuine factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In October 2008, S.J. (and her minor grandson) began receiving healthcare benefits through NJ FamilyCare. S.J.\u2019s particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>benefits, referred to as AFDC-related Medicaid, were provided under the program\u2019s Title XIX segment. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:69-1.1 to - 12.10. Pursuant to the Division\u2019s rules, S.J. was subject to regular redeterminations to assess her continuing eligibility for AFDC-related Medicaid. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:69-5.2 (\u201cRedetermination is a review of factors affecting AFDC-related Medicaid eligibility, including, but not limited to, continued parental deprivation, or changes in income.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">On November 22, 2010, S.J. was approved to begin receiving federal Social Security disability benefits in the amount of $1011 per month on December 22, 2010. As a result of this unearned income, the Hudson County Division of Social Services terminated 5. J. (but not her grandson) from the NJ FamilyCare program, effective January 1, 2011. The termination notice explained that \u201c[a]s part of State Regulations effective [March 1, 2010,] [a]dults with unearned income ... are no longer eligible to receive [NJ] Family[C]are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The putative authority for this termination was based upon the March 2, 2010 directive, contained in Medicaid Communication No. 10-01 issued by John Guhl, Director of the Department of Human Services (DHS). The directive stated that because of New Jersey\u2019s \u201cunprecedented financial crisis,\u201d the Commissioner of the DHS intended to \u201cmodify enrollment levels in the NJ FamilyCare program as deemed necessary to ensure that monies expended for that program do not exceed the amount appropriated.\u201d To reduce enrollment, the directive stated that \u201c[n]ew applications received on or after March 1, 2010[,] for NJ FamilyCare [would] no longer be processed for enrollment for higher income parents.\u201d On July 6, 2010, the directive was adopted by the Commissioner of the DHS, and incorporated into the DHS\u2019s regulatory framework. 42 <em>N.J.R. </em>1404(a) (Jul. 6, 2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>S.J.\u2019s newly-increased income triggered her ineligibility to receive AFDC-related Medicaid benefits, but did not arithmetically disqualify her from the higher-ineome-qualifying SCHIP-related healthcare benefits. However, because this occurred after February 29, 2010, S.J. was deemed a new applicant for benefits excluded from enrollment under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.4(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">For all enrollment applications received after February 28, 2010, all programs under this chapter are closed to any enrollments of, or benefits for, parents and caretakers whose benefits are not funded or payable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, except as described in (b)l below. Therefore, such applications for such persons will not be processed for enrollment. This exclusion from enrollment and benefits additionally applies to parents or caretakers who are applying to enroll after being terminated from enrollment in the NJ FamilyCare Program, including, but not limited to, individuals who have been terminated due to nonpayment of premiums or other amounts due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">S.J. requested a \u201cfair hearing\u201d to (1) contest her expulsion from NJ FamilyCare, (2) challenge her new applicant classification, and (3) reverse the determination not to process her application for SCHIP-related healthcare benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">On May 3, 2011, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) reversed the termination of benefits and restored S.J. to the NJ Family-Care program. The ALJ found that the language of the amended DHS regulations unambiguously closed applications only to new applicants, rather than to existing beneficiaries of NJ FamilyCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">On June 6, 2011, Valerie J. Harr, Director of the Division, reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Director Harr explained, \u201calthough the NJ FamilyCare Program is often characterized as an \u2018umbrella\u2019 which includes AFDC-related Medicaid, there are actually two distinct provisions of the Social Security Act that address eligibility for the NJ FamilyCare Program.\u201d Those two segments have different eligibility requirements. Under the AFDC-related Medicaid segment, the income requirements set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:69-10.3(b) must be satisfied. Under the SCHIP segment, higher-ineom\u00e9 parents qualify as long as the applicant\u2019s income remained below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.4(a)(6)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>However, no new applications to the SCHIP segment received on or after March 1, 2010, were to be processed. Thus, Director Harr found that S.J., as a beneficiary under the AFDC-related Medicaid segment of NJ FamilyCare, could not transfer into the SCHIP because she was a new applicant to that specific segment, and it was closed to new applicants. Because S.J.\u2019s unearned income precluded her from receiving AFDC-related Medicaid healthcare benefits, and because the SCHIP was closed to new applicants, S.J. could not receive benefits under either segment within the orbit of NJ FamilyCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">S.J.\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In April 2006, R.H. and her son and daughter began receiving AFDC-related Medicaid healthcare benefits under NJ Family-Care. On November 10, 2010, R.H. was notified by the Passaic County Board of Social Services that her and her then-nineteen-year-old daughter\u2019s healthcare benefits were being terminated on December 31, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The termination was due to R.H.\u2019s increased unearned income, namely her receipt of unemployment benefits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which caused the household income to exceed the income limits of AFDC-related Medicaid. R.H. was denied entry into the SCHIP because that program was closed to new applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">R.H. appealed the termination of her benefits, but not her daughter\u2019s. On November 30, 2010, she requested a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d On April 6, 2011, an ALJ upheld R.H.\u2019s termination. On June 9, 2011, Director Harr adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that R.H. was a new applicant to the SCHIP, and therefore \u201c[could not] move into the [SCHIP] program because the program closed to those individuals who were not already receiving benefits under [SCHIP] or had not submitted an application prior to March 1, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">R.H.\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In March 2006,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> C.B. and her minor child began receiving Medicaid payments. In January 2009, C.B.\u2019s Medicaid benefits were converted to AFDC-related Medicaid healthcare benefits under NJ FamilyCare. On May 31, 2010, C.B. was notified by the Passaic County Board of Social Services that her and her son\u2019s healthcare benefits were being terminated. Although these benefits were later reinstated,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> C.B. received a notice on December 21, 2010, terminating her healthcare benefits effective January 31, 2011. The termination notice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">Effective March 1, 2010, higher income parents are no longer eligible for NJ FamilyCare. These parents are identified by Program Status Codes of 497 or 498 due to unearned income. You may re-apply if your circumstances change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">At termination, C.B. was receiving $1624.88 per month in unemployment benefits, placing her above the AFDC-related Medicaid income eligibility limit. However, C.B.\u2019s income still fell below the 200 percent FPL income standard for the SCHIP. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.4(a)(6)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">C.B. requested a \u201cfair hearing,\u201d which resulted in a May 18, 2011 reversal by an ALJ \u201cbecause her unemployment income [was] below 200% of the FPL and she has been a constant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>recipient of NJ FamilyCare benefits without a new application required since the commencement of benefits on or after September 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">On June 28, 2011, Director Harr reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding that C.B. was a new applicant for the SCHIP and therefore ineligible for its benefits because \u201cthere is no longer a program. Her child, however, is eligible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">C.B.\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">\u201cWhen reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency, our scope of review is limited.\u201d <em>Burlington Cnty.

Bd. of Trs., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 25, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995))).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">\u201cWhen an agency\u2019s decision meets those criteria, then a court owes substantial deference to the agency\u2019s expertise and superior knowledge of a particular field. Deference controls even if the court would have reached a different result in the first instance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>In re Herrmann, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 926 A.2d 350 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not bound by an agency\u2019s \u201cdetermination of strictly legal issue[s].\u201d <em>In re Carter, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 924 A.2d 525 (quoting <em>Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973)). On such issues, our standard of review is plenary. However, a plenary standard of review does not apply to an agency\u2019s interpretation of regulations that fall within a legislative scheme the agency is charged with implementing and enforcing. <em>In re Hearn, supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 9 A.3d 1032. In such a case, we are required to defer to such interpretation, <em>see Nordstrom v. Lyon, </em>424 <em>N.J.Super. </em>80, 97, 35 A.3d 710 (App.Div.2012), \u201cunless the agency\u2019s interpretation is plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>In re Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n Advisory Op. No. 01-2008, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>254, 260, 989 A.2d 1254 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Division has been tasked, by statute, to administer New Jersey\u2019s participation in Medicaid, as well as oversee the state\u2019s implementation of the SCHIP. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J \u2014 9 and -10. By administrative regulation, the Division \u201cis the single State agency for receipt of Federal funds under Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)) of the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The use of the label \u201cNJ FamilyCare,\u201d unfortunately, has not been rigorously applied. For example, it is defined broadly as \u201cthe health insurance coverage program administered by [the Division] under the provisions of Title XIX and Title XXI of the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49 \u2014 1.3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, <em>N.J.S.A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>30:4J-11 defines \u201cNJ FamilyCare\u201d by reference to the SCHIP program only. <em>See also N.J.AC. </em>10:49-1.2 (\u201cIn New Jersey, the SCHIP program is known as NJ FamilyCare.\u201d). Notwithstanding semantic overlaps, the statutory and regulatory framework clearly contemplates separate programmatic attributes for the programs underwritten by Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">For example, eligibility for NJ FamilyCare-Plan A is governed mostly by <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:69 (\u201cAFDC-related Medicaid\u201d), while eligibility for the other NJ FamilyCare plans are generally governed by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78 (\u201cNJ FamilyCare\u201d). If an individual is eligible for NJ FamilyCare-Plan A, he or she cannot qualify for another plan. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10:78-1.1(a) (\u201cThis chapter contains the criteria for NJ FamilyCare eligibility for certain uninsured parents, caretakers and caretaker relatives and children not eligible under the provisions of <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:69, AFDC-Related Medicaid, and 10:79, NJ FamilyCare Children\u2019s Program, as well as certain uninsured single individuals and couples without dependent children not eligible under the provisions of <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90, Work First New Jersey Program.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">AFDC-related Medicaid benefits are available to applicants if they meet the gross income standards set out in <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:69-10.3(b). Under <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:69-10.13(b), a family with a gross income that exceeds these levels due to \u201cearned income\u201d can have an income disregard in an \u201camount equal to the difference between 133 percent of the Federal poverty level and the Income Standard established for the size of the family unit .... \u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Eligibility for parents and caretakers under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78, however, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">6. Parents, or caretakers, of dependent children under the age of 19 who meet the eligibility criteria contained in (a)6(i) through (iv) below and in this chapter, and who either were enrolled for benefits in the NJ FamilyCare Program on or after September 1, 2005, and continuously have received those benefits or have a pending application for such benefits that was received on or before February 28, 2010. The gross family income standards for eligibility of such individuals follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>iv. Effective September 1, 2008, and applying to NJ FamilyCare existing enrollments under this paragraph and applications received by February 28, 2010, parents or caretakers of dependent children under the age of 19 whose gross family income does not exceed 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Y\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:78 \u2014 3.4(a)(6).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Appellants do not challenge the agency\u2019s action in closing the SCHIP to new applicants as of March 1, 2010. The program was closed in response to economic conditions and fiscal constraints that affected New Jersey and many other jurisdictions around the country. This policy was codified at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.4(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">For all enrollment applications received after February 28, 2010, all programs under this chapter are closed to any enrollments of, or benefits for, parents and caretakers whose benefits are not funded or payable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, except as described in (b)l below. Therefore, such applications for such persons will not be processed for enrollment. This exclusion from enrollment and benefits additionally applies to parents or caretakers who are applying to enroll after being terminated from enrollment in the NJ FamilyCare Program, including, but not limited to, individuals who have been terminated due to nonpayment of premiums or other amounts due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Appellants argue that the agency\u2019s interpretation that they became new applicants after being determined ineligible for AFDC-related Medicaid healthcare benefits (NJ FamilyCare-Plan A) is an erroneous interpretation of the regulations because they should have been automatically transferred into another NJ FamilyCare plan when their entitlement to participate in NJ Family-Care-Plan A ended. We find no support for this equitable theory in either the statutes or regulations that govern NJ FamilyCare and its beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">It is reasonably conceivable that appellants\u2019 receipt of AFDC-related Medicaid healthcare benefits were part of the same overall program (NJ FamilyCare) as that of the SCHIP benefits, and therefore they should be transferred from a non-qualifying program into a qualifying program without being considered new applicants. However, the administrative framework treats AFDC-related Medicaid and SCHIP as two distinct programs, each with its own application and eligibility requirements. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>cannot say that the agency\u2019s decision to treat former AFDC-related Medicaid beneficiaries as new applicants to the SCHIP was arbitrary or capricious, and there is no direct textual support for the concept of a transfer process.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Although the regulations use the term \u201cNJ FamilyCare\u201d loosely to refer to both an umbrella program as a whole, as well as the specific SCHIP, the two segments of NJ FamilyCare do not share funding sources, eligibility rules, or income standards. Moreover, the regulations governing each program\u2019s recertification process refer specifically to determining continuing eligibility for benefits under separate, specific chapters. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:69-5.2(a); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-2.6(a). However, no regulation indicates that a beneficiary of one program is entitled to an automatic transfer to another program upon a change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The only relevant provision discussing what happens when a beneficiary is deemed ineligible for benefits is contained in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:69 \u2014 5.2(b), stating that \u201c[a]ll cases determined ineligible for AFDC-[related] Medicaid shall be screened for eligibility under all other program options. Referrals shall be coordinated to ensure that continuous coverage of benefits is available to the beneficiary, as applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">This provision makes two points. First, a beneficiary is not automatically eligible for every healthcare benefits program under the NJ FamilyCare umbrella when the individual is admitted to one program. If that were the case, eligibility screenings and referrals would be largely unnecessary. Second, when appellants sought to be transferred from one \u201cprogram option\u201d (AFDC-related Medicaid) to another (SCHIP), the SCHIP no longer existed for them because of the March 1, 2010 closure directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">We are not insensitive to the plight of appellants and recognize that they have proposed a workable interpretation of the applicable regulations. However, the appellate role does not allow us to invoke our notions of fairness, or substitute our version of wisdom for the agency\u2019s. Instead, under the gravitational pull of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its regulations, we are constrained to affirm the Director\u2019s determinations in all three cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> NJ FamilyCare is \"is a federal and state funded health insurance program created to help New Jersey\u2019s uninsured children and certain low-income parents and guardians to have affordable health coverage.\" <em>See </em>http://www. njfamilycare.org/pages/whatitis.html (last visited June 7, 2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> We examined the history of the directive and its chronological background in <em>Guaman v. </em>Velez, 421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 248-55, 23 A.3d 451 (App.Div.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> The letter does not expressly state that R.H.'s and her daughter\u2019s healthcare benefits were being terminated, but indicated that only her son was eligible for continued benefits, thus implying that R.H. and her daughter were not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\"> The briefs note that R.H. also received rental income, but during what time period and in what amount are unclear.
