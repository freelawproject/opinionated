O\u2019Boyle sought to compel defendants Borough of Longport (Longport) and Longport\u2019s Clerk and Custodian of Records, Thomas Hiltner, to produce certain letters and compact dises (CDs) pursuant to the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -13, and the common law right of access. A judgment was entered on December 20, 2010,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissing plaintiffs complaint and finding that the items, which consist of litigation materials and correspondence exchanged between outside counsel for Longport and private counsel for a former Planning and Zoning Board member and other persons who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>been or were being sued by plaintiff, were not subject to production. This appeal follows. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">A brief history will place the dispute in context. Over the past several years, plaintiff has sued several Longport officials as well as individuals with connections to Longport\u2019s borough governance. This includes Peter Isen, a former Planning and Zoning Board member, and Longport residents Frank and Anthony DiLorenzo. David W. Sufrin, Esquire, represents Isen and the DiLorenzos.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s conflicts with Longport, and some individuals connected with the municipality, began in 2007 when he was cited for a zoning violation. Plaintiff has also filed lawsuits through his corporation, Commerce Group Construction, Inc., and his organization, Citizens for Open Government, LLC, against Frank and Anthony DiLorenzo and Jerome DiPentino. Additionally, plaintiff sued the Press of Atlantic City for defamation resulting from its coverage of these disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Since 2007, plaintiff has been supplied hundreds of documents by Longport, pursuant to OPRA. In fact, he has successfully sued defendants under OPRA, prevailed, and been awarded counsel fees. Longport retained outside counsel, Emanuel Argentieri, Esquire, as to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">On April 23, 2010, plaintiff demanded from Longport the production of certain documents that he learned about by examining Argentieri\u2019s legal bills, which in turn he obtained under OPRA. The bills included charges for time spent corresponding with Sufrin. Longport provided some of the items requested, but refused to supply: 1) an August 20, 2009 letter from Argentieri to Sufrin; 2) a September 18, 2009 letter from Sufrin to Argentieri, captioned \u201cConfidential: Joint-Defense Strategy Memorandum-Attorney Joint Defense Work Product not for Disclosure to Third Parties\u201d; 3) a September 29, 2009 letter from Sufrin to Argentieri captioned \u201cCONFIDENTIAL JOINT-DEFENSE Attorney Work Product\u201d; 4) a second September 29, 2009 letter from Sufrin to Argentieri along with two CDs; 5) an undated letter from Sufrin to Argentieri which was reviewed by Argentieri on October 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>2009; and 6) documents contained on a third CD provided by Sufrin to Argentieri, which Argentieri reviewed on October 14, 2009. Allegedly, one of the CDs contained a list Sufrin compiled of all the lawsuits plaintiff initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Longport refused to supply the items on the basis that the letters were privileged communications, and the CDs were not in its possession, as they had been returned to Sufrin months earlier and were not copied. Plaintiffs verified complaint followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">After oral argument and an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the letters, the trial judge found they were protected by the attorney-client privilege, and were therefore excluded from the purview of both OPRA and the common law right of access. The court further found that the CDs were not public records, were also subject to the attorney-client privilege, and, since they were not the work product of defendants, disclosure was not mandated in any event. The judge noted that Sufrin was not Longport\u2019s agent, and thus questioned whether plaintiffs OPRA demand could effectively require Sufrin, essentially a third party unrelated to Longport, to produce documents. The judge also found that the CDs were returned without any intent to avoid production, as no OPRA request was submitted until after their return. Accordingly, the trial judge dismissed plaintiffs complaint and sealed the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the correspondence and the CDs were subject to production under OPRA and the common law right of access, that Isen and Longport share no joint interest such as would protect the items from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, and that the court should have required a Vaughn Index<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conducted an <em>in camera </em>inspection not just of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the correspondence, but of the CDs as well. We will first consider the claims made under OPRA, and next under the common law right of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">A trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute, because it is a question of law, is reviewed under a de novo standard. <em>Real v. Radir Wheels, Inc., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>511, 524, 969 A.2d 1069 (2009) (quoting <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007)). In doing so, we \u201cconstrue and apply the statute as enacted.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Daidone v. Buterick Bulk-heading, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>557, 565, 924 A.2d 1193 (2007)). Our analysis \u201cbegins with the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>In re Liquidation, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (quoting <em>Daidone, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 566, 924 A.2d 1193). Findings of fact, however, are reviewed deferentially. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484,323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">OPRA requires that \u201cgovernment records ... be readily accessible for inspection, copying, or examination ... with certain exceptions\u201d and that \u201call government records shall be subject to public access unless exempt from such access____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-1. \u201cThe purpose of OPRA \u2018is to maximize public knowledge about public affairs in order to ensure an informed citizenry and to minimize the evils inherent in a secluded process.\u2019\u201d <em>Times of Trenton Pub. Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Comm. Dev. Corp., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>519, 535, 874 A.2d 1064 (2005) (quoting <em>Asbury Park Press v. Ocean Cnty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 329, 864 A.2d 446 (Law Div.2004)). With that goal in mind, the statute also provides it will not affect \u201cthe common law right of access to any record....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">OPRA defines government records expansively, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>any political subdivision thereof, ... or that has been received in the course of his or its official business by any such officer, commission, agency or authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof.... <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1J</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Even if we assume for the sake of argument that the letters and CDs are government records within the statutory definition, we are also mindful that OPRA does \u201cnot abrogate or erode any ... grant of confidentiality heretofore established or recognized by ... court rule ..., which ... may ... restrict public access to a ... government record.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such privileges include work product as defined in <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c), which \u201cprotect[s] against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation\u201d or materials prepared \u201cin anticipation of litigation____\u201d Protected items can include \u201cdocuments, electronically stored information, and tangible things ... prepared ... by or for another party____\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10 \u2014 2(c); <em>Laporta v. Gloucester Cnty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 259-60, 774 A.2d 545 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">The work product doctrine developed from the self-evident need for attorneys to \u201cwork with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 <em>U.S. </em>495, 510-11, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>385, 393, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>451, 462 (1947). In order to compel disclosure, the party seeking to acquire the documents must establish that he is unable to gain access to the information by other means without undue hardship. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(e); <em>see Hickman, supra, </em>329 <em>U.S. </em>at 511, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 394, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 462-63. Where such a showing is made, the party seeking disclosure is still not entitled to the \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10-2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Because Longport and its officials, and Sufrin and his clients share a common interest, we conclude that the letters and CDs in this case, prepared in the process of developing a litigation defense strategy against one individual, are items protected by the work product privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The common interest rule is routinely applied in the context of the attorney-client privilege. <em>See In re State Comm\u2019n of Investigation Subpoena No. 5441, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 466-67, 544 A.2d 893 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>382, 550 A.2d 484 (1988); <em>In re Envtl. Ins. Declaratory Judgment Actions, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 315, 612 A.2d 1338 (App.Div. 1992). The common interest rule \u201cprotects communications made to a non-party who shares the client\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>In re State Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 544 A.2d 893. But the protection afforded by the common interest rule also applies in the work product context, including to communications between attorneys for different parties. <em>Laporta, supra, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 262, 774 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In order for the common interest rule to apply in such a scenario, it is necessary that \u201c(1) the disclosure is made due to actual or anticipated litigation; (2) for the purposes of furthering a common interest; and (3) the disclosure is made in a manner not inconsistent with maintaining confidentiality against adverse parties.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Holland v. Island Creek Corp., </em>885 <em>F.Supp. </em>4, 6 (D.D.C.1995)). The parties need not have identical interests, merely a \u201ccommon purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>United States v. McPartlin, </em>595 F.2d 1321, 1336 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>833, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>65, 62 L.Ed.2d 43 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In <em>Laporta, </em>for example, the Gloucester County Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to turn over to the plaintiff documents claimed to be protected by the work product privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 774 A.2d 545. The plaintiffs employer, county government, had refused to reemploy him after years as a county employee, after he was suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>because of \u201cperceived illegal conduct----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 774 A.2d 545. The plaintiff had become \u201cthe subject of a federal indictment for matters not related to his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 774 A.2d 545. He was ultimately acquitted of the charges and filed suit for wrongful termination and retaliation. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 774 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The disputed documents included: (1) a ninety-one page statement given by county counsel to county prosecutor\u2019s office investigators, with supporting documentation; (2) a \u201cMEMO TO FILELaPorta,\u201d written by county counsel and turned over to the prosecutor\u2019s office; and (3) a memo authored by the then acting county road supervisor addressed to a county freeholder. <em>Ibid. </em>The prosecutor\u2019s office refused to honor the plaintiffs subpoena issued in the wrongful termination case on the theory the documents were privileged. <em>Ibid. </em>We found the documents need not be produced because they were protected by the common interest shared by the government agencies in protecting their work product. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 263, 774 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">County government\u2019s purpose was \u201cto bar plaintiffs reinstatement and ancillary remedies____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 774 A.2d 545. The county prosecutor\u2019s purpose was to conduct investigations regarding \u201calleged criminal activity by persons holding public office\u201d and the prosecution of such individuals \u201cwith a view towards barring convicted public officers from employment in that capacity.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Athough the dual interests were not identical, they were sufficiently aligned that the common interest doctrine protected the communications from disclosure in the context of the work product privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, 774 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Employing this analysis, we conclude that Sufrin\u2019s clients and these defendants also share a common interest. Over a course of years, Sufrin\u2019s clients have been sued by plaintiff as a result of their connection to the borough, borough governance, and its elected officials. Longport reasonably anticipated future litigation. The communications between counsel, including the CDs, were generated incidental to pending and anticipated litigation. These materials advanced a common interest, i.e., the defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>litigation spanning several years initiated by plaintiff related to his ongoing conflicts with Longport and individuals associated with the municipality. Thus the letters and CDs are protected by the work product privilege, an exception to OPRA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Turning to plaintiffs contention that the common law right of access compels production, we ask initially whether the documents are public records. <em>Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath LLP v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law and Pub. Safety, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 499, 24 A.3d 829 (App.Div.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Generally, the common law right of access includes a wider range of material than OPRA, <em>Educ. Law Ctr. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>274, 302, 966 A.2d 1054 (2009), although the definition of public record has varied. <em>See, e.g., Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 689 A.2d 702; <em>Higg-A-Rella, Inc. v. Essex, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>35, 46, 660 A.2d 1163 (1995); <em>Shuttleworth v. Camden, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 579-80, 610 A.2d 903 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>429, 627 A.2d 1135 (1992). Our Supreme Court has defined a public record as a \u201cwritten memorial! ] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 made by a public officer ... authorized by law to make it.\u201d <em>Mason v. Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 67, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008) (quoting <em>Nero v. Hyland, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 222, 386 A.2d 846 (1978)). Using this definition, the CDs and letters are not public records because they were not created by a public officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">A more expansive definition of a public record is found, however, in <em>Keddie v. Rutgers, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>36, 689 A.2d 702 (1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court held that a document is a public record when it was \u201ccreated by, or at the behest of, public officers in the exercise of a public function.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 689 A.2d 702. Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>less, under our facts, regardless of which definition we employ, we conclude that the requested items are not available through the common law right of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Sufrin\u2019s letters and CDs are not public records, as they were not created \u201cat the behest of [ ] public officers,\u201d and all were created for litigation purposes, a private, not public, function. Although Argentieri\u2019s letter to Sufrin was arguably at the behest of a public official, it is nevertheless not a public record, as it was authored in anticipation of litigation, rather than in the exercise of a public function. Furthermore, even if, for the sake of argument, we were to consider the outcome if some or all of the documents were public records, the material is still not subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">If a document is a public record, the litigant claiming a right to production must establish an interest in the material. <em>Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 966 A.2d 1054. A litigant\u2019s interest may be either public or private. <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 112, 505 A.2d 958. Once a plaintiff proves an interest, the State must then demonstrate that its need for nondisclosure outweighs the plaintiffs need for disclosure. <em>Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 302-03, 966 A.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">But when seeking \u201cdisclosure of privileged records!,]\u201d <em>Wilson v. Brown, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>557, 583, 962 A.2d 1122 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>473, 968 A.2d 1189 (2009), including those subject to work product privilege, a plaintiff must show a \u201cparticularized need[.]\u201d In determining whether the plaintiff has made this showing, courts analyze \u201c(1) the extent to which the information may be available from other sources; (2) the degree of harm that the litigant will suffer from its unavailability; and (3) the possible prejudice to the [public officer].\u201d <em>Paff v. Dir. of Attorney Ethics, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>632, 649, 945 A.2d 149 (Law Div.2007) (quoting <em>McClain v. College Hosp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>346, 351, 492 A.2d 991 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In this case, we conclude plaintiff cannot show a particularized need sufficient to establish an interest which compels disclosure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Other than the self-evident wish to prevail in his lawsuits over Isen, the DiLorenzos, and Longport, no need whatsoever has been demonstrated. Since he cannot prove that the materials are not available through other means, he cannot prove any harm resulting from nondisclosure. Hence the work product privilege applies and the material need not be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Finally, plaintiff asserts that the CDs should have, at a minimum, been examined <em>in camera. </em>But the CDs were not copied, were never in the hands of Longport, were not created at Long-port\u2019s direction, and their contents do not relate to any interest either of Longport or its citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In furtherance of his argument that the CDs should have been examined <em>in camera, </em>plaintiff relies solely on <em>Burnett v. County of Gloucester, </em>415 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 2 A.3d 1110 (App.Div.2010). In <em>Burnett, </em>we held that the Board of County Freeholders was required to produce various settlement agreements entered into by the county even if the agreements were solely in the possession of counsel and not the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 516, 2 A.3d 1110. The thrust of <em>Burnett, </em>however, was not that the production of documents claimed to be public records can be compelled even if they are exclusively in the possession of counsel, and were never in the control of the government agency. Rather, <em>Burnett </em>holds that documents accessible to the public which are generated on behalf of a public agency in the course of its official business are subject to diselosui\u2019e no matter where they are located, even if they were never in the possession of the governmental entity. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 2 A.3d 1110. The rationale behind the decision is compelling \u2014 that government should not be able to shield its transactions from public scrutiny by the expedient of entrusting sole possession of relevant documents to third parties. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">This scenario is quite different. The CDs were created by Sufrin, not at the request of Longport or Argentieri. They were promptly returned to Sufrin, at his insistence, not at the instruction of Longport or even its attorney. The controlling hand in this situation was that of counsel for a third party not named in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>lawsuit, not a governmental agency. Hence <em>Burnett </em>does not compel disclosure either under OPRA or the common law right of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Because all the items at issue are protected attorney work product, we do not reach plaintiffs additional arguments, including that defendants\u2019 failure to file an answer or sworn affidavits was a fatal procedural defect. The questions we consider are purely legal and the record sufficient for the requisite analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-13\"> Earlier, a final judgment denying plaintiff's request for production was entered on August 20, 2010. Plaintiff thereafter sought to disqualify the judge, who recused himself, vacated his order, and transferred the matter to a second judge. It is the second judge's order that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\"> When an OPRA demand is made, a Vaughn Index allows \"a court to analyze, without exhaustive review, the essence of the documents and to determine whether they shall be disclosed.\u201d <em>Atl.
