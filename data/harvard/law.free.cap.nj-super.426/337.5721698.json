Later, in an eminent domain proceeding, it condemned a small strip of land, a slope easement, and a temporary work area within the shopping center in the vicinity of the former driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">At the just compensation trial, defendants claimed that they were entitled to damages not only for the value of the condemned land and easements, but also for losses in property value allegedly caused by the closure of the access driveway. The trial court agreed and allowed defendants to present expert testimony concerning internal traffic congestion that would result from the driveway closure and the impact of such congestion on the shopping center\u2019s value. The jury accepted this testimony, at least in part, as it awarded defendants considerably more compensation than a taking of the land and easements alone would warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The State now appeals the order for judgment and fixing just compensation at $1,607,000. For reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Due to congestion in the area, in 2001 DOT moved forward with the Marlton Circle Project, which would eliminate the traffic circle created by the confluence of Routes 70 and 73 in Evesham Township and replace it with a flyover so that Route 73 would cross Route 70 on an overpass. The project affected the roadways around defendants\u2019 property, the thirty-two acre Marlton Crossing Shopping Center (Center).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The Center lies on two irregularly-shaped parcels of land, close to where Route 73 crosses Route 70. The north parcel consists of 16.8 acres with 956 feet of frontage along Route 73. The south parcel consists of 15.3 acres, with 786 feet of frontage along Route 73. An internal connector road lies between the two parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The Center originally had three access driveways that provided ingress and egress onto Route 73: the northern driveway, the central driveway leading to the connector road, and the southern driveway. The Center could also be accessed through driveways on Old Marlton Pike, Lippincott Drive, and Centre Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Construction of the new overpass/underpass interchange required that a traffic ramp be built directly in front of the north parcel. Because the northern-most of the Center\u2019s three access driveways on Route 73 would intersect Route 73 at the point where cars were merging from the traffic ramp, DOT determined to close that driveway<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and notified defendants of the proposed closing sometime in the Fall of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Defendants submitted a counter-proposal, which DOT incorporated into a new access modification plan. When defendants objected to the modified plan, a meeting was held between defendants and representatives of DOT. As the result of that meeting, defendants submitted a second counter-proposal that included the closure of the northern driveway. This counter-proposal was discussed at a second meeting with representatives of DOT on April 6, 2005. At that time, DOT agreed to defendants\u2019 alternate proposal and also agreed to make parking lot improvements necessary to remediate the closure. Revised plans reflecting the agreed-upon modifications were completed on April 11, 2005, and copies were sent to defendants\u2019 consultant. Defendants did not appeal from, or seek further DOT review of, the access modification determination depicted in those plans, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33, which ultimately became part of the final construction package. Consequently, as part of the construction project, the State removed the driveway, replaced it with new curbing and pavement and striped the pavement for parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In order to construct the new interchange, the State condemned a small strip of land (.23 acres or 10,021 square feet) along the Center\u2019s frontage on Route 73. It also condemned a slope easement (.179 acres or 7,807 square feet) so that it could level the grade between the parking lot and the traffic ramp. Finally, it condemned a temporary work easement so that it could make the improvements necessitated by the removal of the driveway. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>terestingly, due to a straightening of the property line, the takings actually increased the Center\u2019s road frontage on Route 73 from 1,731 feet to 1,748 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On August 25, 2006, DOT formally offered defendants $179,600 for the land taken in fee and slope easement. One year later, on August 23, 2007, the State filed a complaint in condemnation against defendants, and on September 13, 2007, a declaration of taking of the land and premises described in the condemnation complaint. The estimated just compensation of $179,600 was deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On December 10, 2007, a Law Division judge entered an order finding that the State had duly exercised its power of eminent domain. Accordingly, the court appointed commissioners, who thereafter fixed the compensation to be paid defendants at $218,300. Both the State and defendants appealed from the commissioners\u2019 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Prior to jury trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude testimony of defense witnesses concerning any diminution in property value resulting from the driveway closure. The judge denied the motion, finding that defendants were entitled to present their damage claims to the jury, reasoning that \u201cthe taking of the access, even if it\u2019s under the police power, went hand in hand with the condemnation of the property____This happened part [and] parcel of the same proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">At trial, Craig Black, a real estate appraiser retained by the State, valued the condemned property and easements as of August 24, 2007, based on a comparable sales analysis, at $160,300 for the land taken; $31,228 for the easement; and a nominal $1,000 for the temporary work area easement, for a total value of $194,428.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Black did not consider any impact the access modification would have on the Center, stating that he did not believe that the taking had any effect on the remainder of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Defendants\u2019 real estate appraiser, William Steinhart, reached a similar conclusion as to the value of the land taken in fee and slope easement. He disagreed, however, as to the value of the temporary work area easement, concluding that it should be valued at $250,000 \u2014 a figure derived from 25% of the Center\u2019s total rental income for a two-month period. His appraisal also differed from Black\u2019s in that Steinhart considered the effect that changed internal traffic circulation had on the remainder of the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">David Shropshire, a traffic engineering consultant retained by defendants, testified that the closure of the northern driveway would have a critical impact on internal traffic circulation. His opinion was based on his pre-closure measurement of traffic flow at intersections within the Center, rather than traffic circulation post-closure. In this regard, he made certain assumptions concerning how traffic would be redistributed and concluded that there would be significant delays at an internal intersection on the connector road at peak hours, which would compromise internal traffic circulation in terms of safety and service.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Steinhart also believed that shopper dissatisfaction with decreased maneuverability within the Center could manifest itself as a decrease in rent, an increase in vacancy rates, or additional investment risk. Using an income approach to value, he estimated that the total damages caused by the takings and by the changes in internal traffic circulation amounted to $2,250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The State presented rebuttal testimony from Jay Etzel, a traffic engineer who disagreed with Shropshire\u2019s analysis, taking issue with two assumptions the expert made concerning post-closure conditions. Specifically, Etzel opined that Shropshire erred by assuming 1) that 100% of the traffic that formerly used the northern driveway would divert to the central driveway and 2) that the peak hour factor Shropshire calculated from pre-closure field data would remain unchanged post-closure, despite increased traffic volume. Using a peak hour factor derived from professionally established values and assuming that at least some vehicles would avoid the central driveway if it were congested, Etzel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>concluded that the internal intersection in question would provide a satisfactory level of service even at peak volumes. Further, Etzel noted that new signals and routing options that had been established around the Center cast doubt on conclusions based entirely on pre-closure data.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In its jury charge, the court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV9\">[i]t is up to you to determine the existence and amount by which the value of the remaining property was reduced or diminished as a result of onsite conditions created by the taking and you will consider such factors, if any, in arriving at your value of the property after the taking and ultimately in your award of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The court explained that a property owner is not entitled to compensation for diminution of access per se, but the owner can recover \u201c[i]f as a result of a change in access there is a real or genuine affect [sic] on the property because of onsite damages such as effects on internal traffic maneuverability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Following a seven-day trial, the jury returned a unanimous verdict setting the compensation owed defendants at $1,607,000. Thereafter the court entered final judgment in that amount plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">On appeal, the State argues that the court erred by conflating DOT\u2019s authority to regulate highway access with its power to condemn private property through eminent domain and that defendants\u2019 redress for the driveway closure was limited to the procedures set forth in the Access Act. Because the court mistakenly allowed defendants to present evidence of diminished value due to altered internal traffic circulation, the State maintains that the jury verdict should be vacated and the matter remanded for a new just compensation trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Consideration of the State\u2019s claims of error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling and jury charge calls for <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>see also Dempsey v. Alston, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 509, 966 A.2d 1 (App.Div.) (holding that when trial court\u2019s decision turns on question of law, appellate review is <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>novo), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>518, 973 <em>A.2d </em>386 (2009); <em>State v. Russo, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 135, 754 A.2d 623 (App.Div.2000) (observing that trial court\u2019s legal conclusions not entitled to same deference as factual findings). Specifically, the question to be resolved presents a purely legal issue, namely, whether proof of value lost due to access modifications imposed in accordance with the Access Act can be considered in arriving at a just compensation award in a condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In essence, the State argues that regulation of access is an administrative process unrelated to condemnation, and that as an exercise of the State\u2019s police power, access regulation is noncompensable as long as any value remains in the affected property. Because the present matter involves the intersection of these two procedures, we must review both the relevant provisions of the Access Act and the law as to regulatory takings of private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The New Jersey Legislature recognized that the State has a responsibility to effectively manage and maintain each highway within the State highway system and that unrestricted access to State highways can impair the purpose of that system. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7 \u2014 90(e), (d). Although every owner of property that abuts a public road has a right of reasonable access to the road, that right is subject to regulation for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety and welfare. <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:7-90(e). Governmental entities through regulation may not, however, eliminate all access to the general system of highways without providing just compensation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-90(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">After the DOT Commissioner determines that alternate access is available, a property owner\u2019s access permit may be modified or revoked upon written notice and hearing. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-94(a). Alternate access is assumed to exist if the property owner enjoys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>reasonable access to the general system of streets and highways, and in the case of a commercial property owner, if access is available onto \u201cany parallel or perpendicular street, highway, easement, service road or common driveway, which is of sufficient design to support commercial traffic to the business or use.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-94(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-94(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">When the commissioner revokes an access permit pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall be responsible for providing all necessary assistance to the property owner in establishing the alternative access, which shall include the funding of any such improvements by the department.

The lot owner must respond to DOT in writing within thirty days of receipt of notice, either accepting the modification plan or appealing it. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">If the lot owner appeals, the Manager of the Bureau of Major Access Permits must schedule an informal meeting with the lot owner to resolve any differences. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33(e)(5). The Manager must issue a decision in writing within thirty days of the meeting. <em>Ibid. </em>If the lot owner does not agree with the decision, he or she may submit an appeal to the Director, Division of Design Services, within thirty days. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The Director must schedule an informal hearing within ten days of receipt of the appeal, where the lot owner will have an opportunity to present further information regarding objections to the modification plan. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33(c)(6). The Director must render a final agency decision, with reasons, within thirty days of the informal hearing and notify the lot owner of the decision in writing. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47 \u2014 4.33(c)(7). The lot owner may appeal the final agency decision to the Appellate Division as of right within forty-five days from the date of service of the decision. <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2); <em>R. </em>2:4-l(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Here, DOT was clearly authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-90 to modify or revoke defendants\u2019 access permit for the northern driveway. It served notice on defendants of its plan in accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33. Defendants did not appeal the proposal, but rather opted to negotiate a more favorable plan, to which they ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>consented. The meetings that took place with project management staff were not the meetings contemplated by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33(c)(5). Because defendants never formally appealed the access determination, neither the Manager of the Bureau of Major Access Permits nor the Director, Division of Design Services had occasion to consider defendants\u2019 objections or address the question of whether the access that remained after the closure was reasonable. Because defendants consented to DOT\u2019s plan, that plan became the final agency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It remains to determine whether the modification of highway access at issue here amounted to a regulatory taking for which compensation is due defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u201cWhen the state regulates lands to ... provide for the general welfare of its citizens there are inevitably consequences that affect the rights of property owners.\u201d <em>Mansoldo v.

The New Jersey Constitution, article I, paragraph 20, and article IV, section 6, paragraph 3, likewise provide protections against governmental takings of private property without just compensation. <em>Klumpp v. Borough of Avalon, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>390, 404-05, 997 A.2d 967 (2010).

For example, in <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, </em>a case involving rights to a beach boundary area between property owners\u2019 dry land and submerged land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>owned by the State of Florida, the Supreme Court applied state law to determine what rights the owners had in littoral property and avulsions before deciding whether a taking had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2611, 177 L.Ed.2d at 206. Likewise, in <em>Karam, supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 235, 705 A.2d 1221, the question of whether the State\u2019s regulation of riparian land constituted a taking was examined in light of the interest that was vested in the property owner by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In the instant matter, a property owner\u2019s right to access the State highway system is clearly defined by State law. While a property owner has a right of reasonable access to the State\u2019s highway system, he or she does not have an absolute right to access the highway from any particular point on his or her property. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-90; <em>State, by Comm\u2019r of Transp. v.

Highway Auth., </em>59 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 595, 158 A.2d 343 (App.Div.1960). It follows then under the reasoning of <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2611, 177 L.Ed.2d at 206, and <em>Penn Central, supra, </em>438 <em>US. </em>at 124-25, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2659, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 648, that property owners\u2019 interests in any particular access point are not sufficiently bound up with their reasonable expectations of ownership to constitute \u201cproperty\u201d for Fifth Amendment purposes. Thus, modification or revocation of an access point, so long as free and reasonable access remains, does not constitute a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">This conclusion, derived from decisions of the United States Supreme Court, is consistent with the Access Act as well as the common law principle, long recognized in New Jersey, that changes in access per se are not compensable. <em>See High Horizons, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 49, 575 A.2d 1360 (holding that limitation of access is accomplished under state\u2019s police power and is not compensable); <em>Lima &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

In such an event, both the Access Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-98, and the common law, <em>Weiswasser, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, 693 A.2d 864, require that the State acquire the property interest through condemnation. This result is also in accord with the reasoning of <em>Penn Central, supra, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>at 124, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2659, 57 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 648, since lack of reasonable access would interfere with the property owner\u2019s distinct investment-backed expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In this case, the remaining access to the Center is clearly reasonable. The Center retains two access driveways onto Route 73 and three additional driveways onto surrounding roads. Indeed, the most used driveway, handling more than fifty percent of the Center\u2019s traffic, is the one leading to Old Marlton Pike and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that driveway was improved during the construction to create easier access onto Route 73. The record is bereft of any facts indicating that defendants were not left with reasonable access to their property. Moreover, as noted, defendants did not appeal from DOT\u2019s access determination and thus waived the issue of reasonable access.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In sum, DOT\u2019s decision to close the northern driveway did not constitute a Fifth Amendment taking. Any diminution of value the Center might have suffered as the result of the change in access is therefore non-compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The issue remains then as to the true measure of compensation where, as here, there is only a partial condemnation. When private property is taken by the State for public use, the owner is entitled to compensation for the property taken; damages, if any, to any remaining property; and any additional compensation as may be fixed according to law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u201cWhere the entire property is taken, just compensation is \u2018the fair market value of the property as of the date of the taking____\u2019\u201d <em>State, by Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. Simon Family Enters., L.L.C., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 249, 842 A.2d 315 (App.Div. 2004) (quoting <em>State, by Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>507, 513-14, 457 A.2d 463 (1983)). Where only a portion of the private property is taken, the owner \u201cis not only entitled to just compensation for the fair-market value of the portion that has actually been taken, but also for the diminution in the value, if any, of the remaining land, referred to as \u2018severance damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.; accord Dikert, supra, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323, 725 A.2d 119. In assessing severance damages, \u201cthe market value of the property remaining after a taking should be ascertained by a wide factual inquiry into <em>all </em>material facts and circumstances ... that would influence a buyer or seller interested in consummating a sale of the property.\u201d <em>Silver, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 457 A.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>A party seeking severance damages pursuant to a partial condemnation may only recover for losses in value directly attributable to the taking itself, however. <em>Weiswasser, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 693 A.2d 864. In <em>Weiswasser, supra, </em>for example, the Court determined that the property owner could only recover severance damages for loss of visibility if the loss arose directly from changes that occurred on the property taken. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 693 A.2d 864. Similarly, in <em>Pub. Serv. Elect. &amp; Gas v. Oldwick, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 34-35, 308 A.2d 362 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>153, 313 A.2d 213 (1973), a property owner, over whose property a utility company condemned an easement for passage of transmission lines, sought severance damages for value lost due to the construction of three large towers on nearby land. The court held that the property owner could not recover damages arising from the total project, but instead was entitled to compensation only for damages caused by the use of the land actually taken from him. <em>Id. </em>at 36-38, 308 A.2d 362; <em>see also, Dikert, supra, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 725 A.2d 119 (holding that owners of access easement had no claim for severance damages arising from condemnation of servient tenement).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Following this reasoning, defendants here were only entitled to severance damages that arose directly from the property actually taken. The property taken was 0.23 acres in fee simple, 0.179 acres subject to a permanent slope easement, and a temporary easement in the parking lot where improvement work would be performed. The northern access was not taken in the condemnation as it had been modified in the prior administrative proceeding. Even if the access closure were considered to be an inseparable part of the construction project, the closing of a single access point did not amount to a Fifth Amendment taking because, as noted, the property retained reasonable access to the highway system. Thus, it still was not part of the property <em>taken. </em>Because defendants attributed their internal circulation problems\u2014 and hence their loss of value \u2014 solely to the access modification, any loss they experienced therefore did not arise directly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>property <em>taken </em>and therefore severance damages were not recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In arguing otherwise, that they are entitled to compensation for diminution in value of the remainder due to on-site impacts caused by vehicular maneuverability, defendants rely primarily on the holdings in <em>State v. Van Nortwick, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 617 A.2d 284 (App.Div.1992) <em>(Van Nortwick </em>I), and <em>State v. Van Nortwick, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 670 A.2d 548 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>320, 670 A.2d 1061 (1995) <em>(Van Nortwick II). </em>Amicus curiae Maple Shade Properties adds that the State should not be allowed to use the Access Act to avoid paying constitutionally-mandated just compensation for condemned property, basing its argument, as does its fellow amicus, New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, similarly on the <em>Van Nortwick </em>decisions, which they argue, hold that on-site damages are compensable when access changes are effected by the State. We find these decisions distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">In <em>Van Nortwick I, supra, </em>the State appealed from the verdict of a just compensation trial, arguing that the trial court had erred by allowing the defendant to present expert testimony concerning diminution of value caused by an access revocation and by allowing the jury to consider that evidence in awarding damages. 260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 557, 617 A.2d 284. The defendant owned a 1.65-acre parcel of land with 328 feet of frontage along Route 37. <em>Ibid. </em>In order to construct a highway improvement project, the State condemned 0.232 acres of the parcel, consisting of a strip of land 28.5 feet deep along the property\u2019s entire frontage. <em>Ibid. </em>Originally, the defendant had access to Route 37 from the full 328-foot frontage; after the taking, access was limited to 140 feet. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the existing driveway onto Route 37 was moved to the back of the property and connected to Route 37 through a new right of way. <em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 617 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>A panel of this court concluded that because there was no dispute concerning the reasonableness of the remaining access, the trial court had erred by failing to exclude diminution of access as an element of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 558-59, 617 A.2d 284. In so doing, the court remarked <em>in dicta </em>that \u201c[although a diminution of access may cause other conditions on the property itself which may be compensable, as for example, ... such things as a limitation of design options or on-site maneuverability, as long as the remaining access is reasonable, the diminution <em>per se </em>is not compensable.\u201d <em>Van Nortwick I, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 558, 617 A.2d 284. It reversed the just compensation award and remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 617 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><em>Van Nortwick II, supra, </em>involved the State\u2019s appeal after remand. 287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 62-63, 670 A.2d 548. At the remand trial, the Law Division had determined that the defendant was entitled to compensation for on-site impacts caused by the diminution of access. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 670 A.2d 548. The court held that such on-site impacts were compensable as part of severance damages and that a properly instructed jury could separate compensable on-site damage from non-compensable diminution per se damages. <em>Ibid. </em>Another panel of this court agreed and affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 670 A.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In reviewing the facts, the panel noted that the most significant impacts of the taking would be on the property\u2019s depth and on its amount of buildable area. <em>Ibid. </em>It further noted testimony from the defendant\u2019s expert that identified four separate types of on-site damage. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 670 A.2d 548. These were the need for a depth variance, the loss of buildable areas, the loss of design flexibility, and the limitation of on-site maneuverability. <em>Van Nortwick II, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 66, 670 A.2d 548. The expert opined that limitation of vehicular maneuverability would result not from denial of access to the highway per se, but from the location of a single driveway at the back of the lot. <em>Ibid. </em>Such access would not allow drivers to loop in one driveway and out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>another, but would require them to double-back on wide drive aisles. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The court observed that both sides agreed that the access that remained to the property was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 670 A.2d 548. It also observed that this was \u201cnot a typical \u2018highway access\u2019 case where the property owner complains that the limitations on access causes [sic] inconveniences or business losses by the resulting need to follow a more circuitous route.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 670 A.2d 548. It framed the precise issue before the court as \u201cwhether a property owner is entitled to just compensation for on-site damages to his remaining property caused by the manner in which his access was limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 670 A.2d 548. In addressing this question, the court recognized that not all damages are compensable, particularly if those damages are speculative, incidental, or \u201cpeculiar to the owner as opposed to being directly attributable to the realty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71-72, 670 A.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The court found that the defendant\u2019s situation was similar to that of the condemnee in <em>State, by Comm,\u2019r of Transp. v. Inhabitants of Phillipsburg, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 573 A.2d 953 (App.Div. 1990), where the State\u2019s taking cut off one portion of a property\u2019s remainder from another. <em>Van Nortwick II, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 72, 670 A.2d 548. The Phillipsburg court had found that the loss in value was not solely due to the rerouting of traffic, but rather arose from the fact that the taking affected the ability of potential developers to develop the land. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Phillips-burg, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 547-48, 573 A.2d 953).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The court summarized Van Nortwick\u2019s arguments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVr\">Defendant\u2019s claim for severance damages included a claim that a potential developer would pay less for this land, not just because there was a smaller piece of land remaining (for which defendant was being separately compensated), and not just because access to his property from the highway would be limited (which the law did not recognize as compensable), but because the restriction and location of the limited access, combined with the prevailing zoning requirements in the town, caused his property to be less useful and less valuable in terms of its highest and best use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 72-73, 670 A.2d 548.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The court found that there was ample credible testimony from which the jury could have concluded that a potential commercial developer would be restricted in the size, shape and number of structures he or she could build on the property. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 670 A.2d 548.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">This is because room would have to be allowed for wider chiving aisles on the property to permit cars to double back and exit from the same driveway they entered. That double-backing was directly due to the fact that the State had not only decreased the amount of defendant\u2019s access but also changed the location of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\"><em>Van Nortmck I </em>simply set forth the well-established principle that loss of access per se is non-eompensable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Its language concerning damages for loss of on-site maneuverability was merely dicta, and, in any event, too vague, in that it failed to explain what \u201cdiminution of access\u201d is or when it occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Van Nortwick II </em>is distinguishable. In the first instance, the case dealt with access revocation and not, as here, access modification, the former generally involving a greater deprivation than the latter. But more importantly, the court never considered whether the access revocation constituted a Fifth Amendment taking. That is doubtlessly because the State specifically included \u201cthe owner\u2019s right of direct access to and from the deceleration lane\u201d in its description of the property to be condemned.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the court had no occasion to apply the jurisprudence of regulatory takings. Because the issue was not considered, <em>Van Nortwick II </em>is not dispositive when access revocation is effected through regulation and not condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The more compelling distinction between <em>Van Nortwick II </em>and the matter at hand, however, is fact-driven. All of the deleterious on-site effects cited in <em>Van Nortwick II </em>arose directly from the taking in fee. The need to relocate the access, the requirement for a depth variance, the loss of buildable area, and the loss of design flexibility all flowed directly from condemnation of the 28.5-foot strip at the front of the property, which reduced the parcel\u2019s depth by thirteen percent. Even limitations imposed by the construction of wider driving aisles stemmed directly from the taking, since if the access was simply moved to the back of the property but no land was taken, there would have been more room inside the property to accommodate driveways. Thus, as the <em>Van Nortwick II </em>court recognized, the damages claimed were not peculiar to the owner but were directly attributable to the realty. 287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 71-72, 670 A.2d 548. This comports with the classic definition of severance damages as the diminution in the value of the remaining land that is directly attributable to the taking itself. Weiswasser; <em>supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 693 A.2d 864. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>In other words, the damages that were awarded in <em>Van Nortwick II </em>arose from the condemnation in fee, not the relocation of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The same is not true of the instant matter, where the asserted severance damages stemmed solely from the access modification and not the taking. The rerouting of traffic in the Center was not caused by the condemnation of a small strip of land in the property\u2019s set-back. Indeed, the taking did not even require the closing of the northern driveway, as demonstrated by the fact that DOT\u2019s first set of modified plans allowed for that driveway to remain open. Although DOT determined that preventing egress from the driveway would further the purposes of traffic safety, nothing in the taking itself prevented the driveway from remaining at its original location. Thus, unlike <em>Van Nortwick II, </em>the matter here appears to be the \u201ctypical \u2018highway access\u2019 case where the property owner complains that the limitation on access causes inconveniences or business losses by the resulting need to follow a more circuitous route.\u201d <em>287 N.J.Super. </em>at 69, 670 A.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Not only did the revocation of access in <em>Van Nortwick </em>cause a change in the property\u2019s highest and best use and impact its ability to meet zoning requirements, but it also comprised a substantial portion of the condemned property and caused a reduction of frontage and depth of the property. Here, in contrast, the change in access had no such effect and in fact there was an increase in the Center\u2019s road frontage on Route 73 and the takings fell entirely within the local setback requirements. Thus, the circumstances of this ease are significantly different than those in <em>Van Nortwick II, </em>and for all the above reasons, do not warrant severance damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Despite the clear weight of authority holding otherwise, amici nevertheless contend that the State\u2019s two-pronged approach in using the access management process to acquire property and avoid paying just compensation for on-site damages caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>change in access is inherently unfair to the property owner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As noted, the regulation of access is a separate administrative process distinct from the eminent domain action. Moreover, the process is transparent and affords property owners adequate procedural due process protections. Under the Access Act, property owners are entitled to early notification of the State\u2019s plans; the opportunity to meet with DOT officials to express concerns, submit alternate modification proposals, and request compensation; and the right to have the agency\u2019s decision reviewed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-89 to -98; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In the case of modification, DOT\u2019s determination is reviewable internally and the property owner may challenge the agency\u2019s final decision by appealing to the Appellate Division. <em>Ibid. </em>In the case of revocation, the property owner is afforded a hearing in the Office of Administrative Law and may appeal the final agency decision to the Appellate Division. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, if access is revoked, and does not amount to a \u201ctaking,\u201d DOT is required to provide the property owner with all necessary assistance to secure reasonable alternate access to the State highway system. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-94(d). If the agency or court determines that reasonable access does not remain after the regulatory action, and thus a \u201ctaking\u201d has occurred, then the Commissioner must file a condemnation action and provide the property owner with just compensation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:7-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Given the due process sufficiency of the legislative scheme, defendants\u2019 redress for the driveway closure was limited to the procedures set forth in the Access Act and DOT regulations promulgated thereunder. Significantly, defendants did not seek further review of the access determination within the DOT, nor did they appeal the agency\u2019s decision to this court. Therefore, their present claim for so-called severance damages arising from the internal effects of the access modification, which they consented to and left them with reasonable alternate access, may not be appropriately considered in the condemnation trial concerning the State\u2019s acquisition phase. Because the jury in this instance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>instructed otherwise and allowed to compensate defendants for the alleged diminution in value due to impacts caused by poor vehicle maneuverability, the trial court committed reversible error for which a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> The State Highway Access Management Code prohibits an access point to be located on an acceleration ramp. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-3.5(e)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\"> This figure reflects a credit of $1,900 that Black allowed defendants for the cost of replacing certain landscaping and pavement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-13\"> Modification is defined as \"changing the number of access points.\" <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33(c)(l). Revocation, on the other hand, is restricted to eliminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>direct ingress or egress to the State highway and providing alternative access through a road other than the State highway. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47 \u2014 4.33(d)(1). Thus, the regulatory action here was a modification and not a revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b376-11\"> While the State Highway Access Management Code contemplates a hearing in the Office of Administrative Law in the case of a revocation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:47-4.33(d)(1), there is no similar provision applicable to a modification. We have no occasion to pass upon the distinction this regulation draws between revocation and modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> Most States generally recognize that regulation of access per se is noncompensable so long as the property retains a reasonable means of ingress and egress. <em>See, e.g., Ark.

State, </em>113 <em>Idaho </em>142, 742 P.2d 397, 397-400 (1986) (rejecting a plaintiff's complaint that the limitation of access would hamper the ability of large fuel trucks to make deliveries to his gas station and would increase congestion on nearby roads, and ruling that State regulation of private access onto a public road constituted a taking only when vehicular access to the property was totally destroyed), <em>aff d on reh'g, </em>113 <em>Idaho </em>142, 742 <em>P.2d </em>397 (1987). <em>But see Narloch v.
