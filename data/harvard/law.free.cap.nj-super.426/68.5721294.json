The motion judge granted summary judgment dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s LAD complaint because plaintiff, indisputably, did not request an accommodation prior to filing suit. Plaintiff appeals, and for the following reasons, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">Plaintiff, a paraplegic, is a Florida resident who frequently travels to New Jersey to see friends and assist others in Hightstown, where he also acts as a \u201ctester,\u201d visiting facilities to determine their accessibility to the disabled. On March 12 and 13, 2008, plaintiff attempted access to several public buildings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>borough. According to plaintiff, City Hall was \u201cnot properly accessible, the parking sign [wa]s too low, the urinal [wa]s too high, the toilet paper dispenser [wa]s over the grab bar, [there was] no insulation on the pipes, the door [wa]s too heavy, and there may be a problem with turnaround space____\u201d The museum across from City Hall had no disabled parking and the sidewalk path leading to its entrance was \u201cnot accessible because the route [wa]s on an acute slope and cross slope____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Plaintiff encountered similar barriers in downtown Hightstown, where the sidewalks and curb cuts on Bank and Main Streets were on \u201cacute slopes and cross slopes____\u201d Plaintiff also could not access the library because there were no disabled parking spaces and \u201cthe drop off box [wa]s on an acute slope.\u201d The Army Navy Memorial too had no accessible parking, and the \u201csidewalk to river view ha[d] cross slopes ----\u201d Plaintiff summarized his access difficulties thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">I was unable to be a patron at the library, museum, Army Navy Memorial, and my ability to use the routes on Bank Stfreet] and Main St[reet] has been impaired because of slopes and cross slopes. I was a patron of the Municipal Court Building at City Hall[.] [However, my access was impaired] ... because of [a] lack of accessible bathroom and parking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">These conditions persisted on October 13, 2010, when plaintiff attempted to revisit Hightstown\u2019s library, municipal building and downtown area. Despite having his access \u201cgreatly impaired[,]\u201d plaintiff never requested assistance from a municipal employee or any other representative of the borough in facilitating access to Hightstown\u2019s services and facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">Plaintiff secured the services of an expert, who reported areas of non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12101-12132; American National Standards Institute (ANSI) regulations; and the New Jersey Barrier Free Subcode, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:23-7.1 to -7.32 (2009), including, but not limited to, the bathroom facilities in City Hall, the ramp leading to City Hall, the rear parking area of City Hall, the book drop slot at the library, the landing behind the Army Navy Memorial, curb cuts at the corners of Main and Franklin Streets and Hightstown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Mall and Broad Street, and cross slopes on various streets in downtown Hightstown.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Thereafter, plaintiff and Advocates for Disabled Americans (AFDA) filed a complaint, alleging that the Borough of Hightstown (at times defendant) discriminated against them by failing to provide plaintiff access to defendant\u2019s \u201cservices including the sidewalks and curb cuts, library, municipal hall and parking!,]\u201d in violation of Title II of the ADA and LAD. After defendant removed the case to federal court, plaintiff filed an amended complaint that abandoned the ADA claim and requested less than $75,000 in damages. Following the case\u2019s remand to state court, AFDA dismissed its claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Following discovery, on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court dismissed plaintiffs public accommodation disability discrimination claims, finding an obligation under the LAD for plaintiff to request assistance from a place of public accommodation prior to filing suit and that, in this instance, plaintiff never made such a request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">There\u2019s no indication that those requests were made, they were put on notice, so there\u2019s no way to see whether or not they would have reasonably accommodated [plaintiff].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">... [U]nder the law I think there has to be some notice to them. I don\u2019t mean notice of the lawsuit, like we talked about in the beginning, but some notice that somebody is trying to utilize a town\u2019s service, a building, or what have you, and I\u2019m saying there is no issue of material fact here that that notice was given. And under the law ... I think that notice is required before you can see whether or not they had the opportunity to reasonably accommodate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">This matter involves an interpretation of the LAD. Therefore, our review is de novo. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Regarding public facilities, the LAD\u2019s declared public policy is that \u201c[a]ll persons shall have the opportunity ... to obtain all the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of any place of public accommodation\u201d without discrimination on the basis of disability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4.1. To that end, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>It shall be ... an unlawful discrimination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">f. (1) For any owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent, or employee of any place of public accommodation directly or indirectly to refuse, withhold from or deny to any person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof, or to discriminate against any person in the furnishing thereof____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Consistent therewith, the LAD\u2019s implementing regulations require places of public accommodation to provide reasonable access. In particular, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.3 prohibits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">an owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of any place of public accommodation to refuse, withhold from or deny an individual, either directly or indirectly, on account of that person\u2019s disability or perceived disability, access to any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges of a place of public accommodation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.4 provides that places of public accommodations are, \u201cto the extent reasonable,\u201d required to accommodate \u201ca person with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of that person.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a) requires all places of public accommodation to make</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a ... [disabled] patron or prospective patron ..., including making such reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, as may be required to afford goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to a person with a disability, unless the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of the place of public accommodation demonstrates that making the accommodations would impose an undue burden on its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">And <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.12 details examples of \u201c[ajccommodations that may be reasonable in ... particular situations],\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.12(a), including \u201c[mjaking reasonable structural alterations[,J\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.12(a)2, and \u201cproviding an alternative accessible path.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.12(a)10iv. Thus, what is considered reasonable in a particular circumstance is typically a fact-sensitive inquiry, resolvable by a jury. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.12; <em>Franek v. Tomahawk Lake Resort, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206, 218-19, 754 A.2d 1237 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>606, 767 A.2d 484 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(2000); <em>see also Lasky v. Moorestown Twp., </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 540-42, 42 A.3d 212 (App.Div.2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Focusing on <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11 in particular, defendant contends that a public entity\u2019s obligation to make \u201creasonable accommodations to ... a ... prospective patron[,]\u201d is triggered only when that entity first receives notice from the prospective patron of the requested accommodation. Plaintiff, on the other hand, maintains that a prospective patron would not likely know in advance whether a public facility is accessible, thus obligating a public entity to provide access in the absence of a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In ascertaining legislative intent, the scheme in place \u201c \u2018must be read in its entirety; each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section to provide a harmonious whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Burnett v. County of Bergen, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>408, 421, 968 A.2d 1151 (2009) (quoting <em>Bedford v. Riello, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>210, 224, 948 A.2d 1272 (2008)). \u201c \u2018[Generally, the best indicator of ... [legislative] intent is the statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)). But where \u201cthere is ambiguity in the statutory language that leads to more than one plausible interpretation,\u201d as there appears to be here, \u201cwe may turn to extrinsic evidence, \u2018including legislative history, committee reports, and contemporaneous construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492-93, 874 A.2d 1039 (quoting <em>Cherry Hill Manor Assocs. v. Faugno, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>64, 75, 861 A.2d 123 (2004)). As to the latter, \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deferenee[,]\u201d <em>I.L. v. Dept. of Human Servs., </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 364-65, 913 A.2d 122 (App.Div.2006) (quoting <em>DiMaria v. Bd. of Trs. of Pub. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 351, 542 A.2d 498 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>638, 552 A.2d 164 (1988)), when it does not \u201cflout the statutory language and undermine the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>GE Solid State, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>N.J. </em>298, 306-07, 625 A.2d 468 (1993); <em>see also Patel v. N.J. Motor Vehicle Comm\u2019n, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>413, 420, 982 A.2d 445 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">During the public comment period, certain interested persons urged the Division on Civil Rights (Division) \u201cto revise its rules to clarify that owners of places of public accommodation have an ongoing obligation to maintain their facilities free from architectural barriers, in order to ensure that barrier removal is not contingent on a specific request of an individual with disabilities.\u201d 33 <em>N.J.R. </em>1853 (June 4, 2001). In response, the Division stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">The proposed amendments require places of public accommodation to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures required to afford persons with disabilities the goods, services, facilities, privileges, and advantages of the public accommodation, unless such modifications are demonstrated to impose undue hardship. The proposed amendments set forth examples of reasonable accommodation that may be required, which include a series of reasonable structural alterations. The amendments also require places of public accommodation, to the extent reasonable, to ensure that paths of travel are readily accessible and usable by people with disabilities. This duty may include providing accessible entrances, walks and sidewalks, and curb ramps, and making other structural modifications. <em>Although it is not within the Division\u2019s rulemaking authmity to mder across-the-board barrier removal equivalent to the mandates authorized by the ADA, nothing in the Division\u2019s proposed mies as amended conditions the obligation of a place of public accommodation to provide reasonable accommodation on receipt of a request by a person with a disability. </em>Rather, the obligation to provide structural modification, or any other modification, is governed by the standard of reasonableness, and can be excused only if the public accommodation can demonstrate that it would impose an undue hardship. Therefore, the Division declines to amend the proposed rules as suggested by the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">[38 <em>N.J.R. </em>1853-1854 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In declining \u201cto include in its rules a requirement that owners of places of public accommodation consider the wishes of the person with a disability in developing aeeommodations[,]\u201d the Division expressly recognized that while the LAD requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">an interactive process to develop reasonable accommodations <em>in some settings, ... </em>the obligation of the owner or operator of a place of public accommodation to consider the wishes of an individual with a disability seeking an accommodation is subsumed in the concept of what is generally reasonable and effective in a given situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">[33 <em>N.J.R. </em>1853 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">As this statement makes clear, the Division declined to extend the \u201cinteractive process\u201d requirement, generally applied by courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>in the employment context, <em>see infra </em>at 14-15, to the public accommodations context. In keeping with this restraint, we have rejected the \u201covergeneralized use of specific principles and approaches developed to determine liability in employment discrimination cases\u201d in public accommodation cases. <em>Franek, supra,, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215, 754 A.2d 1237; <em>see, e.g., Hall (Estate of Potoczak) v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 106, 777 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.2001) (stating that evidence of the request for an interpreter was not needed to establish notice to the defendant because notice is not an element of the plaintiffs LAD claim), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>336, 793 A.2d 715 (2002); <em>Bomgesser v. Jersey Shore Med. Ctr., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 379, 774 A.2d 615 (App.Div.2001) (holding that a violation of Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 701-796, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 794(a), does not depend on the hospital\u2019s awareness of the prohibited conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On this score, we have noted the distinction that \u201c[p]ublie accommodations cases do not involve ongoing organizational connections or the need to make allowances for other special features of the employer-employee relationship, such as its hierarchical qualities.\u201d <em>Franek, supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215, 754 A.2d 1237. We are therefore satisfied that the Division\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is entitled to deference, especially because it is consistent with the stated intention of the Legislature in enacting the LAD, that disabled persons have \u201c \u2018full and equal access to society, limited only by [their] physical limitations[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>Franek, supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 217, 754 A.2d 1237 (quoting <em>D.I.A.L., Inc. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 439, 603 A.2d 967 (App.Div.1992)); <em>accord Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 495, 446 A.2d 486 (1982) (employment context); <em>see also GE Solid State Inc., supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 306-07, 625 A.2d 468; and that the LAD be construed liberally to that end. <em>Franek, s'upra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 217, 754 A.2d 1237. By focusing on what is generally reasonable rather than requiring a specific individual\u2019s request in addressing accessibility issues, the agency has acted consistent with the LAD\u2019s express proscription against the direct or indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>withholding of access to places of public accommodation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 12f(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In contending otherwise, defendant relies on three cases that, it argues, implicitly establish that a request for assistance is required to establish a public accommodation disability discrimination claim. However, all of those cases are distinguishable because the respective plaintiffs requested assistance prior to bringing suit. <em>See Estate of Nicolas v. Ocean Plaza Condo. Assoc., Inc., </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 576, 909 A.2d 1144 (App.Div. 2006); <em>Ellison v. Creative Learning Ctr., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581, 585, 893 A.2d 12 (App.Div.2006); <em>Oras v. Hous. Auth. of City of Bayonne, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>302, 306-11, 861 A.2d 194 (App.Div. 2004). Those circumstances are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In fact, New Jersey case law does not directly address whether a plaintiff must first request an accommodation to sustain a prima facie public accommodation disability discrimination claim under the LAD. In the absence of controlling authority, in interpreting the LAD in disability discrimination claims, \u201cfederal law has consistently been considered for guidance.\u201d <em>Bomgesser, supra, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 380, 774 A.2d 615 (on LAD claim, applying federal law under Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as guidance); <em>Ensslin v. Twp. of N. Bergen, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 363-64, 646 A.2d 452 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>446, 663 A.2d 1354 (1995); <em>see also Chisolm, v.

There is a clear dichotomy between, on the one hand, those claims alleging an overall lack of access, which require no advance notice, and, on the other hand, those claims alleging a failure to reasonably accommodate by making specific adaptations necessitated by the individual\u2019s disability, which do require notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Regarding the latter, under Title II of the ADA, which prohibits disability discrimination by public entities, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12132, a plaintiff claiming discrimination on the basis that a public entity failed to provide a particular reasonable accommodation needs to show that the public entity had knowledge that the individual required accommodation. <em>See, e.g., Robertson v. Las Animas County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>500 P.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201c[B]e-fore a public entity can be required under the ADA to provide an auxiliary aid ..., the entity must have knowledge that the individual is disabled, either because that disability is obvious or because the individual (or someone else) has informed the entity of the disability.\u201d); <em>Kiman v.

Dist., </em>672 F.Supp.2d 1045, 1062-63, 1068 (C.D.Cal.2008) (granting motion for permanent injunctive relief, and stating that \u201c[b]y continuing to require disabled students to request accommodation [regarding inaccessible workstations and paths of travel] ..., the District has failed to operate its facilities and services in a non-discriminatory manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">For example, in <em>Schonfeld v. City of Carlsbad, </em>978 <em>F.Supp. </em>1329 (S.D.Cal.1997), <em>affd, </em>172 F.3d 876 (9th Cir.1999), the plaintiffs alleged disability discrimination in violation of Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act because \u201cthey were unable to access specific buildings and use the defendant\u2019s parking facilities, ramps and streets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331. On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs were not qualified individuals with disabilities because they did not make formal requests to utilize the defendant\u2019s facilities and services. <em>Id. </em>at 1332. The court rejected the argument, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that \u201c[t]he ADA does not require plaintiffs bringing a claim alleging inadequate access to a facility to have \u2018formally\u2019 requested to use the facility.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The case of <em>Panzardi-Santiago v. Univ. of P.R., </em>200 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.P.R.2002), perhaps best illustrates this dichotomy in approach. There, the plaintiffs alleged disability discrimination in violation of Title II of the ADA, and sought injunctive relief ordering the University of Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to make the facilities at the university\u2019s campus \u201creadily accessible and usable by qualified individuals with disabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The Commonwealth sought summary judgment on the claim that the plaintiff was denied services, access to programs, and reasonable accommodations at the university\u2019s facilities, arguing that no discrimination occurred because a request for reasonable accommodation eoncededly was never made and the Commonwealth did not know about the plaintiffs disability. <em>Id. </em>at 15. The court noted that both the Rehabilitation Act and ADA require, in educational settings, that a plaintiff notify the institution of the disability. <em>Id. </em>at 16. Since the record was undisputed that the Commonwealth had no knowledge of the plaintiffs disability and the plaintiff did not request an accommodation, the court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Additionally, the plaintiff sought summary judgment against the Commonwealth on the claim that she suffered disability discrimination because of a road\u2019s overall inaccessibility on the university\u2019s campus. <em>Ibid. </em>Regarding whether the plaintiffs claim failed because she did not request a reasonable accommodation, the court explained that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">reviewed numerous cases to determine if a plaintiff is required to request accommodation in order to make a prima facie case in an arena outside of an educational setting. The cases cited by the Commonwealth were either employment or education discrimination cases. <em>Cases involving access generally [subscribe\u2022] to the theory that a plaintiff bringing a claim alleging inadequate access to a facility does not have to formally request accommodation. See Layton v. Elder, </em>143 <em>F.</em>3d 469 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Schonfeld v. City of Carlsbad, </em>978 <em>F.Supp. </em>1329 (S.D.Cal.1997), <em>[affd, </em>172 <em>F.3d </em>876 (9th Cir.1999) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 18 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We find this reasoning underlying the distinction in claims persuasive. It is entirely reasonable and consistent with the spirit, if not letter, of the Division\u2019s implementing regulations, to require qualified persons with a disability requesting a reasonable accommodation to apprise the public entity of his or her disabling condition and any suggestions for such possible public accommodations. Indeed, under the LAD, public entities are required, \u201cto the extent reasonable,\u201d to accommodate disabled persons \u201cin the most integrated setting appropriate <em>to the needs of that person.\u201d N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.4(a) (emphasis added). That amendment was implemented in response to a comment that the rules should specify that \u201cpriority be given to an accommodation preferred by the person seeking accommodation.\u201d 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>3979 (Dec. 6, 1999). The Division \u201cagree[d] that a determination regarding the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation should include consideration of the needs and wishes of the person seeking accommodation and the effectiveness and adequacy of the modification.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the Division\u2019s comment strongly implies that, in a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must notify the public entity of the requested accommodation so a reasonable accommodation that considers the needs and wishes of the disabled person may be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On the other hand, where a more generalized claim alleging overall lack of access is made, a plaintiff seeking redress should not be required, as a prerequisite to filing such a claim, to first make a request for a reasonable accommodation. We find nothing in the language of the LAD itself or its legislative history to suggest that notice is an element of the claim in the public accommodation context. Indeed, allowance of such claims without the pre-condition of notice furthers the legislative goal of holding owners of places of public accommodation to their statutory obligation of making their facilities open and accessible to disabled persons, who should have \u201cfull and equal access to society, limited only by their physical limitations____\u201d <em>Franek, supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>per. </em>at 217, 754 A.2d 1237 (internal quotations omitted). It is also consistent with the Division\u2019s interpretation of the statute the agency is charged with enforcing, to which we defer.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Here, the motion judge noted, as a matter of law, that a request for accommodation is required in every instance regardless of the specific circumstances and nature of the claim raised. In doing so, the court failed to appreciate the distinction, clearly drawn in federal eases under the ADA, between particularized claims of a failure to reasonably accommodate and generalized claims of an overall lack of access, and therefore erred in dismissing plaintiffs entire complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">That complaint raises a number of public accommodation disability discrimination claims. We leave it to the motion judge, after appropriate and full discovery, and on a more complete record, to ascertain the precise nature and substance of the claims presented and to apply the principles we espouse today to each one.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> This opinion is being filed simultaneously with the instant opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
