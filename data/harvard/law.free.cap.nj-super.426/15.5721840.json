This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The facts and procedural history are not in dispute. On October 30,1996, when he was thirty-years old, Carluccio was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. On or about August 2, 1998, after pleading guilty to third-degree attempted aggravated assault, he was sentenced to a five-year term of probation. His probation was revoked on March 24, 2000, and Carluccio was sentenced to three years in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He remained incarcerated from March 24, 2000 to January 25, 2001, and was on parole supervision from that date until June 10, 2002. The record contains a letter from a senior parole officer, dated November 3, 2004, indicating that Carluccio complied with all conditions of parole, remained arrest-, drug- and alcohol-free, and his overall evaluation was \u201cvery good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Carluccio was among 334 eligible candidates for the position of \u201cSafety Specialist Trainee, DMV\u201d on a civil service list promulgated on November 15, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carluccio\u2019s name appeared on three certifications, one each for Moms, Monmouth and Camden counties. Carluccio was offered the position contingent upon a criminal background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">On February 13, 2008, the MVC advised Carluccio that he was disqualified based upon information revealed \u201cfrom th[e] record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>check.\u201d On February 14, the MVC further advised Carluccio that it would \u201cdefer any further processing\u201d because of the \u201ccriminal conviction that ha[d] not been expunged by a Court,\u201d but explained that Carluccio was \u201cnot automatically disqualified] ... if [he could] affirmatively demonstrate clear and convincing evidence of ... rehabilitation.\u201d The MVC indicated it would consider the eight factors contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:2A-32(f), and invited Carluccio to respond and submit \u201cany information or evidence of rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In his written response, Carluccio stated that his 1998 conviction resulted from \u201ca domestic incident that [he] allowed to get out of control due to alcohol and immaturity.\u201d Carluccio offered as proof of his rehabilitation: a Certificate of Good Conduct issued by the Parole Board in December 2007, recognizing that his employment as a Code Enforcement Official \u201cwould not be incompatible with the welfare of society,\u201d and a letter from the Parole Board indicating the certificate \u201cmay be applied to your proposed employment as a Safety Specialist\u201d; a commercial driver\u2019s license with a Hazardous Material Endorsement, along with letters from the federal Transportation Security Administration approving Carluceio\u2019s application for the endorsement and its renewal after finding he posed no security threat; a certificate of membership in the Italian-American Police Society of New Jersey; a diploma from the Chubb Institute issued in April 2002; an Inspector\u2019s License issued by the MVC for employment by a private contractor, Parsons, that operated motor vehicle inspection stations from 2002 to 2005, and letters of recommendation from a supervisor who worked for the MVC and Carluccio\u2019s sister, who was also employed by the MVC; and several letters of recommendation from friends in the law enforcement community. Carluccio cited provisions of the Rehabilitated Convicted Offenders Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:168A-1 to -16 (the RCOA), in further support.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The MVC responded by disqualifying Carluccio from employment \u201cbased upon the nature and responsibility of the position of Safety Specialist Trainee ... as its role is to provide direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>customer service to the citizens and businesses of the State of New Jersey.\u201d The MVC advised it would request Carluceio\u2019s name be removed from the certified list \u201cdue to the results of [his] criminal history background check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The MVC submitted its request to SHRM, indicating Carluccio was disqualified \u201cpursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:2A-32(e) ]\u201d based upon his prior criminal history. The MVC further explained, \u201c[h]ad Mr. Carluccio been employed with the MVC at the time of this conviction, he would have had to forfeit his employment pursuant to [N.J.S.A.] 2C:51-2a(1). That being the ease, [his] history renders Mr. Carluccio unemployable at the MVC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Carluccio appealed, and, on May 13, 2008, SHRM notified Carluccio that it denied the MVC\u2019s request, his \u201cname remain[ed] active on the eligible list\u201d and his \u201cappeal [wa]s moot.\u201d SHRM also notified the MVC that it \u201cha[d] failed to provide justification as to how [Carluccio\u2019s] criminal record adversely relate[d] to a position that involves the inspection of motor vehicles and the administration of the driver\u2019s examination.\u201d SHRM instructed the MVC to include Carluccio on the three certifications, but the MVC refused. SHRM referred the matter to the CSC for enforcement, and Carluccio filed a direct appeal with the CSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Before the CSC, the MVC alleged SHRM \u201cdid not address the disqualification of Mr. Carluecio\u2019s employment based on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:2A-32.\u201d The MVC maintained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">[Disqualification and rejection of Mr. Carluccio under the provisions of Title 39 [was] <em>justified____N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-1 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:168-2 allow for the disqualification of an individual based on a prior criminal conviction, provided that the disqualification is based upon a law or rule or regulation or a prior conviction that adversely affects the individual[\u2019]s employment. Clearly, Title 39 is the statute that allows the [MVC] to disqualify Mr. Carluccio from employment, based on his serious prior criminal conviction that the [MVC] reasonably believes adversely affects his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The MVC asserted that Carluccio\u2019s conviction was \u201c\u2018serious,\u2019\u201d occurred when he \u201cwas 30 years old,\u201d \u201cnot young and easily influenced,\u201d and, as a Safety Specialist Trainee, Carluccio \u201cw[ould] have constant, daily contact with the customers the [MVC] is charged to serve.\u201d The MVC claimed that \u201cSafety Specialists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>perform road tests for all New Jersey citizens seeking a driver license [and] ... engage in the inspection of school buses and commercial buses.\u201d The MVC further noted that it had \u201cgone to great lengths to improve its image, customer service and its security\u201d and \u201cc[ould not] take the chance to have its new found reputation discredited with an employee who was convicted of and served time for a crime that has a foundation in an \u2018assault and/or threat\u2019 to another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Carluecio filed a response contending that the MVC\u2019s \u201cinterpretation and application of [T]itle 39 [was] in error.\u201d He alleged that \u201cthe position ... was in Inspection Services and not in Driver Testing,\u201d and he would \u201cnot give driving tests\u201d nor be \u201cinvolved in any way with the driving test process and therefore [would not be] \u2018directly or indirectly involved in the issuance or processing of driver\u2019s licenses, identification cards, driving records, or vehicle registrations and titles.\u2019\u201d Carluecio further alleged that \u201cwhile [he] was employed at Parsons\u201d pursuant to a license issued by the MVC that was \u201crenewed in 2004, 2006, and 2008,\u201d he \u201cworked on State property and had constant, extensive contact with customers.\u201d Carluecio also argued that the MVC failed to consider the impact of the RCOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In its July 27, 2009, decision, the CSC rejected Carluccio\u2019s argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-3 \u201cpreclude[d]\u201d the MVC from \u201cdisqualifying or discriminating\u201d against him in light of his Certificate of Good Conduct and MVC-issued inspector license. The CSC concluded that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:168A-3 was \u201cnormally applied in situations where the agency issues a license or certification so that an individual may engage in a particular type of employment\u201d; thus, the statute did not apply because the MVC \u201c[wa]s acting as a public employer,\u201d and \u201cnot ... as a licensing agency.\u201d The CSC further found that, while pardon or expungement prohibits an appointing authority from rejecting an eligible person based upon a conviction, Carluecio was neither pardoned nor was his conviction expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The CSC additionally found that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-9 applied, which states that \u201c[a] certificate ... shall be presumptive evidence of ... rehabilitation when considered in regard to public employment____\u201d However, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(e), the title of Safety Specialist Trainee was \u201cexempt from being considered \u2018public employment\u2019 ... since it is a position that has access to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare, and safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The CSC cited the MVC\u2019s public responsibilities, including \u201cfraud detection, training and monitoring\u201d that required \u201c[p]roper identification ... at all phases of the licensing and driver testing process\u201d and comparison of \u201cDMV records ... with Social Security Administration records in order to verify the validity of Social Security numbers in [MVC] databases.\u201d The CSC specifically noted that \u201cthe ability to have access to personal information of customers, including social security numbers, and the responsibility of ensuring the identity of the customers of the MVC, by an individual who ha[d] a conviction and ... spent time in prison [was] particularly troubling.\u201d The CSC further determined that \u201cother then [sic] the Certificate of Good Conduct, [Carluccio] failed to provide any information as to his rehabilitation,\u201d and hiring Carluccio \u201cwould violate the public trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Carluccio sought reconsideration and argued that the CSC \u201crelied on incorrect information in detennining what the duties of a Safety Specialist Trainee ... were.\u201d In support, Carluccio submitted letters from his sister and an MVC supervisor which disputed the actual duties of a Safety Specialist Trainee and claimed that such employees \u201cdo not have access to personal data.\u201d Carluccio also submitted a certificate issued by the Parole Board in June 2009 (the 2009 certificate) pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-8, stating that the Parole Board \u201c[had] been responsible for [his] supervision ... [and had] determined that [Carluccio] ha[d] achieved a degree of rehabilitation to indicate that his engaging ... as a ... Safety Specialist would not pose a substantial risk to public safety, would assist in his successful reintegra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>tion and [was] consistent with the public interest.\u201d The MVC countered by arguing that \u201cit routinely reassigns employees\u201d and \u201can employee hired into a unit that does not have access to personal information or responsibility for verifying one\u2019s identity has to be prepared and qualified to be reassigned to a unit that does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On June 1, 2010, the CSC denied Carluccio\u2019s request for reconsideration, noting that he \u201cmerely reiterate[d] his prior arguments.\u201d The CSC concluded that \u201cbased on the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7c, ... the position of Safety Specialist Trainee ... would be exempt from being considered \u2018public employment\u2019 ... since it is a position that has access to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare and safety.\u201d The CSC further concluded that even if Carluecio\u2019s \u201cinitial position did not have access\u201d to such information, \u201che could be reassigned at any time to a unit that did have access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Before us, Carluccio generally argues that pursuant to the statutory and regulatory scheme, his prior conviction does not justify disqualification from employment with the MVC. In particular, he contends that the CSC failed to properly consider the factors bearing on disqualification contained in various provisions of the RCOA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:2A-32. Lastly, Carluccio argues his employment would not \u201cviolate the public trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The CSC contends that the RCOA does not apply and it properly considered the provisions of other applicable statutes. It further argues that its decision should be affirmed because it was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We reverse and remand the matter to the CSC for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We note the well-recognized standards that guide our review of agency action. Appellate courts have \u201ca limited role\u201d in the review of administrative agency determinations. <em>In re Stallworth, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>182, 194, 26 A.3d 1059 (2011) (quoting <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579, 410 A.2d 686 (1980)); <em>In re Carter, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>474, 482, 924 A.2d 525 (2007). \u201cIn order to reverse an agency\u2019s judgment, an appellate court must find the agency\u2019s decision to be \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, or [] not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stallworth, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 194, 26 A.3d 1059 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Henry, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (in turn citing <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963))).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In general, appellate review is limited to determining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">(1) whether the agency\u2019s action violates express or implied legislative policies, that is, did the agency follow the law; (2) whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the findings on which the agency based its action; and (3) whether in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the agency clearly erred in reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made on a showing of the relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\"><em>[Carter, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 482-83, 924 A.2d 525 (quoting <em>Mazza v.

Tpk. Auth. v. Local 196, I.F.P.T.E., </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>283, 301, 920 A.2d 88 (2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-1). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-16\">Notwithstanding the contraiy provisions of any law or rule or regulation ..., no State ... department, board, officer or agency, hereinafter referred to as \u201clicensing authority\u201d authorized to pass upon the qualifications of any applicant for a license or certificate of authority or qualification to engage in the practice of a profession or business or for admission to an examination to qualify for such a license or certificate may disqualify or discriminate against an applicant for a license or certificate or an application for admission to a qualifying examination on the grounds that the applicant has been convicted of a crime, ... except that a licensing authority may disqualify or discriminate against an applicant for a license or certificate if [N.J.&amp;A] 2C:51-2 ... is applicable, or if a conviction for a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>relates adversely to the occupation, trade, vocation, profession or business for which the license or certificate is sought.

For the reasons cited below, we need not address this discrete issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-16\">It is true that the few reported cases interpreting the RCOA have done so in the context of applications for specific vocational licenses. <em>See Maietta v.

No reported case has interpreted these new provisions of the RCOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In pertinent part, the amendments provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">a. <em>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a certificate may be issued </em>in accordance with the provisions of this act <em>that suspends ceHain disabilities, forfeitures or bars to employment </em>or professional licensure or certification that apply to persons convicted of criminal offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">b. <em>A certificate issued pursuant to this act shall have the effect of relieving disabilities, forfeitures or' bars, </em>except those established or required by federal law, <em>to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">(1) <em>public employment, </em>as defined in this section....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:168A-7(a) and (b)(1) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">The Parole Board is a \u201csupervising authority,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(c)(3), authorized to issue such a certificate \u201cto a qualified offender.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-8(b)(l) and (d)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such a certificate \u201cmay suspend disabilities, forfeitures and bars generally within the limits of [the RCOA], or only certain disabilities, forfeitures and bars, specifically named in the certificate document.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-8(b)(2) and (d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">The issuance of a certification by the Parole Board has other implications. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-9 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">A certificate issued pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7] shall be presumptive evidence of the subject\u2019s rehabilitation <em>when considered in regard to public employment as defined in this act, </em>or in conjunction with any licensing, or certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>process to which this act applies, which in any particular case may or may not be overcome by other evidence or information. A certificate granted under this act shall not prevent any judicial, administrative, licensing or other body, board, authority or public official from relying on grounds other than the fact of the criminal conviction in exercising any discretionary authority, if any, to suspend, revoke, refuse to issue or refuse to renew any license, permit or other authority or privilege <em>or to determine eligibility or suitability for employment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\"><em>[Ibid., </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The plain language of these amendments to the RCOA extended the statute\u2019s reach to \u201cpublic employment\u201d opportunities. <em>Compare N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7 (extending RCOA to \u201cpublic employment\u201d) with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-12 (exempting \u201cprivate employers\u201d from the RCOA). The Legislature\u2019s intent is further evidenced by the legislative history that accompanied passage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">The bill specifically prohibits <em>the denial of ... employment to applicants who have previously been convicted of a crime </em>because of the conviction or because of a finding of lack of \"good moral character\u201d based on the conviction____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\"><em>[Sponsor\u2019s Statement to A. S62S </em>(Oct. 23,2006) (emphasis added).] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>access to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare, or safety.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Therefore, \u201c[notwithstanding any law to the contrary,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(a), a certif\u00edcate issued pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-8, not <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-3, is the legislatively-chosen mechanism to \u201creliev[e] disabilities, forfeitures or bars\u201d to public employment arising from certain prior criminal convictions. In this ease, the Parole Board\u2019s 2009 certif\u00edcate, furnished in support of Carluceio\u2019s motion for reconsideration, presumptively demonstrated his rehabilitation for purposes of seeking public employment and relieved him of any \u201cdisabilities, forfeitures [and] bars\u201d resulting from his 1998 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">However, that does not end our inquiry. The CSC determined that the position of Safety Specialist Trainee was not \u201cpublic employment,\u201d and, therefore, the RCOA did not apply. Although the Legislature effectively extended the RCOA beyond its original purposes, the expansion was not without limits. Specifically, the Legislature carefully defined \u201cpublic employment\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(e)(l) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Therefore, the beneficial effects of a certificate issued pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-8 do not inure to public employment opportunities \u201cin law enforcement\u201d or \u201cany position that has access to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare or safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">In this case, without reference to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:168A-7(c)(l), the CSC determined \u201cthat a Safety Specialist Trainee is not a law enforcement title.\u201d When originally enacted in 1968, the RCOA did not exempt law enforcement agencies from its purview. However, in 1974, the Legislature adopted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-6 that expressly exempts \u201cany law enforcement agency.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also In re C. Schmidt &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 354, 399 A.2d 637 (holding the law enforcement exemption applies to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control); <em>but see Maietta, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 459 A.2d 295 (holding the exemption does not apply to the Racing Commission). Because the issue is not squarely before us, we do not consider whether employees of the MVC are \u201cin law enforcement\u201d as that term is used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(c)(l). However, referencing the potential duties included in the job description, and concluding that the position of Safety Specialist provided \u201caccess to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare and safety!,]\u201d the CSC concluded the position was not \u201cpublic employment,\u201d as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(c)(l), to which the RCOA applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The 2009 certificate specifically stated that the Parole Board was acting \u201cin accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7\u201d when it determined Carluecio\u2019s \u201cproposed employment, as a ... Safety Specialist would not pose a substantial risk to public safety ... and [was] consistent with the public interest.\u201d In a letter that preceded receipt of the certificate, the supervisor of the Parole Board\u2019s \u201cExecutive Clemency Unit\u201d advised Carluccio that after consideration of his application by the \u201cfull Board,\u201d it was \u201cdetermined that\u201d \u201c[his] proposed employment as a ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Safety Specialist ... [did] not pose a substantial risk to the public____[T]he certif\u00edcate would assist [Carluccio] with successful reintegration and [was] consistent with [the] public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-16 authorizes the Parole Board to adopt regulations implementing the RCOA. The Parole Board regulations became effective on January 20, 2009. <em>See </em>41 <em>N.J.R. </em>618(a). These regulations are now codified as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-9.1 to -9.8, and essentially track the language of the RCOA. Specifically, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-9.2 defines \u201cpublic employment\u201d in identical language to the statute, thus, providing no elucidation of the phrase \u201cany position that has access to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare, or safety,\u201d the critical exemption from the RCOA\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic employment\u201d at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-4(a) authorizes the CSC to establish the list of eligibles for a job title. The Legislature has delegated to the CSC the authority to \u201crender the final administrative decision\u201d on a variety of appeals, and to \u201c[interpret the application of [the Civil Service Act] to any public body or entity.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:2-6(a), (b), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">In deciding the SHRM\u2019s enforcement request and Carluccio\u2019s appeal, the CSC \u201chad the right and the duty to interpret and apply the [RCOA] to the dispute before it.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Allen, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 444, 621 A.2d 87 (App.Div.1993). However, \u201cgeneral agency principles provide that administrative actions cannot alter the terms of any statute, nor can they violate legislative policies.\u201d <em>Oches v. Twp. of Middletown Police Dep\u2019t, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>1, 27-28, 713 A.2d 993 (1998) (Garibaldi, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">In considering whether Carluecio\u2019s potential employment as a Safety Specialist was \u201cpublic employment\u201d under the RCOA, the CSC was required to recognize that the Legislature delegated to the Parole Board implementation of the 2008 amendments to the RCOA. It is axiomatic that the Parole Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute was entitled to some deference. <em>See, e.g., Wnuck v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>N.J. Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 56, 766 A.2d 312 (App.Div.2001) (noting that our standard of review requires that we \u201cordinarily\u201d defer to the \u2018\u201cinterpretation of statutes and regulations within [an agency\u2019s] implementing and enforcing responsibility\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>In re Appeal by Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 102, 704 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In issuing the 2009 certificate, the Parole Board concluded that \u201c[notwithstanding any law to the contrary,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(a), Carluccio was \u201creliev[ed] [of] disabilities, forfeitures or bars ... to ... public employment\u201d occasioned by his criminal conviction. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-7(b)(l). By specifically referencing the job title in question, we assume the Parole Board concluded the position of Safety Specialist was \u201cpublic employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(e). Further, the certificate was \u201cpresumptive evidence of [Carluccio\u2019s] rehabilitation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">To be sure, this presumption \u201cmay or may not be overcome by other evidence or information\u201d \u201cin any particular case.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-9; <em>see also Storcella, supra, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 243, 686 A.2d 789 (noting that despite the broad language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:168A-3, the Lottery Commission could \u201cconsider the nature of the activities underlying the crimes committed ... and the impact that licensing someone who had conducted an illegal lottery, especially on the very same premises covered by the license, will have on the public\u2019s perception of the integrity of the Lottery\u201d). Additionally, \u201cgrounds other than the fact of the criminal conviction\u201d may inform the appointing agency\u2019s exercise of its \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, in the first instance, the 2009 certificate specific to the title in question established that Carluccio\u2019s conviction did not disqualify him from eligibility for the position, \u201c[notwithstanding any other law to the contrary.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In its decision denying Carluccio\u2019s appeal and his motion for reconsideration, the CSC did not reference the above-cited regulations or the preeminent role the Legislature assigned to the Parole Board in implementing the amendments to the RCOA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Because we are not confident that the CSC properly considered the effect of the amendments to the RCOA and the Parole Board\u2019s issuance of the 2009 certification in reaching its decision, we are constrained to remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The appellate record does not contain the job description for the position of Safety Specialist Trainee, although the MVC, the CSC and Carluecio referenced various portions of it in their submissions that were part of the record below. We cannot discern whether the Parole Board was supplied with the actual job description when it issued the 2009 certificate. The appellate record only contains the certificate and letters the Board sent to Carluccio announcing its determination and enclosing the certificate. On remand, the CSC may permit the MVC to submit the entire job description to the Parole Board for consideration and determination as to whether the position of Safety Specialist MVC provides \u201caccess to sensitive information that could threaten the public health, welfare, or safety.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-7(c)(1).
