Defendant Luis M. Lopez was the School\u2019s principal, and defendant Calvin J. Mott was one of the School\u2019s vice-principals. Plaintiffs employment was terminated on December 27, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">In a complaint filed on January 4, 2008, plaintiff alleged that defendants: violated his due process and equal protection rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>under the New Jersey Constitution and the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6-1 to -2 (the CRA) (count I); retaliated against him in violation of the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -14 (CEPA) (count II); breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (count III); defamed him (Count IV); intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him (Count V); placed him before the public in a false light (Count VI); and otherwise committed acts constituting invasion of privacy (Count VII). Defendants answered denying the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Defendants\u2019 pre-trial summary judgment motion was denied by one Law Division judge and the case proceeded to trial before a different judge. After plaintiff rested, defendants moved for an involuntary dismissal pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b). The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">After all the evidence was admitted, defendants moved for judgment pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:40-1. The judge dismissed: 1) all claims against Lopez; 2) the CEPA claim against Mott; and 3) the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against all defendants (counts III and V). Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his equal protection and invasion of privacy claims (part of count I and count VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Regarding plaintiff\u2019s alleged CRA due process violation, the judge granted the motion and dismissed plaintiffs claim that his procedural due process rights had been violated. However, the judge denied the motion as to plaintiffs claim of a substantive due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The jury returned verdicts of no cause of action on counts II, IV, and VI (CEPA, defamation, and false light). As to plaintiffs claim of a substantive due process violation under the CRA, the jury awarded him $23,534.50 in economic damages and $5000 in emotional distress damages. Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:40-2(b) was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The judge awarded plaintiff $143,894.12 in counsel fees and costs which was less than plaintiff sought. The judge thereafter entered a final amended judgment in the total amount of $175,286.75 that included $31,392.63 in damages and pre-judgment interest. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Defendants contend plaintiffs substantive due process claim under the CRA should have been dismissed because: 1) \u201cthe substantive due process clause does not apply to personnel decisions of a public employer\u201d; and 2) the judge \u201callow[ed] plaintiff to create a substantive due process claim from everyday workplace disagreements.\u201d Defendants also argue that the due process claim should have been dismissed because of CEPA\u2019s waiver provision. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 (providing that institution of an action under CEPA \u201cshall be deemed a waiver of the rights and remedies available under ... State law, rule or regulation or under the common law\u201d). Defendants further contend that the trial judge erred by denying their motion for JNOV because the evidence did not support a finding that defendants\u2019 \u201cactions were so egregious, malicious and abusive that they shocked the conscience or offended human dignity.\u201d Lastly, defendants contend they were entitled to immunity. Plaintiff counters these arguments and cross-appeals from the judge\u2019s fee award, contending that he \u201cerred by reducing the lodestar by [fifty] percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We conclude that plaintiffs substantive due process cause of action under the CRA should have been dismissed by the trial judge at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s ease. <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b). We therefore reverse, dismiss plaintiffs cross-appeal and remand the matter to the trial court for the entry of judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Motions for involuntary dismissal, <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b), judgment, <em>Rule </em>4:40-1, and JNOV, <em>Rule </em>4:40-2, are governed by the same evidential standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>[I]f, accepting as trae all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according him the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><em>[Veidicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 30, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><em>See also </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:40 (2012). We apply the same standard of review, <em>Estate of Roach v.

Stanley Roberts, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>436, 441, 867 A.2d 1133 (2005). Because we conclude defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss made at the end of plaintiffs case should have been granted, we confine our review solely to the evidence presented on his case in chief. <em>See Verdicchio, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 30-31 n. 4, 843 A.2d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We recite much of the evidence regarding events that preceded plaintiffs actual termination. Of themselves, these events did not form the basis of plaintiffs substantive due process claim. We include them because plaintiff contends they evidence defendants\u2019 motive and animus toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s Hiring and First Year at the School</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In 2002, plaintiff, who had been a personal trainer, operated a gym, and worked as a loan officer and security guard since graduating from college in 1976, returned to school to become a physical education teacher under the alternate route program (the program). The program permitted those who did not have an undergraduate degree in education to receive on-the-job training and become certified by the State Department of Education (DOE).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The program was divided into three phases that were documented in guidelines NPS furnished to plaintiff before he commenced work. Plaintiff was to receive twenty days of mentorship with an experienced teacher who, to the extent possible, taught in the same subject area, followed by ten weeks of supervision, including bi-weekly evaluations and five months of support and supervision including evaluation for at least four teaching periods. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>NPS\u2019s policy regarding the mentoring of teachers in the program required that a new teacher be placed in a mentor teacher\u2019s classroom, or vice versa, with the district hiring an appropriate substitute as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In September 2005, NPS hired plaintiff and assigned him to the School, which included students between pre-kindergarten and fourth grade. The employment contract for the 2005-06 school year specified that plaintiff was an at-will employee who could be terminated upon thirty days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Plaintiff began working on September 15, 2005 under the direct supervision of Mott. Deborah Moustakas was also a vice-principal at the school. Within days, plaintiff complained to Mott and Moustakas that he was not supplied with a mentor, and they told him \u201cthey were working on it.\u201d Plaintiff taught his classes without a mentor for two weeks, and testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [he] was doing,\u201d \u201cthe kids weren\u2019t learning anything,\u201d and he was \u201cwatching them have playground time.\u201d Plaintiff was assigned to observe some experienced physical education teachers at other elementary schools where he \u201clearned some basic skills.\u201d Mott and Lopez, however, did not want to incur the expense of paying for a substitute in plaintiffs absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In early October, Mott told plaintiff that Giuseppe Leone would be his mentor. Leone, NPS\u2019s technology coordinator, had gone through the program himself but had no prior experience as a physical education teacher, spent little time with plaintiff and provided no real guidance. Leone testified he met with plaintiff only two or three times, after which Leone learned, from both Mott and plaintiff, that plaintiff \u201cdid not want [Leone\u2019sJ services because\u201d \u201ca computer guy ... would not be able to assist him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Plaintiffs experience was in contrast to that of Marijoe Ashikwei, who also went through the program and began teaching second-grade at the School at the same time as plaintiff. Ashikwei testified that she formed a close relationship with her mentor teacher, for whom she worked previously as a teacher\u2019s aide. Ashikwei stated that Mott helped her whenever she asked, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>though she could not recall how frequently she sought his assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">During September and October 2005, plaintiff complained to Mott about physical conditions in the gym. He also complained to Moustakas about the lack of guidance he was receiving in learning how to curb his students\u2019 unruly behavior, the fact that his students did not have sneakers and Leone\u2019s inadequate mentoring. Moustakas did not address his concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On October 19, Lopez sent plaintiff a memorandum entitled \u201cTeacher Responsibilities,\u201d in which he criticized plaintiff for being \u201cunaware\u201d that two students had left the gym with \u201cscooters\u201d and for failing to have lesson plans for a substitute teacher. Lopez ordered plaintiff to submit \u201csubstitute plans\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Plaintiff testified that he allowed the students to take the scooters home because they were otherwise broken and about to be discarded. He also claimed that Leone told him he need not prepare substitute lesson plans because he was a gym teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In mid-November, Mott informed plaintiff that he was required to submit lesson plans. Mott spoke with plaintiff a few times to assist him in preparing lesson plans and advised plaintiff to contact physical education teachers from other schools for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">On December 21, 2005, plaintiff received a \u201cletter of discipline\u201d from Mott stating that he had failed to submit lesson plans in a timely fashion. Plaintiff explained in a letter dated December 30, that Mott had not provided him with a specific date for submission of the lesson plans, and plaintiff had submitted the plans per Mott\u2019s request the following day. Also on December 30, plaintiff wrote to his union representative that he had received \u201cno on the job support or mentor\u201d since September, had been \u201ccriticized by the administration regarding many different aspects of the job for which [he] ha[d] not been properly trained,\u201d and requested \u201can experienced teacher or mentor\u201d for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>In January 2006, several experienced physical education teachers from other schools came to the School and observed plaintiff. In a memorandum dated January 27, Lopez told plaintiff that his \u201c[twenty] day mentoring program [would] begin on January 29\u201d with Victor DeSalvo, an experienced physical education teacher at another school. Plaintiff stated that DeSalvo \u201cwas very good\u201d and \u201ctaught [plaintiff] what [he] needed to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">On January 10, Mott evaluated plaintiffs performance. Of four possible grades \u2014 unsatisfactory, basic, proficient, and distinguished \u2014 plaintiffs overall rating was \u201cbasic.\u201d Plaintiff received a similar overall rating from Mott in a second evaluation dated March 30 and a third evaluation in June. Mott recommended plaintiff for continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">However, in the interim, by memorandum dated March 16, Lopez notified plaintiff that \u201c[s]everal parents\u201d had complained about his inappropriate use of profanity during class. Plaintiff admitted that he had, on one occasion, told his students that \u201cthey\u2019re acting like a bunch of stupid asses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Plaintiff also testified regarding an incident that occurred in June 2006 involving one of his students, Y.R. Plaintiff instructed the girl to sit on the floor, but she refused and sat on a bench. Plaintiff \u201clightly held her by her upper arm and ... positioned her from the bench until she sat on the floor.\u201d Y.R. was not hurt, and plaintiff did not send her to the school nurse to be seen for any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Plaintiff testified that the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) investigated the incident and issued a report that \u201ccame back unfounded.\u201d Months later, he confirmed with Marie Alum, the nurse at the School, that she never examined Y.R., although DYFS\u2019s report of the incident \u201csaid [Y.R.] was ... looked at by the school nurse.\u201d Alum testified that although her duties included investigating claims of physical abuse made by students, and reporting same to DYFS, she did not recall examining Y.R. or making such a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Plaintiff was not disciplined, and, on June 8, a second employment contract for the 2006-2007 school year was executed. The terms of the contract again provided that plaintiff was an at-will employee subject to termination upon thirty-days\u2019 written notice. Mott approved plaintiff for a standard certification in health and physical education, and the DOE issued him a teaching certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Second Year at the School</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">On September 7, 2006, the first day of the new school year, Mott gave plaintiff a letter which summarized \u201cstrategies\u201d discussed at a meeting held two days earlier. Plaintiff was to: \u201c[rjefrain from any and all physical contact with students\u201d; complete appropriate lesson plans and use them on a daily basis; visit all students in them classrooms prior to the first day of physical activity to \u201cinform [them] of ... gym procedures\u201d; prohibit students from drinking water during class; begin instruction immediately upon students\u2019 arrival; watch students at all times; limit the number of simultaneous activities; and prohibit the use of scooters.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Plaintiff testified that physical contact with the students was unavoidable. He complained to Mott and Moustakas that denying his students water during gym was hazardous to their health. Indeed, DeSalvo testified that he permitted his students to drink water \u201cone at a time\u201d during the rest period at the end of gym class. Plaintiffs complaints to Mott and Moustakas were rebuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Mott evaluated plaintiff for the first time in the new school year on October 11, 2006. Plaintiffs overall rating was again \u201cbasic.\u201d When Mott reviewed the evaluation with him, plaintiff noted it contained several factual errors, for example, what games the students were playing during the observation period. Mott\u2019s reaction to plaintiffs comments was \u201chostile,\u201d causing plaintiff to become \u201cvery suspicious of ... Mott because [he] had trouble with him the year before.\u201d Plaintiff refused to sign the evaluation until Mott corrected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Plaintiff did not see Mott again until November 21. On that day, Mott came to plaintiffs gym class and told him to report to the main office. When he arrived, plaintiff saw two envelopes for him sitting on a bench. One contained a memo from Mott, dated November 16, 2006, entitled \u201cINAPPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE (alleged).\u201d We quote from it at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">On Wednesday, November 15, ... several boys ... informed me of an incident that took place in the gymnasium during one of their physical education classes. Those students ... indicated that in your efforts to discipline [them], you allegedly demanded that the boys fight like animals and kill each other in your make shift <em>cage. ... </em>When [two of the boys] fell out of the <em>cage </em>during the rumble, you at least one time, physically grabbed the boys and tossed them back into the homemade <em>cage. </em>The same students say that you commented more than once throughout the ordeal that they can go ahead and kill themselves. Many students from the class support the boys\u2019 claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">Your actions as expressed by the three victims and one witness, is [sic] unequivocally unacceptable and completely opposes all codes of conduct ... as well as, federal and state statutes and regulations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">[I]t is critical that you use better judgment in resolving problems within the gymnasium. You have been reminded in written form and orally that the administration is always ready to assist. Please allow us to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The second envelope contained a letter from Lopez, dated November 20, detailing a complaint he received from the parent of a female student, K.L., \u201calleging] that her daughter informed her that [plaintiff had] touched her daughter inappropriately several times.\u201d Lopez \u201ccalled [the student] to [his] office and in the presence of the other two administrators^] she corroborated the same information.\u201d Lopez stated \u201cthis type of behavior will not be tolerated in this school and must cease immediately.\u201d Both documents ordered plaintiff to attend a meeting with Lopez and Mott on November 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">After reading the memo and the letter, plaintiff believed \u201cthey seemed serious\u201d and left before the meeting began to \u201cspeak to [his] union representative.\u201d Lopez sent plaintiff a memo, dated November 21, noting his absence from the scheduled meeting and advising him to \u201cadhere to the following recommendations: 1. Refrain from the use of profanity directed toward students. 2. Discontinue physically touching students. 3. Cease kicking stu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>dents to get their attention.\u201d Lopez further advised that he had \u201creceived numerous complaints from students, parents and colleagues regarding [plaintiffs] poor and inappropriate style of classroom management[,]\u201d and, if \u201cthese complaints eontinue[d] [his] only alternative ... [would] be to report this to the proper authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">At trial, plaintiff was asked if he recalled the incident described in Mott\u2019s memo. He testified that on October 19, three boys came into class \u201cpushing and shoving,\u201d and plaintiff \u201cblew [his] whistle and ... [told the] boys [they were] ... fighting like animals and ... [they were] going to kill each other.\u201d He brought the boys to the corner of the gym near a \u201cfoldout table.\u201d Plaintiff thought the boys were going to \u201cdive underneath [the] table,\u201d so he \u201cmoved the table and it tipped over.\u201d Plaintiff \u201cpicked [the table] up and slid it against the wall,\u201d and the \u201cboys sat there----Nobody was tossed. Nobody was touched. Nobody was injured.\u201d Regarding the allegations in Lopez\u2019s letter, plaintiff testified he had a vague recollection of the female student involved and denied touching any student \u201cinappropriately or especially in an inappropriate body part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">On November 27, Moustakas told plaintiff he was reassigned to another school. On November 30, John Scott-Bey, NPS\u2019s Chief Investigator, interviewed plaintiff regarding the inappropriate touching allegations made by K.L. At trial, plaintiff was permitted to testify about his conversations with Scott-Bey and the results of the investigation, which were contained in a report Scott-Bey prepared that was admitted into evidence. The report noted that after investigation, DYFS concluded the October 2005 referral involving Y.R. was \u201cunfounded,\u201d and that the Division\u2019s investigation of \u201cthe second allegation will be unfounded also.\u201d Scott-Bey recommended that plaintiff be transferred to a high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">On December 7, plaintiff was notified in writing by Laurette Asante, NPS\u2019s Director of \u201cLabor/Employee Relations,\u201d that a meeting was to be held on December 12 regarding allegations \u201cthat [he] allegedly engaged in inappropriate discipline of [his] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>students during gym class.\u201d Plaintiff went to the meeting with Pietro Petino, his union representative. The focus was the \u201ccage incident,\u201d and Mott presented the alleged facts to Asante, including four written statements taken from the young boys involved. Plaintiff believed they \u201cwere manipulated by Mr. Mott to write such a thing----\u201d Petino spoke on plaintiffs behalf and denied the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">While testifying at trial, plaintiff identified a Staff Incident Report dated November 27 prepared by Mott for Lopez. The report indicated that on November 15, the four boys told Mott about \u201can incident that took place in the gymnasium ... in the month of October.\u201d The report further contained details of the allegations similar to those Mott wrote in his November 16 memo to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">On December 27, plaintiff received a termination letter from NPS\u2019s Executive Director, Rita R. Salley. It provided, \u201c[b]ased upon appropriate recommendations from administrative staff, the district is exercising its right under ... [your] employment contract ... and terminating your services as a Physical Education Teacher, effective immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Plaintiff testified he was quite surprised, since NPS\u2019s \u201cChild Abuse and Neglect Policy\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">Due process rights will be provided to school personnel or volunteers who have been reassigned or suspended as a result of an accusation of child abuse or neglect. Temporary reassignment or suspension of school personnel or volunteers alleged to have committed an act of child abuse or neglect shall occur if there is reasonable cause to believe that the life or health of the alleged victim or other children is in imminent danger due to continued contact between the school personnel and a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">All references to a report of child abuse or neglect against school personnel shall be removed from employee personnel records immediately following the receipt of an official notice from DYFS that such allegations were unfounded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Plaintiff continued to receive his salary until January 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">\n<em>Events after Plaintiff was Terminated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">At trial, plaintiff introduced two letters he wrote to ScotL-Bey and Marion Bolden, the NPS Superintendent, in January 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>essentially recounting his version of events. Plaintiff testified that he \u201cwas doing everything ... trying to speak to everyone that [he] could to try to get [his] job back, and try to get that transfer.\u201d The letter to Seott-Bey referenced a conversation plaintiff claimed to have had on January 25, 2007, in which Seott-Bey told him \u201cthey were still working ... on the transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Plaintiffs request for unemployment benefits was denied by the Department of Labor because he was discharged for alleged improper conduct. Mott\u2019s version of the \u201ccage incident\u201d was apparently the basis for this conclusion. Plaintiff successfully appealed and began receiving unemployment benefits in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Plaintiff testified regarding the physical and psychological effects his termination had upon him. Dr. Stephen Kopel, a clinical psychologist, testified that plaintiff suffered from clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the events. Plaintiff re-enrolled in school and obtained a certificate in health education. However, his efforts to find employment, demonstrated by dozens of faxes he sent to various school districts commencing in January 2008, were unsuccessful until September 2008, when he was hired by the Irvington School District as a physical education teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In January and June 2007, plaintiff received letters from the Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families (DCF) which investigated referrals regarding the inappropriate touching of K.L. and the \u201ccage incident.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The January letter, authored by investigator Ongeri Aminga regarding the K.L. incident, noted \u201c[s]exual [a]buse was unfounded,\u201d and the investigation \u201crevealed no sexual/genital contact occurred.\u201d However, Aminga referenced \u201cissues noted in the course of the investigation,\u201d including K.L.\u2019s claim that plaintiff \u201cwas wont of putting his arms around her waist,\u201d and that plaintiff was \u201cfond of yelling and kicking students by their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>feet.\u201d Aminga concluded plaintiffs actions did not place K.L. \u201cat any risk of harm and were not to the degree required by statute to find sexual abuse.\u201d At trial, plaintiff testified that contact with the children was unavoidable, and that he observed Mott and Lopez touch students on occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The July letter, from investigator Tomieka Cherry, determined the referral regarding the \u201ccage incident\u201d was \u201cunfounded.\u201d However, Cherry noted concern that plaintiff had \u201carranged an area for the students to engage in a physical altercation and then allowed it to occur,\u201d and had \u201cverbally threatened the students during th[e] incident.\u201d Cherry concluded that \u201c[t]he actions of [plaintiff] placed the students at some risk of harm but were not to the degree required by statute to find physical abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Cherry testified before the jury and described the steps she took in investigating the \u201ccage incident,\u201d including interviews of plaintiff, Mott, another teacher, the students and some parents. The male students substantially corroborated Mott\u2019s version of events, although there were inconsistencies between their statements and those of the female students who witnessed the incident. Cherry testified that Mott said the \u201ccage incident\u201d occurred on October 2, 2006, and she also noted that Mott did not make the report to DYFS until December 5, nearly two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Plaintiff retained a private investigator, Louis F. Stephens, \u201cto check on [his] job reference to see what the ... School would say about [him], why [he] was terminated.\u201d Eepresenting themselves as employers seeking references on plaintiff, Stephens and a member of his staff taped phone conversations with Mott and Moustakas.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Mott indicated to Stephens he would \u201clove to say something and give an opinion about [plaintiff]\u201d but could not because plaintiff was suing the school system. In fact, plaintiffs complaint was not filed until after the conversation. Moustakas told Stephens she was not \u201cat liberty to discuss [plaintiffs] situation,\u201d but indicated she \u201cdid not have a problem with [plaintiff].\u201d Moustakas told Stephens she knew \u201cthere was a DYFS situation,\u201d but could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>provide no information. In the conversation with Stephens\u2019s associate, Mott said he \u201cwould rather not give out any information in regards to [plaintiff],\u201d and \u201cwould have to talk with legal\u201d before commenting. Mott continued, however, by saying plaintiff had been \u201creleased.\u201d When asked if the release was for \u201cadministrative purposes,\u201d Mott replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">That is the part that gets ... real touchy. There was a situation that we had to address and after addressing this situation several times!,] a determination was made by our legal department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Asked if he would recommend plaintiff, Mott answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">No. I would not like to be unfair. I have my own personal opinion!,] but X would think that if you can determine I am sure you would come up with the right conclusion considering that we are at a school that cares for young ones and we are at a school where children should be the priority, and whether they should be safe and sound at all times. And our highest interest and regard are for our young citizens. So I think you can be able to determine something from that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">After plaintiff rested, defendants moved for involuntary dismissal. Regarding the CRA claim, defense counsel focused on plaintiffs allegation that defendants fabricated the abuse complaints referred to DYFS that led to his termination. Defense counsel argued that \u201cunder [\u00a7] 1983 law, ... before you can bring a procedural] due process claim, assuming that\u2019s what\u2019s being brought here, you have to essentially exhaust your administrative remedies.\u201d Defendants also argued that plaintiffs property rights were limited to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Citing an earlier ruling made by the judge when defendants moved for summary judgment, plaintiff argued that it was \u201claw of the case that there was no need to exhaust administrative remedies in a New Jersey civil rights matter.\u201d Plaintiff further contended, as he did at the time the motion for summary judgment was denied, that the NPS child abuse policy and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7(a) \u201cconferred due process rights upon [him].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>In denying defendants\u2019 motion in this regard, the judge concluded the statute and policy \u201ccould create a property interest in employment which could be actionable here in this ease____ [Tjhere is a legitimate argument that under the ... policy the plaintiff shouldn\u2019t have been terminated but could have been reassigned or suspended until the DYFS investigation came back. And that there were ... potentially references to reports that should not have been referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Although it was not expressed at this time, we glean some of the judge\u2019s additional reasoning from his oral decision denying defendants\u2019 post-trial JNOV motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">[T]his just wasn\u2019t an employment rights case. It was about the right to liberty, reputation, pursuit of happiness and to avoid a stigma. It occurred through the plaintiffs employment, but why this court submitted the substantive due process is that even though it arose out of the defendant\u2019s employment, it had an effect upon his reputation through the rest of his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">Now, I also put weight in <em>Doe v.

State Univ., </em>227 F.3d 133, 142 (3d Cir.2000), the court went further by concluding that \u201ctenured public employment is [not] a fundamental property interest entitled to substantive due process protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Here, plaintiff was a non-tenured teacher employed pursuant to a contract that permitted NPS to terminate him upon thirty-days\u2019 written notice. Plaintiff was terminated and paid an additional thirty days of salary, i.e., all he was entitled to receive under the contract. He had no property right to continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Plaintiff argued in opposition to defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, and again when defendants moved for involuntary dismissal, that violations of NPS\u2019s child abuse and neglect policy, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7(a), somehow made his substantive due process claim cognizable under the CRA However, plaintiff has now conceded in his brief and during oral argument before us that any violations of the school district\u2019s policy or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7(a) are not the bases of his substantive due process claim. We need not address the issue further.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Instead, plaintiff argues that the evidence was sufficient to prove a substantive due process violation of his liberty interests, specifically, his right to be free from the \u201cpromulgation] of falsehoods to harm the reputation and dignity of a citizen of the [S]tate.\u201d Plaintiff advanced such an argument in opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>defendants\u2019 summary judgment and involuntary dismissal motions, and defense counsel touched upon that theme in summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">However, the issue was never submitted to the jury. The judge specifically charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">Count one; plaintiff alleges a violation of the FCRA], Specifically the plaintiff claims that the defendant^] unlawfully violated his civil rights by terminating his employment in violation of a state statute and [NPS\u2019sJ lp]oliey regarding abuse and neglect that afforded plaintiff certain substantive due process rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The judge then proceeded to tell the jury that it \u201cmust determine whether defendants acted properly in conducting [their] investigation in this case, or whether [their] conduct was so egregious and abusive that [it] shocks the conscience, violates the civilized norms of government or offend[s] human dignity.\u201d The judge continued, \u201c[Y]ou must first decide did the defendant terminate plaintiffs employment in violation of the State\u2019s statute and [NPS\u2019s] policy on child abuse and neglect____\u201d The verdict sheet asked the jury to decide whether NPS violated its policy or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7(a), and whether the violation \u201cdeprived plaintiff of his substantive due process rights secured by state or constitutional law?\u201d The jury was never asked to consider a substantive due process claim alleging violation of plaintiffs liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Since the jury was never charged on this theory of liability under the CRA, the verdict that resulted in plaintiffs favor simply cannot stand, and, at the least, reversal would be required and a new trial ordered. <em>See, e.g., Das v. Thani, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>518, 527, 795 A.2d 876 (2002). However, we are convinced that the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, failed to prove a substantive due process violation of plaintiffs liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u201cAs a general matter, one does not have a federal constitutionally protected liberty interest in his reputation.\u201d <em>Austin v. Neal, </em>933 <em>F.Supp. </em>444, 455 (E.D.Pa.1996) (citation omitted). To assert a cognizable due process claim under \u00a7 1983, \u201ca plaintiff must show a stigma to his reputation <em>plus </em>deprivation of some additional right or interest.\u201d <em>Hill v. Borough of Kutztoum, </em>455 F.3d 225, 236 (3rd Cir.2006) (citing <em>Paul v.

Thus, plaintiffs liberty claim was not cognizable as a substantive due process violation under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Plaintiff argues that our state constitution affords more expansive substantive due process protections for reputational liberty interests. We consider the merits of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cUnder Article I, Paragraph 1, as under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive due process analysis, determining whether a fundamental right exists involves a two-step inquiry. First, the asserted fundamental liberty interest must be clearly identified. Second, that liberty interest must be objectively and deeply rooted in the traditions, history, and conscience of the people of this State.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Harris, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>415, 435, 908 A.2d 196 (2006) (citation omitted) (citing <em>King v. S. Jersey Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>161, 178, 330 A.2d 1 (1974)). Plaintiff points to no New Jersey precedent that has recognized a liberty interest in one\u2019s good reputation that is embodied in our state constitution and protected by substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In considering a challenge to the law requiring community notification regarding certain sex offenders, the Court in <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 99, 662 A.2d 367, clearly held that the case did not \u201cdeal ... with the question of substantive constitutional deprivation.\u201d The Court found \u201cprotectible interests in both privacy and reputation\u201d that were more expansive than federal precedent by concluding that injury to reputation alone sufficed, i.e., that the stigma-plus test did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 662 A.2d 367. However, the Court noted that \u201c[i]n fulfilling [our] responsibility Lfor interpreting the New Jersey Constitution], \u2018we have generally been more willing to find State-created interests <em>that invoke the protection of procedural due process </em>than have our federal counterparts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>N.J. Parole Bd. v. Byrne, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>192, 208, 460 A.2d 103 (1983)) (emphasis added). The Court defined the scope of those protections: \u201cFundamentally, due process requires an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The minimum requirements of due process, therefore, are notice and the opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Another case relied upon by plaintiff below and before us is <em>East Park High School, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149, 714 A.2d 339. There, we held that if DYFS substantiates a child abuse charge against a teacher resulting in the inclusion of his name in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the Central Registry, the teacher was entitled to an administrative hearing to contest the finding. <em>Id. </em>at 159-66, 714 A.2d 339. We recognized that \u201c[t]he loss of [a teacher\u2019s] good reputation, when the Central Registry information is shared with even a few private citizens, will irrevocably injure [the teacher\u2019s] previous good name[,]\u201d and \u201c[a]ecording to <em>[Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 104-05, 662 A.2d 367], this injury ..., standing alone, is a proteetible private interest under the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 662 A.2d 367. Our reference to <em>Doe </em>in East Park High School recognized a teacher\u2019s right to procedural due process in such circumstances. <em>Cf. In re an Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning L.R., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 460-61, 729 A.2d 463 (App.Div. 1999) (distinguishing <em>East Park High School </em>and concluding that a teacher is not entitled to a hearing where DYFS determines child abuse allegations have not been substantiated but nonetheless expresses concerns about the teacher\u2019s conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In short, the only precedent cited by plaintiff recognizes that one\u2019s right to be free of arbitrary and abusive governmental damage to his reputation under our state constitution is protected only by procedural due process guarantees. Plaintiff concedes he was provided with procedural due process during the December 12, 2006 hearing with Asante.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Plaintiff now seeks to have us recognize a liberty interest in one\u2019s reputation that is embedded in our constitution and subject to protection as a substantive due process right under the CRA. Under the facts of this ease, that would require us to convert what was essentially a tort claim of defamation into something actionable under the CRA The federal precedent under \u00a7 1983 has refused to do so under similar circumstances. <em>See Shovlin v. Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry, </em>50 F.Supp.2d 297, 317 (D.N.J.1998) (noting that \u201cto recognize such a claim would be in conflict with the well-settled rule that the tort of defamation does not rise to the level of a deprivation actionable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">It is inappropriate for us, as a court of intermediate jurisdiction, to recognize a cause of action, particularly one of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>dimension, heretofore never recognized under existing jurisprudence from our Supreme Court. <em>See Riley v.

Therefore, defendants\u2019 motion for an involuntary dismissal made at the end of plaintiffs case should have been granted. We reverse the judgment under review and remand the matter to the trial court for the entry of judgment in favor of defendants dismissing plaintiffs complaint and vacating any award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Reversed on appeal; plaintiffs cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> The copies of these letters contained in the joint appendix are addressed to NPS\u2019s Director of Student Information Services, Susan Kandell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a provides:</p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">When a complaint made against a school employee alleging child abuse or neglect is investigated by the Department of Children and Families, the department shall notify the school district and the employee of its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Upon receipt of a finding by the department that such a complaint is unfounded, the school district shall remove any references to the complaint and investigation by the department from the employee\u2019s personnel records.
