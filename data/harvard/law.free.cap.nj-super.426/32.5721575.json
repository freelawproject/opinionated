Kates appeals from his conviction of second-degree eluding, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-2b (Count 1), and resisting arrest by flight, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-2a(2) (Count 4). Defendant claims the court denied him his constitutional right to counsel of choice by improperly denying him a continuance to hire a private attoi\u2019ney. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">In addition to the eluding and resisting arrest by flight charges, an April 16, 2008 indictment charged defendant with third-degree aggravated assault consisting of simple assault on a law enforcement officer, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1b(5)(a) (Count 2); third-degree resisting arrest by use of physical force or violence, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-2a(3)(a) (Count 3); fourth-degree hindering prosecution by force, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3b(2) (Count 5); and fourth-degree inflicting harm to a law enforcement animal, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3.1 (Count 6). Defendant also was charged with motor vehicle violations under various complaint-summonses.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Defendant, then fifty-one years old, was driving his green Dodge Ram pick-up truck at around 4 a.m. on May 2, 2007 in a high crime Bridgeton neighborhood known for gang activity. Riding in the passenger seat was a young man, Alfonso McClendon. The vehicle aroused a passing officer\u2019s suspicion because the police had received information that an African-American male in a maroon or dark blue small or mid-size truck, perhaps a Chevy S-10 pickup, would be delivering guns in the area. Bridgeton Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Officer Christopher Blackburn began following defendant\u2019s truck without activating his emergency lights or siren. Blackburn testified that defendant signaled to turn several times, but did not. After Blackburn activated his emergency lights, defendant rolled through a stop and increased his speed, and Blackburn turned on his siren.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Defendant led police on a chase of six or seven miles, outside the city and then back again, rolling or speeding through additional stops, driving erratically, sometimes coming to a complete halt, and other times reaching speeds of 80 or 90 m.p.h. At one point during the pursuit, when defendant slowed at an intersection, McClendon, fearing for his life, jumped from the truck. Blackburn said defendant almost collided with a passing car.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">When defendant\u2019s truck ultimately came to rest, defendant ran across a field and into woods, where Blackburn subdued him with the assistance of a police dog and another officer. Both defendant and Blackburn required medical treatment. No guns were found in the truck or in the personal possession of defendant or McClendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Defendant explained he was on his way to his brother\u2019s house so he could counsel McClendon. He believed the persons in the vehicle behind him intended to harm him, and his fear increased when the vehicle continued to follow him, even after he pulled to the side of the road to let it pass. He claimed he was so fearful, he \u201cblacked out\u201d while driving and did not notice the emergency lights or sirens. On cross-examination, the State introduced, for impeachment purposes, his 2006 conviction for possession of a controlled dangerous substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The jury found defendant guilty of Counts 1 and 4, but not guilty of Count 2, as well as not guilty of a lesser-ineluded charge of disorderly persons simple assault (predicated on defendant\u2019s alleged lack of knowledge that his alleged victim was a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>officer) and not guilty of Count 3. The State had dismissed Counts 5 and 6 before trial. The court found defendant guilty of three instances of failure to stop or yield, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-144.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The court granted the State\u2019s motion to sentence defendant to an extended term as a persistent offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(a). Defendant had been convicted of four indictable offenses: second degree robbery in 1973; third degree possession of CDS in 1983; second degree sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a minor in 1992; and, as we mentioned, third degree possession of CDS in 2006. He was also convicted of multiple disorderly persons offenses, including two while free on bail awaiting trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We turn now to the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s request to retain private counsel, the court\u2019s denial, and the role of appointed counsel during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Defendant had been free on $50,000 bond since November 19, 2007. The case had been scheduled for trial on July 19, 2010, but the judge could not reach it because he was still in the midst of another ongoing trial. Instead, on that day, the judge conducted a short scheduling conference on the case. Appearing on defendant\u2019s behalf, as they had on earlier occasions, were Assistant Deputy Public Defenders Jeffrey G. Klavens and Dionne Stanfield. Also present were Assistant Prosecutor Michael Ostrowski and defendant. The judge stated he intended to begin jury selection in defendant\u2019s ease on July 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Stanfield requested an adjournment until August 3, because she was scheduled to be out of the office the week of July 19. The court denied Stanfield\u2019s request, noting that counsel should have been prepared to proceed on July 19. The judge stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have the flexibility in my schedule to give you that extra time otherwise I would[.]\u201d However, Ostrowski disclosed the State also had a scheduling problem: the State\u2019s witnesses were available the week of July 19, but not necessarily the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, OstrowsM explained the State\u2019s case would not likely consume a full day, and the State would call local police officers and one lay witness. Stanfield stated the defense most likely would call defendant as its only witness. The court then tentatively scheduled jury selection for July 27, and testimony August 10, subject to Ostrowski\u2019s confirmation that the State\u2019s witnesses would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">When the matter came before the court for trial on Tuesday, July 27, 2010, Klavens, an Army Reservist, reported on the record he had received orders that he would likely be deployed overseas during the trial. He initially raised the matter to address how the judge would explain his sudden absence. However, defendant, who first learned in court that Klavens expected to be deployed, had other concerns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Klavens had been involved in his case longer than Stanfield. It appears Klavens was to be lead counsel, and Stanfield would serve as second-chair, although that is not clear from the record. Klavens requested an adjournment on defendant\u2019s behalf so he could retain private counsel, rather than have Klavens -withdraw mid-trial. Klavens stated defendant could afford private counsel as he had been employed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The court denied the request after it obtained Klavens\u2019s assurance that Stanfield was prepared to try the case. However, the court did not inquire of Stanfield herself, nor did the court make any findings regarding the two attorneys\u2019 relative experience. The court also did not inquire whether the State objected, nor did it elicit any evidence from defendant himself regarding his financial capacity to retain counsel, the length of the continuance he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>sought, and his reasons for seeking private counsel. Furthermore, the court did not expressly address the impact of an adjournment on the court\u2019s schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The colloquy in relevant part follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">THE COURT: Mr. Klavens, we did conference this matter briefly yesterday, I believe, and you indicated that although you\u2019re standing in as co-counsel, that its likely that you\u2019re not going to make it through the full extent of this trial. You may be deployed prior to the conclusion of this trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">MR. KLAVENS: yes, that\u2019s correct Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">THE COURT: Okay. That being said, however you \u2014 if you want to stand in as co-counsel that\u2019s fine. I just didn\u2019t know whether or not there\u2019s going to be any requests for me to advise the jury as to why you\u2019re automatically absent or how counsel wants to address that or you\u2019re just no longer here and we don\u2019t touch on it. I just want to make sure we\u2019re all clear as to how we\u2019re going to handle that situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">(Attorney discussion)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">MR. KLAVENS: <em>Your Honor, Mr. Kates has an objection and that is he\u2019s not comfortable, I guess, changing attorneys midstream or having the jury see me for part of the time and then seeing me leave for the rest of the time. He feels it\u2019s not fair to him. He\u2019s </em>\u2014 has <em>concerns that the jury would be confused,. So, I\u2019m not sure what to do at this point</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">THE COURT: Any proposals? I mean, what\u2019s your suggestion? I \u2014 is Ms. Stanfield going to be primarily handling this ease and you\u2019re going to be assisting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">MR. KLAVENS: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">MS. STANFIELD: Yes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">____[discussion among counsel and court regarding instruction court would give to jury regarding Klavens\u2019s possible mid-trial absence]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">THE COURT: Mr. Klavens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-17\">MR. KLAVENS: \u2014 Judge, through further discussion with Mr. Kates, <em>Mr. Kates has also indicated] that he\u2019s not comfortable, although Ms. Stanfield has my full faith and support and I know she\u2019s certainly capable of handling this case, Mr. Kates feels that because </em>\u2014 in <em>terms of time, she\u2019s newer to the case than I am. He feels that the lack of the time on the case by Ms. Stanfield is not to his benefit He\u2019s not comfortable at this point, </em>so, again, I don\u2019t know \u2014 I just want to put that on the record that that\u2019s Mr. Kates\u2019 position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-18\">THE COURT: Thank you and you\u2019ve worked \u2014 Mr. Klavens, you\u2019ve worked with Ms. Stanfield with this file and in your opinion Ms. Stanfield is prepared and ready to proceed and Ms. Stanfield I would ask you the same question. This is something that\u2019s been anticipated. Ms. Stanfield is going to be trying this case with you for some quite time, is my understanding. I could be wrong about that, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-19\">MR. KLAVENS: Judge, this is \u2014 we have worked together on this case and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s ready and prepared. <em>This is relatively new to Mr Kates the fact that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>I\u2019m going to be not here. This is </em>\u2014 the <em>last time I spoke with Mr. Kates zeas on Fziday, I think, and some of this has developed since that time. So, this is nezo to Mr. Kates.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">THE COURT: <em>Fair enough. What we\u2019re going to do is, we </em>are <em>going to proceed with, the tzial. I certainly tzmst Mr. Klavens\u2019 representation, </em>and Ms. Stanfield hasn\u2019t indicated in any way or \u2014 Mr. Kates, let me explain to you how this is going to work. I want to give you \u2014 I\u2019m going to give you every opportunity to consult with your attorneys throughout the trial. It\u2019s just important that because when we\u2019re on the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">THE COURT:____[A]s I was saying, I\u2019m comfortable that Ms. Stanfield\u2019s ready to proceed. Mr. Klavens has indicated Ms. Stanfield has been aware of this and is ready to proceed, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">With regard to the issue as to Mr. Klavens leaving in the middle of the trial, I\u2019m going to tell the jury subject to hearing from Mr. Klavens as to any limitations that I might have, the truth, which is that Mr. Klavens has antidpate[d] he\u2019s going to receive orders to be deployed to \u2014 whatever you suggest I \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what I can say, Mr. Klavens. I\u2019m just going to tell them the truth with the limitations that you recommend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">MR. KLAVENS: I will \u2014 I can\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">THE COURT: And that it\u2019s not anticipated\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">MR. KLAVENS: \u2014 I think you can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">THE COURT: \u2014 that he\u2019s going to complete the trial but we\u2019re not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">---- [additional discussion regarding proposed instruction to jury regarding Klavens\u2019s anticipated absence]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-16\">THE COURT: Mr. Kates is standing. Mr. Klavens, do you want to or Ms. Stanfield do you want to see what Mr. Kates\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-17\">(Attorney/client discussion)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-18\">MR. KLAVENS: Mr. Kates is stating that, you know, the instruction is fine because the jury will look favorable towards the attorney, but not necessarily favorable towards him. <em>He indicates that he\u2019s working now and that if he </em>is\u2014 <em>rather than have me as his attoz-ney being removed during the middle of the trial, he\u2019s z-equesting a postponement so he can hire his owzz attorney. Is that </em>right? MR. KATES: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-19\">THE COURT: <em>That\u2019s </em>\u2014 I <em>understand that reqziest. I am denying that z-equest. We are going to proceed zcith the trial today. </em>Okay. With regards to other issues, I would indicate that that may be considered a change in circumstances if the counsel wants to discuss any type of resolution if there is a resolution, but I\u2019ll leave that to counsel during any recess that we have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-20\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-21\">After denying the continuance, the court addressed other preliminary matters and began jury selection mid-morning. The court advised the prospective jurors that the trial itself would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>proceed on July 28 and 29 and continue Tuesday through Thursday, August 10 to 12, and if necessary, deliberations would continue August 13. The record does not reflect when the court decided testimony would be heard during the week of July 27; as noted above, on July 19, the court proposed to begin testimony on August 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Before jury selection continued July 28, Ostrowski reported to the court that plea negotiations, which the court had authorized the day before, were unsuccessful. Defendant reportedly was willing to enter an open plea<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a third-degree charge, but the State was only willing to accept an open plea to the indictment, conditioned on the State not moving for an extended term.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Jury selection concluded July 28, and the jury was sworn at the start of the morning\u2019s proceedings July 29. Stanfield and Ostrowski delivered opening statements, and the State presented its ease and rested before the day\u2019s end, with Stanfield conducting all cross-examination. The court then adjourned until August 10, when defendant testified, with Stanfield conducting the direct and redirect examination. Stanfield and Ostrowski delivered summations, and deliberations began the same day. According to the record, Klavens was present in court, but his on-the-record participation was limited to sidebar conferences. The record does not reflect the extent to which he consulted with or guided Stanfield. Deliberations continued August 11 and the jury reported its verdict early on August 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Defendant raises the following points on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">DEFENDANT WAS DENIED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO COUNSEL OF CHOICE WHEN THE JUDGE ARBITRARILY REFUSED HIS REQUEST FOR A CONTINUANCE TO RETAIN PRIVATE COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahi\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE IN ALLOWING JURORS TO LEARN ABOUT KATES\u2019S DRUG USE DURING VOIR DIRE. (Not raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">DUE TO THE JUDGE\u2019S IMPROPER DOUBLE-COUNTING AND ERRONEOUS FINDING THAT THE OFFENSE WAS \u201cPARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS,\u201d DEFENDANT WAS SENTENCED TO A MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE EXTENDED TERM OF 15 YEARS AS A PERSISTENT OFFENDER, RATHER THAN A SENTENCE AT OR BELOW THE MID-POINT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Several legal principles inform our decision that the court denied defendant his constitutional right to the counsel of his choice, which is a structural error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">A defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence[,]\u201d U.S. Const., amend. VI, entitles \u201ca defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>140, 144, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2557, 2561, 165 L.Ed.2d 409, 417 (2006). <em>See also Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 <em>U.S. </em>45, 53, 53 <em>S.Ct. </em>55, 58, 77 <em>L.Ed. </em>158, 162 (1932) (\u201cthe right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afford a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his choice\u201d). In other words, the Sixth Amendment \u201ccommands ... that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at 146, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2562, 165 L.Ed.2d at 418. <em>See also Jacobson v. Jacobson, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 67, 376 A.2d 558 (App.Div.1977) (construing New Jersey Constitutional right to counsel, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, U10, to encompass \u201cright of an accused to secure counsel of his own choice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">However, an indigent defendant who is represented by appointed counsel does not enjoy a right to choose counsel. <em>State v. Williams, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 170, 960 A.2d 805 (App.Div.2008), <em>certif. denied, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>440, 991 A.2d 229 (2010). The Office of the Public Defender retains the flexibility to substitute one attorney from its office for another. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 75, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>979 A.2d 792 (App.Div.2009), <em>certif. denied, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>155, 988 A.2d 1177 (2010). <em>See also Morris v.

Deprivation of the right is \u201ccomplete\u201d when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants, regardless of the quality of the representation he received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8H\"><em>[Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at 148, 126 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2563, 165 L.Ed.2d at 419.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\"><em>See also United States v.

In that respect, deprivation of counsel of choice is on a par with deprivation of the right to counsel, <em>Id. </em>at 148-49, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2564, 165 L.Ed.2d at 419-20 (citing <em>Gideon v.

A defendant\u2019s right to choose counsel is also circumscribed by the court\u2019s power to guard against conflicts of interest, and to vindicate the court\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Wheat v.

When assessing a continuance request to retain counsel, \u201cthe trial court must strike a balance between its inherent and necessary right to control its own calendar and the public\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of justice, on the one hand, and the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to obtain counsel of his own choice, on the other.\u201d <em>State v.

As our Court recognized .in connection with the denial of the closely related right to self-representation, \u201c[defendant may have been represented by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>skilled attorney ... that matters not\u201d. <em>King, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 22, 40 A.3d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Likewise, the factor pertaining to \u201cprejudice to defendant\u2019s case\u201d must be squared with the <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>holding that \u201cit is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at 148, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2563, 165 L.Ed.2d at 419. The Court of Appeals in <em>Burton, supra, </em>explained, \u201cA showing of prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case is not a prerequisite to the granting of a continuance.\u201d 584 <em>F.2d </em>at 491 n. 19. Rather, it is pertinent to consider possible prejudice because a finding of prejudice \u201cwould lend weight toward granting the requested continuance.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Thus, a constitutional deprivation occurs only when the court mistakenly exercises its discretion and erroneously or arbitrarily denies a continuance to retain chosen counsel. \u201c[0]nly an unreasoning and arbitrary \u2018insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\u2019 violates the right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Slappy, supra, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 11-12, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1616, 75 L.Ed.2d at 620 (quoting <em>Ungar, supra, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>at 589, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 849, 11 L.Ed.2d at 931). <em>See also Hayes, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 16 A.3d 1028 (requiring \u201cmisuse of judicial discretion\u201d to overturn denial of continuance to retain counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Our Court has recognized that abuse of discretion \u201cdefies precise definition.\u201d <em>Flagg v.

Hayes was forced to prosecute a motion to withdraw his guilty plea without representation, because his prior attorneys had conflicts and the trial court denied a continuance to permit him to retain new counsel. The Court held \u201cthe denial of defendant\u2019s request for an adjournment was unreasonable and prejudicial to defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 16 A.3d 1028. However, the Court used the phrase \u201cprejudicial to defendant\u2019s rights\u201d to refer to denial of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, as opposed to any resulting harm in the proceeding itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Although the State in <em>Hayes </em>argued that any error in denying the adjournment was harmless because the defendant\u2019s withdrawal motion was meritless, the Court held the record was inadequate to determine if the absence of counsel caused harm in the proceeding itself. 205 <em>N.J. </em>at 540-41, 16 A.3d 1028. Thus, proof of harmful error was not a prerequisite to relief in <em>Hayes. </em>That is consistent with the Court\u2019s prior holding that complete deprivation of counsel is a structural error that cannot be harmless. <em>Purnell, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 60-61, 735 A.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In other jurisdictions, where a trial court has summarily denied a request for an adjournment to retain counsel, without a reasoned analysis of the relevant factors, the denial has been deemed arbitrary, warranting correction. For example, in affirming the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, the Third Circuit held that a New Jersey defendant was denied his constitutional right to counsel of his choice when the court summarily denied a continuance. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>868 F.2d at 611. Although the defendant proposed to retain out-of-state attorneys, the issue was not the pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>hac vice rule then in effect, but the impact of the attorneys\u2019 involvement on the administration of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 607, n. 3. The Third Circuit held, \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s wooden approach and its failure to make record-supported findings balancing the right to counsel with the demands of the administration of justice resulted in an arbitrary denial of Fuller\u2019s motion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. In a subsequent ease, the Third Circuit explained that the nature of the inquiry and findings may vary according to the circumstances; nonetheless, a trial court may not arbitrarily rely on generalizations, speculation, or determinations lacking a basis in fact or reason. <em>Voigt, supra, </em>89 F.3d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d 998 (9th Cir.2001), the Court of Appeals reversed a conviction because the trial court arbitrarily denied the defendant a continuance on the first day of trial. The defendant sought the continuance to enable him to retain an identified private attorney to substitute for an assigned federal public defender. The defendant complained his assigned attorney was not well-prepared, and had not adequately consulted with him about the ease. The private attorney reported to the court that the defendant\u2019s family was prepared to retain him, but that he could not take the case if it proceeded as scheduled. The judge did not consider the length of delay that would have been necessary, and flatly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance without stating reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The appeals court acknowledged that trial judges \u201chave broad latitude to deny a motion for substitution of counsel on the eve of trial when the request would require a continuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003. However, a court \u201cshould summarize in the record its reasons for the denial.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted). It is not enough to repeat simply \u201cyour request is denied.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the court\u2019s confidence in the assigned counsel\u2019s competence was no substitute for the exercise of defendant\u2019s rights. \u201cThe issue in this case is the attorney-client relationship and not the comfort of the court or the competency of the attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Other jurisdictions have likewise found denial of the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice where the trial court did not engage in a reasoned analysis of the facts. <em>See, e.g., Panzardi Alvarez, supra, </em>816 F.2d at 817 (\u201crote application\u201d of rule denying appearance of chosen out-of-state attorney was an abuse of discretion denying constitutional right to attorney of choice); <em>Smith, supra, </em>618 F.3d at 666 (trial court\u2019s denial of continuance erroneous where no trial had been set before request); <em>State v. Goldsberry, </em>419 <em>Md. </em>100, 18 A.3d 836, 850 (2011) (stating that court must make \u201cevidence based findings\u201d and \u201crecord must reflect that the trial court contemplated relevant factors\u201d in balancing right to one\u2019s counsel of choice against, in that case, interest in enforcing conflict rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">By contrast, where the trial court has engaged in a reasoned balancing of factors \u2014 including a defendant\u2019s lack of diligence, the failure to assert the financial capacity to retain private counsel, and a demonstrated inconvenience to the court or witnesses \u2014 we have affirmed the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in denying a continuance. In <em>Fwrguson, supra, </em>we affirmed a trial court\u2019s denial of a day-of-trial request for a continuance to allow private counsel, retained eleven days earlier, to substitute for a public defender. 198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 405-06, 487 A.2d 730. The trial court recited that witnesses were present in court; private counsel did not notify the court of his need for a continuance until the day of trial; and the court would have had no other eases to try. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Likewise, in <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 260, 708 A.2d 716 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>381, 718 A.2d 1210 (1998), we found no abuse of discretion where a trial court denied an eve-of-trial request for a continuance to seek private counsel. The defendant failed to justify his delay, private counsel was not yet retained, and the defendant\u2019s professed capacity to hire private counsel was questionable and at odds with his prior claim of indigency. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[A] defendant must act with reasonable diligence when exercising the right to choose his or her own counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 708 A.2d 716. Moreover, the purported conflict with his appointed counsel that prompted the defendant\u2019s desire for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>private counsel \u2014 the fact that his \u201cdefense counsel was being paid by the State and the State was also prosecuting him\u201d \u2014 was one obvious from the start of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 708 A.2d 716. <em>See also Stale v. McCombs, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 165, 408 A.2d 434 (App.Div.1978) (no abuse of discretion denying continuance on eve of trial to hire private counsel to replace assigned counsel where the defendant did not act \u201cwith reasonable diligence\u201d and there was no representation regarding financial capacity) <em>aff'd o.b., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>373, 408 A.2d 425 (1979); <em>State v. Reddy, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 35, 347 A.2d 545 (App.Div.1975) (\u201creasons on the record fully justify the exercise of ... discretion in denying the application for adjournment\u201d where request made without diligence or representation of financial capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Applying these principles, we conclude the trial court did not adequately elicit facts and apply the relevant factors to reasonably balance defendant\u2019s desire to retain counsel of his choice against the court\u2019s need to proceed with the scheduled trial. The court\u2019s only expressed basis for denying the requested continuance was its satisfaction, based solely on Klavens\u2019s assurance, that Stanfield was prepared to try the case in Klavens\u2019s absence. As we have observed, the availability of competent counsel may not replace the right to choose one\u2019s own counsel. Gonzalez<em>-Lopez, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at 148, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2563, 165 L.Ed.2d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Defendant undisputedly was surprised by the news on the first day of jury selection that his long-standing assigned counsel expected to be deployed and would no longer be his lead counsel. While defendant certainly had no right to dictate the assignment of another assistant deputy public defender, he retained the constitutional right, albeit not absolute, to hire private counsel of his choice. His eve-of-trial decision to exercise that right could hardly be attributed to a lack of diligence of the sort present in <em>McLaughlin, Furguson, McCombs, </em>and <em>Reddy. </em>The judge recognized the deployment orders were a changed circumstance. Moreover, defendant was requesting flexibility in a trial schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>that had been set only one week earlier and had already been adjusted to accommodate the needs of the State and Stanfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Under the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the court to inquire of defendant himself, to determine the length of the requested delay, <em>Hayes, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 16 A.3d 1028 (factors include \u201clength of the requested delay\u201d); and to assess whether defendant\u2019s request was made in good faith, <em>ibid, </em>(factors include \u201cwhether the requested delay is .. dilatory, purposeful, or contrived\u201d). The court also did not inquire regarding defendant\u2019s financial capacity to retain private counsel. With the benefit of hindsight, we note defendant testified at trial that he was employed as a union construction worker. Moreover, he or friends or family were able to post bond of $50,000, according to the record. That also distinguishes defendant\u2019s case from <em>McLaughlin, McCombs, </em>and <em>Reddy, </em>in which financial capacity was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The court should also have given defendant an opportunity, in camera if necessary, to amply explain his concerns, to which Klavens alluded, that Stanfield was new to the case and may not have been as prepared as Klavens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant was not obliged to demonstrate prejudice from denial of counsel of his choice, as we have explained at length. But, a showing that defendant would be prejudiced by the change in counsel would have added \u201cweight\u201d to his request. <em>Burton, supra, </em>584 <em>F.</em>2d at 491 n. 19. The court did not expressly consider Stanfield\u2019s originally intended role before Klavens received his orders. <em>See Hayes, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 16 A.3d 1028 (factors include \u201cwhether the other counsel was retained as lead or associate counsel\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The court also made no findings regarding the imperatives of its calendar. We do not know whether other cases were available for the court to try, nor the impact of a continuance on the State and its witnesses, as the court did not inquire whether the State objected to the continuance. Perhaps, it would have been feasible for the court and the State to delay jury selection until August 10, and continue the trial thereafter, giving defendant two weeks to retain private counsel. Although two weeks is a short period, the case was not complex. Even if defendant wanted more time, the court conceivably may have granted a continuance for less. <em>See Burton, supra, </em>584 <em>F.</em>2d at 491, n. 13 (\u201cA motion for a continuance may not properly be denied on the [sjole ground that the time sought is longer than necessary ... since unjustifiably long requests for continuances, if otherwise reasonable, can simply be granted for a shorter period of time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Finally, we do not mean to imply that a defendant\u2019s continuance request need necessarily trigger an extensive or time-consuming factual inquiry to elicit information essential to an appropriate exercise of discretion. We do not envision that the inquiries required in this case would have been lengthy or burdensome. Moreover, we can imagine facts that conceivably would have justified the discretionary denial of defendant\u2019s continuance request here, based on the factors we identified in <em>Furguson </em>and our Supreme Court endorsed in <em>Hayes. </em>However, it is not for us to speculate. It was incumbent upon the trial court to develop that record, and to apply those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">As the trial court\u2019s error is not subject to a harmless error analysis, <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, </em>defendant is entitled to a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>trial. Finally, in light of our decision, we do not reach defendant\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-10\"> The State agreed before trial that defendant's 1973 robbery conviction and 1993 sexual assault conviction were too remote to be used for impeachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\"> The court acknowledged that Klavens had informed the court of his anticipated deployment during a brief conference the day before.
