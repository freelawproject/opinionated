December 31st, 1909, Mr. Judson went south, and at his request the proposed conference with Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Harriman was postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Mr. Judson returned January 10th, 1910, and arranged for an interview to be had with Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Harriman February 4th, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">January 31st, 1910, the defendants\u2019 attorney wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys that unless the latter began the printing of the record immediately, the plaintiff would move for the dismissal of the appeals at the March term of this court at Hartford,</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>February 4th, 1910, the previously arranged conference of the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendants was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">February 5th, 1910, Mr. Stoddard wrote to Mr. Judson that he and Mr. Harriman were satisfied that it was impossible to present the appeal without printing all the certified proceedings, and that they again insisted that the printing of the record be proceeded with at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">February 11th, 1910, the defendants filed their motions to dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">February 18th, 1910, the plaintiff authorized the printing of the entire evidence, and on that day his attorney directed the clerk to proceed with the printing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">February 24th, 1910, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys filed in this court a motion to be allowed to file the following additional reason of appeal: \u201cThe appellant further claims that the finding should be corrected in accordance with exceptions 1 and to 67, each respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The entire record as allowed by the trial judge cannot be printed in time for the next (April) term of this court. It is doubtful if it can be for the following June term.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The defendants claim that these facts show that the appellant is responsible for the failure to have the records in these cases printed, and that they justify their claim that the appeals should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Had the plaintiff desired to have this court review the questions of law raised by the finding as made by the trial court and filed July 29th, 1909, he could undoubtedly have had the record printed for the October term, 1909, of this court, to which his appeals were originally taken. Clearly the preparation of the record has been so delayed that the case cannot be ready for trial before the June term, 1910, because of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>tiff\u2019s attempt to have his sixty-seven exceptions to the finding considered by this court, without incurring the expense of printing the entire evidence. The question is, ought we, under the circumstances, to justify this delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Prior to October 6th, 1909, there was a question between the parties whether the whole or only a part of the evidence should be printed. The plaintiff, by his exhibits attached to his exceptions as required by \u00a7 795 of the General Statutes, had asked that a part only of the evidence be printed. The defendants, by virtue of the right accorded them by \u00a7 795, requested the trial judge to certify all the evidence, and this request, as the statute required it should be, was granted by the court, and all the evidence was certified and allowed and made a part of the record. By this decision, rendered October 6th, 1909, which the statute does not empower us to review, the defendants, as the plaintiff well knew, became entitled to have the entire evidence printed, so long as the plaintiff insisted in pursuing his motions for a correction of the finding. It thereupon became the duty of the plaintiff, if he still insisted in pursuing his motion to correct the finding, to proceed with the printing of the entire evidence, unless he procured the consent of the defendants to omit the printing of some part of it, or, if he wished to abandon his motion to correct, then to proceed with the printing of the record, taking the finding as made by the trial judge. Instead of pursuing either course, he directed the clerk not to print the record, and no part of the record has been printed. After October 16th no attempt appears to have been made by the plaintiff to obtain a conference with the defendants looldng to the omission of parts of the evidence, until December 13th, when an interview was requested for that purpose by a letter containing the statement that the plaintiff would, or had, reduced his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>exceptions to the finding \u201cto one or two in number.\u201d It does not appear that any reduction of the number of the exceptions to the finding was in fact ever made. Although the defendants in answering said letter the next day (December 14th) expressed their willingness to meet the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys at any time that would suit their convenience, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys do not appear to have been ready for such a conference until February 4th, 1910. The excuse given for this delay is that Mr. Judson, one of the two attorneys for the plaintiff, the plaintiff himself also being a practicing attorney, was out of the State from December 31st until the 10th of January. The next day after the interview of February 4th, counsel for the defendants wrote the attorneys for the plaintiff that defendants\u2019 attorneys were satisfied that it was impossible to present the case on the appeal without printing all the evidence. Then, after counsel for defendants had twice insisted in writing that the printing of the record be immediately proceeded with, there followed a delay of two weeks before the plaintiff himself decided to incur the expense of printing all the evidence, and obtained the consent of the referee in bankruptcy, whose office is in New Haven. The clerk was finally directed to proceed with the printing February 18th, 1910, a week after the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the appeals had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The plaintiff has had his day in court. The right to an appeal is not a constitutional one, nor one based upon principles of natural justice. It is but a statutory privilege which an aggrieved party has the right to avail himself of only when he has strictly complied with the provisions of the statutes and rules upon which the privilege is granted. <em>Etchells </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>76 Conn. 534, 541, 57 Atl. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Upon the facts before us the appellants have failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>prosecute their appeals with due diligence. They are responsible for directing the record, as allowed by the trial court, not to be printed, and for failing to order it to be printed until February 18'th, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The motions of the appellees are granted, and the appeals are dismissed with costs, and the judgments of the Superior Court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
