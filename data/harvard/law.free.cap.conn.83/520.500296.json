J., Prentice, Thayer, Roraback and Wheeler, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-8\">The defendant filled out a blank order for an automobile of a special style and finish, at a price of 354,045, to be shipped at a future date, and delivered the order and his check for 35500, as part payment in advance, to the plaintiff, who received and accepted them. As the check was written on a form used by a bank in another State and contained some erasures and interlineations, it was agreed that the defendant might, upon his return home, substitute for it a regularly numbered check taken from his own book. Instead of doing this the defendant requested the plaintiff to cancel his order and return his check, and shortly thereafter refused to pay it upon presentation. In a suit upon the check to recover its amount, it was held:\u2014 '</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-9\">1. That there had been a sufficient delivery of the check to entitle the plaintiff to sue upon it; the proposed substitution being a trivial matter which was evidently not intended to change in any essential respect the rights of the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-11\">2. That the attempted revocation or withdrawal of the order by the defendant after its acceptance by the plaintiff, was ineffectual to reheve the former from liability on his check.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-13\">3. That it was apparent from the language of the order that it was not to be signed by the plaintiff; nor was it essential to its acceptance that the plaintiff\u2019s agent should have countersigned it at the time it was given, nor that he should have countersigned at all the duplicate of the order given to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-15\">4. That the undertaking of the plaintiff to furnish the automobile pursuant to the terms of the order, as found by the trial court, was a sufficient consideration for the check.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-17\">5. That the nontender of the car at the time originally agreed upon for delivery was not only not pleaded as a defense, but was due to the defendant\u2019s own fault.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-19\">6.

Paragraph 3 alleges the payment of protest fees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">The answer states four defenses. The first denies paragraph 1 of the complaint, and alleges want of knowledge as to the remaining paragraphs. The second alleges that the paper sued upon was delivered upon an express agreement that it should not be used as a check, but should be held by plaintiff\u2019s agent until the defendant had opportunity to mail a numbered check frorfi his personal check book; and that before the defendant had such opportunity said agent improperly attempted to use said paper as a check. The third defense avers that said numbered check was to be given as part payment for an automobile, \u201cwhich the defendant wished to order, or was considering ordering,\u201d and that before said numbered check was to be delivered, \u201cand before the defendant had consummated said order, or the plaintiff accepted the same, the defendant notified said agent, and the plaintiff, that he had changed and revoked his wish to order the automobile,\u201d and requested the return of said paper, and that the plaintiff failed to return it, and improperly attempted to use it as a check.

It was agreed that Webber should hold said check without depositing the same, so as to give the defendant an opportunity upon his return to Hartford to substitute a check to be drawn on a blank taken from his regular checkbook and duly numbered, and to be sent to Webber as a substitute for the check then given. Defendant went on a short business trip, reaching Hartford on the evening of March 12th, 1909. The written instrument called \u201cOrder\u201d was drawn in duplicate, both signed by the defendant; and one copy was retained by the defendant and the other given to Webber for the plaintiff; neither was signed by plaintiff or Webber until afterward, when Webber countersigned the copy given to him, \u201cW. A. Webber, Salesman\u201d; but such countersigning was without the knowledge of defendant. Webber informed the defendant that an order on plaintiff for an automobile would not be accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>unless a check for $500 was given with such order, and thereupon defendant gave to Webber, for the plaintiff, the check and order above described, subject to the agreement above stated, and Webber received the same for and on behalf of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff did not otherwise accept said order except as hereinafter stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">On the afternoon of March 13th, 1909, defendant, in Hartford, wrote and mailed to plaintiff, in Boston, a letter, the material part of which follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">\u201cHartford, Conn., March 13, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">The American Automobile Company, 16 Columbus Avenue, Boston, Mass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-11\">Gentlemen:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-12\">Referring to instructions I gave you last Thursday to order an 'American Roadster\u2019 for me for delivery the latter part of April, I beg to say upon reaching home I find some matters that came to a head which I did not anticipate, which will make it impossible for me to use this car until the latter part if at all this season; therefore, I wish you would cancel the instructions I gave you and return my cheque for $500, which I left with you. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-13\">Yours very respectfully,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVk\">Thomas C.

Soon after said check was returned to the plaintiff, it forwarded the check to Hartford for collection, and payment was demanded of defendant and was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">The plaintiff was not a manufacturer of automobiles, but a sales agent, as both parties understood; and both understood that plaintiff was to procure said automobile to be finished, equipped, and shipped in and from Indianapolis by a manufacturer there located. After the receipt of the letter, the plaintiff took no further steps to build, equip, or deliver said automobile, and plaintiff has never shipped, or caused to be shipped, to the defendant said automobile, or any automobile, or tendered to the defendant said automobile or any automobile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\">At the time said order and check were signed and delivered by the defendant, it was defendant\u2019s intention thereby to order the automobile specified therein, and to make a deposit of $500 to apply on the purchase, price, subject only to his right to send a substitute check as aforesaid; and it was the intention of the plaintiff, acting by its agent Webber, to furnish the said automobile in accordance with the order of defendant, and to allow the defendant the privilege of sending a substitute check, and in case such substitute should not be sent, to use the check delivered, and both parties then so understood the matter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-8\"><em>Joseph P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6d\">In rendering judgment for the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>fendant upon the facts found, we think the trial court overlooked the real character of the action and of the issues framed by the pleadings. This is not an action to recover damages for a breach of contract to purchase an automobile, nor for a refusal to accept one which had been ordered; nor is it an action to recover a part of the agreed purchase price of the automobile ordered by the defendant. The pleadings show that it is an action upon a negotiable instrument, by the payee against the maker, and that the question of the latter\u2019s liability is to be determined by the rules of law applicable to such instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The four, and only, defenses pleaded to such action, deny in effect that the defendant made such a delivery of the check as to enable the plaintiff to maintain an action upon it; they deny that the plaintiff is the owner of the check; and allege that the substitute check which was to be given was to be in part payment of the purchase price of 'an automobile which the defendant intended to order, but which intended order was revoked or countermanded before it was accepted; and allege that the paper delivered to the plaintiff was without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In his memorandum of decision the trial judge says that the plaintiff has failed to sustain the allegations of the complaint according to their full legal import, and the judgment-file states that the court finds the issues for the defendant. As we read the facts found, they not only sustain the allegations of the complaint, but fail to support any of the defenses pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">First, the facts found show such a delivery of the check as entitles the plaintiff to sue upon it. The proposed substitution of a numbered check for the one given, was a trivial matter which was evidently not intended to change in any essential respect either the check given, or the rights of the parties under it. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the most it only gave the defendant the privilege of postponing payment of the $500 for such reasonable time as would enable him to send a numbered check. He has never attempted to avail himself of this privilege, although he has had ample time to do so. The court has found that the parties intended that the check delivered could be collected if a substitute check should not be sent. It is apparent that the defendant could have sent the substitute check had he wished to, as early as March 13th, when he wrote the plaintiff. The original check was not presented for payment until March 15th, and payment was not attempted to be enforced by suit until April 1st. As a matter of fact the defendant decided as early as March 13th not to send the substitute check, but to attempt to revoke the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Second, the facts show no such revocation or withdrawal of the order before it was accepted as is alleged in the answer, or as relieves the defendant from liability on the check. The writing describing the automobile was an order which, from its language, was not to be signed by the plaintiff. It does not appear that the salesman who took the order was required to countersign it at the time it was given, or that he was at any time to countersign the duplicate given the purchaser. The countersigning of such an instrument by the salesman is usually for the purpose of authentication or attestation, for the benefit of the one receiving the order. This order was properly countersigned by Webber after he received it, and without the defendant\u2019s knowledge. That the order was accepted so that it became binding upon both parties, is shown by the fact that it was delivered and received, and that the check was given and received as an advance part payment, and deposited in the bank by the plaintiff, and is further shown by the finding that, by the signing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>delivery of the check and order, the defendant intended to order the automobile, and to deposit $500 to apply on the purchase price,- and the plaintiff intended to furnish the automobile in accordance with the terms of the defendant\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The undertaking of the plaintiff as found by the court, to furnish the automobile in accordance with the terms of the order, was a sufficient consideration for the check, and further, the check is itself prima facie proof that it was issued for a valuable consideration. General Statutes, \u00a7 4194.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">But it appears from the memorandum of the judge that the real ground of the decision of the trial court was that there was in effect a mutual rescission of the contract of sale by the parties, because the defendant by his letter of March 13th refused to carry out the contract, and the plaintiff failed to deliver or tender the automobile on the 25th of April. The court says in the memorandum: \u201cIt being admitted, or at least not disputed, that no delivery of the car was ever made, it follows that at the date of the suit the plaintiff had only a qualified title to the money, contingent upon delivery; and, further, that delivery has now become impossible by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s neglect or refusal to deliver or tender the car. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">But there was no such issue in the case, as no such defense was pleaded. The third defense is that the defendant, <em>before he had </em>\u201cconsummated\u201d <em>his order </em>and <em>before the plaintiff had accepted it, </em>revoked or countermanded his \u201cwish to order.\u201d There is no suggestion in the answer that the plaintiff neglected or refused to deliver, in accordance with the terms of the written agreement, the automobile, as a part payment for which the check was given, or that it had become impossible for the plaintiff to deliver it, or that the plaintiff had in any maimer treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>contract, as a part of which the check was given, as rescinded. And further, the facts found fail to show that the plaintiff has treated the contract as rescinded. It was the defendant\u2019s and not the plaintiff\u2019s fault, that the automobile was not delivered on the 25th of April. The agreement did not contemplate a tender of the car before the payment of the check. The plaintiff was to receive the $500 more than forty days before he was required to tender the car. On the 13th of March the defendant stopped payment of the check and wrote the plaintiff, in effect, that he would not take the car if tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">While it is found that under these circumstances the car was not tendered on the 25th of April, it does not appear that the plaintiff cannot or will not deliver the automobile within a reasonable time after the check is paid, and upon payment of the balance of the purchase price. This is all that he is required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">There is no intimation in <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>78 Conn. 459, 62 Atl. 760, cited by the defendant, that a party who has advanced money in part payment of a contract, may alone rescind it and recover back the advance payment, while the other party is without fault and is ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement. The decision in that case is based upon the fact that the defendant had denied the right of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate to receive the property which was the subject of the contract of sale, and had disabled himself from performing his part of the contract by transferring the property to others, and had so treated the contract of sale as to in effect rescind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The fact in the present case, that the plaintiff made, under the circumstances, no tender of the automobile on the 25th of April, did not in law work a rescission of the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">There is error and the judgment is reversed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>case remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
