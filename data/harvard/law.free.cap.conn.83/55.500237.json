Upon a prosecution for keeping \u201ca house which was and was reputed to be a house of ill-fame,\u201d it was held:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-11\">1. That evidence that the house was reputed to be one of ill-fame was admissible as tending to prove that it was in fact a house of that character.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-13\">2. That the adoption of such a rule of evidence did not render the statute unconstitutional, nor invalidate a trial resulting in the conviction of the accused.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b67-15\">Argued January 19th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsX\">decided February 3d, 1910.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-16\">Information for keeping a house of ill-fame, brought to the Criminal Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County and tried to the jury before <em>Simpson, J., </em>after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>a demurrer to the information had been overruled; verdict and judgment of guilty, and appeal by the accused.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ac3\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-6\"><em>Ernest L.

In so far as the statute under consideration permits a conviction for the offense of keeping a house which is in fact a house of prostitution, which, as we have said, is the only offense with which this accused is charged, it is not unconstitutional. Whether it contravenes the State or Federal constitutions, or both, in permitting a conviction for an offense which we have held is not the offense charged in this information, and of which this accused could not therefore have been convicted in the court below, namely, the keeping of a house merely reputed to be a house of prostitution, we have no occasion at present to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">But the accused claims that the statute violates the provisions of both the State and Federal constitution because it permits a conviction of the offense of keeping a house which is in fact a house of prostitution, upon proof that it is reputed to be such a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">It is true that we have held, as was said in our former decision: \u201cUpon such proof of reputation, in the absence of any other evidence of the true character of the place, the jury may convict the accused of keeping a house or place which is in fact of the character that it is reputed to be. When such evidence of reputation is offered it must, either by itself or in connection with other evidence, be sufficient to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the reputed character of the; house or place in question was its true character. When evidence of the reputed character of the place is offered, it may always be met by evidence that such is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>real character of the place, and however complete may be the proof of reputation, there can be no conviction if it appears that the house or place is not in fact kept or used for the reputed immoral or unlawful purposes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>82 Conn. 111, 114, 72 Atl. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The adoption of such a rule of evidence in this State does not render the statute upon which the information is based, nor the method or proceedings by which the accused was convicted, unconstitutional as claimed. It is, however, unnecessary to pursue the discussion of that subject in this case, since it does not appear that that rule was invoked upon the second trial. We have no finding before us showing what evidence was offered, or what rulings were made, or what instructions were given to the jury. It is entirely consistent with the record before us, that no evidence whatever of reputation was offered by the State. If no such evidence was offered, the court had no occasion to charge the jury that the State could establish a prima facie case by proof of reputation only, and presumably did not. For aught that appears from the record, the accused was properly convicted upon direct evidence only\u2014without the introduction of any evidence of reputation\u2014 that she kept a house which was in fact a house of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
