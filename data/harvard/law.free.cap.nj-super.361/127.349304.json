Catalano. Defendant filed a counterclaim seeking damages for alleged deficiencies in the work plaintiff performed and for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The case was arbitrated in accordance with <em>Rule </em>4:21A-l(a)(3), resulting in an award in plaintiffs favor for $22,564.50 rendered on January 7, 2002. Defendant subsequently authorized its counsel to file a demand for a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Defendant\u2019s counsel prepared the demand and instructed his secretary to file it with the court and serve plaintiff. The secretary sent the demand to the clerk by overnight mail on the afternoon of February 4, 2002, and the demand was filed on February 6, 2002, within the thirty-day period allowed under <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). The secretary intended to serve the demand upon opposing counsel the next morning by fax and regular mail. However, she fell that evening, suffering a broken wrist which required surgery and kept her out of work for more than a month. As a result, the secretary failed to send the demand to plaintiffs counsel. She also failed to inform the attorney who had instructed her to serve the demand that she had not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">On February 19, 2002, defendant\u2019s counsel received a trial notice from the court setting an April 8, 2002 trial date. The next day, defendant\u2019s counsel received a motion by plaintiff for confirmation of the arbitration award. He became aware in a subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>quent telephone conversation with plaintiffs counsel that the trial de novo demand had not been served. Consequently, on February 21, 2002, defendant\u2019s counsel served a copy of the demand upon plaintiffs counsel. However, plaintiffs counsel refused to withdraw his motion for confirmation of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The trial court concluded in an oral opinion that it was compelled by existing case law to grant plaintiffs motion for confirmation of the arbitration award. Although expressing a \u201cpersonal\u201d opinion that \u201cthis case screams out for relief and relaxation of this Draconian rule\u201d based on the secretary\u2019s \u201cunfortunate accident,\u201d the court felt it lacked authority to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Bule </em>4:21A-6 (b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">An order shall be entered dismissing the action following the filing of the arbitrator\u2019s award unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">(1) within 30 days after filing of the arbitration award, a party thereto files with the civil division manager and serves on all other parties a notice of rejection of the award and demand for a trial de novo and pays a trial de novo fee as set forth in paragraph (c) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\"><em>Rules </em>4:21A-1 to -8 were originally adopted in 1986 to implement the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-24 to -35 which mandate arbitration of certain automobile negligence cases. The rules were comprehensively amended in 1989 to apply also to the arbitration of personal injury cases where the amount in controversy is -$20,000 or less, in which arbitration is mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-20 to -30. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:21A (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) implements <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-31 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-26, which provide that unless one of the parties to the arbitration demands a trial de novo \u201cwithin 30 days of the filing of the arbitration decision,\u201d the trial court shall confirm the award upon motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In <em>Hartsfield v. Fantini, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>611, 695 A.2d 259 (1997) and <em>Wallace v. JFK Hartwyck at Oak Tree, Inc., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>605, 695 A.2d 257 (1997), the Court held that the thirty-day period for filing a demand for a trial de novo may be relaxed only upon a showing of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d The Court also held that \u201can attorney\u2019s failure to supervise staff or heavy workload\u201d are \u201cinsufficient to satisfy the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Hartsfield, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 695 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has been squarely confronted with the question whether this \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard also applies to a motion for relaxation of the thirty-day period for service of a trial de novo demand. Plaintiff relies upon a sentence in <em>Jones v. First Nat\u2019l Supermarkets, Inc., </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 127, 746 A.2d 1072 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>132, 754 A.2d 1209 (2000), which states: \u201cWe hold that the requirement of service should be strictly enforced as was the filing requirement in both <em>Hartsfield, supra, </em>and <em>Wallace, supra.\" </em>However, the party seeking a trial de novo in <em>Jones </em>did not offer any excuse whatsoever for failing to serve the demand in a timely manner. Consequently, the only question presented by that appeal was whether \u201cthe de novo demand must be served on all other parties within thirty days.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In answering this question, the court correctly observed that \u201c[t]he express language of <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l) provides that both filing and service of the demand must be accomplished within thirty days of entry of an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, in <em>Woods v. Shop-Rite Supermarkets, Vill. Supermarkets, Inc., </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>613, 618, 792 A.2d 558 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>38, 803 A.2d 634 (2002), the party seeking a trial de novo did not provide \u201cany explanation for the failure to serve the demand ... upon defendant.\u201d Consequently, we were not required in either <em>Jones </em>or <em>Woods </em>to determine the standard that governs a court\u2019s review of a motion for relaxation of the thirty-day period for service of a trial de novo demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Our decision in <em>Corcoran v. St. Peter\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 771 A.2d 707 (App.Div.2001), provides some guidance in determining the appropriate standard. After bringing a personal injury action, the plaintiffs in <em>Corcoran </em>filed a substitution of attorney and thereafter defendant\u2019s attorney dealt exclusively with plaintiffs new attorney of record. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 771 A.2d 707. Ten months later, an arbitration was held. Within thirty days of the award, defendant\u2019s attorney filed and served a demand for a trial de novo. However, his secretary mistakenly served the demand upon plaintiffs\u2019 original attorney. <em>Ibid. </em>As a result, plaintiffs did not receive notice of defendant\u2019s demand until after expiration of the thirty-day period allowed under <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 344, 771 A.2d 707. Although we characterized the secretary\u2019s service of the demand on the wrong attorney as a \u201cclerical mistake,\u201d we held that her action constituted substantial compliance with the service requirement. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In concluding that the requirement of service of a trial de novo demand can be satisfied by substantial compliance, we noted that the courts of this State have applied the substantial compliance doctrine in various other contexts \u201cwhere a party files a pleading or other court document in a timely manner, but fails to make service in strict accordance with the governing court rule or statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 771 A.2d 707. We also noted that unlike the requirement that the trial de novo demand be filed within thirty days, which is mandated by statute, the requirement of service is solely a matter of court rule. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 771 A.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Although the substantial compliance doctrine does not apply in this case because the secretary for defendant\u2019s attorney did not take any steps to serve the trial de novo demand, <em>Corcoran </em>shows that our courts extend some latitude in enforcement of the service requirement of <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(l) in eases where the demand has been filed within the allowed thirty-day period. It also shows that even a \u201cclerical mistake\u201d may provide a sufficient basis for a court declining to strictly enforce the service requirement if there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201creasonable explanation\u201d for the mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 771 A.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>Rule </em>l:3^4(a) confers general authority upon the trial and appellate courts to enlarge the time allowed for taking action under the court rules. Although certain time periods are not subject to such enlargement, <em>R. </em>l:3-4(c), the thirty-day period for service of a trial de novo demand under <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(l) is not one of those time periods. Therefore, <em>Rule </em>l:3^(a) provides the requisite authority for a trial court to enlarge this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\"><em>Rule </em>l:3-4(a) does not contain any explicit standard for a court granting an enlargement of time. However, unless there is an overriding policy consideration that requires a stricter standard, an application for an enlargement or extension of the time for taking action under a court rule is governed by a more liberal standard than \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d such as the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d or \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>See, e.g., R. </em>4:69-6(c) (time for filing an action in lieu of prerogative writs may be enlarged \u201cwhere it is manifest that the interest of justice so requires\u201d); <em>R. </em>4:73-6(a) (time for filing notice of appeal from award of condemnation commissioners may be extended for not more than thirty days \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d); <em>R. </em>2:4^4(a) (time for filing appeal of final judgment or final agency action may be extended for up to thirty days \u201cupon a showing of good cause and the absence of prejudice\u201d). Moreover, the general rule governing relaxation of the requirements of the court rules, <em>Rule </em>1:1-2, provides that \u201cany rule may be relaxed ... if adherence to it would result in an injustice.\u201d Thus, it is appropriate to consider the policy that underlies the time requirement of a particular court rule in determining the standard that should govern a motion under <em>Rule </em>l:3^(a) for an enlargement of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In <em>Hartsfield, </em>the Court concluded that the legislative policy of preserving judicial resources by promoting arbitration of personal injury actions required application of an \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard to an application for relaxation of the thirty-day period for filing a trial de novo demand. 149 <em>N.J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>618, 695 A.2d 259. However, there is no need for application of this same stringent standard to an application for relaxation of the time for service of the demand. We note that once a party files a timely demand, the clerk of the court will promptly schedule the case for trial and notify the parties of the trial date: for example, the clerk sent out a trial notice in this case less than two weeks after the trial de novo demand was filed. Consequently, even though <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(l) requires both filing and service of a trial de novo demand to be made within thirty days, a delay in satisfaction of the service requirement does not have the same deleterious effect upon efficient administration of the arbitration program as a failure to file the demand within time. Therefore, we conclude that the requirement that a trial de novo demand be served within thirty days may be relaxed upon a showing of good cause and the absence of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Plaintiff does not question the veracity of the affidavit submitted by the secretary to defendant\u2019s attorney, which certifies that she prepared a copy of the trial de novo demand with the intention of mailing it to plaintiffs attorney the morning after she sent it to the clerk for filing, but that she was unable to do so because she suffered a broken wrist that evening which kept her out of work for more than a month. Although defendant\u2019s attorney should have spoken with his secretary after the accident and carefully examined her desk and files to determine whether she had been working on any matters that had to be attended to before her return, the secretary\u2019s accident was an unusual circumstance which we believe provides the requisite good cause for relaxation of the service requirement of <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(l). Since defendant filed the demand for a trial de novo in a timely manner, and the clerk scheduled the case for trial in the ordinary course, the delay in service did not result in a delay of the trial. The only prejudice plaintiff claims as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to serve the demand at the same time it was sent to the court for filing is the cost of preparation of the motion to confirm the arbitration award. However, this can be adequately addressed by requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>defendant to pay the cost of preparation of plaintiffs motion. <em>See Delaware Valley Wholesale Florist, Inc. v. Addalia, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 233, 793 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Accordingly, the order confirming the arbitration award is reversed and the case remanded to the trial court to schedule a new trial date. Defendant is directed to pay the reasonable cost of preparation of the motion for confirmation of the arbitration award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> These rules were further amended in 2000 as part of the \"Best Practices\u201d rule amendments. See Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:21A (2003). The 2000 amendments to <em>Rules </em>4:21A-1 to 8 are not implicated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
