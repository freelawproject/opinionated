One ruling barred defendant from access to the educational records of the young man defendant was accused of sexually assaulting. The other ruling barred admission of expert testimony regarding her psychological condition which defendant sought to introduce in support of her defense of duress. We affirm the exclusion of the expert testimony. We find, however, that the trial judge mistakenly exercised his discretion when he failed to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the victim\u2019s school records and release of those records to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Following a jury trial, defendant, Sheryl Van Dyke, was convicted of a single count of second degree sexual assault contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(4) and two counts of third degree endangering the welfare of a child contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. The primary victim, J.M., was thirteen at the time of the offense. At sentencing, the judge merged the endangering conviction involving J.M. with the sexual assault conviction and imposed a five-year term of imprisonment. On the second endangering conviction, which involved K.M., the judge imposed a concurrent three-year prison term. The appropriate penalties and assessments were imposed. In addition, defendant must register pursuant to Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -19, submit to DNA testing, and she is subject to community supervision for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In the summer of 1999, defendant was thirty-four years old and married for fifteen years. Defendant and her husband had two children, an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter, who played frequently with thirteen year old J.M. and his twelve year old sister K.M. They were neighbors of J.M.\u2019s family. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>children spent their time swimming, watching television and playing on the computer at defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Defendant conceded that a sexual relationship developed between J.M. and her in September 1999. She testified that J.M. coerced her by threatening to punch her eight year old daughter, who wore a cardiac pacemaker at the time. Defendant testified that she feared that a punch would disrupt the pacemaker and trigger cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">J.M. testified that defendant initiated the relationship. He conceded that he physically assaulted defendant in the later stages of the relationship but contended it was a reaction to her sexually assaultive behavior. We relate both versions of the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">According to J.M., about a week after his thirteenth birthday, he was at defendant\u2019s residence in the playroom watching the movie \u201cFace Off\u2019 with defendant. Defendant came over to the sofa where J.M. was lying, laid down on top of him and started to kiss him. J.M. testified he was shocked and pushed her off him when someone came inside. J.M. went upstairs and sat at the kitchen table, and defendant also went upstairs and stared at him across the table. Nothing else happened that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">A few weeks later, during the evening of September 16, 1999, J.M. was at defendant\u2019s residence. Defendant\u2019s husband and children were asleep upstairs. In the playroom, defendant asked J.M. if he wanted a \u201cblow job\u201d and proceeded to give him one. J.M. stated this was his first sexual experience. He denied cursing at defendant or making any threats toward her at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">At the end of September, defendant asked J.M. to help her fix the headboard on her bed. Defendant\u2019s two children and J.M.\u2019s siblings were downstairs in the playroom. According to J.M., defendant pushed him onto the bed, took off her pants and had intercourse with him. Defendant made J.M. wear one of her husband\u2019s condoms. J.M. denied punching or using force with defendant at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>J.M. explained that defendant kept track of when they had sex by using color-coded dots on a calendar, with each color representing a different sexual act. J.M. claimed that he had sex with defendant four to five times a week after school. Defendant often invited his siblings to the house for sloepovers. During these sleepovers, defendant and J.M. would have sex while the other children were asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">J.M. testified that defendant joked about J.M. killing her husband and giving him half the insurance money. Defendant would also say \u201cI love you,\u201d and said she wanted to marry J.M. when her husband died and J.M. turned eighteen. J.M. described underwear that defendant wore, and described defendant\u2019s Caesarean section scar. He also viewed pornographic movies with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">J.M. testified that after his grandmother passed away in February 2000, he began to have feelings of anger because of what defendant was doing to him. At this point, J.M. began to fight defendant when she tried to have sex with him and was physically aggressive during other times. In one incident, defendant and J.M. argued over a bag of bagel chips, and he kicked defendant and pushed her onto the floor. J.M. took the channel changer and smashed it in defendant\u2019s face with such force that the batteries flew out; defendant sustained a black eye and a bloody nose. J.M. also admitted choking defendant during this altercation. J.M. testified that this sort of physical assault happened approximately once a month, and verbal confrontations occurred about twice a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">J.M. used defendant\u2019s computer frequently, and had access to defendant\u2019s America Online account. He had his own screen names on defendant\u2019s account, such as \u201cpopkornpimp69\u201d and \u201cXXXpimp69XXX.\u201d At one point, America Online closed the account because of J.M.\u2019s behavior on the internet. J.M. claimed defendant showed him how to access porn sites, and would use the porn sites to arouse him so they could have sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">J.M. testified that defendant threatened to overdose on her medication, cut her wrists with a razorblade, or take her two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>children and move in with someone she met on the internet if he told anyone about their relationship. J.M. claims that he cut off the sexual relationship on April 10, 2000 after the bagel chips incident, because defendant expressed an interest in having a lesbian relationship with his younger sister K.M., and began to do the same things with K.M., such as talking on the phone, that defendant had done to establish a relationship with him. On May 18, 2000, J.M. told his sister K.M. and another sister that he had been having an affair with defendant and that defendant might try to have sex with K.M. He then informed his parents who took him to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Defendant testified that her daughter had a pacemaker and that J.M. threatened to punch her daughter in the chest if defendant did not have sex with him. Defendant claimed that J.M. and his sisters began coming over, uninvited, to play with her children and use her computer in May 1999. She claimed J.M. was pleasant at that time, but constantly complained about his home life. In July 1999, J.M. had a bad day, and she comforted him by giving him a hug and kiss on the cheek. After this incident, J.M.\u2019s behavior began to change; he sat close to her, put his arm around her or his head on her lap. Defendant tried to discourage this behavior by telling him to move over, but he persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In August 1999, defendant claimed J.M. began to show signs of aggression towards her, such as hitting her, kicking her or spitting on her. Defendant tried to send him home after this behavior, but he would not leave. J.M. fought with defendant\u2019s son, positioned him in a choke hold, and said, \u201cI could kill him in a second.\u201d J.M. remembered \u201cclowning around\u201d with defendant\u2019s son, with his hands around his neck, but denied threatening to kill him. J.M. boasted about his violent behavior at home, bragged of holding a knife to his sister\u2019s throat, and setting fire to a field and being arrested. J.M. admitted that he told defendant about these things. According to defendant, J.M. also questioned defendant repeatedly about her sex life, and J.M. hit or threatened her when she would not answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>On September 16, 1999, defendant recalled watching TV in the playroom with J.M. Her husband was not home. Defendant claimed J.M, sat close to her on the couch and requested that she give him a blow job. When she refused, he threatened to kill defendant\u2019s daughter by punching her pacemaker. Believing J.M.\u2019s threats, she performed oral sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Defendant described a pattern of control that J.M. attempted to establish over her. She claimed he destroyed her CDs and movies. She asserted that whenever J.M. wanted sex, he threatened to kill her daughter, her son, or her if she did not comply, and he constantly hit, kicked, punched, choked, pushed and spat on her. She claimed that a few times a month he threatened to burn her house down if she did not have sex with him. If she was on the phone, he yelled at her to get off or hung up the phone. WTien defendant wore makeup, J.M. questioned her; when she wore clothes he did not like, he ripped them off her. He broke down the locked door of a bathroom she used.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Defendant claimed that if she bought her children something while shopping, J.M. became angry and violent if she did not buy something for him. She claimed J.M. rearranged her wedding rings to pretend that he was married to defendant, and that he told his family and defendant\u2019s family that defendant was afraid of him because he had control over her.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Defendant claimed J.M. threw things at her, such as food, books and pillows. Defendant testified that during one incident, J.M. became angry with her and threw all of her patio furniture off the deck, smashing it. J.M. admitted this incident. Defendant presented numerous pictures which depicted property in her house defaced or damaged by J.M. He admitted doing some of the damage. He also called defendant vile names.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Defendant recounted the bagel chips incident when J.M. smashed a channel changer in her face. She added that, in addition to hitting her with a channel changer, J.M. also took off a ball chain necklace, whipped her face with it, and choked her until she nearly fainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Defendant claimed the bagel chips incident spurred her to break off their relationship. About a week later, J.M. and her son started fighting. J.M. choked, punched and hit him. When defendant attempted to separate the boys, J.M. punched her in the mouth and nose causing profuse bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The State produced a number of emails that were written by defendant to J.M. The emails were mostly of an explicit nature, referencing the sexual exploits of defendant and J.M. Defendant claimed she did not write all of the emails and that some were written in a style that she was unfamiliar with, such as using \u201cU\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cR\u201d for \u201care.\u201d However, she admitted sending some of the emails to J.M. because he insisted that whenever she wrote an email to her children, she should send one to him as well. In one email defendant wrote \u201cplease delete this when you\u2019re finished reading it, or you\u2019ll be visiting me in jail.\u201d The State also introduced pornographic pictures and a movie clip downloaded under defendant\u2019s screen name, and a photograph depicting J.M. with his legs around defendant and grabbing her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">E.M., the mother of J.M. and K.M., testified that J.M. was a pleasant, helpful, typical twelve year old prior to August 20, 1999. After that date, J.M. became gradually more withdrawn, hid in his room, slept around the clock, lost interest in attending school, and became more angry at home. She testified that his sister, K.M., also had mood changes during the summer of 1999. She also asserted that J.M. attended a private special education academy due to poor attendance at school occasioned by a sleep disorder. Other witnesses testified about J.M.\u2019s aggressive and destructive behavior. One of defendant\u2019s brothers-in-law testified that J.M. bragged about setting a field on fire. A neighbor related a beating by J.M. of a neighborhood child. She also witnessed J.M. throw patio furniture off defendant\u2019s deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">POINT ONE. The Pretrial Exclusion of Expert and Lay Testimony Concerning the Defense of Duress Was Error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>POINT TWO. The Denial of Access to the Victims\u2019 School, Psychological, Probation, and Other Records Denied Defendant a Fair Trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Prior to trial, defendant sought the school records of J.M. She obtained only his attendance records. The court denied access to the psychological, social work and other school records because defendant had not demonstrated the requisite need for them. Following the testimony of J.M.\u2019s mother, defendant renewed her motion for access to J.M.\u2019s school records. Once again, the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">There is a strong interest in protecting the confidentiality of juvenile records. <em>State v. Allen, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>474, 479, 482, 361 A.2d 5 (1976). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-60 governs disclosure of juvenile information. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">a. Social, medical, psychological, legal and other records of the court and probation division, and records of law enforcement agencies, pertaining to juveniles charged as a delinquent or found to be part of a juvenile-family crisis, shall be strictly safeguarded from public inspection. Such records shall be made available only to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">(6) Any person ... interested in a case ... by order of the court for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-60a(6).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Access to pupil records are also governed by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:3 \u2014 6.5, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">(a) Only authorized organizations, agencies or persons as defined herein shall have access to pupil records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">* \u2756 iH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-15\">(c) Authorized organizations, agencies and persons shall include only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-16\">:\u00a1: * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-17\">(14) Organizations, agencies and individuals outside the school, other than those specified in this section, upon the presentation of a court order; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-18\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>6:3-6.5(a); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:3-6.6(c)(14).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>However, a juvenile\u2019s records should be available to third persons \u25a0with a sufficient legitimate interest or when the interests of justice require. <em>Allen, supra, 70 N.J. </em>at 483, 361 A.2d 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">This court found that relevant school records should be disclosed to a defendant upon a showing of particularized need. <em>State v. Krivacska, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 35, 775 A.2d 6 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>206, 785 A.2d 435 (2001), <em>cert. denied. </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>1012, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1594, 152 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>510 (2002). We noted, however, that the Confrontation Clause does not require the disclosure of any and all information that might be useful to a defendant. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 52-53, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 999, 94 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>40, 54 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Balancing the juvenile\u2019s right to privacy against the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation can be accomplished by an <em>in camera </em>court review of the records. <em>State v. Brown, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 588, 334 A.2d 392 (Law Div.1975). \u201cThe party seeking an <em>in camera </em>inspection must advance \u2018some factual predicate which would make it reasonably likely that the file will bear such fruit and that the quest for its contents is not merely a desperate grasping at a straw.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 398, 720 A.2d 425 (App.Div.1998) <em>(in camera </em>review permitted where defendant showed that police officer was suspended and under investigation for misconduct in conjunction with defendant\u2019s allegation that officer had tried to \u201cshake him down\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Kaszubinski, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 141, 425 A.2d 711 (Law Div.1980) (citations omitted)); <em>see also Krivacska, supra, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 35, 775 A.2d 6 (trial court properly examined school records <em>in camera </em>for issue of competency of mentally retarded witnesses accusing therapist of sexual abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">At trial, J.M.\u2019s mother testified that prior to August 20, 1999, her son \u201cwas a very pleasant, helpful, basically what I would consider typical twelve-year old at that time.\u201d According to her, his demeanor changed; \u201che gradually became withdrawn, he would hide in his room. He slept more, more and more around the clock. Lost interest in attending school. And as it got further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>into winter and spring, he became angry at home.\u201d She also testified that alter his grandmother\u2019s death in February 2000, J.M. retreated to his room and would not communicate with anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Once J.M.\u2019s mother testified about her son\u2019s demeanor, the interests of justice required an <em>in camera </em>production of the school records. With nothing more than the attendance records, defendant was left without any resources to rebut the mother\u2019s testimony about J.M.\u2019s demeanor and the change in his sleep patterns. To be sure, J.M.\u2019s attendance records provided some information with which to impeach his mother because the attendance records belied her suggestion that his attendance was normal before the 1999-2000 school year. Having found one instance in which his mother\u2019s testimony was refuted by school records, the interests of justice required an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the records. Furthermore, an <em>in camera </em>inspection of those documents would not have seriously undermined the confidentiality policy. If the trial judge discovered no information to impeach the credibility of J.M.\u2019s mother, the records would have not been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We ordered production of the school records for an <em>in camera </em>inspection by this court. Our examination of the records reveals that J.M. had not only a history of poor attendance since the 1993-94 school year but also that his mother reported concerns about J.M.\u2019s emotional well-being to school authorities as early as September 1997. For example, she advised the school social worker that J.M. refused to get up in the morning to attend school and that he fought or threatened family members to avoid getting up and going to school. His mother also described a turbulent relationship with his parents, including threats to harm his father, depending on J.M.\u2019s mood. She also attributed J.M.\u2019s sleep disorder to the death of an older cousin in June 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">J.M. was placed in an out-of-district school for the 1998-99 school year. His attendance improved and there were no reports of disruptive behavior &lt;at school. His parents reported to school authorities, however, that he displayed his anger at home which was particularly directed to an older brother and his father. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>During the 1999-2000 school term, his attendance began to deteriorate. His disposition was described as depressed. He ascribed his difficulties to problems with an older brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Although the school reports of the 1999-2000 term support the State\u2019s case and may corroborate J.M.\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony to some extent, the balance of the records raise serious questions about the mother\u2019s credibility. The school records depict a young boy with possibly serious emotional problems at least two years before the assaultive relationship between J.M. and defendant commenced in September 1999. Moreover, the records depict an angry young boy who engaged in oppositional and assaultive behavior towards adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The information contained in these records is highly relevant and probative evidence of J.M.\u2019s behavior. It had the capacity to corroborate defendant\u2019s experience with J.M. and to overcome any scepticism which the jury may have had concerning the ability of a slight thirteen year old boy to control and intimidate a thirty-four year old woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Here, the interests of justice required an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the school records. Having reviewed those records, we conclude that the records must be disclosed to the prosecutor and defense counsel and that defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">When this matter is retried, we expect that defendant will assert once again that she engaged in sexual relations with J.M. under duress. Therefore, we consider whether the trial judge properly barred testimony by a forensic psychologist in support of her defense. We conclude that the testimony was properly barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Dr. Witt was prepared to testify that defendant was an anxious, passive, timid woman. According to him, these personality features rendered her easily influenced and easily intimidated. He was also prepared to testify that defendant had a history of anxiety-related problems. He diagnosed an obsessive-compulsive disorder, a panic disorder, elements of post-traumatic stress disor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>der, and a dependent personality disorder. He concluded that \u201cassuming that there is factual support for her description of the events with the teenager, she clearly felt under duress and coerced by his actions, and such coercion was the causative factor in her offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The trial judge ruled that Dr. Witt\u2019s testimony was inadmissible. Initially, he observed that most people can discern whether another is passive, timid or anxious given ample opportunity to observe the person. He also concluded that case law established the standard of the reasonable person rather than the idiosyncratic behavior or personality traits of an individual. The trial judge commented that Dr. Witt\u2019s testimony would inevitably alter the focus from the reasonable person to the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-9(a) recognizes duress as an affirmative defense; it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">it is an affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Prior to the adoption of the penal code on September 1, 1979, but in anticipation of its adoption, the Supreme Court recognized the defense in <em>State v. Toscano, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>421, 378 A.2d 755 (1977). It remains the only case in this State which discusses the \u201cperson of reasonable firmness\u201d standard. According to the Court, the defense \u201cfocuses on the reasonableness of the accused\u2019s fear and his actual ability to resist unlawful demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 378 A.2d 755. The Court elaborated that a jury should be admonished to consider a defendant\u2019s attributes, such as age and health, but not \u201cthe idiosyncracies of an individual\u2019s temperament.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to one commentator, the standard is intended to take account of \u201cstark, tangible factors which differentiate the actor from another such as his size or strength or age or health \u2014 but not to take account of matters of temperament.\u201d Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 4 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-9 (2003) (citing <em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>Vol. II at 71 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Defendant argues that a person\u2019s health has physical and mental components. Thus, consideration of the state of a person\u2019s physical health may not fully reflect the person\u2019s \u201csituation.\u201d The State responds that consideration of a defendant\u2019s personality departs from the objective standard of a \u201cperson of reasonable firmness\u201d articulated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The duress defense enacted by the Legislature as part of the New Jersey Criminal Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-1 to 104-9, is identical to the duress provision of the Model Penal Code. <em>Model Penal Code </em>\u00a7 2.09 (1985). Thus, review of the comments by the Model Penal Code reporters concerning this provision assists our consideration of whether a person\u2019s mental status and the idiosyncracies of a person\u2019s personality are personal attributes which may be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The comment to \u00a7 2.09, particularly the section which discusses the proper scope of the defense, provides considerable assistance in resolving this question. In the course of the discussion, the reporters reflect on the purpose of legal norms and standards and the standard of conduct imposed on members of the community at which the rule of law can be effective. We quote this discussion at length because it provides an excellent guide for our analysis of this issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">In favor of allowing the defense, it may be argued that the legal sanction cannot be effective [if the actor is so far overwhelmed by force that his behavior is involuntary] and that the actor may not properly be blamed for doing what he had to choose to do. It seems clear, however, that the argument in its full force must be rejected. The crucial reason is the same as that which elsewhere leads to an unwillingness to vary legal norms with the individual\u2019s capacity to meet the standards they prescribe, absent a disability that is both gross and verifiable, such as the mental disease or defect that may establish irresponsibility. The most that it is feasible to do with lesser disabilities is to accord them proper weight in sentencing. To make liability depend upon the fortitude of any given actor would be no less impractical or otherwise impolitic than to permit it to depend upon such other variables as intelligence or clarity of judgment, suggestibility or moral insight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Moreover, the legal standard may gain in its effectiveness by being unconditional in this respect. It cannot be known what choices might be different if the actor thought he had a chance of exculpation on the ground of his peculiar disabilities instead of knowing that he does not. No less important, legal norms and sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>operate not only at the moment of climactic choice, but also in the fashioning of values and of character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">Though, for the foregoing reasons, the submission that the actor lacked the fortitude to make the moral choice should not be entertained as a defense, a different situation is presented if the claimed excuse is based upon the incapacity of men in general to resist the coercive pressures to which the individual succumbed. Here the essential principle is that which Henry Hart has put as follows: \u201cObligations of conduct fixed by a fair appraisal of the minimum requirements for the maintenance and fostering of community life will, by hypothesis, be obligations which normal members of the community will be <em>able </em>to comply with, given the necessary awareness of the circumstances of fact calling for compliance.\u201d <em>[The Aims of the Criminal Law, </em>23 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 401, 414 (1958).l This is to say that law is ineffective in the deepest sense, indeed it is hypocritical, if it imposes on the actor who has the misfortune to confront a dilemmatie choice, a standard that his judges are not prepared to affirm that they should and could comply with if their turn to face the problem should arise. Condemnation in such a ease is bound to be an ineffective threat; what is, however, more significant is that it is divorced from any moral base and is unjust. Where it would be both \u201cpersonally and socially debilitating\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 414 n. 31] to accept the actor\u2019s cowardice as a defense, it would be equally debilitating to demand that heroism be the standard of legality. The proper treatment of the hero is not merely to withhold a social censure; it is to give him praise and just reward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\"><em>[Model Penal Code </em>\u00a7 2.09, comment 2 at 374-75 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">From this discussion we discern that the intent of the drafters of the Model Penal Code was to establish a standard based on a societal norm rather than the exceptional or the substandard attributes of an individual. From this discussion we also conclude that defendant\u2019s reaction to J.M.\u2019s threats of harm to her daughter and the physical and emotional abuse heaped on her must be measured by the societal objective norm of the person of reasonable firmness rather than by the multiple personality disorders which characterize defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Consistent with the intent of the drafters of the Model Penal Code, evidence of a person\u2019s mental health, such as depression or personality disorders, has been excluded from consideration by a jury in the face of the defense of duress in state jurisdictions which have adopted the Model Penal Code. <em>Marx v. State, </em>291 <em>Ark. </em>325, 724 S.W.2d 456 (1987) (defendant\u2019s situation did not include emotional upset caused by a recent burglary of his house, a failing business and his mother\u2019s poor health); <em>State v. Ianniello, </em>671 S.W.2d 298 (Mo.Ct.App.1984) (defendant\u2019s dyslexia and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>knowledge of past criminal behavior of another does not establish coercion); <em>People v. Sanchez, </em>112 Misc.2d 100, 446 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>164 (Sup.Ct.1982) (history of depression not a factor for consideration by a jury of duress defense). One exception is a Pennsylvania case, <em>Commonwealth v. DeMarco, </em>570 <em>Pa. </em>263, 809 A.2d 256 (2002), which allowed a jury to consider defendant\u2019s borderline mental retardation as a factor in its consideration of defendant\u2019s defense of duress. The court may have considered defendant\u2019s mental retardation a gross or verifiable mental disability which could establish irresponsibility for one\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A person\u2019s liability for a criminal act is measured against the standard set by the Legislature for the behavior of the entire community. A defendant\u2019s effort to avoid criminal liability should be measured by the same objective societal norm. Here, introduction of evidence that defendant was uniquely susceptible to J.M.\u2019s taunts and threats would inevitably allow the jury to measure defendant\u2019s conduct by a standard other than the norm governing the general population. Such a standard is beyond the contemplation of the duress defense and out-of-step with accepted principles of criminal liability. The evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In summary, we affirm the exclusion of testimony by Dr. Witt and evidence of defendant\u2019s personality. The trial judge, however, erred when he failed to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of J.M.\u2019s school records. Because those records contain relevant and probative evidence which may be utilized not only to impeach the credibility of the victim\u2019s mother but also to support the duress defense, we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
