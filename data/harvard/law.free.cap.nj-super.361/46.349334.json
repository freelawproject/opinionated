M.A.G., the children\u2019s mother, died in an automobile accident that occurred on November 7,1998 in Florida. A.R.G. and M.A.G. had been living in Virginia. However, they separated in 1997. M.A.G. filed a complaint for divorce in the Circuit Court in Virginia and an order granting her custody of the three children was entered on March 25, 1997. The complaint alleged that A.R.G. had subjected M.A.G. to mental cruelty; threatening and emotional abuse; stalking; harassment; marital rape; physical restraint; and destruction of her property. M.A.G. obtained a domestic violence order of protection against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>A.R.G. on August 4, 1997. During the pendency of the divorce ease, M.A.G. obtained permission from the court to move, with the children, to Florida to reside with her parents. After M.AG.\u2019s fatal accident, the children went to reside with A.R.G., who moved with them to New Jersey to reside in the home of his mother, N.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">A.R.G. appeals from an order entered on July 17, 2002, denying his motion for reconsideration of an order that had been entered on June 26, 2002, finding that AR.G\u2019s behavior toward the children constituted aggravated circumstances of abuse, neglect and cruelty that excused DYFS from the statutory requirement to exert reasonable efforts to reunify A.R.G. with his children. A.R.G. also appeals from a \u201cpermanency order,\u201d also entered on July 17, 2002, approving the permanency plan of DYFS to terminate A.R.G.\u2019s parental rights, with adoption of the children by the maternal grandparents, and requiring DYFS to file a guardianship action against A.R.G. by September 18, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The following factual and procedural history gave rise to this appeal. On May 28, 2002, DYFS received a referral from Ms. Carola, the school nurse at the Hudson Elementary School, 18th Street, Union City, the school attended by R.L.G. and A.J.G., advising that she had observed numerous bruises on the arms, back, buttocks and legs of R.L.G. that had been attributed by the child to a beating by A.R.G. The school had received an anonymous call stating that R.J.G. had been physically abused. It was later determined that C.G.F., A.R.G.\u2019s sister, had reported the abuse to the school after C.R.G. had informed her that A.R.G. had been beating R.L.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">DYFS caseworker Dionis Burgos responded to the school, met with Nurse Carola, and spoke with the child. R.L.G. advised Burgos that he had been beaten by his father because he had received a negative progress report from school. Burgos observed large black and blue marks on R.L.G.\u2019s right arm and outer forearm; fading red bruises, in addition to eight fading, red belt marks around the area of R.L.G.\u2019s inner right arm; fading black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and blue bruises on the child\u2019s left arm along with four red, circular belt marks; seven red belt-loop bruises on R.L.G.\u2019s back in the area of the child\u2019s left shoulder; and three black and blue belt-loop bruises on the side of his right calf.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Upon further inquiry by Burgos, R.L.G. described a beating that had been inflicted upon him by A.R.G. on May 27, 2002. R.L.G. further informed Burgos that his father often struck him. Burgos also interviewed A.J.G., who verified the information given by R.L.G. N.G., the children\u2019s paternal grandmother, appeared at the school to retrieve the children, and was also interviewed by Burgos. N.G. initially informed Burgos that she did not see her son A.R.G. strike R.L.G., but stated that A.R.G. was \u201calways screaming at everyone[,]\u201d and that she feels A.R.G. \u201cwent to the extreme.\u201d Burgos made arrangements for R.L.G. to be physically examined at the Jersey City Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Prior to going to the hospital, Burgos accompanied N.G., R.L.G. and A.J.G. back to their home to obtain various phone numbers and other information that might be needed at the hospital. Upon their arriving at the home, the child C.R.G. appeared and he was also interviewed by Burgos. C.R.G. informed Burgos that R.L.G. \u201cdoes not get hit all the time only when he gets bad grades[,]\u201d and that A.R.G. had stopped hitting C.R.G. three years ago. C.G.F., who also resided in an apartment at the same premises where the children resided, was also interviewed by Burgos. C.G.F. stated \u201cshe was glad the Division had gone to her brother\u2019s home[,]\u201d because \u201c[t]he abuse had to stop[,]\u201d and further stated that \u201c[h]er brother even verbally abused his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">After examining R.L.G. at the hospital, Dr. Radwan \u201creported that the child had old bruises and that based on that information he was determining that the child had at least 5 to 6 beatings on his body.\u201d No bruises were detected on A.J.G.\u2019s body. Dr. Pellecia also examined R.L.G., and reported that R.L.G. \u201chad 4 to 5 past beatings on his bodyf,]\u201d and that \u201c[h]e had old, new and healing sears.\u201d Dr. Pellecia also stated in his report that the bruises to \u201c[t]he buttock area did not have time to heal and that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>new beating was probably done on top of the healing woundsf,]\u201d and \u201cthat the buttock area, which was the more seriously injured, would probably leave scars that appeared like birthmarks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In a second interview of N.G. by Burgos, conducted later that day, N.G. admitted she had been present when the beating to R.L.G. had occurred, but stated that \u201c[A.R.G.] is an aggressive person and she is powerless to stop him.\u201d Photographs taken of the bruised areas of R.L.G. graphically depict the results of the severe beating inflicted upon the child by A.R.G. A.R.G. was interviewed by representatives of the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and admitted to beating R.L.G. with a belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">After substantiating the abuse, the Division effected an emergency removal of the children from A.R.G.\u2019s care on May 28, 2002, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.29 to -8.30, and temporarily placed the children into foster care. DYFS also concluded that N.G. had been \u201cneglectful because she did not stop the numerous beatings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">On May 29, 2002, DYFS filed a verified child abuse and neglect complaint in the Family Part against A.R.G., pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axe\">[wjhile in <em>the </em>care and custody of their father, the children were abused and/or neglected in that their father has failed to exercise a minimum degree of care in providing the children with proper supervision or guardianship or by unreasonably inflicting or allowing to be inflicted harm or substantial risk thereof, including infliction of excessive corporal punishment or by any other acts of a similarly serious nature requiring the aid of the court resulting in such children\u2019s physical, mental or emotional condition becoming impaired or in imminent danger of becoming impaired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The complaint also alleged that there was an extensive history of protective service agency involvement in several other states, and that DYFS had requested records from those states. DYFS sought an order granting it custody of the three children \u201cand/or such relief as is provided by law, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 <em>et seq. </em>and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12, and such other relief as may be warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">As a result of the application by DYFS, the trial court entered two orders on May 29, 2002. One order approved and authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the emergency removal that had been effected by DYFS; placed continued custody of the children with DYFS; prohibited A.R.G. from having any contact with the children; and directed that the matter return to court on June 26, 2002. An order to show cause was also entered on May 29, 2002, directing A.R.G. to show cause on June 26, 2002, why an order should not be entered continuing custody, care and supervision of the children with the Division. The order to show cause also provided for representation of the children by the Office of the Law Guardian, and stated that if A.R.G. was unable to afford counsel he could make application for representation to the Public Defender\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Meanwhile, criminal charges were filed against A.R.G. and he was incarcerated; bail was set at $50,000. A Law Division order entered on May 29, 2002 in the criminal matter prohibited A.R.G. from having any contact with the children. A.R.G. was released on bail on June 7, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Pursuant to the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:23-1 to -18, an order was entered in the Family Part on June 6, 2002, authorizing the priority placement of the children with L.L. and G.L., the maternal grandparents, in the State of Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">By letter to all counsel dated June 24, 2002, counsel for DYFS advised, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">Enclosed please find a copy of the evidence packet for the fact finding hearing on Wednesday, June 26, 2002 at 1:30 pm.

The parent has been convicted of murder, aggravated manslaughter or manslaughter of a child; aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring or soliciting to commit murder, aggravated manslaughter or manslaughter of a child; committing or attempting to commit an assault that resulted, or could have resulted, in significant bodily injury to a child; or committing a similarly serious criminal act which resulted, or could have resulted, in the death of or significant bodily injury to a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">c. The rights of the parent to another of the parent\u2019s children have been involuntarily terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">\n<em>When determining whether reasonable efforts are required to reunify the child with the parent, the health and safety of the child and the child\u2019s need for permanency shall be of paramount concern to the court.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">This section shall not be construed to prohibit the division from providing reasonable efforts to reunity the family, if the division determines that family reunification is in the child\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">A permanency plan for the child may be established at the same hearing at which the court determines that reasonable efforts are not required to reunify the child with the parent, if the hearing meets all of the requirements of a permanency hearing pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-61.2],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-11.3 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">The only witness presented at the fact-finding hearing was Dionis Burgos, the DYFS caseworker. Burgos testified to the results of the investigation by DYFS and produced the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>records contained in the DYFS file, including the photographs taken of R.J.G.\u2019s injuries. Over the objection of counsel for A.R.G., the DYFS file was admitted into evidence. After considering the testimony, evidence, and arguments of counsel, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">The Division has proffered 20 photographs of [R.L.G.], and I think the most descriptive photograph would be P-7, the photograph that shows [R.L.G.\u2019s] left arm with bruises on the left forearm____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Pm satisfied that the photographs do not overly exaggerate the extent, nature of the injury. Perhaps bruises are more colorful, demonstrative, but certainly the markings indicate a serious savage beating by [A.R.G.] upon the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">Pm clearly convinced based upon the testimony of Ms. Burgos, the documentation of the medical records, the photographs that the Division has established that [A.R.G.] has abused [R.L.G.] pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A.] </em>9:6-8.21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">Additionally, there is argument that the other two children were not abused. [N.J.S.A.] 9:6-8.46 provides for evidence to be considered, proof of abuse and neglect of one child shall be admissible evidence on the issue of abuse and neglect of another child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">Pm satisfied that based on the abuse inflicted upon [R.L.G.] that the other children likewise would be considered victims of abuse and at risk in the care of [A.R.G.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">The Division also requests a determination pursuant to [N.J.S.A.] 30:4C-11.2<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that they be excused from providing reasonable efforts based upon the child being subject to aggravated circumstances of abuse, neglect, cruelty, or abandonment. Pm satisfied that the Division has clearly established that [R.L.G.] has been subjected to aggravated circumstances of abuse and cruelty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">This is not just punishment for a child\u2019s bad progress report in school. This is a serious beating inflicted upon a young child by an adult through the use of a belt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Division would be excused from providing reasonable efforts. The children are to continue in the care and custody of the Division. Visitation will continue to be suspended for [A.R.G.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">[A.R.G.1 is to comply with the Division\u2019s referral for parenting, anger management, along with any referrals made as a result of the psychological evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">[Counsel for A.R.G.] can have her own psychological evaluation. The children can be ... placed with the maternal grandparents in Florida at any time on notice to [the Law Guardian],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The court entered two orders on June 26, 2002, memorializing its findings. In the fact-finding order, the court found that removal and placement of the children was necessary due to imminent danger to their life, safety or health. The order also recited that DYFS had established by clear and convincing evidence that R.L.G. had been abused by A.R.G., and that due to the severity of abuse the other children were at risk for abuse. The order further provided that \u201creasonable efforts need not be provided.\u201d In the second order, entered on return of the order to show cause, the court continued the \u201cno contact\u201d provision until further order of the court; directed that the interstate referral be conducted on the maternal grandparents in Florida; restrained A.R.G. from the home of the maternal grandparents; required A.R.G. to submit to a psychological evaluation, anger management counseling and parenting skills training; and scheduled a permanency hearing for July 17, 2002.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That order also stated that the \u201cDivision is excused from reasonable efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">On or about July 15, 2002, A.R.G. filed a motion seeking a rehearing or reconsideration of the determination by the court that had excused DYFS from providing reasonable efforts to reunify him with the children. The motion also sought an order directing DYFS to provide services to A.R.G., and an adjournment of the permanency hearing. The motion was argued in the Family Part on July 17, 2002. After analyzing the statute, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>found that the conduct of A.R.G. had constituted aggravated circumstances of abuse and cruelty, and denied the motion stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">In this ease the evidence presented by the Division, P-1 through P-5, testimony of Ms. Burgos, really shows that [A.R.G.] beat the child, [R.L.G.] with a belt on or about May 27th, 2002. The Division offered statements of the child and in fact the children, [AJ.G. and C.R.G.] that this was not an isolated incident, as offered by [A.R.G.] in his statement to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. [R.L.G.] had reported that he had been hit previously by [A.R.G.] with both belt and by hand, page five of P-4. He also reported to the Division that in the past his father has always hit him. It started in September of 2001. Every time the teacher sent a progress report or report card or a note he would be hit with the belt, P-4 at page 11. [R.L.G.] also said that he was hit every marking period. [R.L.G.] also stated that the beating left him in pain, the contact sheet dated May 30th at P-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">The medical documentation, P-4 at page three, reflects that the child had lesions in different stages of healing____Dr. Pellecia ... reported to the Division worker ... that [R.L.G.] had four to five past beatings. Dr. Pellecia opined that he, [R.L.G.], has old, new and healing scars. Photos, P-5, also speak volumes of the savagery of the assault on [R.L.G.] by [A.R.G.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">The Division\u2019s evidence also shows that another child, [C.R.G.], told the worker \u201c[R.L.G.] does not get hit all the time, only when he gets bad grades.\u201d He claimed that three years ago his father ... stopped hitting him, [C.R.G.]. He would be hit for everything. And that he stood up to his father and the beatings stopped____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">[C.R.G.] also stated that his father told him to keep quiet because if anything was revealed he, [A.R.G.], would go to jail____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">[C.R.G.] also has described domestic violence between [A.R.G.] and his mother. P 1, a contact sheet from [June 10, 2002], describes [C.R.G.] observing [A.R.G.] hitting the mother of the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\"># ^5 #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">Two of the three children testified to physical abuse of them by [AR.G.] [A. J.G.] and [C.R.G.] have also witnessed the physical abuse of [R.L.G.] by [A.R.G.]. [C.R.G.] described domestic violence between [A.R.G.] and their mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-17\">Now our Legislature has recognized the impact on children being exposed to violence in the home. Children, even when they are not themselves physically assaulted suffer deep and lasting emotional effect from exposures to domestic violence. [N.J.S.A.] 2C:25-18. This is not an allegation of domestic violence. The only reason why it\u2019s not domestic violence is that the children cannot be victims of domestic violence. But obviously this would be violence in the house, which impacts upon the children who are exposed to the violence, even though not hit themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-18\">The evidence presented by the Division through the statements of the children\u2014 and statements of the children are admissible pursuant to [N.J.S.A.] 9:6-8.46\u2014 describes a systematic and a substantial period ... of physically and emotionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>abusing the children. His methods of discipline go beyond the bounds of discipline and in fact reach the level of a cruel and depraved mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">While these cases are fact sensitive I\u2019m satisfied that the ... abuse rises to the level of aggravated abuse and cruelty \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">SjC <em>t'.i</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">I\u2019m satisfied that I considered all the evidence on June 26th as to the nature of the assault, the continuous assaults upon [R.L.G.J. And in that determination I am still satisfied clearly and convincingly that [A.R.G.] has intimidated and physically assaulted the child. That would satisfy me it was an aggravated circumstance of abuse and cruelty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The judge then conducted the scheduled permanency hearing. The Division\u2019s permanency goal, endorsed by the children\u2019s law guardian, was termination of A.R.G.\u2019s parental rights and adoption by the maternal grandparents, with whom the children had been residing in Florida. In approving the plan offered by DYFS, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">The permanency plan of the Division is appropriate. The plan is termination. The Division is excused from providing reasonable efforts. However, they still have to establish each of the four prongs of the best interest test for termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">Visitation will continue suspended. The no contact order is in place. [Counsel for A.R.G.] can discuss that matter with the prosecutor or make application ... on notice to the prosecutor to lift the no contact order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">The children should be referred to a therapist. The therapist should send reports to [the law guardian] and/or the Division as to the children\u2019s interest or desire in seeing [or] having contact with their father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">* s? * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">All right. But the Division still could explore other options to termination as to [C.R.G.] maybe even \u2014 well, all three actually. [R.L.G.] is about to turn 10. [C.R.G.] is about to turn 15. There may be other options that the Division could explore, such as maybe long term foster care, but it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re going to have enough time for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">V \u00abS' v</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">The Division should explore any options, discuss the possibility of adoption with the children. [C.R.G.] and [R.L.G.] do have the right to have some input as to that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">The judge entered three separate orders on July 17, 2002. One order denied A.R.G.\u2019s motion for reconsideration.

The third order, designated as a \u201cpermanency order,\u201d approved the Division\u2019s permanency plan of termination of A.R.G.\u2019s parental rights, with adoption by the maternal grandparents; stated that the Division need not provide reasonable efforts because the children had been subjected to aggravated circumstances of abuse, neglect and cruelty; and directed the Division to file a guardianship complaint by September 18, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On August 29, 2002, A.R.G. filed a notice of appeal from entry of the July 17, 2002 order.

No. </em>105-89, 111 <em>Stat. </em>2115 (1997) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 42 <em>U.S.C.), </em>in order to qualify for the continued receipt of federal funding for New Jersey\u2019s child protection system. The overall purpose and scope of ASFA were stated in the report of the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means (Committee) to Congress, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">The Committee bill is expected to increase the number of adoptions in the United States. Three major provisions of the bill were designed to produce this increase in adoptions. First, under current law, States must engage in \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to help families that have abused or neglected their children. Some observers have argued that uncertainty about the reasonable efforts standard sometimes delays State action in making children available for adoption. In response to this problem, the bill requires States to define \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d in State law, such as child torture or sexual abuse, that would permit the State to bypass the Federal reasonable efforts criterion and move more expeditiously to terminate parental rights and make a child available for adoption. In addition, States would not be required to reunite families in cases where a parent has murdered another child or lost their parental rights to a sibling. Second, the bill provides States with a $4,000 ($6,000 for special needs children) incentive payment for each adoption above the number of adoptions during the previous year. Third, in the case of children under age 10 who have been in foster care for at least 18 of the past 24 months, the bill requires States to move toward terminating parental rights under most circumstances. Taken together, these provisions and associated provisions of the Committee bill can be expected to produce a substantial increase in adoptions in the years ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\"><em>[H.R. Rep. </em>105-77, at 7 (1997), <em>reprinted in </em>1997 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>1,2739-40.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Prior to the enactment of ASFA, New Jersey required DYFS to meet the more demanding standard of exerting \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d in attempting family reunification. ASFA replaced that requirement with the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d standard, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15), and further required the States to adopt legislation excusing state agencies from providing reasonable efforts under certain enumerated circumstances. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(3), as amended by <em>L. </em>1997, c. 175, \u00a7 18, <em>eff. </em>July 31, 1997. Here, the pertinent exception permitting States to \u201cbypass\u201d reasonable efforts for reunification is where the state agency can demonstrate the existence of \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d inflicted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>parent upon the child. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i). The reasons underlying enactment of this bypass provision were explained at length by the Committee, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">After many years of growth, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the nation\u2019s foster care caseload is now almost 500,000. Recent studies have shown that in some States, the average child removed from the home because of family problems spends almost three years in foster care. Many of these children will never return home; many more will return home one or more times before it becomes evident that their families will not be able to take care of them permanently. And yet, testimony before the Committee, as well as scientific studies, have shown that adoption is an effective way to assure that children grow up in loving families and that they become happy and productive citizens as adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">There seems to be almost universal agreement that adoption is preferable to foster care and that the nation\u2019s children would be well served'by a policy that increases adoption rates. Over the past several years, however, witnesses before the Committee have testified that there are a variety of barriers to adoption, some of them Federal. One barrier is the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d criterion in the Federal statute. This criterion requires States to make reasonable efforts to prevent removing a child from its home and to facilitate returning children to their homes if removal has been necessary. The intent of this policy is to provide services to families so that they can continue to fulfill their child rearing function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">However, there seems to be a growing belief that Federal statutes, the social work profession, and the courts sometimes err on the side of protecting the rights of parents. As a result, too many children are subjected to long spells of foster care or are returned to families that reabuse them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">The bipartisan group that wrote this legislation recognized the importance and essential fairness of the reasonable efforts criterion. What is needed is not a wholesale reversal of reasonable efforts or of the view that government has a responsibility to help troubled families solve the problems that lead to child abuse or neglect. The Federal government now spends well over $4.5 billion dollars helping these families and their children and the money is well spent. <em>Rather than abandoning the Federal policy of helping troubled families, what is needed is a measured, response to allow States to adjust their statutes and practices </em>so <em>that in some circumstances States will be able to move more efficiently toward terminating parental rights and placing children for adoption.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\"><em>Thus, the Committee bill would require States to define \u201caggravated circumstances, </em>\u201d <em>such as child torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse, in which States are allowed to bypass the Federal reasonable efforts criteria and instead would be required to make efforts to place the child for adoption. </em>In addition, States would be required to bypass reasonable efforts to provide services to families if the parent has murdered a child, committed manslaughter in the death of a child, or has another child for whom parental rights were involuntarily terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\"><em>[H.R. Rep. No. </em>105-77, at 7-8 (1997), <em>reprinted in </em>1997 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>1, 2740 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Thus, ASFA permitted child protection agencies to bypass the requirement that reasonable efforts of reunification be exerted when the court finds that there are aggravated circumstances, such as abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, and sexual abuse; that there is a homicide of a child; or that the parent has had parental rights to another child terminated. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Prior to the enactment of ASFA, \u201cboth state and federal law appeared to give primary consideration to the rights of parents, as opposed to the welfare of their children.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Children, Youth &amp; Families Dep\u2019t v. Amy B., </em>133 <em>N.M. </em>136, 61 P.3d 845, 847 (Ct.App.2002). In eliminating the requirement of reasonable efforts under certain circumstances, and in requiring the States to follow suit in order to be eligible for federal benefits, ASFA was responding to perceived excesses in the application of the reasonable efforts requirement. <em>In re Custody and Guardianship of Marino S., </em>181 Misc.2d 264, 693 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>822, 825 (Fam.Ct.1999). The obvious intent of Congress was not to require remedial measures in situations where a court has determined that the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances of abuse. <em>J.S. v. State of Alaska, </em>50 P.3d 388, 392 (Alaska 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Additionally, ASFA conditions receipt of federal funding upon a State\u2019s adoption of a system in which, <em>inter alia, </em>the status of each child in placement is reviewed periodically but no less frequently than once every six months, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 675(5)(B); requires a permanency hearing to be held not later than twelve months after the child has been in placement, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 675(5)(C); and, under specific circumstances, requires States to seek termination of parental rights and concurrently identify, recruit, and process a qualified family for adoption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 675(5)(E). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Idaho Dep\u2019t of Health and Welfare v.

Thus, in pursuing that goal, ASFA provides that reasonable efforts to reunite children with their parents \u201cshall not be required ... if a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that (i) the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances (as defined in State law, which definition may include but need not be limited to abandonment, torture, chronic abuse and sexual abuse)[.]\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i). Essentially, ASFA makes clear that a child need not be forced to remain in or be returned to an unsafe home and allows the States to place the safety and welfare of the child before the interest of abusive parents. <em>In Interest of S.A.M., </em>826 So.2d 1266, 1276 (Miss.2002). If reasonable efforts for reunification are not made as a result of a determination made pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i) \u2014 that they are not required by reason of aggravated circumstances \u2014 then a permanency hearing \u201cshall be held for the child within 30 days after the determination[.]\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671(a)(E)(i); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.54(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Although a finding under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3(a) relieves DYFS of the requirement to make reasonable efforts to reunify an abused or neglected child with that child\u2019s parent where the court has found that aggravated circumstances exist, the term \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d has not been defined by our Legislature, despite AFSA providing that that term is to be defined by state law and \u201cmay include ... abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, and sexual abuse.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The Supreme Court has, however, recognized the \u201cstrong policy considerations that underscore the need to secure permanency and stability for the child without undue delay.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of DMH, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>365, 385, 736 A.2d 1261 (1999) (citing to <em>In re Guardianship of K.H.O., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 356, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999)). In referencing ASFA, the Court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">On the federal level, the recent trend has been to limit the reasonable efforts social service agencies must undertake to reunite families.

Because Congress left it to the States to define what \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d means, a wide variety of approaches have been found among the States. Although ASFA provides that aggravated circumstances may be defined to include, but not be limited to, \u201cabandonment, torture, chronic abuse, and sexual abuse,\u201d our Legislature has chosen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>use the term \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d as a modifier of \u201cabuse, neglect, cruelty or abandonment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3(a). Stated another way, it appears that the degree, or extent, of the \u201cabuse, neglect, cruelty or abandonment\u201d would seemingly determine whether \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In the absence of more descriptive statutory language, we must construe the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3(a) in light of the language used and the objective sought to be achieved. <em>Matter of Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:1I, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>119, 127-28, 693 A.2d 97 (1997). \u201cPrimary regard must be given to the fundamental purposes for which the legislation was enacted.\u201d <em>Velazquez ex rel.

Department of Banking, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>105, 113, 777 A.2d 1 (2001).

In North Carolina, for example, reasonable efforts for reunification after placement shall not be required, <em>inter alia, </em>where the court has determined that the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances, <em>N.C.

Prior to AFSA, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), <em>P.L. </em>96-272, as codified in scattered sections throughout Title 42, restructured federal programs for children removed from their families due to abuse or neglect. Through matching-fund incentives, AACWA required the States to lessen the emphasis on foster care and out-of-home placement by requiring services designed to prevent placement and to make it possible for children to return to their homes. <em>See </em>Kurtis A. Kemper, <em>Construction And Application By State Courts of the Federal Adoption And Safe Families Act And Its Implementation By State Statutes, </em>2003 <em>A.L.R. </em>5th 3, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Significantly, the enactment of AFSA represented a departure from the emphasis in AACWA on the preservation of families by establishing a child protection system that subordinates parental rights to the paramount concern for the health and safety of the child when making a decision on whether or not it is in the child\u2019s best interests to preserve the family unit. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-1(a); <em>In re Guardianship of D.J.M., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>150, 154-55, 737 A.2d 1179 (Ch.Div.1999) (observing that, distilled to its essence, the adoption of ASFA shifted the focus from reunification with biological parents to the safety of the children).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3(a) stand for the proposition that the child protection system should not be required to expend its limited resources on attempting to reunify children with their abusive parents where aggravated circumstances of abuse, neglect, cruelty or abandonment exist and dictate the continued need of the children for protection to \u201cassure that children grow up in loving families and that they become happy and productive citizens as adults.\u201d <em>H.R.Rep. No. </em>105-77, <em>supra, </em>at 8. In weighing the balance between the rights of children and the rights of parents when considering reunification services, the balancing formula should tip on the side of protecting children, and not on the side of protecting the rights of parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Still, to bypass the requirement for reasonable efforts of reunification, \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d must be found to exist. The difficult issue is identifying aggravated circumstances. Resolution of that issue must be viewed through the lens of the legislative intent that the safety of the child is the paramount concern. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C\u20141(a); <em>In re Guardianship of DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 385, 736 A.2d 1261. Certainly, the determination of whether aggravated circumstances exist must be made on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, we concur with the observation by the Oregon Court of Appeals that it is not possible or necessary for us to determine the entire universe of \u201caggravated circumstances.\u201d <em>See State ex rel. Juvenile Dep\u2019t of Benton County v. Risland, supra, </em>51 P.3d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>However, our review of the legislation and case law in the various States provides guidance in establishing criteria to determine the existence of aggravated circumstances. Although there are a wide variety of approaches among the States, there are common threads, or themes, that are underpinned by the intent and purposes of AFSA, as implemented by our Legislature. We conclude that the term \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d embodies the concept that the nature of the abuse or neglect must have been so severe or repetitive that to attempt reunification would jeopardize and compromise the safety of the child, and would place the child in a position of an unreasonable risk to be reabused.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Moreover, any circumstances that increase the severity of the abuse or neglect, or add to its injurious consequences, equates to \u201caggravated circumstances.\u201d Whether couched as \u201csevere child abuse or neglect,\u201d \u201cserious child abuse or neglect,\u201d or \u201csevere physical injury\u201d of a singular, chronic, recurrent, or repetitive nature, where the circumstances created by the parent\u2019s conduct create an unacceptably high risk to the health, safety and welfare of the child, they are \u201caggravated\u201d to the extent that the child welfare agency, here DYFS, may bypass reasonable efforts of reunification. Moreover, where the parental conduct is particularly heinous or abhorrent to society, involving savage, brutal, or repetitive beatings, torture, or sexual abuse, the conduct may also be said to constitute \u201caggravated circumstances.\u201d Additionally, whether the offer or receipt of services would correct the conditions that led to the abuse or neglect within a reasonable time may also be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We note that the existence of aggravated circumstances does not suggest that services are not to be provided at all. Here, for example, the June 26, 2002 order required A.R.G. to submit to a psychological evaluation, counseling, anger management, and parenting skills classes. However, the aggravated circumstances bypass provision of ASF A, as embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3(a), gives the court discretion to identify the most egregious cases at the early stages of the child protective process without providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>fruitless reunification services. <em>See In re Ashley S., supra, </em>762 A.2d at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In reviewing the factual findings and conclusions of a trial judge, we are obliged to accord deference to the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations and its \u201cfeel of the case\u201d based upon the opportunity of the judge to see and hear the witnesses. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (1998); <em>Pascale v. Pascale, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>20, 33, 549 A.2d 782 (1988). We are not to disturb the judge\u2019s findings unless they are \u201cso manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Additionally, \u201c[b]ecause of the family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters, appellate courts should accord deference to family court factfinding.\u201d <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 713 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">After analyzing the record in the light of the written and oral arguments advanced by the parties, and considering applicable law, we conclude there was adequate, substantial, credible evidence in the record to support the conclusion of the trial judge that aggravated circumstances of abuse and cruelty had been clearly and convincingly proved, permitting the court to authorize DYFS to bypass the statutory obligation of exerting reasonable efforts of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The judge\u2019s characterization of R.L.G. having been subjected to \u201ca serious savage beating\u201d at the hands of A.R.G. is fully supported by the testimony, photographs, and other evidence in the record. A.R.G.\u2019s argument that the beating he inflicted was an isolated incident is belied by the record. The statements of the children, paternal grandmother, and paternal aunt, as confirmed by the expert evaluations, demonstrate A.R.G. repeatedly subjected R.L.G. to beatings and abuse, and that he had previously subjected C.R.G. to beatings. The inability of his mother, N.G., to control A.R.G.\u2019s violent outbursts and his sister C.G.F.\u2019s statements concerning A.R.G.\u2019s abusive behavior certainly show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the savage beating inflicted upon R.L.G. was far from an isolated occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The child A.J.G.\u2019s statements to the investigator from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office concerning his observations of the May 27, 2002 beating of R.J.G., relating that A.R.G. kept hitting R.L.G. over and over and told R.L.G. that he would beat R.L.G. until he bled, and that \u201cthe next time I\u2019ll break your arms[,]\u201d reflects depraved behavior. The record also demonstrated that A.R.G.\u2019s pattern of violent and abusive behavior permeated his marriage with M.A.L. and led to their separation. Moreover, the children had witnessed A.R.G.\u2019s abuse of their mother, as well as repeated violence in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">It was fully within the province of the trial judge to reject as unpersuasive the evidence adduced by A.R.G. that the children\u2019s swimming coach and school principal always observed a wholesome relationship between A.R.G. and the children. We note that those observations were made in a public setting. We take notice that violent and abusive behavior in an interpersonal family setting is more likely to occur in private, behind closed doors, rather than in public view.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">We also find unpersuasive A.R.G.\u2019s argument that there were no aggravated circumstances because R.L.G. had suffered no broken bones or prolonged medical treatment. The nature and severity of the beating that R.L.G. had been subjected to on May 27, 2002, at the hands of A.R.G., as graphically depicted by the photographs in evidence; the prior beatings suffered by both C.R.G. and R.L.G.; the medical evidence of the repeated beatings suffered by R.L.G.; the indictment and repudiation of A.R.G.\u2019s abusive behavior by his own mother and sister; and the evidence of prior abusive and violent behavior by A.R.G., are all sufficient indicia and proof of aggravated circumstances of chronic abuse and cruelty, without the necessity of broken bones or prolonged medical care. The totality of the evidence paints a vivid picture of the children and others in A.R.G.\u2019s family household being subjected to a violent and intimidating atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>We also conclude that the judge properly applied the provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46 in concluding that all three children were in need of protection by the court. <em>See Division of Youth and Family Servs. v. Robert M., </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>44, 68, 788 A.2d 888 (App.Div.) (noting that the abuse of one child may pose a danger to other children in the household), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>39, 803 A.2d 635 (2002); <em>J &amp; E v. M.F., </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 493, 385 A.2d 240 (App.Div.) (noting that \u201cpredictions as to probable future conduct can only be based upon past performance[,]\u201d and \u201c[e]vidence of parents\u2019 fitness or unfitness can be gleaned not only from their past treatment of the child in question but also from the quality of care given to other children in their custody\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>490, 391 A.2d 504 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The record established that A.R.G.\u2019s resort to violence was chronic, habitual and repetitive, and endangered the health, safety and welfare of the children. These \u201caggravated circumstances,\u201d within the context of the intent of ASFA that the safety of children be the court\u2019s paramount concern, established by clear and convincing evidence that the exertion of reasonable efforts for reunification should be bypassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We emphasize that a finding of aggravated circumstances permitting the bypass of the reasonable efforts requirement does not equate to a deprivation of parental rights. <em>See In re Baby Boy H., </em>63 <em>Cal.App. </em>4th 470, 477-78, 73 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>793 (1998). As the trial judge correctly stated, in order to terminate A.R.G.\u2019s parental rights, DYFS must still establish each of the four prongs contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a) by clear and convincing evidence during the guardianship trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We have reviewed with great respect the thoughtful dissent of our esteemed colleague. We recognize that this is a difficult ease, and we cannot quarrel in technical terms with the procedural due process concerns expressed in the dissent. However, \u201c[d]ue process of law is not a fixed star in the constitutional firmament. It radiates variably in application, \u2018calling] for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019\u201d <em>Wakefield v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Pinchak, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 570, 674 A.2d 621 (App.Div.1996) (quoting <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 481, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, 494 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Here, as a practical matter, the record adequately demonstrates that the evidence and circumstances forming the basis for the Division\u2019s application for permission to bypass the requirement to provide reunification services were well known to A.R.G. and all counsel prior to the June 26, 2002 hearing. Moreover, A.R.G. made no proffer \u2014 either at the June 26th hearing or in his motion for reconsideration heard on July 17, 2002 \u2014 as to what additional proofs or evidence he would have submitted to challenge the claim that \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse, neglect, cruelty or abandonment\u201d existed as a result of his conduct. Indeed, everything that could have been submitted was fully before the court; there were no surprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Instead, A.R.G. merely relied upon his penitence and sought another opportunity to parent these children. All such pleas to the contrary notwithstanding, the photographs of the brutal beating administered by A.R.G. to R.L.G. fully speak for themselves. When those photographs are considered within the context of the other undisputed evidence presented to the trial judge, the power of the proofs clearly and convincingly supports the finding of aggravated circumstances under any standard or interpretation of that term. As so aptly stated, \u201c \u2018One picture is worth more than ten thousand words.\u2019 <em>Chinese proverb.\u201d Traver v.

Whether the termination of A.R.G.\u2019s parental rights will or should be terminated is not an issue before us in this appeal. Likewise, the issue of whether kinship legal guardianship proceedings are an appropriate alternative to termination of his parental rights is a matter to be advanced to the Family Part by A.R.G. during the guardianship proceedings. The sole question here is whether the Family Part \u2014 in the child abuse and neglect action \u2014 properly concluded that aggravated circumstances existed. In our view, the uncontroverted clarity of the evidence supports the conclusion reached by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The orders entered in the Family Part on June 26, 2002 and July 17, 2002, are affirmed.

Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21c. And, I concur with the observations of my colleagues that the evidence presented to the trial judge demonstrated A.R.G.\u2019s repeated abuse of R.L.G., his prior abuse of C.R.G., as well as his abusive and controlling conduct toward other family members, including his deceased wife, his mother and sister. I also agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that the enactment of the Federal Adoption &amp; Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) represented a shift in legislative intent from a child protection system that emphasized the preservation of families to a system that subordinates parental rights to the paramount concern for protecting the health, safety and welfare of children when considering whether it is in the child\u2019s best interests to preserve the family unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">However, I have serious reservations as to whether A.R.G.\u2019s due process rights were sufficiently protected by the procedures followed. The essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>67, 80, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1983, 1994, 32 <em>L. Ed.</em>2d 556, 567-68 (1972). In this case, not only was A.R.G. deprived of adequate notice of the DYFS application, but there also was insufficient opportunity to allow his counsel to consider or present a defense. The procedures followed here culminated in relieving DYFS of its obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunite A.R.G. with his children, a result that is unsustainable in light of the serious consequences flowing from that discussion, which I will discuss in more detail later in this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">An order to show cause was filed by the Division on May 29, 2002, and an order was entered on that date approving the emergency removal of the children and scheduling the matter for a hearing on June 26, 2002. The order also, among other things, continued custody, care and supervision of the children with DYFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">A second order was entered also on May 29, 2002. The second order is a form order with pre-printed language, containing a menu of options as to the purpose of the scheduled hearing, the selection of which was to be designated by the insertion of a checkmark, or other mark, in the appropriate space next to one of the following types of hearings: \u201cCase Management Conference\u201d; \u201cCompliance Review\u201d; \u201cFact Finding\u201d; and \u201cPermanency Hearing.\u201d No checkmark appears in any of the spaces provided. And nowhere in the order is there any reference to the fact that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>hearing would be held to determine whether \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d exist excusing DYFS of its obligation to make reasonable efforts toward family reunification pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The only indication in the record on appeal that demonstrates notice to A.R.G. concerning the specific nature of the June 26, 2002 hearing is the June 24, 2002 letter from the Division\u2019s counsel to A.R.G.\u2019s counsel, issued only two days prior to the scheduled hearing date, transmitting an \u201cevidence packet\u201d to A.R.G.\u2019s counsel. That letter informed A.R.G., through counsel, for the first time, that the Division intended to request \u201ca finding pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3(a)[.]\u201d No further explanation is provided in the letter that DYFS intended to seek a ruling relieving DYFS of its obligation to make reasonable efforts toward family reunification on the ground that \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d exist. Certainly, no formal pleading, motion, supporting certification, or brief accompanied DYFS\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In my view, two days prior notice, and the nature and manner of furnishing that notice, were insufficient to apprise A.R.G. of .the serious consequences that would result if the court acceded to the Division\u2019s request for a determination under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3a, denying A.R.G. due process of law. Moreover, I believe that the Division\u2019s failure to proceed formally also renders the proceedings and ensuing order a nullity. The eleventh hour transmittal of a \u201cpacket of evidence\u201d with a terse reference to the statute does not pass constitutional muster. Instead, DYFS should have indicated in its order to show cause its intention to proceed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3a if it was seeking to obtain a waiver of DYFS\u2019s efforts to reunite A.R.G. with his children. Alternatively, if time was an issue, a motion on short notice could have been subsequently filed and served after DYFS obtained the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">As for the lack of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, I highlight the following exchange between counsel for A.R.G. and the court at the June 26, 2002 hearing. This exchange creates serious doubt as to whether A.R.G.\u2019s counsel was afforded an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>adequate opportunity to address DYFS\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">ICOUNSEL FOR A.R.G.]: Your Honor, I\u2019m asking the court to find that reasonable efforts should have been made\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">THE COURT: This is not a reasonable efforts case. It\u2019s a fact finding case to determine whether or not there was abuse\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">[COUNSEL FOR A.R.G.]: Your Honor, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 as defined under\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">LCOUNSEL FOR A.R.G.]: \u2014 I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">THE COURT: It\u2019s got nothing to do with reasonable effort. So, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t consume time talking about reasonable efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-12\">[COUNSEL FOR A.R.G.]: Okay. So, Your Honor already ruled on that as far as reasonable efforts have been made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-13\">THE COURT: It\u2019s not a question of reasonable efforts being offered at this time. The question is whether or not there was abuse committed by [A.R.G.] upon the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">Although the judge may have been precluding argument <em>on </em>the issue of whether the Division should have provided reasonable efforts to prevent placement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-11.2a because <em>placement </em>had already occurred, apparently that was not clear to AR.G.\u2019s counsel because, after this exchange, both counsel for DYFS and the law guardian requested to be heard on the \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d issue \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d However, without granting argument on that issue, the judge then delivered his opinion, which included a finding that \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d had been established. Fundamental fairness required more than this cursory review and adjudication of AR.G.\u2019s rights in light of the serious consequences that flowed from the judge\u2019s finding of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse.\u201d Aside from relieving DYFS of its obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunite the family, that finding permitted the court to accelerate the proceedings to the end that a guardianship complaint was filed only three months later. In my view, this rush to judgment under the facts of this case is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Both ASFA, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 671 (a)(15)(E)(i), and our implementing statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.54b(2), accelerate the required permanency hearing upon a finding that reasonable efforts of reunifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tion need not be made pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3a. Under those provisions, the permanency hearing must occur within thirty days after such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">By contrast, if a court finds that a child has been subjected to \u201cabuse or neglect\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.9 and that placement is required, the initial placement can be for as long as twelve months, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6 \u2014 8.54b(l), with a permanency hearing held \u201cno later than 12 months after the child has been in placement.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-61.2a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In this ease, the judge conducted a permanency hearing immediately after the finding of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d and approved the Division\u2019s permanency plan, namely, termination of A.R.G.\u2019s parental rights to all three children and adoption by the maternal grandparents. Thus, this finding allowed DYFS to abbreviate the time for approving its permanency plan with the result that DYFS could file its guardianship immediately. That complaint was filed on September 18, 2002, just three months after the June 26, 2002 hearing, all because it was excused from making any efforts toward family reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">As a result of the judge\u2019s ruling, arguably, at least a portion of the third prong of the four-prong \u201cbest interests\u201d test justifying termination of parental rights in the guardianship action may have been satisfied. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(3). <em>See also In re Custody and Guardianship of Marino S., </em>181 <em>Misc.</em>2d 264, 693 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>822, 831-33 (N.Y.Fam.Ct.1999), <em>aff'd </em>293 <em>A.D.2d </em>223, 741 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>207 (N.Y.App.Div.2002). In a guardianship action, ordinarily DYFS is required to demonstrate it \u201chas made reasonable efforts to provide services to help the parent correct the circumstances which led to the child\u2019s placement outside the home\u201d before termination may be ordered. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(3). With the court\u2019s finding that DYFS had established \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d by clear and convincing evidence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it could later be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>argued in the guardianship action that the reasonable efforts requirement need not be further demonstrated. <em>Ibid. </em>I believe that the shortening of the time in this case, in the absence of appropriate due process safeguards requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Moreover, I have serious reservations as to whether the evidence presented at the factfinding hearing was even sufficient to support a finding of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse.\u201d The majority opinion reviews, in depth, legislation passed in various states implementing those provisions of ASFA pertaining to \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d as permitting waiver of the reasonable efforts requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-ll.lb. A critical examination of that legislation, however, reveals a common thread for interpreting the phrase \u201caggravating circumstances of abuse\u201d as requiring both (1) a finding that the conduct of the parent has subjected the child to serious injury or has placed the child in a position of being at significant risk of serious injury, and (2) that services would not correct the conditions that led to the abuse or neglect within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In this case, there was no medical testimony concerning the full extent and nature of the injury to R.L.G. from A.R.G.\u2019s physical abuse of the child. Nor was there a psychological evaluation of R.L.G., or the other children, which might have afforded some insight into the emotional effects of the abuse on the children. Similarly, there was no psychological evaluation of A.R.G., which might have revealed whether there is any likelihood that services would be able to correct the condition that led to the abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The presentation of such evidence would have elicited cross-examination and further exploration of these issues. In the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>such evidence, I have no confidence that a just result was reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. The sole evidence presented at the hearing came from the testimony of the DYFS caseworker, which relied substantially on the hearsay statements of others. Unlike the circumstances in <em>In re Guardianship of B.L.A., </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 753 A.2d 770 (Ch.Div.2000), this family had no prior history of intervention by the Division. Fundamental fairness required expert testimony and testimony of the adverse family witnesses before the court could properly conclude that DYFS had proved \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d by clear and convincing evidence excusing it from making any efforts toward reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Moreover, if the evidence underpinning the trial court\u2019s decision in this case can be viewed as supporting a conclusion of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse,\u201d consider how many other cases alleging child abuse under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21 could arguably fit within the definition of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11.3a; <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>10:133I4.3.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I respectively suggest that the majority has not articulated a useful standard for determining when \u201cserious abuse\u201d or \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d has occurred. For instance, it is not clear whether conduct alone is sufficient to establish a case of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d or whether the effect of that conduct must be factored into the equation. If the \u201ceffect\u201d is a vital component, then expert evidence must be presented to aid the fact-finder to reach a just result.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Finally, I would be remiss if I did not question whether ASFA\u2019s approval of the waiver of the reasonable efforts requirement in cases of \u201caggravated circumstances of abuse\u201d was intended to expedite termination proceedings to free abused children for adoption who are not languishing in foster care. <em>See. H.R. Rep. </em>105-77, at 7 (1997), <em>reprinted in </em>1997 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>1, 2739-40. Here, it seems the children have been safely placed with caring grandparents. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.3a provides that DYFS shall not be required to file a petition seeking the termination of parental rights if \u201c[t]he child is being cared for by a relative and a permanent plan for the child can be achieved without termination of parental rights[.]\u201d Again, these children have been placed with their maternal grandparents, with whom they have previously resided and therefore, in my view, there is no reason for these accelerated proceedings. Notably, the children are not infants. A.J.G. recently turned nine years old; R.L.G. is ten; and C.R.G. is sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">I also note that the rush to judgment in this case essentially precludes consideration of a permanency alternative that arguably could be appropriate in a case of this nature, namely, a \u201ckinship legal guardianship arrangement.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-84 to -88 (providing for a kinship legal guardianship arrangement as an alternative disposition and permanent placement once children have been residing in the home of a relative for a period of twelve consecutive months). But I draw no conclusions in that regard in the absence of briefing on the issue. Suffice it to say, given the fact that these children are safely placed in a secure and familiar environment with their maternal grandparents in Florida, and that the criminal charges against their father have not as yet been resolved, the rush to achieve permanency for these children which is applicable to the foster placement of an abused child seems ill-advised under our system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">For all of these reasons, I would reverse and remand the matter to the Family Part for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> In a factfinding hearing, any determination that a child is an abused or neglected child must be based on a preponderance of the evidence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>8.46b(1).
