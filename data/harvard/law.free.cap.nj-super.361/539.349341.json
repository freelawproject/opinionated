In the underlying litigation, Sally James sued her former employers, Click Corporation of America, Inc. (Click) and North American Beverage Company (North American), and their principal and her former supervisor, John C. Imbesi (Imbesi). (None of the parties have sought to pursue this litigation anonymously. In view of the subject matter, we use a pseudonym, Sally James, for the claimant-appellant only.) She alleged, among other things, sexual harassment in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12. She claimed both compensatory and punitive damages. The case settled before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Under the terms of the settlement, a sum of money, $1 million, was paid and a consent judgment was entered in James\u2019s favor on her LAD claims, and her claims for negligent transmission of venereal herpes and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The remaining claims were dismissed with prejudice. The entire settlement, $4.15 million, ostensibly represented James\u2019s compensatory damages. No portion was attributed to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Imbesi, Click, and North American paid James $700,000, and assigned to her their rights to prosecute and recover from the non-settling insurers. An additional $300,000 was paid by American Motorists Insurance Company (American Motorists), which had provided Click and North American with commercial general liability and excess liability insurance, and Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (Lumbermens), which had provided Click and North American with workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability insurance during fourteen months of James\u2019s term of employment. American Motorists and Lumbermens are part of the Kemper group of insurance companies. The parties sometimes collectively refer to American Motorists and Lumbermens as \u201cKemper.\u201d We refer separately to the companies because their interests are somewhat different.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The non-settling insurance companies were: (1) Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company and Fireman\u2019s Fund Indemnity Corporation (Fireman\u2019s), which had provided homeowners\u2019 insurance to Imbesi; and (2) Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company (Harleysville), which had provided commercial general liability, excess liability, and workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability insurance to Click and North American during a five-month portion of James\u2019s employment. Both Fireman\u2019s and Harleysville denied coverage for James\u2019s claims. They did not participate in negotiating the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">This lawsuit which focused on coverage for the $4.15 million judgment ensued. The action was for declaratory relief to determine the various insurance companies\u2019 rights and responsibilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and to allocate the settlement amount and defense costs in the underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The Law Division judge held that, under the employers\u2019 liability policy, Harleysville had been obligated to indemnify and provide a defense to Click and North American with respect to James\u2019s LAD claims. However, the judge also found that the overall settlement was unreasonable, collusive and unenforceable against Harleysville. In her final judgment, the judge dismissed all claims against Harleysville, with one exception; Harleysville was held to a duty to reimburse Lumbermens for twenty-five percent of the defense costs ($11,500) it incurred in the underlying litigation in which James claimed damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">James appeals, claiming the judge erred in refusing to enforce the settlement against Harleysville. Harleysville cross-appeals, claiming the judge erred in holding it was obligated to indemnify and provide a defense to Click and North American with respect to James\u2019s LAD claims. We affirm on the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">For about nineteen months, between July 1995 and February 1997, James worked as an office manager for Click and North American, in a two-room office located in Ocean City, Cape May County, New Jersey. Imbesi, who for many years had run his family\u2019s soft-drink business (the Imbesi Bottling Group), founded and ran both Click and North American, which engaged in the business of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing soft-drink beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Click and North American were small, closely-held corporations. During the period of James\u2019s employment, Imbesi was the president, sole shareholder, and sole director of Click. He was the president, majority shareholder, and sole director of North American. In various documents, Imbesi\u2019s wife, Patricia, was identified as secretary and treasurer of Click and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers were identified as officers and directors of Click. Imbesi admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>that his wife played only a limited role at Click, and his brothers played no role at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Imbesi had no superiors at either Click or North American. His subordinate employees consisted of James, Dennis King, and James Burns. While James worked in Ocean City, King and Burns were located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The record reflects substantial overlap in the operations of the two corporations. For example, although James, King, and Burns performed services for both Click and North American, they were paid only by Click. The companies shared office space, but only Click paid rent, in the amount of $1 per year, to another of Imbesi\u2019s companies. Funds from one company were used to finance the operations of the other. There is also some indication that Imbesi may have commingled his personal and business accounts, using funds from personal accounts to pay corporate expenses and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">I-A. <em>James\u2019s Allegations of Sexual Harassment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">During the course of James\u2019s employment, neither Click nor North American had a written policy against sexual harassment. Nor did they maintain written employment manuals or guidelines relating to the treatment of sexual harassment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">James alleged that during the entire period of her employment at Click and North American, Imbesi made sexual comments to her, exposed his genitalia to her, touched her in a sexual manner, and demanded sexual favors from her. When she rejected his advances, Imbesi became verbally abusive, but he continued to sexually harass and proposition her.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">James also alleged that, in about September 1995, two months after her hiring date, she began a sexual relationship with Imbesi. Their sexual activities occurred both in the office and elsewhere. James claimed this relationship was actually coercive; she participated in it only out of fear of losing her job and of Imbesi\u2019s potential violence towards her. She alleged that, on occasions when she temporarily ended the relationship, Imbesi became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>verbally abusive, and his demands for sexual favors were imposed in an increasingly threatening manner. Most significantly, James alleged that one day in December 1996, after driving her home, Imbesi forced his way into her home and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">James also alleged that Imbesi directly tied her participation in their sexual relationship to her compensation and continued employment at Click and North American. For example, James alleged that: (1) in May or June 1996, when she threatened to end the relationship, Imbesi threatened her with the loss of employment and stock options; (2) in July 1996, Imbesi refused to give her the paycheck until she performed sexually; (3) in October 1996, when she told Imbesi she was leaving the company because she \u201ccould not take it anymore,\u201d Imbesi told her she could not leave; and (4) in October or November 1996, when she refused Imbesi\u2019s sexual demands, he withheld her paycheck and said he would have to review her salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Finally, James alleged that in February 1997 she was diagnosed with genital herpes, contracting the disease from Imbesi in the fall of 1996. According to James, Imbesi knew he had herpes but never told her. Except on one occasion, he did not wear a condom when they had sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">James did not receive health insurance through her employment with Click and North American. She claimed that, when she asked Imbesi to pay her medical bills, he demanded that she perform sexual favors in return, which she did out of desperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Finally, James alleged that, as a result of Imbesi\u2019s abuse, she suffered from severe anxiety, panic attacks, and herpes outbreaks which were painful, humiliating, disruptive of her present marriage, and created risks for complications during any future pregnancy or childbirth. James admitted, however, that she had suffered from emotional problems before meeting Imbesi.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">For his part, Imbesi admitted having a sexual relationship with James; he claimed it was entirely consensual. Imbesi specifically denied demanding sex in exchange for compensation. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>he admitted making personal loans to James. Supporting Imbesi\u2019s claim of a consensual relationship are several personal cards and notes James gave to him during the course of her employment with Click and North American.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">As to the issue of venereal disease, Imbesi admitted: he contracted genital herpes in the 1980\u2019s; he was aware of his infection during his relationship with James; and he did not advise James that he had the disease. However, Imbesi claimed: he did not believe he was contagious when he was asymptomatic; he was unaware he had subjected James to the possibility of contracting herpes, presumably because he did not have a herpes outbreak during the period of her employment; and he never intended to infect her with the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Imbesi also admitted using company funds to pay James\u2019s medical bills. However, he claimed he did so to fulfill a promise he made to her when she began working with the companies. Imbesi denied demanding sex in exchange for these medical payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">I-B. <em>Imbesi\u2019s History of Workplace Sexual Harassment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Between November 1981 and May 1995, Imbesi was employed as president of the 7-Up Bottling Company of Philadelphia, the parent company of his family\u2019s soft-drink bottling business. During that period, Imbesi was twice accused of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">First, in 1986, Kimberly Flavin, a receptionist at the 7-Up Bottling Company in Virginia Beach, Virginia, filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Flavin complained that she had been sexually harassed by Imbesi, and fired from her job because she refused Imbesi\u2019s sexual advances. That case was settled before any litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Second, in 1995, Deborah Goodwin, an account manager with the 7-Up Bottling Company of Philadelphia, filed a sexual harassment complaint against Imbesi in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission followed by a complaint in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Goodwin claimed Imbesi continually made comments of a sexual nature to her, propositioned her, touched her in a sexually offensive maimer, and punished her for refusing his sexual demands. She claimed the harassment resulted in her constructive discharge, when she resigned because she could no longer withstand Imbesi\u2019s abuse. Imbesi denied Goodwin\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing. However, a jury returned a verdict in Goodwin\u2019s favor for more than $2 million. In unreported decisions, the court reduced Goodwin\u2019s award to $425,041, representing $325,041 in compensatory damages, and $100,000 in punitive damages, the applicable punitive damages cap under Title VII. <em>Goodwin v. Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Philadelphia, </em>1998 <em>WL </em>438488 (E.D.Pa. July 31, 1998); <em>Goodwin v. Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Philadelphia, </em>1998 <em>U.S. Dist. LEXIS </em>11853 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 3, 1998). The ease eventually settled for $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Over the years, Imbesi also had sexual affairs with other female subordinates. One of those affairs resulted in the birth of a son, as well as a 1995 restraining order against Imbesi in Vermont, based upon an allegation that he had been physically abusive towards the woman and child.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">I-C. <em>James\u2019s Sexual Harassment Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">1. <em>Causes of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In April 1997, about two months after she resigned, James filed a complaint against Click, North American, Imbesi, and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Federal Action). James alleged the following causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\"><em>Counts One and Two: </em>quid pro quo and hostile work environment sexual harassment, contrary to the LAD, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\"><em>Count Three: </em>gender-motivated violence, contrary to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), 42 U.S.C.A \u00a7 13981;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\"><em>Count Four: </em>assault and battery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\"><em>Counts Five and Six: </em>negligent and intentional transmission of a venereal disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\"><em>Counts Seven and Eight: </em>negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Count Nine: </em>negligent supervision and retention of Imbesi;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\"><em>Count Ten: </em>unlawful retaliation for James\u2019s refusal to testify falsely on Imbesi\u2019s behalf in the <em>Goodwin </em>litigation, ultimately resulting in her constructive discharge, contrary to the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\"><em>Count Eleven: </em>wrongful discharge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\"><em>Counts Tvjelve and Thirteen: </em>conspiracy to deprive James of her civil rights as a prospective witness in the <em>Goodwin </em>litigation, contrary to 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1985(2) and 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">James alleged that Click and North American were the \u201calter egos\u201d of Imbesi and his brothers, and that each defendant should be held jointly and severally liable. She also claimed that defendants were directly liable for their own misconduct, and vicariously liable for Imbesi\u2019s misdeeds. James sought compensatory damages for lost earnings, physical and psychological injuries, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Imbesi retained Dilworth Paxson (Dilworth) to defend him in the Federal Action. All defendants filed motions to dismiss. By memorandum decision and order dated January 27, 1998, the court: (1) dismissed with prejudice the claims under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1985(2) and \u00a7 1986 as against all defendants; and (2) dismissed without prejudice the majority of state law claims against Click, North American, Imbesi, and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims. After this decision and order, the only remaining claims in the Federal Action were against Imbesi for: (1) gender-motivated violence contrary to the VAWA (Count Three); and (2) assault and battery (Count Four).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">About six months later, on August 5, 1998 James commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, by filing a civil summons and jury demand (Philadelphia Action). The named defendants were the same as in the Federal Action: Click, North American, Imbesi, and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers. James later provided Imbesi, Click, and North American with a draft copy of a complaint she intended to file in the Philadelphia Action, in which she asserted those claims over which the federal court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. James, however, never actually filed a complaint in the Philadelphia Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>2. <em>The Settlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Throughout the course of this litigation and even before this litigation began, the parties engaged in settlement discussions. On August 25, 1998 a settlement conference was held before federal Magistrate Judge Peter B. Scuderi.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On November 9, 1998 the parties agreed to a tentative settlement, contingent upon their obtaining permission for the Philadelphia Action to proceed under seal and using pseudonyms. The parties filed a joint petition requesting this relief. Also pursuant to the tentative settlement, the defendants filed a writ of summons in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, against Fireman\u2019s, American Motorists, Lumbermens, and Harleysville, seeking a declaration that the insurance carriers were obligated to defend and indemnify them with respect to any costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, settlements, judgments, or monetary awards arising from or relating to the Philadelphia Action. Finally, also pursuant to this tentative settlement, on November 30, 1998 the federal court dismissed the remaining claims against Imbesi, those for assault and battery and violation of VAWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On December 16, 1998 James declared the tentative settlement null and void, because the parties had been unable to obtain an order permitting the Philadelphia Action to proceed under seal. James then filed a motion in federal court, seeking to vacate the dismissal of her claims, which the court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Despite the collapse of the tentative settlement, the parties continued to engage in settlement discussions in which American Motorists and Lumbermens participated. Although advised of these discussions, Harleysville chose not to participate. Settlement conferences were held before Judge Scuderi on January 19 and 25, 1999 at which Harleysville did not appear. Pursuant to these discussions, and with the federal court\u2019s approval, on January 25, 1999 James filed an amended complaint in the Federal Action, in which she reasserted all the claims from her original complaint, except the claims under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1985(2) and 1986, which had been dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>After considering the submissions of James\u2019s counsel and representations made by counsel at the January 25, 1999 settlement conference, Judge Scuderi stated in terse, conclusory letters dated February 8 and 9, 1999 (Appendices B and C) that $4.15 million constituted a reasonable settlement figure for the case, in exchange for a consent judgment in plaintiffs favor on Counts I(LAD), II(LAD), V (negligent transmission of a venereal disease), and VII (negligent infliction of emotional distress) of the amended complaint, and dismissal, with prejudice, of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In February 1999, James entered into a confidential settlement agreement (Settlement or Settlement Agreement) with: (1) defendants Imbesi, Click, and North American; (2) insurers, American Motorists and Lumbermens; and (3) Patricia Imbesi (Imbesi\u2019s wife). Imbesi executed the agreement on behalf of himself, Click, and North American. Imbesi\u2019s three brothers entered into a separate settlement agreement with James, Click, North American, American Motorists, and Lumbermens.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The Settlement Agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">(1) A Consent Judgment would be entered in the Federal Action, in favor of James, against Imbesi, Click, and North American, jointly and severally, in the amount of $4.15 million, on the LAD sexual harassment claims (Counts One and Two), the claim of negligent transmission of a venereal disease (Count Five), and the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count VII). No part of the $4.15 million would be deemed attributable to James\u2019s claim for punitive damages. Payment of the $4.15 million would be structured as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">(a) Imbesi, Click, and North American agreed to pay James $550,000. They also agreed to assign to James their rights to prosecute and recover from the \u201cNon-Settling Insurers,\u201d Fireman\u2019s and Harleysville, any amounts attributable to the Federal and Philadelphia Actions. Finally, they guaranteed James payment of an additional $150,000, payable in full within two years of the Settlement, if, as of that date, James had received no money from the Non-Settling Insurers. However, James agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>reimburse Imbesi, Click, and North American for this \u201cguarantee payment,\u201d depending upon the amount she eventually received from the Non-Settling Insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">(b) American Motorists and Lumbermens agreed to pay James $200,000. They also guaranteed payment of an additional $100,000, payable in full within two years, if, as of that date, James had received no money from the Non-Settling insurers, Fireman\u2019s and Harleysville. However, James agreed to reimburse American Motorists and Lumbermens for this \u201cguarantee payment,\u201d depending upon, the amount she eventually received from the Non-Settling Insurers; and</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(c) Dilworth was retained to represent Imbesi, Click, North American, and James in an action against the Non-Settling Insurers, seeking, among other things: (1) attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with the Federal Action, the Philadelphia Action, and the declaratory judgment action; (2) the up-front payments of $750,000, made to settle the dismissed claims; (3) the guarantee payments of $250,000; (4) the remaining $3.15 million of the total Settlement amount; and (5) damages for bad faith, for failing to.settle James\u2019s claims within the policy limits, and failing to defend Imbesi, Click, and North American against James\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">(2) James agreed to dismiss with prejudice the remaining claims in her Federal Action, and in her Philadelphia Action, and release all other claims and causes of action she might have against Imbesi, Click, North American, American Motorists, and Lumbermens.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">(3) Imbesi, Click, and North American agreed to dismiss, without prejudice, their declaratory judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, and release all claims against James, American Motorists, and Lumbermens.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The parties agreed that the Settlement was fair, reasonable, and made in good faith, based upon their competing estimates of James\u2019s injuries, and the potential for liability on her claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Pursuant to the Settlement, on March 5, 1999 the parties stipulated to a judgment in James\u2019s favor on Counts One, Two, Five, and Seven of the complaint, and to the dismissal with prejudice of the remaining counts. In a separate, and again a terse, conclusory documentation of \u201cfindings,\u201d also dated March 5, 1999, Judge Seuderi found that the Settlement was fair and reasonable, and was entered into in good faith (Appendix D). By order dated March 9, 1999 the federal court sealed and impounded the case record and by order dated March 17, 1999 the federal court dismissed the case in accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation. Finally, also pursuant to the Settlement, James voluntarily dismissed the Philadelphia County Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">I-D. <em>Insurance Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">1. <em>Fireman\u2019s</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">During an eight-month period of James\u2019s employment, between June 1996 and February 1997, Imbesi was insured under a Homeowner\u2019s Policy issued by Fireman\u2019s, which had an effective coverage date of between June 25, 1996 and June 25, 1997. When advised of James\u2019s Federal Action, Fireman\u2019s initially agreed to provide Imbesi with a defense. Fireman\u2019s asserted, however, that the majority of the claims fell outside the scope of its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Following the federal court\u2019s January 27,1998 order, dismissing the majority of James\u2019s claims, Fireman\u2019s withdrew its defense, taking the position that the remaining claims, for assault, battery, and gender-motivated violence under the VAWA, were not covered under its policy. Fireman\u2019s also denied coverage with respect to the subsequent Philadelphia Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">2. <em>American Motorists</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">During a fourteen-month period of James\u2019s employment, between July 1995 and September 1996, North American and Click were named insureds under the following policies issued by American Motorists: (1) Commercial General Liability Policy, effective September 8, 1994 to September 8, 1995; (2) Commercial General Liability Policy, effective September 20, 1995 to September 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>1996; and (3) Excess Liability Policy, effective June 13, 1995 to September 20, 1996. American Motorists denied coverage for James\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">3. <em>Lumbermens</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">For a fourteen-month period of James\u2019s employment, between July 1995 and September 1996, North American and Click were named insureds under a workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability policy issued by Lumbermens, effective June 13, 1995 to September 20, 1996. By letter dated May 29, 1997 Lumbermens stated it would provide a defense and potential indemnification for Click and North American under this policy, with respect to James\u2019s claims of sexual harassment under the LAD (Counts One and Two), and her claims of negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress (Counts Seven and Nine). However, Lumbermens denied coverage for: James\u2019s additional claimed causes of action; any claims involving intentional conduct; punitive damages; and non-bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">4. <em>Harleysville</em></p>\n<p id=\"AzG\">a. <em>The Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">During a five-month portion of James\u2019s employment, between September 20, 1996 and February 1997, Click and North American were covered by the following insurance policies issued by Harleysville, which had coverage dates of September 20, 1996 to September 20,1997:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">(1) <em>Commercial General Liability Policy. </em>This policy excluded from coverage all employment-related injuries, and all injuries arising from employment practices. The policy covered executive officers and directors, such as Imbesi, but only with respect to their official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">(2) <em>Commercial Blanket Excess Liability Policy. </em>This policy excluded from coverage all employment-related injuries, and all injuries arising from employment practices. Executive officers, directors, and stockholders, such as Imbesi, were covered, but only while acting within the scope of their official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>(3) <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Policy. </em>This policy insured only North American and Click. It did not insure officers, directors, or shareholders of the corporations, such as Imbesi. The Workers\u2019 Compensation portion of the policy covered accidental bodily injuries, or diseases caused or aggravated by the conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The Employers\u2019 Liability portion of the policy covered accidental bodily injuries arising out of and in the course of the injured employee\u2019s employment, and bodily injury by disease caused or aggravated by the conditions of employment. Under Exclusion C5, the Employers\u2019 Liability Policy excluded from coverage damages for \u201cbodily injury <em>intentionally </em>caused or aggravated\u201d by the insured (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In addition, under Exclusion C7, the Employers\u2019 Liability Policy excluded from coverage \u201cdamages arising out of coercion, criticism, demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination against or termination of any employee, or any personnel practices, policies, acts or omissions.\u201d Under <em>Schmidt v. Smith, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014 (1998), Exclusion C7 was void as against public policy to the extent it purported to deny coverage for bodily injuries arising from the conduct described, including emotional injuries accompanied by physical manifestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">b. <em>Harleysville\u2019s Denial of Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Even before James commenced the Federal Action, Dilworth advised Harleysville of James\u2019s allegations, and requested coverage. After having reviewed a draft copy of James\u2019s complaint, in a letter dated March 31,1997 Harleysville advised Dilworth that it was denying coverage under the Commercial General Liability Policy and the Commercial Blanket Excess Liability Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">In letters written after the Federal Action had been filed, Dilworth again requested coverage from Harleysville. In two letters dated December 30,1997 one addressed to North American and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers and the second addressed to Click <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>and Imbesi, Harleysville denied all coverage for James\u2019s claims in the Federal Action, with the exception of James\u2019s claims that: (1) North American and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers should be held vicariously liable for Imbesi\u2019s misconduct; and (2) North American and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers were negligent in their supervision of Imbesi. As to these two claims, Harleysville agreed to provide a defense to North American and Imbesi\u2019s three brothers, under the Commercial General Liability Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">However, Harleysville denied indemnity under all three of its policies. Harleysville denied coverage under the Employers\u2019 Liability Policy on the basis of Exclusion C5, for intentional conduct, and Exclusion C7, for damages arising out of \u201ccoercion, ... discipline, ... harassment, humiliation, discrimination against or termination of any employee or any personnel practices, policies, acts, or omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Harleysville denied coverage to Imbesi, individually, because he was alleged to have engaged in intentional misconduct. Harleysville denied coverage to Click and North American because they were allegedly Imbesi\u2019s alter ego. Harleysville denied coverage to Imbesi\u2019s three brothers to the extent they participated in, ratified, or acquiesced in Imbesi\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Harleysville further stated that the insureds\u2019 failure to provide relevant disclosures regarding Imbesi\u2019s pre-policy conduct, as referenced in James\u2019s complaint, could amount to misrepresentations sufficient to void the policies altogether, and to exclude all coverage that might otherwise apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Finally, Harleysville disclaimed liability for James\u2019s damages, other than those resulting from unintentional bodily injuries, which occurred in employment-related activities, during the time period the policies were in effect. In this regard, Harleysville stated its belief that James\u2019s damages arose from a single course of conduct, commencing prior to the policy period. Therefore, none of her damage claims were covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>After receipt of the January 27, 1998 opinion and order in the Federal Action, which dismissed the majority of James\u2019s claims, Harleysville advised that it would not provide Click or Imbesi with a defense or indemnification as to the remaining causes of action, <em>i.e., </em>assault and battery, and gender-motivated violence contrary to the VAWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">After James filed the Philadelphia Action, Dilworth made additional requests for coverage, advising Harleysville of the new litigation, and the parties\u2019 settlement discussions. In October 1998, James\u2019s counsel also wrote to the various insurance carriers, advising them of the tentative settlement of the Federal and Philadelphia Actions, and asking if they had any objections to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Harleysville responded to James\u2019s counsel by stating it was in the process of evaluating insurance coverage issues relating to the Philadelphia Action. Harleysville objected to unilateral settlement of that lawsuit. It also requested a copy of the proposed settlement agreement which Dilworth agreed to provide only if Harleysville agreed to maintain its confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">By letter dated November 11,1998 Harleysville denied coverage with respect to the Philadelphia Action. In a letter dated December 4, 1998 Harleysville provided the reasons for its denial of coverage, which largely mirrored the reasons given in its three previous denial letters, relating to the Federal Action. Harleysville also declined invitations to participate in the parties\u2019 continuing settlement discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">c. <em>Harleysville\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">On December 11, 1998 Harleysville filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, naming as defendants: North American; Click; Imbesi; Imbesi\u2019s three brothers; Fireman\u2019s; American Motorists; and Lumbermens. Harleysville sought a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to provide a defense or indemnification to Click, North American, Imbesi, or Imbesi\u2019s three brothers with respect to James\u2019s claims in her Federal and Philadelphia Actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>After the Settlement, on March 26, 1999 Harleysville filed an amended complaint in its declaratory judgment action: (1) adding James as a defendant; and adding alternative claims that (2) the Settlement was not made in good faith, was unreasonable, and was the product of collusion, and Harleysville had no obligation to pay any portion of the settlement amount, and (3) if coverage were found, Harleysville was entitled to contribution from, or indemnification by, American Motorists, Lumbermens, and Fireman\u2019s. Harleysville\u2019s Pennsylvania declaratory judgment action eventually was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A. <em>The Parties and Their Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Fireman\u2019s commenced the present litigation on November 17, 1998, prior to the Settlement of the Federal and Philadelphia Actions, and prior to Harleysville\u2019s declaratory judgment action in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In its original complaint, Fireman\u2019s named as defendants Imbesi, American Motorists, Lumbermens, and Harleysville, and sought: (1) a declaratory judgment that the homeowner\u2019s policy it had issued to Imbesi did not provide coverage for James\u2019s claims; or (2) alternatively, should coverage be found to exist, indemnification from American Motorist, Lumbermens, and Harleysville. On February 11, 1999 after the Settlement, Fireman\u2019s filed an amended complaint, adding Click, North American, and James as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Imbesi, Click, North American, and James answered Fireman\u2019s amended complaint, denying that Fireman\u2019s was entitled to the relief it sought. Imbesi and James also asserted counterclaims against Fireman\u2019s: (1) seeking a declaratory judgment that the homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage for James\u2019s claims; (2) alleging breach of contract and bad faith refusal to indemnify and settle James\u2019s claims; and (3) seeking an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Imbesi also asserted a counterclaim against Fireman\u2019s, alleging bad faith refusal to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Imbesi, Click, North American, and James also asserted cross-claims against Harleysville: (1) seeking a declaratory judgment the policies issued by Harleysville provided coverage for James\u2019s claims; (2) alleging breach of contract and bad faith refusal to settle or indemnify; and (3) seeking an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Imbesi, Click, and North American also cross-claimed against Harleysville alleging bad faith refusal to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">American Motorists and Lumbermens separately answered Fireman\u2019s amended complaint, denying any obligation to provide coverage for James\u2019s claims, except as provided under the terms of the Settlement. Lumbermens also asserted a cross-claim against Harleysville, seeking contribution as to the defense costs incurred in the underlying litigation. Harleysville denied liability on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Harleysville then filed an amended answer to Fireman\u2019s amended complaint, and to the cross-claims asserted by Imbesi, Click, North American, James, and Lumbermens. Harleysville continued to deny liability on the claims asserted against it. Harleysville also asserted a counter-claim against Fireman\u2019s, and cross-claims against American Motorists, Lumbermens, Imbesi, Click, North American, and James, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to provide coverage for James\u2019s claims, or, alternatively, seeking indemnification from the other insurance companies. Harleysville also filed amended cross-claims against Imbesi, Click, North American, and James.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">B. <em>Summary Judgment Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In February 2001, Fireman\u2019s, American Motorists, and Harleysville, moved for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of all claims against them. At the same time, Imbesi, Click, North American, and James moved for partial summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor on Counts One and Two of their cross-claim against Harleysville, for declaratory judgment and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>By oral decision and order dated March 1, 2001, the judge granted Fireman\u2019s summary judgment motion, and dismissed all claims against it. Also on March 1, 2001 the judge denied both Harleysville and American Motorists\u2019 summary judgment motions, and granted, in part, the summary judgment motion filed by Imbesi, Click, North American, and James. The judge orally held that, under <em>Schmidt, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014, Harleysville had a duty to both defend and indemnify Click and North American, with respect to James\u2019s sexual harassment claims under the LAD, to the extent the alleged harassment resulted in bodily injuries. That duty arose under Harleysville\u2019s Employers\u2019 Liability Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Harleysville moved for reconsideration and also moved for a ruling it was not estopped from challenging the enforceability of the Settlement, and seeking apportionment of reasonable defense costs. After hearing oral argument, the judge entered separate orders dated May 2, 2001:(1) denying Harleysville\u2019s motion for reconsideration; but holding that (2) Harleysville was not es-topped from challenging any aspect of the Settlement; and (3) Harleysville was required to reimburse Lumbermens for no more than twenty-five percent of reasonable defense costs incurred by Lumbermens in defending Click and North American in the underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">On May 22, 2001 Harleysville moved for leave to appeal from the judge\u2019s orders denying its motion for summary judgment, and its motion for reconsideration. This court and the Supreme Court denied the motions for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On June 14, 2001 upon further consideration of Harleysville\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge granted partial summary judgment in favor of Harleysville, holding that Harleysville was not liable for the defense costs of Imbesi, Click, and North American, and dismissing these parties\u2019 cross-claims against Harleysville. However, the judge maintained her earlier holding that Harleysville was obligated to reimburse Lumbermens for twenty-five percent of the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs Lumber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>mens incurred in defending Click and North American in the underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On June 22, 2001 Harleysville filed another motion for summary judgment. This time, Harleysville sought: (1) judgment that the Settlement was unreasonable, collusive, and not entered into in good faith; and (2) dismissal of all remaining claims against it. In support of this motion, Harleysville submitted, among other things, an expert report from John J. Gibbons, Esq., former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. (See Appendix A.) Judge Gibbons reasoned that the Settlement, although summarily approved by Judge Seuderi, was unreasonable because: (1) it was based upon inadmissible net opinions of attorneys, and not upon an evaluation of the competing evidence relating to the'likelihood of James\u2019s success on the merits and her alleged damages; and (2) it did not represent a good faith compromise on the part of James, because the Settlement amount of $4.15 million exceeded any settlement or verdict ever reported in any New Jersey case involving sexual harassment or negligent transmission of a venereal disease, exceeded the verdict in the <em>Goodwin </em>litigation, and most likely exceeded the amount James could have recovered and sustained had the case been tried to a jury. Judge Gibbons stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">24. In sum, it is my opinion that the settlement reached in the James litigation is not reasonable because it does not represent a good faith comprise of James\u2019s claims and there was an insufficient record upon which Magistrate Judge Seuderi could approve the settlement. Clearly, the amount of the consent judgment would not have been considered by the parties were the insurance companies not the responsible entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On July 2, 2001 the judge entered an amended scheduling order. As it relates to the present appeal, the judge ordered that a jury trial would be limited to the issue of James\u2019s compensatory damages, the category of damages for which James had settled, and the appropriate allocation of such damages \u201cbetween and among the defendants.\u201d Thereafter, on July 20, 2001 the judge granted partial summary judgment in favor of Harleysville, declaring that the Settlement was unreasonable. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>judge denied the portion of Harleysville\u2019s motion that requested dismissal of all claims against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Harleysville moved for reconsideration of both the July 2 and , July 20, 2001 orders which the judge denied. Harleysville also moved for leave to appeal, which both this court and the Supreme Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On October 10, 2001 Click and North American moved to compel James to file a pleading, setting forth all claims she intended to present against Imbesi, Click, and North American, including a prayer for relief. In response, James filed a cross-claim against Click and North American, asserting claims of quid pro quo and hostile work environment sexual harassment under the LAD, the only claims as to which the court found insurance coverage, which Click and North American moved to dismiss based upon the terms of the Settlement. Harleysville also moved to dismiss James\u2019s cross-claim, under <em>R. </em>4:6 \u2014 4(b)(1), on the grounds that it was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">During oral argument on October 26, 2001 the judge initially indicated an intent to deny the motions to dismiss James\u2019s cross-claims. However, the court reserved judgment in order to consider the effect of our decision in <em>Pasha v. Rosemount Mem\u2019l Park, Inc., </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 781 A.2d 1119 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>42, 791 A.2d 221 (2002), decided just ten days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In an oral decision on January 18, 2002 based upon <em>Pasha, </em>the judge ruled that the Settlement was unenforceable against Harleysville as unreasonable and collusive. This ruling had the effect of: (1) foreclosing any recovery by Imbesi, Click, North American and James on their cross-claims against Harleysville; and (2) granting judgment in favor of Harleysville on its cross-claims against the other co-defendants, with the exception of the partial summary judgment which had been entered in favor of Lumbermens on the issue of defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>In accordance with her January 18, 2002 oral decision, and her earlier decision regarding the allocation of defense costs, in an order dated January 31, 2002, the judge: (1) directed that Harleysville reimburse Lumbermens in the amount of $11,400, representing twenty-five percent of the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred in defending the underlying litigation; and (2) vacated the orders of July 20 and August 31, 2001, entered summary judgment in favor of Harleysville, and consistent therewith, dismissed with prejudice all remaining claims and cross-claims asserted by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">James filed a timely notice of appeal and Harleysville filed a timely notice of cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">As the sole issue in her appeal, James contends the judge erred in refusing to enforce the Settlement against Harleysville, based upon her findings that the Settlement was unreasonable and collusive. She urges, alternatively, if we decline to hold that the Settlement is reasonable as a matter of law the case be remanded for a plenary hearing on the issue of reasonableness, before a different judge. James now contends Judge Cooper has prejudged this issue. If, after such a hearing, the judge finds the Settlement amount unreasonable, then James contends a trial should be held on the merits of her sexual harassment claims under the LAD, the amount of her compensatory damages, and the portion of those damages which Harleysville should be held liable to pay. James contends, however, that no damages should be allocated between and among Imbesi, Click, and North American.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">A. <em>Standard of Legal Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">This issue was decided on summary judgment. Our standard of review is the same as that of the trial judge\u2019s. <em>Sojourner A. ex rel. Y.A. v.

However, if the evidence is \u201c \u2018so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law,\u2019 \u201d then summary judgment must be granted. <em>Brill, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146, quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>242, 252, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2505, 2512, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>202, 214 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The applicable law is well-established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cWhere an insurer -wrongfully refuses coverage and a defense to its insured, so that the insured is obliged to defend himself in an action later held to be covered by the policy, the insurer is liable for the amount of the judgment obtained against the insured or of the settlement made by him. <em>The only qualifications to this rule are that the amount paid in settlement be reasonable and that the payment be made in good faith.\"</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\"><em>[Griggs v.

Rather, under <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-68, 443 A.2d 163, the judge should deny enforcement if either of those conditions exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The New Jersey case upon which James relies does not support her argument on this point. <em>See Battista v. W. World Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Inc., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 146-51, 545 A.2d 841 (Law Div.1988) (refusing to enforce settlement that was unreasonable in amount, but made in good faith) <em>aff'd in relevant part, and rev\u2019d in part sub. nom, Battista v.

The only case James cites which is supportive of her argument comes from another jurisdiction. This case is unpersuasive in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s explicit, contrary holding in <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-68, 443 A.2d 163. <em>Alton M. Johnson Co. v. M.A.I. Co., </em>463 N.W.2d 277, 279-80 (Minn.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The insurer bears the ultimate burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. The insurer is not liable if the settlement is either unreasonable, or was reached in bad faith. <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 365-68, 443 A.2d 163. The insured, however, bears the initial burden of production or the burden to produce evidence to support the reasonable and good faith nature of the settlement. The insured is presumed to possess all essential information necessary to make such a determination. <em>Id. </em>at 367-68, 443 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">1. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The judge held that the Settlement amount was unreasonable on its face, to the extent Harleysville was obligated to pay at least $3.15 million of the $4.15 million Settlement figure. The judge found that reasonable minds could not differ on this issue. She concluded that summary judgment was appropriate, and a plenary hearing was unnecessary. As a result of this finding, and her additional finding that the Settlement was collusive, the judge denied enforcement of the Settlement against Harleysville and entered judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">James claims the court\u2019s determination of unreasonableness was incorrect. James\u2019s primary contention is that without a finding that Judge Scuderi abused his discretion in approving the Settlement, the judge in New Jersey is bound by his finding that the Settlement amount was reasonable. For this argument, James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>primarily relies upon federal court decisions involving the review of class-action settlements, a review required under <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>23(e). James\u2019s argument misapprehends the applicable law and is based upon faulty logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Under <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-68, 443 A.2d 163, it is the court\u2019s obligation to conduct an independent review of the Settlement in order to determine whether it is reasonable and made in good faith. <em>See also, Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Hempel, </em>4 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>703 (10th Cir.2001) (mere fact that judge approved settlement is insufficient to render it reasonable). Here, there are at least two ways in which the Settlement amount is unreasonable on its face: (1) the entire $4.15 million is attributed to James\u2019s compensatory damages, with none allocated to punitive damages; and (2) Harleysville is deemed liable disproportionately to pay, at the very least, seventy-six percent of the Settlement-amount, $3.15 million, and perhaps even the entire Settlement amount of $4.15 million, even though Harleysville insured Click and North American for only five of James\u2019s nineteen months of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The judge could find these particular aspects of the Settlement amount unreasonable without questioning Judge Seuderi\u2019s more general eonclusory finding that the overall $4.15 million constituted \u201ca reasonable settlement figure\u201d for James\u2019s LAD claims, and her claims for negligent transmission of a venereal disease and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Judge Scuderi did not find that $4.15 million represented a reasonable evaluation of James\u2019s compensatory damages. As discussed at 40-to-45 post, the parties never presented Judge Scuderi with the evidence necessary to make such a conclusion. We conclude it extremely doubtful that such a conclusion could ever be reached under the circumstances .of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In addition, Judge Scuderi never found that assigning Harleysville liability for $3.15 million of the $4.15 million Settlement amount, or even potentially the entire $4.15 million, was reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>able. We conclude it extremely doubtful that such a finding could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Judge Scuderi found only, and very generally, that the parties\u2019 proposed settlement agreement constituted \u201ca reasonable and good faith resolution of the difficult issues in this case.\u201d There is no conflict between that very general finding, and a specific finding by this court that the Settlement amount is quite unreasonable in its particular context and allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Our grounds for concluding that the Settlement amount is unreasonable substantially overlap with our bases for concluding that the Settlement was collusive and made in bad faith. <em>See Midwestern Indem. Co. v. Laikin, </em>119 F.Supp.2d 831, 843 (S.D.Ind.2000) (issues of bad faith or collusion closely related to issue of reasonableness of settlement amount, and evidence often overlaps). We discuss these points now and we find the Settlement unreasonable on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">2. <em>jBad Faith and Collusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">In addition to finding the Settlement unreasonable, the judge found the Settlement \u201cunconscionable.\u201d The judge explained that her finding of unconscionability meant that the Settlement was \u201cbeyond unreasonable,\u201d and entailed \u201ca collusive aspect\u201d such as to meet the standard of unreasonableness and bad faith set forth in <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-68, 443 A.2d 163. James contends this finding was also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">We recently addressed the issues of bad faith and collusiveness in the context of finding a settlement agreement unenforceable against an insurance company. <em>Pasha, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 781 A.2d 1119. In <em>Pasha, </em>plaintiffs were the five surviving children of Dorthea Coleman. During Coleman\u2019s burial, her casket tilted while being lowered into the grave and it fell to the bottom. When the casket was retrieved, water had seeped into the structure. After being \u201creconditioned,\u201d Coleman\u2019s body was buried at a different site. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 781 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The plaintiffs sued the cemetery, Rosemount, seeking damages for emotional distress resulting from mishandling a corpse. Rose-mount notified its insurance company of the claim and the company denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The plaintiffs and Rosemount then entered into a settlement agreement in the amount of $500,000. Rosemount agreed to pay $30,000, and assigned to plaintiffs its rights against its insurance company. The plaintiffs agreed to pay Rosemount one-third of the amount they recovered against the insurance company, up to a maximum of the $30,000 Rosemount had paid to settle. Pursuant to the settlement, a consent judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs against Rosemount.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The parties agreed that Rosemount\u2019s $30,000 payment, and the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement to repay that amount if they were successful in their suit against the insurance company, would be kept confidential. No similar confidentiality agreement was entered into with respect to the $500,000 nominal settlement amount, which plaintiffs intended to make public, to serve as a \u201cwake-up call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-54, 781 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On a motion for summary judgment, the judge entered judgment in favor of the insurance company, finding the settlement collusive. <em>Id. </em>at 354-55, 781 A.2d 1119. We affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 355-59, 781 A.2d 1119. We held that the plaintiffs had not satisfied their burden under <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-68, 443 A.2d 163, to produce evidence that the settlement agreement was reasonable in amount and entered into in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 356-59, 443 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">To satisfy their burden of production, the plaintiffs in <em>Pasha </em>had submitted: (1) a certification from their own attorney; (2) a certification from Rosemount\u2019s attorney; and (3) a certification from an expert that the settlement was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 356-57, 781 A.2d 1119. We faulted the attorneys for failing to identify the factors they took into consideration in the settlement of the case, or the factors which ordinarily affect such cases in general, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>failing to discuss the plaintiffs damages or injuries, physical, psychological or otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 781 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We also faulted the expert for concluding that the settlement was reasonable, without giving a proper explanation based upon the facts of the case. The expert noted only that the settlement was reasonable: (1) in light of the \u201cextremely wide range of sustainable verdicts and even greater range of reasonable settlements\u201d; (2) the fact that the case would be tried in Essex County, where \u201cjuries tend to award higher verdicts than juries elsewhere in all types of cases\u201d; and (3) the plaintiffs shared the ethnic characteristics of those who might be expected to serve as jurors. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We found that the attorney and expert certifications contained \u201cnothing but guesswork and unsupported anecdotal references.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 781 A.2d 1119. These were \u201cwholly insufficient to satisfy [the plaintiffs\u2019] burden under <em>Griggs.\u201d Ibid. </em>In finding collusion, we also relied upon the terms of the settlement agreement. We emphasized the disparity between the amount paid by Rosemount to the plaintiffs, just $30,000, with the total amount of the settlement, $500,000. <em>Id. </em>at 357-58, 443 A.2d 163. We found additional evidence of collusion in the parties\u2019 agreement to publicize the $500,000 settlement, but to conceal Rosemount\u2019s responsibility for paying only $30,000, an amount which Rosemount could recover if the plaintiffs were successful in pursuing their claim against the insurance company. <em>Id. </em>at 358, 443 A.2d 163. We conclude here that James also failed to meet her burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">IV-a. <em>The Evidence Produced by James</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">James presented little or no competent evidence to support the reasonableness and good faith nature of the Settlement. She relied upon the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">(1) the allegations in her complaint;</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>(2) the affidavit of Alan D. Berkowitz, a Pennsylvania attorney specializing in labor and employment law, who expressed that: (a) \u201c[i]n light of the grossly egregious conduct of which Mr. Imbesi and the two corporations that he controls are accused, and the severe damages that flow from such conduct, from a defendants\u2019 employment lawyers\u2019 point of view, we believe that a stipulated judgment in the range of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 for compensatory damages only on Counts I, II, V and VII of the Amended Complaint would be quite reasonable and appropriate\u201d; and (b) \u201cthe Confidential Settlement Agreement is reasonable in its entirety [sic], \u25a0 particularly in light of the fact that two insurance companies have refused, to date, to indemnify and defend Mr. Imbesi, Click Corporation of America, Inc. and North American Beverage Company\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">(3) the affidavit of Patricia V. Pierce, an attorney admitted to practice in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California, specializing in labor and employment law, expressed that: (a) \u201c[i]n light of the criminal nature of the conduct that Mr. Imbesi perpetrated on Ms. James, and the lifetime of physical and psychological damages from which she will suffer, it is my opinion that a stipulated judgment in the range of $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 for compensatory damages only on Counts I, II, VI and VII of the Amended Complaint would be quite reasonable and appropriate. A jury would probably return a verdict substantially in excess of this range\u201d; and (b) \u201cthe Confidential Settlement Agreement is reasonable in its entirety, particularly in light of the fact that two insurance companies have refused, to date, to indemnify and defend Mr. Imbesi, Click Corporation of America, Inc. and North American Beverage Company\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">(4) statements made by her counsel during a January 25, 1999 settlement conference before Judge Scuderi. There is no transcript of that conference. However, counsel for Imbesi has sworn that James\u2019s counsel presented \u201cevidence of the nature and scope of James\u2019s asserted injuries,\u201d the verdict in the <em>Goodwin </em>litigation and \u201cevidence of sexual harassment verdicts nationwide that ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ceeded ... $6 million.\u201d A letter from James\u2019s counsel, to counsel for Imbesi, demanding $6 million in settlement, provides no greater justification for a $6 million settlement demand, other than to suggest that Philadelphia juries have \u201ca well deserved reputation for large ... verdicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">First, plaintiff was not entitled to rely upon the naked allegations of her complaint, which have no evidentiary value. She was obligated to come forward with evidence to support those allegations. <em>Vargas v. Hudson Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>949 <em>F.</em>2d 665, 674 (3d Cir.1991) (\u201c[i]n deciding whether a settlement is prudent and reasonable, a court must consider the risk to the settling parties. It is the extent of the defendants\u2019 exposure to liability and not mere allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that <em>govern </em>the appraisal of reasonableness\u201d); <em>Excelsior Ins. Co. v. Pennsbury Pain Ctr., </em>975 <em>F.Supp. </em>342, 356 (D.N.J.1996) (same, quoting Vargas).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Second, the opinions of Berkowitz, Pierce and James\u2019s counsel constitute inadmissible net opinions because the attorneys never stated a factual basis for their opinions, grounded in the evidentiary record. These net opinions could not be considered by the trial judge as proof that the Settlement was reasonable and entered into in good faith. <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524-25, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981); <em>Smith v. Estate of Kelly, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>480, 497-98, 778 A.2d 1162 (App.Div.2001); <em>Jimenez v. GNOC, Corp., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 540-43, 670 A.2d 24 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>374, 678 A.2d 714 (1996). <em>See also, Brill, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (on summary judgment, evidentiary materials must be \u201ccompetent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">For example, Berkowitz reasoned that \u201csevere damages flow\u201d from conduct such as that alleged against Imbesi. However, Berkowitz never identified any evidence supporting the truthfulness of James\u2019s allegations against Imbesi, nor did he identify any particular damages James had suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Similarly, Pierce stated that, while she represented Goodwin in her litigation against Imbesi, she prepared James as a witness, and deposed and cross-examined Imbesi. Based upon those expe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>riences, Pierce credited James\u2019s version of events over that of Imbesi. However, Pierce did not state any factual basis to support her credibility determination stating only vaguely that she was \u201cquite familiar with numerous ways in which Mr. Hamburg [would] impeach [Imbesi\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Moreover, while Pierce thought that James had suffered a \u201clifetime of physical and psychological damages\u201d from Imbesi\u2019s \u201ccriminal\u201d conduct, she did not specify any medical evidence to support such a conclusion. Pierce also made no attempt to differentiate between Imbesi\u2019s individual liability and the liability of Click and North American. In this regard, Pierce gave no consideration to the fact that the most severe conduct alleged, Imbesi\u2019s alleged criminal sexual assault against James, may well not be covered and insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The only verdict and settlement Berkowitz and Pierce cited in support of their opinions were from the <em>Goodwin </em>litigation. The <em>Goodwin </em>verdict and settlement, however, do not support James\u2019s claim that the multi-million dollar Settlement in the present case was reasonable or made in good faith. Indeed, they support the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Specifically, the <em>Goodwin </em>verdict consisted of $2.1 million in punitive damages, which was subsequently cut to $100,000, the applicable statutory limit under Title VII, and only $325,041 in compensatory damages. Here, on the other hand, the $4.15 million Settlement supposedly represented a fair valuation of James\u2019s compensatory damages alone, without any consideration of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Finally, the arguments allegedly made by James\u2019s counsel, during the January 25, 1999 settlement conference before Judge Seuderi, were not fleshed out in the factual record and are difficult to assess. Based upon the limited information provided, it appears those arguments suffer from the same flaws as the Berkowitz and Pierce affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In sharp contrast to the essentially nugatory or conclusory affidavits of Berkowitz and Pierce, and the arguments of James\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>counsel, is the affidavit of former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit, John Gibbons, submitted by Harleysville in support of its motion for summary judgment. James does not dispute the veracity of Judge Gibbons\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In his report (Appendix A), Judge Gibbons cited to specific evidence which casts doubt upon the truthfulness of James\u2019s allegations against Imbesi. He also surveyed all reported New Jersey verdicts and settlements in sexual harassment cases, and cases involving the negligent transmission of a venereal disease\u2014 two of the three claims James \u201csettled\u201d for $4.15 million. Based upon his review of those cases, Judge Gibbons stated that $4.15 million was higher than any settlement or verdict ever reported in such a case. Moreover, Judge Gibbons noted that the largest portion of all of the verdicts he reviewed was the award for punitive damages, not the award for compensatory damages. Judge Gibbons concluded that the $4.15 million very likely exceeded the amount James could have recovered had the case been tried. Therefore, the Settlement did not represent a true, good faith compromise of James\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">IV-b. <em>Imbesi\u2019s Failure to Rebut James\u2019s Valuation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The record also reveals that Imbesi and the other defendants failed to mount any substantial challenge to James\u2019s valuation of the case. Indeed, in a letter to James\u2019s counsel, just prior to the January 25,1999 settlement conference, Imbesi\u2019s counsel conceded that a multi-million dollar settlement was reasonable. Imbesi\u2019s failure to rebut James\u2019s valuation of the case also supports a finding of collusiveness and bad faith. <em>Cont'l Cas. Co., 4 Fed.Appx. </em>703, 717 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cAmong the indicators of bad faith and collusion are ... lack of serious negotiations on damages\u201d) (quoting Stephen R. Schmidt, <em>The Bad Faith Setup, </em>29 <em>Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. </em>705, 721 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Specifically, the record reveals that in the January 25, 1999 settlement conference, Imbesi relied exclusively on the arguments of his counsel. Again, since there was no transcript made of the conference, it is difficult to evaluate the substance of those argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ments. However, according to counsel\u2019s affidavit, her remarks at the conference were limited to: (1) Imbesi\u2019s claim that his relationship with James was consensual; and (2) conflicts and uncertainties in James\u2019s deposition testimony. Significantly, as in <em>Pasha, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357, 781 A.2d 1119, Imbesi\u2019s counsel did not challenge James\u2019s valuation of her compensatory damages, and failed to discuss James\u2019s damages or injuries, physical, psychological or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We find it reasonable to question why Imbesi failed to challenge James\u2019s valuation of her claims, and instead accepted the concept that James should receive millions of dollars in compensatory damages. The apparent answer to that question leads to yet an additional inference that the Settlement was collusive and made in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Specifically, the record reveals that no discovery had ever been taken with respect to the state law claims for which James obtained a consent judgment and $4.15 million in compensatory damages. The majority of James\u2019s claims, including the claims for which she obtained a consent judgment, were dismissed from the Federal Action by order dated January 27, 1998. Thereafter, James never filed a complaint in state court, reasserting the claims which had been dismissed. Apparently, James only reasserted and revived those claims in federal court on January 25, 1999 in order to resolve them as part of the Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">All discovery in the Federal Action, including the depositions of both James and Imbesi was necessarily limited to the two claims remaining in the Federal Action for assault and battery and gender-motivated violence. The record suggests that James\u2019s deposition was taken in the Federal Action. However, the transcript of that deposition is not part of this appellate record. The record contains only the transcript for James\u2019s deposition in the present declaratory judgment state litigation. The evidence necessary to prove such claims is not co-extensive with the claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>which James obtained a consent judgment. Indeed, the claims of assault and battery and gender-motivated violence were made against Imbesi, individually, and not against Click and North American Harleysville\u2019s insureds under the Employers\u2019 Liability Policy implicated in this case. Therefore, no evidence was recorded relating to the liability of Click and North American for Imbesi\u2019s alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In addition, and perhaps even more significantly, despite the parties\u2019 agreement that James suffered at least $4.15 million in compensatory damages, there is no evidence that James ever submitted to an independent examination by a medical doctor or a psychological expert engaged by the defendants to evaluate her claims of physical and psychological injuries. Although Imbesi originally had sought a psychiatric examination of James, the parties agreed to postpone that examination pending the outcome of their settlement discussions. Thus, there was never any independent medical evidence marshaled and available to support, refute or confirm the nature and extent of James\u2019s alleged physical and psychological injuries. <em>See, e.g., Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 368-69, 443 <em>A.2d </em>163 (in remanding for determination on issues of reasonableness and good faith, finding it significant that insured failed to conduct basic physical examination or deposition of the plaintiff and that insured did not question factual basis of amount of settlement).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">As to this issue, the record clearly suggests James\u2019s alleged injuries are not as serious as she claims. First, James admitted in interrogatory answers she suffered from \u201cemotional problems\u201d before she met Imbesi. Therefore, there is some reason to question the extent to which Imbesi, Click and North American may be held liable for her psychological condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Second, there exists one affidavit from James\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Shively, which predates the February 1999 Settlement. It was submitted to the state court in the Philadelphia Action, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>support of the parties\u2019 joint motion to proceed under seal. There is no evidence that this affidavit was submitted to Judge Scuderi, although it was submitted to the trial court in the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In this affidavit, Dr. Shively stated that James suffered flashbacks, generalized chronic anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, weight loss and fear of being in public places. However, Shively also stated that James had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d and that \u201cthe quality of [James\u2019s] life ha[d] improved considerably.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Our reading of the record reflects that, at all times, the parties were primarily interested in disposing of the case and suing the carriers. Serious settlement discussions began before the litigation was filed. Of course, there exists a strong public policy in favor of settlements. <em>Zuccarelli v. State Dept. of Envtl. Prot., </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>372, 380, 741 A.2d 599 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>394, 749 A.2d 368 (2000). That policy, however, does not excuse insureds from their obligation, under <em>Griggs, 88 N.J. </em>at 364-68, 443 A.2d 163, to present sufficient evidence to support the reasonableness and good faith nature of their settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The lack of an evidentiary basis to support this $4.15 million Settlement stands in stark contrast to the sort of detailed examinations of the potential for liability and damages, including extensive, detailed discussions of the underlying facts and expert opinions, which courts have found sufficient to support the reasonableness of a settlement agreement in this insurance context. <em>See, e.g., Midwestern, </em>119 F.Supp.2d at 845-51; <em>Excelsior, </em>975 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 354-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">IV-c. <em>The Terms of the Settlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">An examination of the terms of the Settlement Agreement also support a finding of bad faith and collusion. The first suspicious term is the allocation of the entire $4.15 million Settlement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>compensatory damages, with no portion allocated to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Both sides in the Federal action benefitted from this allocation. Imbesi, Click and North American benefitted because punitive damages are generally neither insured against nor insurable. <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 580-89, 667 A.2d 1087 (App.Div.1995). James benefitted because she avoided the problem of recovering a punitive damages award from Imbesi, whose assets may be non-liquid and difficult to value, or otherwise difficult to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The only entities disadvantaged by this allocation are the Non-Settling Insurers, specifically Harleysville, because, while punitive damages are not covered and insured, compensatory damages potentially are, if they relate to a bodily injury James suffered, arising from her employment with Click and North American. <em>Schmidt, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Finally, as discussed previously, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that James suffered $4.15 million in compensatory damages, and no New Jersey jury has ever awarded such a large amount in compensatory, or even punitive damages, in cases involving claims similar to James\u2019s. Thus, this term of the Settlement Agreement clearly represents an inappropriate attempt to squeeze a settlement for both compensatory and punitive damages into a sum for compensatory damages alone, solely for the purpose of obtaining insurance coverage. As such, it constitutes evidence of collusion and bad faith. <em>Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>4 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>703, 717 (10th Cir.2001) (negotiated settlement \u201cbecomes collusive when the purpose is to injure the interests of an absent or nonparticipating party, such as an insurer or nonsettling defendant. Among the indicators of bad faith and collusion are ... attempts to affect the insurance coverage, ... and attempts to harm the interest of the insurer\u201d) (quoting Stephen R. Schmidt, <em>The Bad Faith Setup, </em>29 <em>Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. </em>705, 721 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>A second suspicious Settlement term is the disparity in the amounts paid by the settling parties and the total amount of the Settlement. Specifically, James agreed to accept $750,000 from Imbesi, Click, and North American, and $250,000 from American Motorists and Lumbermens, and to seek the remaining $3.15 million from Harleysville and Fireman\u2019s. Furthermore, depending upon her success against the Non-Settling Insurers, James agreed to reimburse up to $250,000, the \u201cguaranteed payments,\u201d to the settling parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The third suspicious term is James\u2019s agreement to waive her right to proceed against Imbesi, Click and North American, should she be unable to recover from Harleysville. This aspect of the Settlement raises strong suspicions of bad faith or collusion by the parties, to recover an unreasonable Settlement amount from the Non-Settling Insurers. <em>Griggs, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 370, 443 A.2d 163. Indeed, we conclude this aspect of the Settlement provides strong evidence that the $4.15 million settlement amount was a sham, which did not truly represent James\u2019s actual losses. If it did, why would she be willing to settle for \u201conly\u201d $1 million and risk the possibility of recovering nothing from the Non-Settling Insurers? We conclude that she agreed to accept $1 million from the settling parties because she believed $1 million was reasonable in the circumstance to compensate her for her losses. Any balance recovered over $1 million was essentially serendipitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Finally, a fourth suspicious term is the parties\u2019 agreement to hold Harleysville responsible for paying, at the very least, $3.15 million of the $4.15 million Settlement. Harleysville insured Click and North American for only five months of James\u2019s nineteen-month period of employment, while American Motorists and Lumbermens insured the companies for fourteen months of her employment. One might expect American Motorists and Lumbermens to be held responsible for paying more than Harleysville or at least a more proportionate ratio. However, that is not the case under the terms of the Settlement. Those companies agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>pay only $300,000, while Harleysville was expected to pay at least $3.15 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It is possible, as James contends, that she suffered the more severe damages during the five months of her employment which were insured by Harleysville. It is during this time period that she allegedly contracted herpes from Imbesi, and he allegedly raped her. Nevertheless, these alleged facts do not justify holding Harleysville responsible for $3.15 million of the $4.15 million Settlement, more than three-fourths.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Clearly, from James\u2019s complaint, Imbesi\u2019s alleged sexual harassment was a continuous course of conduct, commencing from the very start of her employment. In the temporal context, it is reasonable that American Motorists and Lumbermens should be responsible for a greater portion of the Settlement than Harleysville. Moreover, there is legitimate reason to question whether these alleged injuries, resulting from Imbesi\u2019s criminal conduct, were attributable vicariously to Click and North American and conduct insured against by the carriers. Given this situation, we would have expected James to demand greater payments from Imbesi, American Motorists and Lumbermens. However, she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">IV-d. <em>Concealment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Finally, unlike in <em>Pasha, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 781 A.2d 1119, we find no evidence of an intent by the parties to \u201cconceal\u201d the terms of their Settlement from the Non Settling Insurers. Indeed, the Settlement anticipated future litigation against the Non-Settling Insurers, in which, of necessity, the Settlement Agreement would be disclosed. Moreover, the evidence shows that the parties attempted to involve the Non-Settling Insurers in the settlement discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Moreover, in the present case, the parties intended to keep the entire Settlement Agreement confidential, except as necessary to pursue their claim against the Non-Settling Insurers and not just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>those aspects of the Settlement which were deemed controversial. It is apparent from the record that the parties\u2019 reasons for keeping the Settlement confidential were valid,- and related to the scandalous nature of James\u2019s allegations and Imbesi\u2019s conduct. For example, as part of their earlier, unsuccessful settlement negotiations, the parties had jointly moved in the Philadelphia Action to proceed under seal by using pseudonyms. Furthermore, as part of the successful Settlement, the parties sought and obtained an order from the federal court, sealing and impounding the case record.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Lack of concealment, however, does not entail a finding that the Settlement was made in good faith and without collusion by the parties. Concealment constitutes only one means of establishing collusion or a lack of good faith. <em>Midwestern, </em>119 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 843; <em>Pasha, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356-59, 781 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Consideration of all other factors leads us to the conclusion that the Settlement was unreasonable and collusive, and made in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\n<em>James\u2019s Alternative Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">As an alternative argument, James contends that the reasonableness and good faith nature of the Settlement amount cannot be decided on this record alone, and a plenary hearing is necessary on these issues. James also suggests a method for conducting that hearing, including a different judge, in any further proceedings which may be necessary, should the Settlement be deemed unreasonable. We conclude that the Settlement was unreasonable on its face, collusive and entered into in bad faith. We find the evidence on these issues was so one-sided that reasonable minds could not differ. Summary judgment was appropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>entered in Harleysville\u2019s favor and a plenary hearing is unnecessary. No reasonable fact-finder could reach a contrary conclusion. We conclude that the $4.15 million settlement and judgment was contrived to optimize the benefits of the settling parties, to the detriment of the holdout carriers, on damages, coverage and liability and was entered into in bad faith without any sound relationship to the realities of the situation. The claimant recovered $1 million in damages, a reasonable sum in compensation. The balance of $3.15 million is not justified by the indisputable facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">As to Harleysville\u2019s cross-appeal, the Law Division held that, under the Employers\u2019 Liability portion of its Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Policy, Harleysville was obligated to defend and indemnify Click and North American with respect to James\u2019s claims of sexual harassment under the LAD, to the extent James suffered bodily injury as a result. The judge based this decision on her interpretation of <em>Schmidt, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">In its cross-appeal, Harleysville contends this holding was erroneous and represents an incorrect interpretation of <em>Schmidt. </em>More specifically, Harleysville contends that it owed no duty to defend or indemnify Click and North American, under the Employers\u2019 Liability Policy: (1) because Exclusion C5 excluded from coverage \u201cbodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated\u201d by the insured; and (2) because public policy prohibits Click and North American from being insured for intentional acts of sexual harassment and sexual assault. At the time of oral argument, counsel for cross-appellant advised us that if we affirm on the direct appeal, \u201cthis concludes the case\u201d and we need not decide the cross-appeal. We agree and dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Affirmed on the appeal; dismissed on the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\n<em>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">FIREMAN\u2019S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY and FIREMAN\u2019S FUND INDEMNITY CORPORATION, Plaintiffs,</p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">vs.</p>\n<p id=\"AvU\">JOHN C.

I have been asked by Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cHarleysville\u201d) to offer my opinion as to the reasonableness of the settlement entered into by Sally James, North American Beverage \u2022 Company, Click Corporation of America, Inc., John Imbesi, and American Motorists Insurance Company and Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (hereinafter the \u201cKemper Insurance Companies\u201d), in an action entitled <em>Sally James v. Click Corporation of America, Inc., North American Beverage Company, John Imbesi, Lawrence Imbesi, Mark Imbesi and Joseph Imbesi, </em>United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 97-cv-2736 (hereinafter \u201cJames litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Axx\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\n<em>Qualifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">2. I am a partner in the law firm of Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione, a professional corporation. Founded in 1926, the firm currently has 155 attorneys. It maintains offices in Newark, New Jersey, and in New York City. It provides a full range of legal services to a diverse group of clients, with departments specializing in civil and criminal litigation, commercial and corporate law, tax law, employment and labor law, real estate and land use law, environmental law and intellectual property law. The firm has an extensive employment and labor law department, consisting of about 15 attorneys who specialize in handling discrimination claims I am admitted to practice before the Courts of the State of New Jersey, the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. I have appeared as counsel in the New Jersey appellate and trial courts and in each of the federal courts mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">3. I received my B.S. degree from Holy Cross College in 1947, and my LL.B. <em>Cum Laude </em>from Harvard Law School in 1950. At Harvard I served as an editor of the <em>Harvard Law Review. </em>I joined my present law firm, then known as Crummy &amp; Considine, upon graduation from Harvard and was admitted to the New Jersey Bar that same year. In 1954 I became a partner in the firm, which then became known as Crummy, Considine &amp; Gibbons. I remained a partner in that firm until the end of 1969. My practice between 1950 and 1970 included state and federal civil and criminal litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">4. In 1960 I was appointed by the New Jersey Supreme Court as a member of the New Jersey Board of Bar Examiners. I became Chairman of that Board in 1963. I was appointed in 1968 by Governor Richard J. Hughes to the New Jersey Council Against Crime, in 1968 to the Council of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and in 1967 to the Governor\u2019s Select Commission on Civil Disorders. I have served as a Trustee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Essex County Bar Association, a Trustee, officer and ultimately President of the New Jersey State Bar Association, and as a member of the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association. I am a Fellow of the American Bar Foundation and a Life member of the American Law Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">5. I first became a member of the faculty of Seton Hall University Law School in 1972. I hav.e taught at that Law School; at Duke Law School in Durham, North Carolina; at Rutgers Law School in Newark, New Jersey; at Rutgers Law School in Camden, New Jersey; and at Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts. I have served as a member of the Visiting Committee for the University of Chicago Law School. In the course of my academic career I have taught Appellate Advocacy, Contracts, Commercial Law, Conflicts of Laws, Constitutional Law, Federal Jurisdiction and Information and Publication Law. I have published more than 20 articles and review essays in law publications, including the Law Reviews of Columbia University, Duke University, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, Seton Hall University, Suffolk University, Brooklyn Law School, Cardozo Law School, and New York Law School.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">6. In December of 1969 I was nominated to, and on January 15, 1970 I became a judge of, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I became Chief Judge of the Third Circuit at the beginning of 1987 and served in that capacity until January 15, 1990. On that date I retired from the bench. During my judicial service, I participated in several thousand appeals and authored about eight hundred published opinions. A number of my opinions have been included in casebooks used in law schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">7. Upon my retirement from the bench, I became- a tenured professor at Seton Hall University Law School, holding the Richard J. Hughes Chair in Constitutional Law. Shortly thereafter, my old firm, then called Crummy, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione, invited me to become Special Counsel. I continued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>that capacity until January, 1998, when the firm changed its name to Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione, and I was named Senior Partner of the firm. Thus, I have remained in the active practice of law since my retirement from the bench. I have argued cases in the United States Supreme Court, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the United States District Court, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate, Law and Chancery Divisions. I have also served as an arbitrator or mediator in more than 45 civil disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Legal Assumptions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\"><em>8. </em>It is not my intention to offer <em>an </em>opinion as to the governing law, since the Court does not ordinarily admit such testimony. <em>See </em>FED. R. EVID. 702; <em>Lithuanian Commerce Corp., Ltd. v. Sara Lee Hosiery, </em>177 F.R.D. 245, 264 (D.N.J.1997), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>179 F.R.D. 450 (D.N.J.1998); <em>Boddy v. Cigna Property &amp; Cas. Cos., </em>334 N.J.Super. 649, 659, 760 A.2d 823 (App.Div.2000). Before rendering my opinions as to the reasonableness of the settlement in the James litigation, however, it is necessary to identify my assumptions respecting the legal standards governing them. Those assumptions (with which the Court may or may not agree) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">A. That under New Jersey law where an insurer fails to defendant an insured, a settlement entered into by the insured and a third party may be enforced against the insurer if the settlement is reasonable in amount and entered into in good faith. <em>Griggs v. Bertram, </em>88 N.J. 347, 368, 443 A.2d 163 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">B. That the New Jersey Supreme Court, in <em>Griggs, </em>set forth a burden-shifting framework to be used when evaluating these settlements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">The initial burden of going forward with proofs of these elements rests upon the insured and the ultimate burden of persuasion as to these elements is the responsibility of the insurer. This rule reasonably accommodates and compromises the competing interests of the parties and considerations of public policy. It will discourage collusive or overreaching impositions upon insurance carriers and, at the same time, will be conducive toward encouraging settlement and protecting an insured in its efforts amicably to resolve a claim against it after having been abandoned by its carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\"><em>Id. Accord Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Health Care Ins. Exchange, </em>247 N.J.Super. 241, 248, 588 A.2d 1275 (App.Div.1991); <em>Vargas v. Hudson County Bd. of Elections, </em>949 F.2d 665, 674 (3d Cir.1991).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>C. That the <em>Griggs </em>Court, however, did not define the factors that the trial court should consider when evaluating the reasonableness of a settlement and the good faith of the settling parties. The commentary in the cases that have followed helps shed some light on what factors should be taken into consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">D. That in <em>Vargas v. Hudson County Bd. of Elections, </em>the Third Circuit stated that \u201cin determining whether a settlement is prudent and reasonable, a court must consider the risk to the settling party. It is the extent of the defendants\u2019 exposure to liability and not mere allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that govern the appraisal of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Vargas, </em>949 F.2d at 674.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">E. That in <em>Luria Bros. &amp; Co., Inc. v. Alliance Assur. Co. Ltd., </em>780 F.2d 1082, 1091 (3d Cir.1986), the Third Circuit directed that \u201c[i]n order to recover the amount of the settlement from the insurer, the insured need not establish actual liability to the party to whom it has settled so long as a potential liability on the facts known to the insured is shown to exist, culminating in a settlement in an amount reasonable in view of the size of possible recovery and degree of probability of claimant\u2019s success against the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">F. That in <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. of Wis. v. Hendrix, </em>199 F.2d 53, 60 (4th Cir.1952), the court stated that \u201cin every case of settlement before judgment the reasonableness of the compromise is a proper subject of inquiry which cannot be answered without some examination into the merits of the claim.\u201d The court found the settlement unreasonable, noting that no witness with personal knowledge was called to testify and the alleged wrongdoer was neither examined as a witness nor questions as to whether the charges against him were true. <em>Id. </em>at 59.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">G. That courts have discussed similar factors that should be considered when evaluating the fairness and 'reasonableness of settlements in class actions and shareholder derivative suits, and a review of these cases provides additional guidance on the factors that a court should consider when reviewing a settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">H. That in those cases, the courts have held that a court cannot approve a settlement that appears to be inequitable or unfair. <em>McCray v. Beatty, </em>64 F.R.D. 107, 110 (D.N.J.1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">I. That \u201c[i]n order to approve a proposed settlement, the court must be satisfied that the agreement is \u2018fan1, adequate, and reasonable,\u2019 and not the product of fraud or collusion.\u201d <em>In re Matzo Food Prods. Litig., </em>156 F.R.D. 600, 604 (D.N.J.1994) (quoting <em>Stoetzner v. United States Steel Corp., </em>897 F.2d 115, 118 (3d Cir.1990)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">J. That the court cannot simply \u201crubber stamp\u201d a settlement based on the arguments and recommendations of counsel. <em>Id </em>Eather, \u201c[t]o make this determination, the factual record before the [ ] court must be sufficiently developed.\u201d <em>Id </em>(citing <em>Girsh v. Jepson, </em>521 F.2d 153, 159 (3d Cir.1975)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">K. That the Third Circuit, in fact, has reversed lower courts when the lower courts have approved a settlement without an appropriate record. <em>See, e.g., In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liability Litig., </em>55 F.3d 768, 819 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Girsh, </em>521 F.2d at 157.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">L. That in eases primarily seeking monetary relief, the proposed settlement should be compared to \u201cthe present value of the damages the plaintiff would likely recover, if successful, discounted by the risk of not prevailing.\u201d <em>D.M. v. Terhune, </em>67 F.Supp.2d 401, 409 (D.N.J.1999) (citing <em>In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Track Fuel Tank Prods. Liability Litig., </em>55 F.3d 768, 806 (3d Cir.1995)). A settlement which is too high in favor of the plaintiff will be considered unfair because a \u201csettlement is a compromise, a yielding of the highest hopes in exchange for certainty and resolution.\" <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">M. That the New Jersey Appellate Division has held that \u201c[t]he very concept of settlement implies some element of compromise.\u201d <em>Battista v. Western World Ins. Co., </em>227 N.J.Super. 135, 150, 545 A.2d 841 (Law Div.1988), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds sub nom, Battista v. Olson, </em>250 N.J.Super. 330, 594 A.2d 260 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 N.J. 553, 606 A.2d 366 (1991). The Court further held that despite the fact that an insurer may be estopped from denying coverage for punitive damages if it failed to properly advise the insured of said denial, \u201cthe estoppel cannot serve to make it responsible to pay damages in an amount that would never have been considered by the parties were the insurance company not the responsible entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 545 A.2d 841</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">9. Given the foregoing legal assumptions, the task at hand is to opine on the reasonableness of the settlement in the James litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">\n<em>Factual Assumptions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">10. Sally James sued, <em>inter alia, </em>John Imbesi and his companies, Click Corporation of American, Inc. and North American Beverage Company, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">11. James\u2019s Complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>sexual harassment in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\u201cLAD\u201d), negligent transmission of a venereal disease, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">12. The parties sought insurance coverage and indemnification from the defendants\u2019 insurers, including Harleysville. With the exception of the Kemper Insurance Companies, all of the insurance companies, including Harleysville, denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">13. Harleysville had issued three policies to Imbesi\u2019s companies, North American Beverage Company and Click Corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>in the Summer of 1996: (i) Commercial General Liability Policy (\u201cCGL\u201d) (MDA 3D 76 29), (ii) Commercial Blanket Excess Liability Policy (\u201cBEL\u201d) (BEC 30 76 29), and (iii) Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Policy (\u201cWC/EPL\u201d) (WC 30 76 29). These policies were in effect September 20,1996 to September 20, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">14. The parties and the Kemper Insurance Companies settled the matter for: (i) a payment of $750,000 to James from Imbesi, North American Beverage Company and Click Corporation, (ii) a payment of $250,000 to James from the Kemper Insurance Companies, and (iii) the entry of a consent judgment of $4.15 million, representing compensatory damages only, in favor of James against Imbesi, North American Beverage Company and Click Corporation that could only be executed against the insurance companies that denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">\n<em>Materials Examined</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">15. I have examined the following materials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">A. The pleadings filed in the James litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">B. The Confidential Settlement Agreement in the James litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">C. The Affidavits of Patricia V. Pierce, Esq. and Alan D.

Because no record was made, I am not able to review the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Scuderi on January 25,1999 in the James litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>Reasonableness of the Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">17. In analyzing the reasonableness of the settlement in the James litigation, I have considered two distinct issues: (i) whether there was an adequate record before Magistrate Judge Scuderi permitting him to find the settlement reasonable, and (ii) whether the settlement was, in fact, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">18. While Magistrate Judge Scuderi did not make a record of the hearing on January 25, 1999, in the James litigation, the attorneys for the parties have indicated that the Magistrate Judge had the following materials before him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u2022 Affidavit of Patricia V Pierce, Esq., attorney for Deborah Goodwin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u2022 Affidavit of Alan D. Berkowitz, Esq., attorney for Carpenter Realty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">\u2022 Arguments of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">Based on these sparse materials, Magistrate Judge Scuderi recommended the settlement of the James litigation include a consent judgment of $4.15 million and concluded that the settlement was reasonable There was no legal requirement that the settlement be approved, and the approval process was not an adversarial proceeding. Harleysville was not a party to that proceeding. For the reasons set forth below, it is my opinion that the settlement was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">Initially, the affidavits of Pierce and Berkowitz were inadmissible net opinions, unsupported by any factual evidence or other data. <em>See </em>FED. R. EVID. 702; <em>May v. Atlantic City Hilton, </em>128 F.Supp.2d 195, 198 (D.N.J.2000); <em>Reed v. Binder, </em>165 F.R.D. 424, 430 n. 11 (D.N.J.1996); <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 N.J. 512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981) (holding that under the net opinion rule \u201can expert\u2019s bare conclusions, unsupported by factual evidence, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>inadmissible\u201d). The affidavits presented nothing more than subjective and unsupported speculation about what a jury could award James if she successfully pursued her claim against Imbesi and his companies. <em>See e.g., Kaplan v. Skoloff &amp; Wolfe, P.C., </em>339 N.J.Super. 97, 102-04, 770 A.2d 1258 (App.Div.2001) (holding that attorney\u2019s opinion of the reasonableness of a divorce settlement was an inadmissible net opinion because the attorney failed to offer any evidential support for' his conclusion other than his personal view and experience). Therefore, Magistrate Judge Scuderi\u2019s reliance on the affidavits was improper and certainly not sufficient to support a finding that the settlement was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">More important is the evidence that the Magistrate Judge did <em>not </em>have before him. Because of this striking lack of evidence, the record upon which the Magistrate Judge rules was insufficient to support his finding that the settlement was reasonable. Magistrate Judge Scuderi did not have before him evidence with which he could adequately review the factors bearing on the possibility of liability and amount of damages. The Magistrate Judge did not review any expert reports, deposition testimony or other discovery in the case. It does not appear that the Magistrate Judge even reviewed the pleadings in the matter. Nor did the Magistrate Judge consider the ability of the defendants to pay the settlement or the complexity, length and expense of further litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Clearly, Magistrate Judge Scuderi did not consider the amount of opposition to James\u2019s claim because the defendants failed to adequately place such evidence before him. The defendants failed to present the Magistrate Judge with any substantive opposition to James\u2019s claims. The defendants failed to present any affidavits or other evidence to challenge the self-serving affidavits presented by James. Ms. Flick, the attorney for the defendants in the James litigation, testified that she only presented evidence of the consensual nature of the relationship between the parties and raised \u201csome issues\u201d as to James\u2019s credibility. In fact, there were <em>numerous </em>inconsistencies in James\u2019s testimony and instances where she admitted her untruthfulness. For example, James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>testified that she lied on her resume by indicating that she had a college degree and then gave inconsistent testimony about the reason for failing to complete her college degree. There were also inconsistencies in her testimony about the alleged rape by Imbesi, including evidence that the rape could not have occurred because of the timing of events as she described.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">James also testified that despite the alleged rape by Imbesi, she accepted a loan from him of over $13,000, contacted a real estate agent to rent another apartment in the area, and enrolled in the local community college. James also admitted that she engaged in consensual sex with Imbesi, both inside and outside the office. Indeed, the evidence showed that James did not inform anyone of Imbesi\u2019s alleged improper conduct until two days after she learned that Imbesi was involved with another woman. This evidence was not reviewed by Magistrate Judge Scuderi.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In addition, the defendants did not present the testimony or report of any economic or psychological experts. Nor did the defendants even have James examined by any doctors. Furthermore, neither James nor the defendants presented the Magistrate Judge with any economic or employability expert reports relating to James\u2019s economic loss or ability to return to work. Therefore, the Magistrate Judge could not have considered this important information. In fact, Magistrate Judge Scuderi could not have even reviewed the affidavit of James\u2019s treating psychiatrist (Dr. Susan Shively) because it was not prepared until May 5,1999, over 3 months after the January 25,1999 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Furthermore, there was evidence to contradict the severity of James\u2019s emotional and physical damages that was not before Magistrate Judge Scuderi. The evidence showed that James has lived a fairly normal life since leaving Imbesi, notwithstanding that she requires medication for herpes. Subsequent to the alleged harassment by Imbesi, James was able to immediately obtain another job, enrolled in college to complete her degree, and shortly thereafter met and married her husband. None of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>evidence was apparently presented to or reviewed by the Magistrate Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that the record before Magistrate Judge Scuderi was not sufficient to approve the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">19. As to the actual reasonableness of the settlement, I have surveyed verdicts and settlements involving sexual harassment under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\u201cLAD\u201d) and negligent transmission of a venereal disease (the claims upon which the settlement was based). The settlement in the James litigation is higher than any settlement or verdict ever reported in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">20. In eases involving claims of sexual harassment under the LAD, reported settlements, with the exception of one case, have not exceeded $425,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Ferri v. Department of Corrections, </em>L-1142-96, 1999 WL 33564464 (N.J. Law.

Dorf Feature Serv., </em>N.J.L.J. (Sept. 9, 1996) (parties settled employee\u2019s claim for sexual harassment based on her termination for allegedly rebuffing his sexual advances for $200,000); <em>Astin v. Atlantic County Ultil. Auth., </em>N.J.L.J. (Mar. 27, 1995) (parties settled female publicist\u2019s claim of sexual harassment by supervisor for $250,000); <em>Plaintiff v.

(Aug. 4, 1997) (parties settled secretary\u2019s claim of sexual harassment against judge for $95,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">There is nothing about James\u2019s case, which likewise included allegations of inappropriate language and physical contact, which distinguishes it for these reported settlements and that justifies a settlement of $4.15 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The highest reported settlement of a sexual harassment case under the LAD was in <em>Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>174 F.3d 95 (3rd Cir.1999). There, the plaintiff, a female police officer, filed suit against her employer for sexual harassment. The plaintiff claimed that she had been repeatedly subjected to perverse sexual jokes and comments by her male colleagues. For example, the plaintiff was subjected to sexually derogatory comments, gestures and graffiti over a <em>period of years, </em>as well as demeaning transfers and job assignments and the denial of an increase in salary. The plaintiff claimed that she suffered severe emotional distress that interfered with her work, personal life and family life. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed another suit against her employer, alleging that she was retaliated against for filing the initial sexual harassment complaint. After a two-month trial on her initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>sexual harassment claim, a jury awarded the plaintiff $575,000 in compensatory damages and $700,000 in punitive damages (a total of $1.275 million). The District Court reduced the compensatory award to $175,000 and upheld the punitive damage award (a total of $875,000). The Third Circuit upheld the reduced $175,000 compensatory award but reversed the $700,000 punitive damage award and remanded for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages. Prior to a new trial, the parties settled both the sexual harassment suit and the retaliation suit for $1.4 million (including attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">There are a number of aspects of James\u2019s claims that distinguish it from <em>Hurley </em>and demonstrate that the $4.15 million settlement is unreasonable. For example, James was only employed by Imbesi for 1$ years and, for at least some of that time, she was admittedly engaged in a consensual relationship with him. Moreover, unlike Hurley\u2019s claim of sexual comments by several colleagues, James claimed that Imbesi was the only one involved in the offensive conduct. James did not allege that her job was adversely changed by way of demotion or reassignment or that her salary was affected. Accordingly, there is no reasonable basis to find that James\u2019s claims are worth more than Hurley\u2019s claims. Even if an argument is made that James\u2019s damages exceeded that of Hurley, Hurley settled both a sexual harassment and retaliation claim for $1.4 million, one-quarter of the settlement made in the James litigation. Thus, in light of the reported settlements of sexual harassment claims under the LAD, the $4.15 million settlement in James the litigation is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">21. Even jury verdicts for sexual harassment under the LAD, where juries have expressly found that the plaintiffs claims are supported by the facts and a settlement compromise is nor involved, have not reached as high as the $4.15 million settlement in the James litigation. <em>See, e.g., Camacho v. Country Squire Diner, </em>L-599-96 (N.J.Law.Div., Atl.County, Oct. 1998) (jury awarded waitress $103,900 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages against diner and $15,000 against owner for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sexual harassment in form of repeated foul and suggestive language, obscene gestures and her termination for complaining about same); <em>Blakey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>1997 WL 1524797 (D.N.J.

Servidio, </em>L-7482-94, 1997 WL 33346459 (N.J. Law Div., Hudson County, Sept. 1997) (jury awarded employee $300,000 in compensatory damages, which the court remitted to $90,000, and $2,500 in punitive damages for sexual harassment and emotional distress resulting from comments by supervisor and other employees that supervisor wanted to have oral sex with her while they watched); <em>Lockley v. State of </em>N.J., L-031965-94 (N.J.

Smith, </em>L-2349-91 (N.J. Law Div. Somerset County, Sept. 1994) (jury awarded plaintiff $80,000 in compensatory damages for sexual harassment, including repeated obscene gestures and touching); <em>Plaintiff v. Defendant </em>(names unknown), L-8472-91, 1994 WL 1874526 (N.J. Law Div., Bergen County, Mar. 1994) (jury awarded secretary $15,000 for sexual harassment by employer who threatened to terminate her if she did not have sex with him); <em>Gares v. Willingboro Twp., </em>90 F.3d 720 (3d Cir.1996) (jury awarded employee $24,000 in compensatory damages and $38,000 in punitive damages for sexual harassment by police chief); <em>Bouton v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., </em>90-2884, 1992 WL 1474849 (D.N.J.1992) (jury awarded executive secretary $70,000 in compensatory damages for sexual harassment by two different bosses in form of sexual advances); <em>Caridi v. Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>W-019262-89, 1992 WL 1474162 (N.J. Law Div., Hudson County, Oct 1992) (jury awarded police officer $500,000 for emotional distress resulting from sexual harassment in form of inappropriate work assignments, unfounded departmental charges and inadequate supervision by her supervisors of sexual harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ment by co-workers); <em>Hutchinson v. Fucili, </em>W-008454089 (N.J. Law Div., Warrant County, Apr. 1991) (jury awarded counter clerk $2,000 for sexual harassment in form of sexual comments and jokes and offer of monetary compensation in exchange for sexual favors, which she resisted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The most recent jury verdicts subsequent to the January 1999 hearing in the James litigation have not reached that high. <em>See e.g., Layton v. New Jersey Turnpike Auth., </em>N.J.L.J. (June 12, 2000) (jury awarded toll collector $590,000 for the emotional distress she suffered from her supervisor\u2019s unwanted physical advances); <em>Van Ginneken v. Quick Check Corp., </em>L-1256-97 (N.J. Law Div., Morris County, Oct. 1999) (jury awarded male convenience store assistant manager $25,000 for sexual harassment in form of highly offensive comments by female manager); <em>Washington v. Salem Lafayette Assocs., </em>A-5316-97T3 (N.J.App.Div. July 2, 1999) (jury awarded plaintiff $50,000 against former employer for sexual harassment, assault and battery and intentional interference with her employment relationship); <em>Hubis v. Burns Pontiac GMC, </em>No. 98-CV-1360, 2001 WL 34031303 (D.N.J. March 12, 2001) (jury awarded plaintiff $1.5 million for hostile work environment sexual harassment and gender discrimination based, in part, on her supervisor exposing himself to her twice and demoting her), <em>motion for new trial or, in the alternative, remittitur pending.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">In the James litigation, the parties did not conclude the matter to trial. There was no finding of liability by the defendants. Instead, James chose to compromise her claim in order to secure a recovery. The very essence of a settlement is a compromise of the amount sought in exchange for an immediate and certain payment. The $4.15 million settlement does not represent a compromise of James\u2019s claims, but rather an amount that very likely exceeds what she could have recovered if the matter had been tried and decided by a jury. Hence, it is my opinion that the $4.15 million settlement is not, in fact, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>22. More enlightening is the comparison of James\u2019s case to that of Deborah Goodwin. Goodwin was also employed by Imbesi and his companies for about <em>1% </em>years (July 1993-January 1995). She quit her job and filed suit against Imbesi and his companies asserting most of the same claims as those asserted by James (e.g., quid pro quo sexual harassment, hostile work environment sexual harassment, assault and battery, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent supervision). Goodwin\u2019s factual allegations are almost identical to those made by James (e.g. Imbesi repeatedly asked her to engage in oral sex with him, Imbesi asked if she would have his baby, Imbesi asked her if she was a \u201cgagger\u201d or a \u201cswallower\u201d, Imbesi retaliated against her for refusing his sexual demands).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Goodwin settled part of her claim with the defendants for $1 million and a jury awarded her $2.5 million on the remainder of her claims, of which about $ 2.1 million was for punitive damages. The Court subsequently reduced the compensatory damage award to $425,041 and the punitive damage award to $100,000, reducing Goodwin\u2019s total award to $525,041. In total, Goodwin received approximately $1,525 million for her claims against Imbesi and his companies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In comparison, James settled part of her claim with the defendants for $1 million and has a $4.15 million consent judgment for the remainder of her claims that would, if enforced, give her a total of $5.15 million. Moreover, Goodwin received $425,041 in compensatory damages and James, through the Consent Judgment received $4.15 million. In light of the similarity of the defendants, the nature of the claims and the damages asserted, there is no reasonable basis for James\u2019s claims to be worth over $3 million more than Goodwin\u2019s claims. Indeed, Goodwin\u2019s claims were decided in her favor by a jury and James\u2019s claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>were never proved but merely compromised in a settlement. It is my opinion that this further demonstrates that the $4.15 million settlement in the James litigation is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">23. In cases involving negligent infliction of a sexual disease, the one real distinction between James\u2019s claims and Goodwin\u2019s claims, jury verdicts have ranged from $93,676 to $357,620. <em>See e.g., In re Moffitt, </em>254 B.R. 389, 392 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio), <em>aff'd, </em>252 B.R. 916 (6th Cir.BAP 2000) (jury awarded plaintiff, who contracted genital warts from ex-husband, $100,000 in compensatory damages on her claim of negligence and $175,000 on her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress); <em>Crawford v. Norris, </em>CV-307-590 (Az. Pima County, Feb. 1997) (jury awarded plaintiff $50,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages for contracting herpes from defendant who failed to warn her that he had the disease); <em>Meany v. Meany, </em>639 So.2d 229, 237 (La.1994) (jury awarded plaintiff $125,000 for ex-husband\u2019s negligence in infecting her with genital herpes and venereal arts); <em>Valeska v. Valeska, </em>CV-85-918-PH, 1985 WL 348314 (Ala., Distr. Court, Montgomery County, Dec. 1985) (jury awarded plaintiff $300,000 on claim that she contracted chlamydia from ex-husband which he knew he acquired during an extramarital affair); <em>Stafford v. Stafford, </em>726 S.W.2d 14, 15 (Tex.1987) (jury awarded plaintiff $257,260 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages on claim that ex-husband infected her with chlamydia). <em>See also Duke v. Housen, </em>589 P.2d 334 (Wy.1979) (reversing jury award of $300,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages on a claim that her boyfriend was grossly negligent when he infected her with gonorrhea because complaint was untimely).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">There is nothing about the facts of the James case that sets it apart from these cases or justifies a significantly higher value. James did not take her claim to a jury but decided to compromise the matter through a settlement. Indeed, at trial Imbesi would have <em>PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL </em>denied the allegations made by James, claimed that they were engaged in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>consensual relationship and testified that he did not believe that the herpes was contagious. In light of the reported verdicts in cases involving claims of negligent infection of a sexual disease, it is my opinion that the settlement of $4.15 million in the James litigation is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">24. In sum, it is my opinion that the settlement reached in the James litigation is not reasonable because it does not represent a good faith compromise of James\u2019s claims and there was an insufficient record upon which Magistrate Judge Scuderi could approve the settlement. Clearly, the amount of the consent judgment would not have been considered by the parties were the insurance companies not the responsible entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">25.
