(CHS), and defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Atlantic County (County), CHS provided healthcare services to inmates incarcerated at the Atlantic County Justice Facility (Facility). Plaintiff Giselle Chrisanthis is a licensed practical nurse who was employed by CHS to provide services at the Facility. Plaintiff alleged that, during the course of her employment, she was sexually harassed by defendant Sean Thomas, who was a supervising corrections officer employed by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Plaintiff brought an action under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49(LAD), against the County, Thomas, and CHS, seeking money damages for \u201chostile work environment sexual harassment.\u201d Judge Higbee granted the County\u2019s and Thomas\u2019s motions for summary judgment. The sole issue on appeal pertains to the summary judgment motion granted in favor of the County. After summary judgment was granted, plaintiff and Thomas entered into a stipulation of dismissal, dismissing with prejudice all claims, including Thomas\u2019s counterclaims, they had against each other. Plaintiff then entered into a consent order dismissing without prejudice her claims against CHS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Recognizing that the LAD applies to employer-employee relationships only and does not protect independent contractors, the judge determined that the proofs were insufficient to establish an employment relationship between plaintiff and the County to support LAD liability. Plaintiff appeals, contending she presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment and the issue, for LAD purposes, of County employment, should have been presented to the trier-of-fact. We disagree with plaintiff and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Located in Mays Landing, the Facility is a \u201cmaximum, medium and minimum detention facility\u201d that houses sentenced and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>sentenced men and women. The jail population averages about 975 persons who require medical, dental and mental health services. During 1995 and earlier, the nursing component of these services was performed by County employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">On September 27, 1995, the County issued a Request For Proposals (RFP), inviting health care contractors to submit proposals to perform medical, dental and mental health services at the Facility beginning on January 1, 1996. The RFP outlined the County\u2019s requirements for services and specified that the \u201cHealth Care Contractor is at all times hereunder acting and performing as an independent contractor to coordinate the provision of professional services within the scope of the authority conferred by this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The RFP also contained a provision concerning \u201cCounty Satisfaction with Health Care Personnel,\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">If the County should become dissatisfied with any health care personnel and/or subcontractor provided by the Health Care Contractor, the Contractor, in recognition of the sensitive nature of correctional services, shall, following receipt of written notice from the County of its dissatisfaction and the reasons thereof, exercise its best efforts to resolve the problem and, if the problem is not resolved, remove the individual about whom the County has expressed its dissatisfaction. The Contractor will be allowed a reasonable time prior to removal to find an acceptable replacement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In response to the County\u2019s RFP, CHS submitted a proposal detailing its plan to provide the requested services. CHS\u2019s proposal specified that it would hire personnel to provide the services, subject to \u201cAtlantic County\u2019s approval,\u201d which evidently meant that the prospective CHS employee was \u201crequired to pass investigations conducted\u201d by the Facility. The proposal also provided that CHS would purchase and maintain all necessary medical and pharmaceutical supplies and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">CHS was awarded the bid, and on December 29, 1995, the County and CHS entered into a contract for provision of medical, dental, and mental health services at the Facility commencing on January 1, 1996. This was a one-year contract, with two one-year renewal options by the County. The contract, by its terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>incorporated the County\u2019s RFP and CHS\u2019s proposal. The contract provided that CHS\u2019s \u201cstatus shall be that of an independent principal and not as agent or employee of the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Plaintiff is a licensed practical nurse. On October 8, 1996, she was hired by CHS to provide medical services at the Facility. Plaintiff was given a CHS employee handbook, which specified her role as a CHS employee at the Facility, including pay, benefits, and CHS\u2019s performance appraisals and disciplinary procedures. The handbook recited that CHS medical employees were \u201cguests\u201d of the Facility and that, as such, they were to observe the \u201crules of security.\u201d The handbook also stated that CHS was sometimes requested by a client \u201cto terminate an employee who is unacceptable ... or violates their rules and regulations. Under such circumstances, the [CHS] employee may be asked to immediately surrender his/her identification badge and be escorted off of the premises and/or permanently barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Plaintiff worked at the Facility on a part-time basis during 1996, 1997, and 1998. During this period, she received favorable performance appraisals from her CHS supervisors, but was also issued a written warning by those supervisors concerning her excessive absenteeism. On May 20, 1999, plaintiff completed a \u201cPosition Description\u201d form with her CHS supervisor, in which she specified the numerous duties required of her job at the Facility. The form is noteworthy because, in completing it, plaintiff essentially acknowledged her role as a CHS employee who provided \u201cnursing care within the correctional facility;\u201d she did not assert in any way that her job constituted County employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">When she began her employment with CHS at the Facility in 1996, plaintiff became acquainted with Thomas, a County employee occupying the position of corrections officer and holding the rank of sergeant. By 1999, Thomas had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. According to plaintiff, on June 21 and July 7, 1999, Thomas touched her in a sexually inappropriate manner, against her wishes, in pursuit of sexual favors. Plaintiff reported the incidents, and Thomas\u2019s superiors at the Facility conducted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>investigation which concluded on September 27, 1999 the allegations were \u201cnot sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On August 16, 1999, the County\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEO), began an investigation into plaintiffs complaint of sexual harassment pursuant to a County policy concerning such allegations against its employees. The County\u2019s EEO officer, Susan L. Gross, issued a report, on January 11, 2000, in which she concluded that \u201c[tjhere is insufficient credible evidence to substantiate the allegations of sexual contact [made] by ... [plaintiff] against Sgt. Thomas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">On December 13, 1999, CHS sent plaintiff a letter notifying her that on December 31, 1999 CHS\u2019s contract with the County would terminate and that, as a result, \u201cyour employment with CHS will cease as of that date.\u201d The motion record establishes that plaintiff knew of no one employed by the County who was responsible for terminating her from her employment with CHS. Thereafter, plaintiff appears to have been immediately hired by Prison Health Solutions (PHS), an independent healthcare provider unrelated to CHS, to provide the same nursing services at the Facility that she provided when she was employed by CHS. However, plaintiff was evidently employed by PHS on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, and PHS never requested her services. According to plaintiff, PHS had been advised by someone in authority at the Facility that she was not to be called for work and was not permitted on the premises of the Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The LAD prohibits employment discrimination, including sexual harassment, by an \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12a. However, the LAD\u2019s definition of \u201cemployee\u201d states only that it \u201cdoes not include any individual employed in the domestic service of any person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5f. The relatively undefined term raises the issue of who is an \u201cemployee\u201d and thus protected by the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">In <em>Carney v. Dexter Shoe Co., </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>1093, 1101-03 (D.N.J.1988), the district court concluded that, because the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tiff shoe salesman was an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the defendant shoe manufacturer and thus his LAD-based claim for age discrimination failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In <em>Pukowsky v. Caruso, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 177-80, 711 A.2d 398 (App.Div.1998), we found, based on our review of judicial interpretations (including <em>Carney) </em>of comparable federal and state anti-discrimination statutes, that \u201cindependent contractors are not to be considered \u2018employees\u2019 within the meaning of the LAD, and are therefore not entitled to avail themselves of its protections.\u201d Plaintiff cannot and does not deny she was an employee of CHS. She asserts she had a \u201cdual employer relationship\u201d with both CHS and the County, resulting mainly from the County\u2019s control over her work for CHS at the Facility. <em>Kurdyla v. Pinkerton Sec., </em>197 <em>F.R.D. </em>128, 134 (D.N.J.2000) (\u201cA plaintiff may be an employee of more than one entity. Courts have recognized that an individual may be an employee of multiple employers under a particular statute, including anti-discrimination enactments.\u201d); <em>Hebard v. Basking Ridge Fire Co. No. 1, </em>164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 83-84, 395 A.2d 870 (App.Div.1978), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>294, 405 A.2d 838 (1979) (indicating in a LAD case that \u201c[tjhese indicia of control, both fiscal and supervisory, warrant the conclusion that the members of the company are, in effect, employees of the township, as well as of the company, notwithstanding the fact that the members are not paid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Whether plaintiff can be considered a County employee for LAD purposes requires application of a twelve-factor test. <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182-83, 711 A.2d 398. This test was derived from the test set out in <em>Franz v. Raymond Eisenhardt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>732 <em>F.Supp. </em>521, 528 (D.N.J.1990), which was itself taken from the test used in <em>E.E.O.C. v. Zippo Mfg. Co., </em>713 F.2d 32, 37 (3d Cir.1983). As we stated in <em>Pukowsky, </em>the federal courts have developed a number of tests to interpret statutes that contain the word \u201cemployee,\u201d but do not adequately define the term. <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 711 A.2d 398. \u2018All of these tests are substantially similar to the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>which was developed by the Third Circuit in <em>Zippo </em>and applied [by the district court in New Jersey] in <em>Carney.\u201d Ibid.; see DaBronzo v. Roche Vitamins, Inc., </em>232 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>306, 315-17 (D.N.J.2002) (describing concisely the similarities and differences among the various federal tests); <em>Kurdyla, supra, </em>197 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 133 n. 13; <em>Walker v. Correctional Med. Sys., </em>886 <em>F.Supp. </em>515, 520-22 (W.D.Pa.1995). These are the factors in what we will refer to as the <em>Pukowsky </em>test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">(1) the employer\u2019s right to control the means and manner of the worker\u2019s performance; (2) the kind of occupation \u2014 supervised or unsupervised; (3) skill; (4) who furnishes the equipment and workplace; (5) the length of time in which the individual has worked; (6) the method of payment; (7) the manner of termination of the work relationship; (8) whether there is annual leave; (9) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the \u201cemployer;\u201d (10) whether the worker accrues retirement benefits; (11) whether the \u201cemployer\u201d pays social security taxes; and (12) the intention of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\"><em>[Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182-83, 711 A.2d 398.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u201cThe most important of these factors is the first, the employer\u2019s right to control the means and manner of the worker\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Franz, supra, </em>732 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 528; <em>accord Walker, supra, </em>886 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 521; <em>Carney, supra, </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Applying the <em>Pukowsky </em>test to the facts before us, it is readily apparent that eight of the factors plainly indicate that plaintiff was not a County employee. There is little dispute that plaintiffs activities <em>as a nurse </em>were always supervised by a CHS nursing manager and not by a County employee during her employment at the Facility. As recognized by the trial judge, the \u201cbottom line is her work was as a nurse and the County did not direct how she could nurse.\u201d (Factor 2) Plaintiff held the skilled position of a licensed practical nurse, a skill not possessed by County employees at the Facility. This dissimilarity in job skills weighs in favor of classifying plaintiff as an employee of the independent contractor (CHS) and not as a County employee. (Factor 3) <em>DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 F.Supp.2d at 317 (where the court concluded under Factor 3 that the removal of asbestos was a specialized job skill possessed by the employees of an independent contractor and not by the employees of a vitamin manufacturer).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Plaintiff was employed as a nurse at the Facility only for about three years. This relatively brief period of employment militates against finding her to be a County employee, whose term of employment at a defined job position could reasonably be expected to have lasted longer. (Factor 5) <em>DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 F.Supp.2d at 317 (where the court determined that the thirty-year span of employment of an asbestos-removal worker indicated that he was more readily classifiable as an employee than as an independent contractor). Plaintiff was hired by CHS, paid by CHS, provided vacation, insurance, and retirement benefits by CHS, and had the employer\u2019s portion of her Social Security taxes paid by CHS. (Factors 6, 8,10 and 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The most apparent expression of the intention of the parties is contained in the contract between them and in the County\u2019s RFP, which was made part of that contract. Both documents specify that the selected Health Care Contractor (CHS) is to act as an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d who provides medical services to the Facility. (Factor 12)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Although eight of the twelve factors plainly indicate that plaintiff was employed by an independent contractor and could not therefore be considered a County employee for purposes of establishing liability under the LAD, the <em>Pukowsky </em>test requires more than the listing of factors on either side of the ledger with victory going to the side garnering the most factors. A \u201cprincipled application\u201d of the factors and a consideration of which factors are more important under the peculiar circumstances of each case are required. <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 711 A.2d 398; <em>Carney, supra, </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1099 (\u2018Where there exist several indicia of employee status, the mere presence or absence of two or three of them \u2014 without a reasoned balancing of the above factors \u2014 cannot dictate the outcome of a summary judgment motion\u201d). We address the remaining four factors mindful of this consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Factor 4 concerns who furnishes the equipment and workplace. The contract between CHS and the County provided that CHS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>would purchase and maintain all necessary medical and pharmaceutical supplies and equipment. Because employers usually provide all supplies and equipment needed by their employees, this factor appears to weigh in favor of classifying CHS as an independent contractor and thus disqualifying plaintiff from classification as a County employee. However, the factor includes a workplace component and, because plaintiff performed all of her services at the Facility, the County obviously furnished plaintiffs workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In <em>Walker, </em>a nurse, who was employed by an independent contractor healthcare provider to work at a county jail, filed a federal suit against the county under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2Q00e, <em>et seq., </em>alleging racially discriminatory application of security policies by the jail\u2019s management. <em>Walker, supra, </em>886 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 518-19. To establish the county\u2019s liability, the nurse asserted that she was, in effect, an employee of the county because of the control exercised by the county over her work. <em>Id. </em>at 519-24. In response, the county asserted that she was an independent contractor and thus not protected under the federal statute. <em>Ibid. </em>In determining that the plaintiff-nurse should <em>not </em>be classified as an independent contractor and that her complaint should not be dismissed on summary judgment on that ground, the court reasoned that the \u201cworkplace\u201d factor supported the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that she was a county employee because the plaintiff \u201calways reported to the Jail, and all her work was performed there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The trial judge in our case refused to attach any significance to the fact that the County provided the Facility as plaintiff\u2019s workplace, observing that \u201cmost independent contractors work somewhere else;\u201d that is, they perform their jobs in places not under their control. The judge noted that the plaintiff in <em>Pukowsky </em>worked at a skating rink owned and controlled by someone else. In <em>Pukowsky, </em>we did not consider that circumstance as weighing in favor of classifying the plaintiff as an employee of the rink and, instead, determined that the plaintiff was an independent contractor. <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 711 A.2d 398; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>also DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 F.Supp.2d at 317 (determining that the fourth factor indicated that the plaintiff was an independent contractor, the court essentially ignored the fact that the manufacturer furnished the plaintiffs workplace, but relied instead on a contract provision requiring the plaintiffs employer to furnish all equipment and supplies).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">CHS describes itself as a \u201cphysician-owned health care management organization serving today\u2019s correctional market.\u201d Its business is to provide health care workers to correctional facilities to provide health care services to inmates. Naturally, CHS\u2019s employees work at an assigned correctional facility. To paraphrase Willie Sutton, it\u2019s where the inmates are.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the circumstances of this case, the furnishing of a workplace by the owner of the correctional facility is a necessary part of the contractual arrangement. This reduces any weight attributable to this factor. It does not nullify the factor. If, for example, an organization such as CHS sent its employees to different correctional facilities at different times, the workplace component of this factor might be eliminated completely. But where an employee, such as plaintiff in this case, is hired for the specific purpose of working at a particular location, and that location is, as a matter of fact, her exclusive workplace, this component comes into play. Overall, it is entitled to only low relative weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In <em>Walker, </em>the court mentioned the workplace factor as favoring county employment, but gave no analysis and ascribed no relative weight to that factor. <em>Walker, supra, </em>886 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 521. It is evident that the factor to which the court ascribed the greatest weight in finding that a material issue of fact existed as to whether the plaintiff was a county employee was Factor 1, the right of control, the most important factor, <em>ibid., </em>which we will discuss later in this opinion. We are satisfied that Factor 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>weighs heavily, although not entirely, in favor of independent contractor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Factor 7 concerns the manner of termination of the work relationship. Contrary to plaintiffs argument, the County did not terminate plaintiffs employment with CHS. The County\u2019s contract with CHS expired on December 31, 1999, and CHS terminated plaintiffs employment as of that date. Thus, on its face, the circumstances surrounding the ending of plaintiffs \u201cwork relationship\u201d at the Facility indicate only that the independent contractor (CHS) lost the County contract to provide medical services at the Facility and that it discharged its employees as a result of the contract\u2019s expiration. Nothing suggests that, because of that circumstance, plaintiff must be classified as a County employee and not as an employee of the independent contractor (CHS).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Plaintiff, however, appears to assert that the County, by \u201cterminating her security clearance\u201d following her termination by CHS, effectively prevented her from enjoying a work relationship as an employee of PHS, which was CHS\u2019s successor as the health care contractor at the Facility. According to plaintiff, because she lacked a security clearance, she was never called by PHS for an assignment at the Facility. This turn of events could be viewed under Factor 7 as an exercise of control by the County over plaintiffs employment through its effective disruption of plaintiffs work relationship with PHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">On a related issue, plaintiff argues that the provision in the County\u2019s RFP allowing for the removal of a CHS employee if the County is \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with that employee, also shows control by the County over plaintiffs work relationship with CHS. This degree of control encompasses the possible termination of that relationship based on the amorphous concept of \u201cdissatisfaction.\u201d This contract provision could also implicate Factor 7. The <em>Da-Bronzo </em>decision suggests otherwise, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In <em>DaBronzo, </em>an asbestos removal worker, who was employed by an independent contractor and working at a vitamin manufacturer\u2019s plant, brought an action against the manufacturer under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8 (CEPA). <em>DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 F.Supp.2d at 307-09. The worker was barred by the manufacturer from entering the plant\u2019s premises and was thereafter fired by his contractor-employer. <em>Ibid. </em>In determining that the worker could not sue the manufacturer under CEPA because he was not the manufacturer\u2019s employee but only an independent contractor, the court relied very heavily upon the rationale of <em>Pukowsky. DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 312-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In considering Factor 7, the court in <em>DaBronzo </em>noted that the vitamin manufacturer\u2019s contract with the worker\u2019s contractor-employer contained a provision allowing the manufacturer to \u201cremove\u201d from the manufacturer\u2019s premises any of the contractor\u2019s workers that the manufacturer \u201cdeems incompetent or a hindrance to the proper progress of work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317-18. The provision further stated that the manufacturer\u2019s written consent would be required before the removed employee would be allowed to return. <em>Ibid. </em>The provision did not empower the manufacturer to fire the contractor\u2019s employee. <em>Id. </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The contract provision in <em>DaBronzo </em>is similar to the one in the County\u2019s RFP, which allowed for the exclusion of CHS workers if the County became \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with them. Also similar is the circumstance that the RFP\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d provision did not expressly empower the County to terminate the workers\u2019 employment with CHS. Additionally, the vitamin manufacturer\u2019s requirement for its written consent before a removed worker could be readmitted to the manufacturer\u2019s premises is similar to the withdrawal of plaintiffs security clearance for entry into the Facility. That is, the County effectively withdrew its consent for plaintiffs entry to the Facility and would have had to give such consent again before plaintiff could begin her work for PHS at the Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In <em>DaBronzo, </em>the court determined essentially that, because the contractor-employer retained the \u201cultimate authority\u201d to terminate the worker from its employ, the manufacturer did not exert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>sufficient control over the contractor-employer\u2019s termination decision to trigger the worker\u2019s classification as the manufacturer\u2019s employee under Factor 7. <em>Ibid. </em>The court stressed that \u201cthe contract speaks only to ... [the manufacturer\u2019s] right to remove an employee from the work site,\u201d and not to any right by the manufacturer to actually terminate the worker\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>at 318. The same is true here. The RFP\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d provision only allowed the removal of a CHS employee by the County and did riot require the termination of that employee\u2019s employment by CHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Thus, in <em>DaBronzo, </em>the manufacturer\u2019s act of barring the worker from its premises pursuant to a contract provision did not function to make the worker an employee of the manufacturer for purposes of establishing CEPA liability. Similarly, neither the presence of the \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d provision in the County\u2019s RFP, nor the withdrawal of plaintiffs security clearance by the County, should function to make plaintiff an employee of the County for purposes of establishing liability under the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Another circumstance that weighed in the court\u2019s decision in <em>DaBronzo </em>was that the \u201cPlaintiff has submitted no evidence that ... [the contractor-employer] could not have employed him at another work site or in another capacity,\u201d rather than terminating his employment after he was barred from the manufacturer\u2019s premises. <em>Ibid. </em>The situation is similar here. Plaintiff has presented no evidence showing that PHS cannot employ her as a nurse at another job site or in another job capacity. The record is very scant concerning PHS and its dealings with the County and with plaintiff. PHS is not a party in this litigation. This dearth of proof undermines plaintiffs argument concerning her lockout from the Facility during her employment by PHS. We conclude that Factor 7 indicates that plaintiff was the employee of the independent contractor (CHS) and not a County employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Factor 9 concerns whether the work is an integral part of the business of the \u201cemployer.\u201d We find unpersuasive plaintiffs argument that because a correctional facility is legally required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>provide health services to inmates, that function is an integral part of its business. We agree with Judge Higbee\u2019s finding that the \u201cmost central business of the County was to imprison and control convicted criminals. Secondary to this [the County] had to, of course, provide laundry, food and medical services but this is not the primary function of the facility.\u201d Plaintiff presents no authority requiring the County to utilize County employees to provide medical services to the inmates at the Facility. Provision of medical services to inmates is an incidental, not integral, function of the Facility. Factor 9 indicates that plaintiff was functioning as the employee of an independent contractor and not as a County employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Factor 1, the most important factor, concerns the employer\u2019s right to control the means and manner of the worker\u2019s performance. The trial judge rejected plaintiffs contention that the County controlled her job performance to such an extent that she should be considered a County employee for LAD purposes. The judge reasoned that, while the County necessarily controlled access and movement throughout the Facility for security reasons, \u201c[t]hese security type measures apply to anyone who enters the jail and don\u2019t create an employer/employee relationship.\u201d Instead, the \u201cbottom line is her work was as a nurse and the County did not direct how she could nurse.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Plaintiff relies heavily on <em>Walker </em>in contending that the County\u2019s exercise of control over her activities as a nurse at the Facility was so substantial that she should be classified as a County employee for LAD purposes. This reliance is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In <em>Walker, </em>the district court considered a \u201ccontrol\u201d factor identical to <em>Pukowsky </em>Factor 1 in the course of determining whether the nurse there was an independent contractor or a county employee. <em>Walker, supra, </em>886 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 520-21. The court determined that the nurse could be considered a county employee for liability purposes under Title VII because of contract provisions explicitly setting out such control. The specific con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tract language the court relied on provided that CMS, the healthcare independent contractor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">shall perform as directed by the .. Warden or his designee. Warden shall limit his directives to matters pertaining to: termination of CMS personnel ...; calling meetings, and security matters; and directing CMS to examine a specific inmate. However, CMS shall perform in accordance with the Warden\u2019s directives regardless of whether CMS perceives said directives to be beyond the Warden\u2019s authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 521.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The contract thus provided for the Warden\u2019s direct control over the independent contractor\u2019s nursing functions at the jail. Included among those control elements were the \u201cright to terminate\u201d the contractor\u2019s personnel, as well as the right \u201cto assign additional duties\u201d and the right to direct the provision of medical services to a particular inmate. <em>Ibid. </em>The court viewed these express contractual rights as sufficient proof of control by the county to support an inference that the plaintiff-nurse was a county employee for liability purposes under Title VII. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The case before us is different. The contract between the County and CHS did not include express provisions like those in <em>Walker, </em>granting the County the right to terminate, assign, or direct CHS employees. Thus, <em>Walker </em>does not support a finding that plaintiff should be considered a County employee under Factor 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\"><em>DaBronzo </em>is also unavailing. In <em>DaBronzo, </em>the plaintiff asserted that the vitamin manufacturer \u201ccontrolled the means and manner of employment and supervised his work,\u201d pointing to specific control provisions of the contract between the manufacturer and his contractor-employer, as well as the fact that the manufacturer \u201cmandated compliance with its standard operating procedures and oversaw plaintiffs completion of his work.\u201d <em>DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 F.Supp.2d at 316-17. The court rejected this argument, reasoning that, because the plaintiff \u201cindependently exercised his expertise in removing and handling asbestos,\u201d the \u201cfirst factor does not weigh in favor of either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Unlike the situation in <em>DaBronzo, </em>there are no contract provisions in the contract between the County and CHS giving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>County the kind of control that the vitamin manufacturer had over the <em>DaBronzo </em>plaintiff. Like the situation in <em>DaBronzo, </em>the proofs show that plaintiff in the case before us independently exercised her expertise as a nurse in performing her job at the Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In rejecting the <em>DaBronzo </em>plaintiffs argument concerning the manufacturer\u2019s \u201cmandated compliance with its standard operating procedures\u201d and its oversight of the completion of the plaintiffs work, the court found that \u201cthere were some indicia of control or supervision by [the manufacturer], but that this supervision was limited to ensuring compliance with safety procedures, promoting efficiency, managing its budget, establishing administrative processes, and maintaining control over its premises.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In our case, most of the control measures that plaintiff asserts were exercised over her by the County may fairly be characterized as the County\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with its safety and security procedures at the Facility and to maintain control over the Facility\u2019s premises. As in <em>DaBronzo, </em>such efforts by the County do not result in an exercise of control under Factor 1 sufficient to turn plaintiff into a County employee for LAD purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The \u201ccontrol\u201d considerations underlying Factor 1 indicate that plaintiff was not a County employee, but that she was an employee of independent contractor CHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we employ \u201cthe same standard that governs trial courts in determining whether summary judgment was properly granted.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Schragger, Lavine, Nagy &amp; Krasny, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 89, 773 A.2d 1164 (App.Div.2001). Thus we view the facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, giving that party the benefit of all inferences that may be drawn in his or her favor, and determine whether those facts are \u201csufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Johnson, supra, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 89-90, 773 A.2d 1164; <em>see R. </em>4:46-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Absolute and clear-cut unanimity on all twelve <em>Pukowsky </em>factors is not required to support summary judgment. In <em>Zippo, supra, </em>713 F.2d at 38, the court held that although the length of time plaintiffs worked as district managers and their exclusive product arrangement and economic dependence are indicative of employee status, the presence of those factors, when balanced against other factors strongly supporting independent contractor status, would not defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In <em>Carney, supra, </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1098-99, the court stated, \u201cIt is not necessary for Dexter in order to prevail to demonstrate each of the foregoing factors weighs in favor of \u2018non-employee\u2019 status____Where there exist several indicia of employee status, the mere presence or absence of two or three of them \u2014 without a reasoned balancing of the above factors \u2014 cannot dictate the outcome of a summary judgment motion.\u201d Thus, despite the long-term status and exercise of some control by Dexter, summary judgment determining the salesman was an independent contractor was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Likewise, in <em>DaBronzo, supra, </em>232 F.Supp.2d at 315-18, the court granted summary judgment determining independent contractor status, despite the presence of some control, thirty years longevity, provision of exclusive worksite, and the presence of a contractual provision authorizing the manufacturer to require removal of any employee of the contractor, a right that the manufacturer exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">In <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 711 A.2d 398, we found that none of the twelve factors favored employee states, but noted that \u201c[t]o the extent that the answer to any such factors may have indicated such a relationship, the overwhelming balance of factors clearly supports the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff was not an employee of Parkway.\u201d There, disposition was by involuntary dismissal at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b). <em>Id. </em>at 172, 711 A.2d 398. The same standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>applies to summary judgment motions. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In the case before us, some circumstances arguably point towards employee status, <em>e.g., </em>some control, provision of workplace, the contractual right of removal provision, and the alleged revocation of plaintiffs security clearance. To whatever extent these factors exist, their weight pales in comparison to that of the other factors. With respect to the most important Factor 1, any control exercised by the County is incidental to plaintiffs work as a nurse, and is for security, safety and administrative purposes. Only CHS controls plaintiffs activities as a nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We are convinced that no rational factfinder, applying the twelve-factor <em>Pukowsky </em>test, could find that plaintiff was a County employee for LAD purposes. Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Turning to plaintiffs remaining argument, she contends that the County assumed liability for protecting Plaintiff from sexual harassment under the LAD by undertaking all investigative efforts following plaintiffs report of harassment. Thus, plaintiff essentially asserts that, because the County conducted an investigation into her sexual-harassment allegations against its employee, Thomas, the County treated her like a County employee and is therefore liable to plaintiff under the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The trial judge rejected this argument, determining that the County had a legal obligation to investigate the allegations and that the County\u2019s fulfillment of that obligation did not result in plaintiffs classification as a County employee for LAD-liability purposes. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">\u201cIf the employer had actual or constructive knowledge of the [sexual] harassment and did not promptly and effectively act to stop it, [the employer] will be liable\u201d under the LAD. <em>WoodsPirozzi v. Nabisco Foods, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 268, 675 A.2d 684 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>(App.Div.1996) (citing <em>Lehmann v. Toys 'R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 622, 626 A.2d 445 (1993)). The County was under a legal duty to investigate and resolve the allegations made by plaintiff against Thomas in order to avoid possible liability under the LAD. While plaintiff was not a County employee, her allegations put the County on notice about purported sexual harassment by Thomas and the possibility that such harassment may also have extended to County employees who had been or were still being harassed by Thomas, but had not yet complained. There was thus a basis for the County\u2019s investigation even though plaintiff was not a County employee. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> Plaintiffs counsel represented at oral argument that CHS has gone out of business and is uninsured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\"> Willie Sutton, the infamous bank robber, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, \"because that's where the money is.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
