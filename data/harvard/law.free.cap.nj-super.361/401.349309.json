Count two charged attempted aggravated sexual assault on S.M. in September 1999, and counts three and four charged endangering S.M. in June and September, respectively. These three counts were dismissed under the negotiated disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">On this appeal, defendant argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss counts one and, two of the indictment because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(1) requires physical presence [of the defendant]\u201d and \u201cbecause the phrase \u2018upon the actor\u2019s instruction\u2019 is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied.\u201d He also argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss counts three through fourteen of the indictment [the endangering counts] because the State did not present any evidence that defendant was in the victims\u2019 physical presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">We reject the arguments, and affirm the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Marilyn C. Clark in her opinion of March 28, 2001, 361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 825 A.2d 1224 (Law Div.2001). <em>See also State v. Hackett, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>66, 77-81, 764 A.2d 421 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
