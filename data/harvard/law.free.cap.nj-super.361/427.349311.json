Wood pled guilty to one count of first degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a, and one count of third degree escape, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement. The terms of the agreement left open the NERA issue for the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">At the plea hearing, defendant gave the following factual basis for the first degree robbery charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Q. And at that time did you come into contact with an individual by the name of William Bay, B-A-Y?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Q. Did you commit a theft upon William Bay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">Q. And in the course of committing that theft did you use a stun gun, as it\u2019s commonly known?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">Q. Do you understand that to use such a stun gun in the course of committing a theft constitutes the first degree crime of armed robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-13\">Q. How do you plead to that charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-14\">A. Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">CROSS EXAMINATION BY COUNTY PROSECUTOR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">Q. Mr. Wood, tell me about the stun gun. Is this one of those guns that you actually have to touch the skin and then pull the trigger to \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 zap or give a charge to the person that you were using it on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-17\">A. I don\u2019t know what you mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-18\">Q. Well, there\u2019s a couple kinds of stun guns. There\u2019s the kind that shoot out electrodes and they stick in somebody and they\u2019ve got wires attached to them, and there\u2019s the kind that you actually have to hold it up to them in order for the electrical shock to be given. Which kind was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-19\">A. It\u2019s powered by a six-volt battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-20\">Q. Did it have things and tentacles that shot out from it or was it hand-held only?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ako\">A. Hand held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-21\">Q. Hand held only?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-22\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-23\">Q. Okay. And you actually have to touch the person and it leaves a little bum, a swelling mark; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-24\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-25\">Q. Okay. And you did this to Mr. Bay more than once; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-26\">A. Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-27\">Q. You actually used this stun gun on Mr. Bay a number of times; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-28\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-29\">At the time of the robbery, the victim was age 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-30\">At the sentencing hearing, the trial court held that a stun gun was a deadly weapon for NERA purposes and sentenced defendant to a term of twenty years, with an eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility. The court based its decision on the inclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>sion of stun gun within the definition of \u201cweapon\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1r.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Under the relevant section of the pre-amendment NERA, a person was subject to the provisions of the statute if he was sentenced for committing a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d The term \u201cviolent crime\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">[A]ny crime in which the actor causes death, causes serious bodily injury as defined in subsection b. of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-1, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon. \u201cViolent crime\u201d also includes any aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault in which the actor uses, or threatens the immediate use of, physical force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">For the purposes of this section, \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d means any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Analytically, we will approach this matter the same way Judge Pressler did in <em>State v. Austin, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 762 A.2d 1052 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>294, 773 A.2d 1157 (2001). In reaching the conclusion that an inoperable BB gun was not a deadly weapon under NERA, Judge Pressler noted that unlike the Graves Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which expressly incorporates the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1f, section d in NERA does not. She thus reasoned that \u201cthe legislative intention to impose the severe penalty of parole ineligibility until eighty-five percent of the base term has been served was clearly intended to be limited to those truly violent crimes encompassed by its careful and circumscribed definition.\u201d <em>State v. Austin, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 491, 762 A.2d 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">In this case, the NERA definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d requires a judicial finding that the stun gun was, in the manner it was used or was intended to be used, \u201cknown to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d The record before us does not support such a finding. It is undisputed that despite being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>submitted to repeated electrical discharges, the victim did not sustain \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-1b. The only reference to the stun gun\u2019s capacity to inflict pain and injury comes from a comment made by defendant himself that the weapon was powered by a \u201csix-volt battery.\u201d Without more, this record is legally insufficient to support a finding that the stun gun used here fits the NERA definition of deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We remand this matter to the sentencing court to permit the State to present evidence that this stun gun, in the manner it was used or intended to be used, was known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. Such evidence may consist of expert testimony and technical data provided by the stun gun\u2019s manufacturer, including the manufacturer\u2019s use and safety instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-13\"> The case originally came before us on July 23, 2002, as part of the excessive sentencing oral argument calendar. Judge Stern ordered the parties to fully brief this issue and directed that the case be re-listed and resolved by formal opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-11\"> This refers to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c which mandates a parole ineligibility term of between one-third and one-half of the base term if a firearm is used in the commission of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
