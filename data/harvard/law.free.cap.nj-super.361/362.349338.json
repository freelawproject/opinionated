Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). The trial court granted the motion, and plaintiffs appeal. We affirm because the allegations of the complaint do not meet the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25, which governs the negligence liability of accountants to third parties for all transactions entered into after March 17, 1995. <em>L </em>1995, c. 49, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">I \u2014 THE COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The complaint, read indulgently, as is required by <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elec. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989), alleges the following facts. Plaintiffs, corporations owning and operating supermarkets, are members or stockholders of Twin County Grocers, Inc. (\u201cTwin County\u201d), a wholesale distributor of supermarket products, described as \u201ca cooperative organization, serving the mutual needs of its supermarket members ----\u201d Most of the individual owners of plaintiff corporations were also members of Twin County\u2019s Board of Directors. Twin County engaged defendant as its accountant for the primary purpose of conducting audits \u201cto provide reasonable assurance of detecting errors and irregularities that were material to Twin County\u2019s financial statements.\u201d The annual audits were performed negligently for four years, and as a result failed to disclose that one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the directors had perpetrated numerous frauds \u201cthat adversely impacted Twin County and members of the Twin County Cooperative, including the plaintiffs.\u201d Defendant \u201cknew that members of Twin County\u2019s Board of Directors, including plaintiffs\u2019 owners, relied on defendant\u2019s audit services in connection with their individual store operations including, but not limited to, their individual decisions regarding the nature and extent of their continued participation in the Twin County cooperative.\u201d Each plaintiff suffered \u201cunique damages that may not otherwise be recoverable by Twin County____\u201d Plaintiffs separately allege that based on the above facts defendant breached a fiduciary duty to inform them about the fraudulent acts \u201cabout which defendant should have made itself aware.\u201d Finally they seek relief as third-party beneficiaries of the engagement agreement, alleging that defendant had a \u201cwritten obligation to report directly to Twin County\u2019s Board of Directors and their respective operating entities ----\u201d However, the engagement letters make no reference to reporting to anyone other than Twin County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">II \u2014 LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The subject of an accountant\u2019s liability to third parties for negligence in performing work for a client has generated a variety of judicial and legislative reactions. For comprehensive discussions, see <em>Bily v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>3 Cal.4th 370, 11 <em>Cal.</em>Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745 (1992), and Christine M. Guerci, <em>Annotation, Liability of Independent Accountant to Investors or Shareholders, </em>48 <em>A.L.R. </em>5th 389 (1997). In New Jersey, the subject was initially resolved as a matter of common law. <em>H. Rosenblum, Inc. v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 461 A.2d 138 (1983). Now it is governed by legislation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG\">a. As used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>(1) \u201cAccountant\u201d means a person who is registered as a certified public accountant pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1977, c. 144 (C. 45:2B-1 et seq.), or an accounting firm which is organized for the practice of public accounting pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1977, c. 144 (C. 45:2B-1 et seq.) and P.L.1969, c. 232 (C. 14A:17-1 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">(2) \u201cBank\u201d means a State or federally chartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, a group of such institutions or its affiliates, subsidiaries, co-lenders, successors or assigns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">(3) \u201cClient\u201d means the party directly engaging an accountant to perform a professional accounting service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anp\">(4) \u201cProfessional accounting service\u201d includes, but is not limited to, the compilation, review, certification, or audit of, or the expression of a professional opinion or other reporting on, a financial statement or other information covering a specified period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">(5) <em>\u201cSpecified transaction\u201d means a particular transaction between </em>a <em>client and a claimant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">b. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, no accountant shall be liable for damages for negligence arising out of and in the course of rendering any professional accounting service unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">(1) The claimant against the accountant was the accountant\u2019s client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">(2) The accountant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">(a) knew at the time of the engagement by the client, or agreed with the client after the time of the engagement, that the professional accounting service rendered to the client would be made available to the claimant, <em>who was specifically identified to the accountant in connection with a specified transaction made by the claimant;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">(b) knew that the claimant intended to rely upon the professional accounting service <em>in connection with that specified transaction; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">(c) directly ejqpressed to the claimant, by words or conduct, the accountant\u2019s understanding of the claimant\u2019s intended reliance on the professional accounting service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">(3) In the case of a bank claimant, the accountant acknowledged the bank\u2019s intended reliance on the professional accounting service and the client\u2019s knowledge of that reliance in a written communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">When called upon to interpret a statute, the \u201coverriding goal has consistently been to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Young v. Schering Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>16, 25, 660 A.2d 1153 (1995). When the language is clear, we generally rely on its plain meaning. <em>O\u2019Connell v. State, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>484, 488, 795 A.2d 857 (2002). However, if \u201cliteral application of the language used would lead to results incompatible with the legislative design,\u201d we are obliged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cto give effect to the obvious purpose of the Legislature ----\u201d <em>New Capitol Bar &amp; Grill Corp. v. Div. of Employment Sec., 25 N.J. </em>155, 160, 135 A.2d 465 (1957). In that circumstance \u201c \u2018words used may be expanded or limited according to the manifest reason and obvious purpose of the law. The spirit of the legislative direction prevails over the literal sense of the terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In <em>Rosenblum, supra, </em>the Court determined that in certain circumstances \u201caccounting firms should no longer be permitted to hide within the citadel of <em>privity </em>and avoid liability for their malpractice.\u201d 93 <em>N.J. </em>at 353, 461 A.2d 138 (emphasis added). The statute with which we are concerned, N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-25, was introduced by its sponsor for the specific purpose of limiting the effect of that decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">This bill would limit accountants\u2019 liability to third parties for the accountants\u2019 negligent acts. Although accountants\u2019 civil liability has historically been limited by common law, which required that there must be privity (a direct relationship) between an accountant and any party bringing suit against him, recent case law has weakened this concept. In [H.] <em>Rosenblum, Inc. v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 461 A.2d 138 (1983), the New Jersey Supreme Court expanded the scope of accountants\u2019 liability to include all \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d plaintiffs, such as stockholders and potential investors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Thus, an accountant providing professional services to a client is vulnerable to lawsuits by virtually any member of the investing public at large, regardless of whether the accountant had any previous relationship with that person or any knowledge that the person would rely on the services the accountant rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">The sponsor believes that this situation is particularly unjust in light of the fact that an accountant is rarely the primary wrongdoer in negligence cases. Instead, the accountant is sued because he failed to detect the fraud of his client. In many cases, an accounting firm is sued because it has \u201cdeep pockets,\u201d in contrast to its client, which may have become insolvent by the time the investors realize they have been defrauded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">This bill would restore the concept of privity to accountants\u2019 liability towards third parties. The bill provides that an accountant will not be liable for damages for negligence to any person unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">(1) the person was the accountant\u2019s client, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">(2) the accountant knew that the person (who was specifically identified to the accountant at the time the services were rendered) intended to rely upon the accountant\u2019s services in connection with a specified transaction, and the accountant expressed his understanding of that reliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\"><em>[Statement attached to S.826 </em>(March 10, 1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The sponsor\u2019s intentions in that regard are clearly expressed in the statute, and literal application of the words of the statute to the circumstances of this case is entirely consistent with the overall legislative design.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Under subsection b(2) of the statute, the accountant must know when engaged, or must thereafter agree with the client, that his work will be made available to a \u201cspecifically identified\u201d claimant \u201cin connection with a specified transaction made by the claimant.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25 (b)(2)(a). And subsection a(5) limits the transactions to those occurring between the claimant and the client <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25(a)(5). Further, the accountant must have known that the claimant \u201cintended to rely\u201d on his services \u201cin connection with that specified transaction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25 (b)(2)(b). But even such knowledge is not enough. There can be no liability unless the accountant used words or conduct \u201cdirectly expressed to the claimant,\u201d which establish the accountant\u2019s understanding of the claimant\u2019s intended reliance on his work. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-25(b)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The complaint neither alleges expressly, nor implies, satisfaction of any of the elements of this statute. Consider first its description of plaintiffs\u2019 transactions giving rise to damages: \u201cindividual store operations\u201d and \u201cthe nature and extent of their continued participation in the Twin County cooperative.\u201d Since the first category does not allege a transaction between the client, Twin County, and the claimant, subsection a(5) is not satisfied. While the second category is suggestive of a transaction between each plaintiff and client, it hardly describes, or suggests, a particular transaction, which is fatal under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Although the complaint alleges defendant\u2019s knowledge respecting the private business interests of plaintiffs, it does not allege that plaintiffs were specifically identified as possible claimants. Moreover, the assertion that plaintiffs\u2019 relied on the audit services in connection \u201cwith their individual decisions regarding the nature and extent of their continued participation\u201d in Twin City, quite obviously fails to allege any specific transaction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>which plaintiffs were going to engage with the client. Therefore, the complaint fails to satisfy subsection b(2)(a) and (b). Finally the complaint does not contain any language even suggesting that defendant provided any expression directly to plaintiffs, let alone one reflecting an understanding that they intended to rely on the audits. Therefore, subsection b(2)(c) has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments respecting the doctrines of fiduciary duty and third-party beneficiary contracts as bases for this suit are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11^3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\"> Since the engagement letters are referenced in the complaint, they could be considered without converting the motion into one for summary judgment. <em>In </em>re <em>Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
