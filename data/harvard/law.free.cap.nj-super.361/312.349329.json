We conclude that a determination of the adequacy of a seller\u2019s instructions and warnings requires consideration of all the seller\u2019s communications to intended users, including demonstrations of the product, and therefore a product demonstration that violates a seller\u2019s safety warnings may be found to have undermined the effectiveness of those warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Defendant Yamaha Motor Corporation, U.S.A. (Yamaha) distributes a jet boat called the \u201cExciter 270.\u201d Defendant Stumpy\u2019s Sales &amp; Service, Inc. (Stumpy\u2019s) is a retail dealer of Yamaha products with premises in Neptune.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The owners manual given to purchasers of the Exciter jet boat includes various warnings concerning the product\u2019s use. One warning states: \u201cDo not operate the boat in rough water ...; this may lead to an accident causing injury or death.\u201d Another warning states: \u201cDo not go over a water-ski jump, or attempt any other kind of jumping maneuver with the boat, since you risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>injuring yourself or damaging your Jet Boat.\u201d There also are warning labels affixed to the boat, one of which states: \u201cNever attempt jumps with this boat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">To promote sales of its jet boat, Yamaha established a demonstration program under which \u201cdemos\u201d were sold to its dealers under favorable terms for use in showing the product to prospective customers. At the outset of this program, the Yamaha district sales representative, Gerald L. Solensky, Jr., came to Stumpy\u2019s in June 1997 to show its salesmen how to operate the boat. During his presentation, Solensky reviewed the benefits of the product, including \u201csafety features,\u201d with Stumpy\u2019s salesmen and took them for a ride. Solensky drove the boat for part of the ride and then turned the controls over to John Wehrle, Stumpy\u2019s sales manager. The ride started in the river adjoining Stumpy\u2019s premises, where the water was fairly calm, but after a while, Wehrle drove the boat out an inlet into the ocean. At this point, the boat was driven over ocean waves and jumped at least partially out of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">During Solensky\u2019s presentation, one of the Stumpy\u2019s salesmen in the boat was Keith Barrett. According to Barrett, the ocean was \u201cextremely rough\u201d that day, with approximately three-foot high waves where the boat was being operated. In a deposition, Barrett testified that Solensky \u201cencouraged [Wehrle] to go out into the ocean and they were actually trying to tip [the] boat and jump it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On March 28, 1998, Barrett gave a demonstration ride of the Yamaha jet boat to plaintiff and her boyfriend. This was apparently the first time Barrett had shown the boat to a customer after Solensky\u2019s demonstration ride. According to Barrett, he followed substantially the same route in his demonstration that Solensky had taken in his demonstration to Stumpy\u2019s salesmen, first riding on the smooth water of the river and then entering the ocean surf. Barrett claims that the ocean was calmer when he made his demonstration to plaintiff than during his ride with Solensky and that he did not drive the boat as fast as Wehrle had driven it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>However, plaintiff claims Barrett made a conscious effort to cause the boat to go airborne and it \u201cactually came out of the water.\u201d Plaintiff alleges she was bounced out of her seat when Barrett drove the boat over a wave, as a result of which she suffered personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Plaintiff subsequently brought this personal injury action against Yamaha, Barrett, Stumpy\u2019s and Evelyn Stumpf, a principal of Stumpy\u2019s. After completion of discovery, Yamaha moved for summary judgment on the ground that its owners manual and the labels on the boat contained adequate warnings concerning the dangers posed by unsafe use and that the sole cause of the accident was Barrett\u2019s \u201cjumping\u201d the boat in \u201crough waters,\u201d contrary to those warnings. The trial court granted Yamaha summary judgment, stating that any improper demonstration by Solensky of the use of the jet boat did not \u201cabsolve\u201d Barrett and Stumpy\u2019s from responsibility for \u201cany deviation from basic safety precautions which clearly they had an obligation to adhere to.\u201d Plaintiff settled her claims against Stumpy\u2019s and its employees and then filed this appeal from the summary judgment in favor of Yamaha.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">A claim that a product seller has failed to provide adequate warnings concerning the dangers posed by the product\u2019s use is now governed by the Products Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -7. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-2(b) subjects a product seller to liability for a product which \u201cfail[s] to contain adequate warnings or instructions.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-4 provides that \u201c[a]n adequate product warning or instruction is one that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have provided with respect to the danger and that communicates adequate information on the dangers and safe use of the product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, the persons by whom the product is intended to be used____\u201d This statutory standard for determining the adequacy of a product safety warning is essentially a codification of the common law standard. <em>See Grier v. Cochran W. Corp., </em>308 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 317, 705 A.2d 1262 (App.Div.1998). The Product Liability Act governs \u201cany claim or action ... for harm caused by a product, irrespective of the theory underlying the claim, except actions for ... breach of an express warranty.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1(b)(3); <em>see Tirrell v. Navistar Int'l, Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 398, 591 A.2d 643 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>390, 599 A.2d 166 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u201c[A]n adequate warning is one that includes the directions, communications, and information essential to make the use of a product safe.\u201d <em>Freund v. Cellofilm Props., Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>229, 243, 432 A.2d 925 (1981). In some circumstances, a safety warning in an owners manual or other printed materials accompanying a product does not constitute an adequate warning; the seller also may be required to place safety warnings directly on the product. <em>Michalko v. Cooke Color &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>386, 403, 451 A.2d 179 (1982). In fact, pictorial symbols, rather than simply words, may be required to adequately convey safety warnings to some anticipated users. <em>See Campos v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>198, 208, 485 A.2d 305 (1984). Consequently, a trier of fact must consider all communications from a seller to anticipated users of a product in determining whether the seller has discharged its duties as a \u201creasonably prudent [product seller].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-4. \u201cQuestions of reasonableness in determining the adequacy of warnings are ordinarily for the jury to resolve.\u201d <em>Grier, supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 317, 705 A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Although a retailer is not ordinarily an intended user of the products it sells, Yamaha clearly intended Stumpy\u2019s employees to use the demo jet boat. In fact, the purpose of Yamaha\u2019s demonstration program was to promote sales of the jet boat by having its dealers\u2019 salesmen demonstrate the boat\u2019s operation to prospective customers. Therefore, those employees were intended users of the boat, to whom Yamaha owed a duty to provide adequate warnings concerning its safe use. If Barrett or another one of those intended users failed to operate the boat properly because Yamaha provided inadequate warnings concerning its safe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>use, Yamaha may be held liable to a third party such as plaintiff who suffers injuries as a result of a user\u2019s negligent operation of the boat. <em>See Tirrell, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 402-03, 591 A.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Yamaha\u2019s communications to Stumpy\u2019s and its employees concerning the use of the demo jet boat were not limited to the printed instructions and warnings accompanying the product. Instead, Yamaha sent its regional sales representative, Solensky, to show Stumpy\u2019s employees how to operate the boat. Moreover, according to Barrett, Solensky encouraged Wehrle in the presence of Barrett and the other Stumpy\u2019s salesmen to operate the boat in a manner that violated Yamaha\u2019s printed safety warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">As recognized by a leading products liability treatise, \u201c[w]hat might otherwise be an adequate warning can be undermined and made ineffective by counteracting representations.\u201d 1 Jerry J. Phillips &amp; Robert E. Pryor, <em>Products Liability </em>\u00a7 6.07 at 6-45 (rev.2002). Moreover, such \u201c[cjounteracting representations are not limited to words.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also </em>M. Stewart Madden, <em>The Enduring Paradox of Products Liability Law Relating to Prescription Pharmaceuticals, </em>21 <em>Pace L.Rev. </em>313, 330 (2001) (\u201cAn otherwise suitable warning may be vitiated by the conduct of the manufacturer or those acting at the direction of the manufacturer if they promote the product in such a fashion as to obscure or lessen the cautionary impact of the seller\u2019s warnings.\u201d); <em>cf. Baldino v. Castagna, </em>505 <em>Pa. </em>239, 478 A.2d 807, 810 (1984) (\u201c[A] drug manufacturer can be held to have breached his duty of reasonable care by promoting its product in such a way as to nullify printed warnings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In this case, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Solensky\u2019s live demonstration of the use of the jet boat constituted a \u201ccounteracting representation\u201d that undermined the effectiveness of the printed warnings accompanying the product. By encouraging Wehrle to drive the boat into the rough water of the ocean and jump waves, Solensky may have conveyed the impression to Barrett and the other Stumpy\u2019s salesmen that Yamaha did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>not consider this method of operation of the \u201cExciter\u201d jet boat to be as dangerous as its printed warnings indicated and that such a method of operation could be used to promote sales. We also believe that a reasonable trier of fact could find that Solensky\u2019s presentation was a proximate cause of Barrett\u2019s alleged unsafe demonstration of the jet boat to plaintiff and therefore that Yamaha should be held jointly liable with Stumpy\u2019s for plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment in Yamaha\u2019s favor and remand the case for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
