He entered a guilty plea on August 18, 2000, to count two \u2014 fourth-degree criminal sexual contact. As part of the plea agreement, the State dismissed counts one, three and four of the indictment, and recommended a sentence of 365 days in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On September 21, 2000, in accordance with the plea recommendation, the court imposed 365 days incarceration. Defendant received credit for the 362 days he had already served. The court also imposed appropriate penalties and assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Fourth-degree criminal sexual contact qualifies as a predicate sexually violent offense for civil commitment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26(b), a provision of the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.24 to -27.38. Before defendant was released from custody, the New Jersey Attorney General petitioned the court to have defendant civilly committed pursuant to the SVPA. On October 4, 2000, a judge found probable cause to believe that defendant was a sexually violent predator and defendant was committed to, and remains in, the Special Treatment Unit, also referred to as the Northern Regional Unit, located in Kearny, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Based on his involuntary commitment, defendant moved to vacate his sentence and retract his guilty plea. On January 5, 2001, the court denied his motion. It is from this decision that defendant has appealed. He raises the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA TO FOURTH DEGREE CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONTACT BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO ADVISE HIM THAT HIS PLEA IN THIS CASE WAS LIKELY TO RESULT IN AN INDETERMINATE TERM OF CONFINEMENT UNDER THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR ACT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT\u2019S ATTORNEY FAILED TO ADVISE HIM THAT HIS PLEA WOULD SUBJECT HIM TO THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR ACT, HE WAS DEPRIVED OF THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL UNDER THE SIXTH AMENDMENT. (Not Raised Below).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We have reviewed the record in light of defendant\u2019s contentions and the applicable law. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm. We reject his ineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice to his right to pursue a post-conviction relief petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The charges against defendant arose out of an incident which took place on August 15, 1999. Defendant\u2019s version of the facts differs somewhat from the victim\u2019s version. According to the presentence report, defendant said he was outside of the Stern Light Inn in Folsom when he observed a woman get into an automobile accident in the parking lot. The woman approached defendant and asked for a ride home. Defendant agreed to take her home, but he first went back into the bar to have another drink; when he returned to his car the woman had gone. Defendant then went to a local convenience store to buy cigarettes where he saw the woman and offered to drive her home. According to defendant, the woman offered to give defendant money for gas but defendant said \u201cno, I can suggest you hit me off.\u201d After the victim told him she was married, defendant replied \u201chow about you jerk me off\u2019; he pulled down his sweat pants and exposed himself. Defendant told the police that the woman started \u201cjerking him off\u2019 and then placed her mouth on his penis. Defendant reported to the police that he never forced the woman to give him oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">According to the victim, who was intoxicated when first questioned by the police, after she voluntarily got into the car with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>defendant, he told her that she owed him something and that she had to \u201csuck his dick.\u201d The victim stated that she was afraid and felt that if she \u201cdidn\u2019t do it he would hurt or even kill\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">At the plea hearing, defendant admitted to an act of sexual contact. He responded \u201cyes\u201d to the following question by the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">Q. With regard to ... count two ... it alleges that on or about the 15th day of August 1999, in the Township of Buena Vista, you did commit an act of sexual contact with a [P.S.], and you used physical force or coercion for the purpose of sexually arousing or sexually gratifying yourself or to degrade or humiliate her. Is that true?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The following colloquy then took place among defendant, his attorney and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">[Defense counsel] At the time you came in contact with her was she intoxicated? [Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">[Defense counsel] Did you and her somehow get involved in \u2014 you were going to be taking her home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">[Defense counsel] During the course of that ride home did you coerce her to touch you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">[Defense counsel]^-in your private area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-15\">[Defense counsel] Did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-16\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-17\">[Defense counsel] And it was her desire not to do that, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-18\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-19\">[Defense counsel] And this occurred while you were eithef taking her \u2014 it was like one or two o\u2019clock in the morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-20\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-21\">[Defense counsel] And you were taking her home, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-22\">[Defendant] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-23\">[The Court] And was this for the purpose of sexually gratifying yourself or humiliating her, either one of those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-24\">[Defendant] Yes. Sexually gratifying myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-25\">At the plea hearing there was some discussion of defendant\u2019s obligations under Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4, but no discussion of defendant\u2019s potential commitment pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ant to the SVPA. The plea form also made no reference to the SVPA. The judge explained to defendant the consequences of his plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">On Indictment 99-11-2217 do you understand that this is a fourth-degree crime, and it carries with it a potential statutory maximum penalty of 18 months [in] New Jersey State Prison? But instead the prosecutor has recommended that in return for a plea of guilty by you at this point in time at sentencing she would recommend a sentence of 365 days in the New Jersey State Prison. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Defendant sought release pending sentencing because he had already served 362 days of the 365 day recommended sentence. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">Well, there\u2019s one snag, and ... it\u2019s a major snag. That is that, as you know, once he would be sentenced to the Department of Corrections to be assigned to the New Jersey State Prison system he would have to go through that process and be subject to their parole and not the County parole. Now I\u2019m not saying he would serve any more time, but what I am saying is ... he would be subject to their parole rules, as he knows. And if he has a prior record of any type, then that could affect their attitude towards parole; and you know that, as well as I.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The court added that \u201cthe worst that could happen is he maxes out and max-out would be 365.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">In the Petition for Civil Commitment under the SVPA, the August 15, 1999, offense was listed as the \u201cpredicate offense.\u201d The petition also recited that two physicians had identified defendant as a sexually violent predator who had a diagnosis which included anti-social personality disorder, frotteurism, polysubstance dependence, dysthymia, sexual sadism, and impulse disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Defendant was born on July 7, 1969, and was thirty-one years old at the time the petition was filed. The petition included defendant\u2019s prior criminal and juvenile history. As a juvenile, defendant had four adjudications for criminal sexual contact between August and October 1984. His adult criminal history began when he was arrested in October 1987 and charged with distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. He pled guilty and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>placed on probation. In January 1988, he was charged with one count of \u201ccriminal attempVsexual assault\u201d and two counts of criminal sexual contact. In February he was charged with another count of criminal sexual contact. When he was sentenced in July 1988, the January charges were dismissed; he pled guilty to the single February charge of criminal sexual contact. The court imposed a sentence of three years probation, with 364 days in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In 1990, defendant committed a series of offenses which resulted in his confinement at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (Avenel). In May he was charged with one count of criminal sexual contact. In October he was charged with one count of \u201ccriminal attempt/aggravated sexual assault,\u201d one count of aggravated assault, one count of aggravated criminal sexual contact, and one count of criminal sexual contact. The October charges arose when, while walking with a woman he knew, he touched her breasts, threw her to the ground, put his knees on her shoulders, exposed his penis and grabbed her hands, trying to place them on his penis. When she tried to scream, he \u201cstuffed grass into her mouth and choked her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">He was later charged with one count of criminal sexual contact and one count of sexual assault from an incident which arose in November when he approached an unknown victim and attempted to insert his finger into her anus over her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Of these 1990 charges, defendant pled guilty to the May charge of criminal sexual contact; the October charges of criminal attempt/aggravated sexual assault, and aggravated assault; and the November criminal sexual contact charge. He was sentenced for these offenses on October 11, 1991. The court imposed a total of seven years at Avenel with three and one-half years of parole ineligibility. His probation arising out of his July 1988 sentence was later violated and the court sentenced him to a concurrent eighteen months at Avenel. Defendant remained at Avenel until sometime in 1997 when he \u201cmaxed out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>According to his mental evaluation at Avenel, defendant\u2019s behavior had been characterized by \u201cpoor judgment and impulsivity ... he [was] apt to go to extremes to try to avoid facing unpleasant aspects of reality.\u201d He admitted to sexually assaulting women since he was approximately fifteen years old. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t even explain it.\u201d Upon seeing \u201ca pretty girl walk by\u201d he would say to himself, \u201chow would it feel to have some of that?\u201d He said \u201cI would expose my penis and have them try to do things for me, like masturbate me or oral sex.\u201d He admitted to grabbing women on their breasts or buttocks. He estimated that he had approximately thirty to forty victims through the years. With the exception of one, all of his victims were strangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">At the motion hearing to retract defendant\u2019s guilty plea, defense counsel argued that had defendant known that his guilty plea \u201cwould have been a condition precedent [to commitment under the SVPA] ... he would not have pled [guilty]. We would have tried the case.\u201d Defense counsel considered the \u201cfacts of this case ... extremely weak.\u201d He explained that defendant only agreed to the plea because he had already served 362 days of what he anticipated would be a 365 day sentence. Defense counsel quoted defendant as saying \u201cI don\u2019t have to do any more time, it\u2019s a criminal sexual contact, I\u2019ll take the deal, it\u2019s 365, I\u2019ve got 362 in, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The judge denied the motion. He reasoned that the civil commitment was a collateral consequence of the plea and the court was not required to advise a defendant of the possibility of commitment pursuant to the SVPA before a plea was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">On appeal, defendant asserts he should be able to withdraw his plea, because the trial court failed to advise him of the possible SVPA commitment. Defendant argues commitment under the SVPA is a penal consequence of his guilty plea which must be disclosed before the court takes the plea. The State, through the Atlantic County Prosecutor and the Attorney General, argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>commitment pursuant to the SVPA is merely a collateral consequence of the plea, not a penal consequence, which does not warrant disclosure before a defendant pleads guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A motion to withdraw a plea after sentencing should be granted only to correct a manifest injustice. <em>R. </em>3:21-1; <em>State v. </em>Fischer, 38 <em>N.J. </em>40, 48, 183 A.2d 11 (1962); <em>State v. Deutsch, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>190, 198, 168 A.2d 12 (1961). Factors relevant to a determination of whether a defendant should be permitted to withdraw a guilty plea are: the materiality of the mistake or omission and its resulting prejudice to defendant, defendant\u2019s guilt, and manner of entry of the plea. <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 135-36, 430 A.2d 957 (App.Div.1981). When considering whether a mistake is material, \u201c[a] distinction is often drawn between the penal consequences of a plea and potential or actual \u2018collateral consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wilkerson, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 224, 728 A.2d 827 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>128, 741 A.2d 96 (1999). To withdraw a plea, the mistake relied upon must relate to the penal consequences of the plea since a mistake as to the collateral consequences, while it may have a significant effect on the defendant, is not material. <em>State v. Vieira, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>681, 686, 760 A.2d 840 (Law Div.2000) (quotation omitted); see <em>also State v. Howard, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>113, 122, 539 A.2d 1203 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In <em>State v. Heitzman, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 622, 508 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 527 A.2d 439 (1987), we determined that the defendant was not entitled to have his guilty plea set aside on the grounds that neither the judge nor counsel told him that he could lose his state job if he pled guilty to the crime. Judge King, speaking for the court, stated that a defendant \u201cneed be informed only of the penal consequences of his plea and not the collateral consequences, such as loss of public or private employment, effect on immigration status, voting rights, possible auto license suspension, possible dishonorable discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>from the military or anything else.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Garcia, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 337-38, 727 A.2d 97 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Against these standards, we examine the SVPA to determine whether commitment pursuant to the statute is penal or merely a collateral consequence of defendant\u2019s guilty plea. In enacting the SVPA, the Legislature modified the existing involuntary civil commitment process, recognizing \u201cthe need to commit those sexually violent predators who were not mentally ill as defined by the general commitment statute, but who nevertheless \u2018pose a danger to others should they be returned to society.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Commitment of E.D., </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 456, 803 A.2d 166 (App.Div.2002) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.25c). \u201cSaid another way, the intent of the Legislature in enacting the SVPA was to broaden the reach of New Jersey law to afford protection to society from those sexually violent predators who pose a danger as a result of a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes them likely to engage in repeated acts of predatory sexual violence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The SVPA provides for the commitment of sexually violent predators, as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26(b), \u201cin an environnjent separate from persons\u201d otherwise committed or confined. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.25d. The Division of Mental Health Services in the Department of Human Services provides treatment which \u201cshall be appropriately tailored to address the specific needs of sexually violent predators.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.34b. To commit a person involuntarily under the SVPA, the State must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the individual poses \u201ca threat to the health and safety of others if he or she were found ... to have serious difficulty in controlling his or her harmful behavior such that it is highly likely that the individual will not control his or her sexually violent behavior and will reoffend.\u201d <em>In re Commitment of W.Z., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>109, 130, 801 A.2d 205 (2002). Once confined, \u201can individual should be released when a court is convinced that he or she will not have serious difficulty controlling sexually violent behavior and will be highly likely to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the plan for safe reintegration into the community.\u201d <em>Ibid.; N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32c(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The procedure for commitment of a person convicted of a sexually violent offense under the SVPA is set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.28. The Attorney General <em>\u201cmay </em>initiate a court proceeding for involuntary commitment\u201d under certain conditions. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). If the person is a patient in a \u201cshort-term care facility, State or county psychiatric facility or special psychiatric hospital,\u201d the Attorney General may submit to the court a \u201cclinical certificate for a sexually violent predator completed by a psychiatrist at the facility at which the person is a patient and the screening certificate which authorized admission of the person to the facility.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.28a. If this section is not used, the Attorney General may initiate a court proceeding to have a person, including an inmate scheduled for release upon expiration of his or her maximum term of incarceration, involuntarily committed as a sexually violent predator, \u201cby submission to the court of two clinical certificates for a sexually violent predator, at least one of which is prepared by a psychiatrist.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.28b &amp; c.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Given this background, we agree with the State that commitment under the SVPA is a collateral consequence of the guilty plea. Whether to initiate a court proceeding for involuntary commitment under the SVPA is discretionary with the Attorney General, not mandatory. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.28. At oral argument, we were informed by the State that there are over 10,000 convicted sex offenders in New Jersey, yet only approximately 700 of their cases have been reviewed for possible commitment pursuant to the SVPA, of which 240 persons are currently committed. Conviction of a predicate offense is therefore not a true indicator of whether the Attorney General will initiate a commitment action under the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">A conviction, adjudication, or a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, of a sexually violent offense only satisfies one of the criteria necessary to be committed as a sexually violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>predator. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26(b). The State must also prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person suffers from a mental abnormality, or personality disorder, which makes the person \u201clikely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 133, 801 A.2d 205. The key to commitment is not the predicate offense, but the present mental condition which creates a likelihood of future sexually violent behavior. <em>See In re Commitment of P.C., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 580, 794 A.2d 211 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Moreover, it is not solely the mental condition of the person that is dispositive, but whether the mental condition affects the individual\u2019s ability to control his or her sexually harmful conduct. <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 130, 801 A.2d 205. As Justice LaVecchia explained in <em>W.Z., </em>\u201cour SVPA is essentially the same as the Kansas statute examined in <em>Hendricks </em>in that it \u2018requires evidence of past sexually violent behavior and a present mental condition that creates a likelihood of such conduct in the future if the person is not incapacitated.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 801 A.2d 205 (quoting <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>346, 357, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 2080, 138 L.Ed.2d 501, 512 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>Hendricks, </em>the United States Supreme Court noted that the Kansas Legislature intended the statute to create a civil proceeding; it described the law as a \u201ccivil commitment proceeding\u201d and placed it in the Kansas civil, rather than criminal, code. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 361, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2082, 138 L.Ed.2d at 516. The Court further found that the statute did not have a punitive purpose because civil commitment under the statute was neither retributive nor was it intended to deter criminal activity. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 362, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2082, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 517. The Court pointed out that the State did not base commitment on a person\u2019s criminal intent but rather on a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d or \u201cmental abnormality.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the Court reasoned that because the statute addressed those persons who were unable to control their behavior, they were not deterred by the threat of commitment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>This same reasoning supports a conclusion that like the <em>Hendricks </em>sexually violent predator statute, the SVPA is similarly civil, rather than criminal, in nature. Like the statute in <em>Hendricks, </em>our SVPA is part of the involuntary civil commitment process, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.25c, placed by the Legislature in the civil code, Title 30, Institutions and Agencies, not the criminal code, Title 2C. Nor does the SVPA promote deterrence because those who are subject to commitment are unable to control their criminal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Also like <em>Hendricks, </em>the consequence of commitment pursuant to the SVPA rests upon uncertain future events. Commitment does not automatically follow a conviction for a sexually violent offense. In any given case, the Attorney General may decline to initiate commitment proceedings pursuant to the SVPA. A convicted sex offender may not be diagnosed with the requisite mental abnormality or personality disorder to warrant commitment. The State may not prove by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant has serious difficulty controlling his or her sexual behavior. And a court may not find the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Commitment under the SVPA is not punitive; rather, it is subject to an independent regulatory process imposed for purposes of treatment and protection of the public. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.34b. In deciding whether the New Jersey sex offender registration and community notification requirements of Megan\u2019s Law were punitive, the Court in <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 43, 662 A.2d 367 (1995) recognized that although a statute may indirectly adversely affect, even severely, some of those subject to its provisions, the statute does not become punitive solely because it has a punitive impact. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">[T]he laws\u2019 validity, measured against the various constitutional attacks, depends on whether they inflict punishment. The determination of punishment has ordinarily consisted of several components. An initial inquiry is whether the legislative intent was regulatory or punitive: if the latter, that generally is the end of the inquiry, for punishment results; if the former, the inquiry changes to whether the impact, despite the legislative intent to regulate, is in fact punitive, usually analyzed in terms of the accepted goals of punishment, retribution and deterrence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Despite some ambivalent language, a punitive impact \u2014 one that effects retribution or accomplishes deterrence \u2014 renders the law or the specific provision of the law that is attacked, punishment, but only if the sole explanation for that impact is a punitive intent. In other words, the law is characterized as regulatory in accordance with the legislative intent even if there is some punitive impact, if that impact is simply an inevitable consequence of the regulatory provisions themselves. The law is characterized as punitive only if the punitive impact comes from aspects of the law unnecessary to accomplish its regulatory purposes \u2014 that is, if the law is \u2018excessive,\u2019 the excess consisting of provisions that cannot be justified as regulatory, that result in a punitive impact, and that, therefore, can only be explained as evidencing a punitive intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 46, 662 <em>A.2d </em>367].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The Court concluded that the challenged provisions of Megan\u2019s Law did not constitute punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 77 n. 18, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">A similar analysis of our SVPA results in the same conclusion. The SVPA aims to protect the public and provide treatment to sexually violent predators. <em>See In re Commitment of J.P., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 461, 772 A.2d 54 (App.Div.2001); <em>P.C., supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 579, 794 A.2d 211. The legislative intent is regulatory, not punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Beyond question, a civil commitment constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty. <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 801 A.2d 205. Confinements under the SVPA, being indeterminate, constitute an onerous impairment of a person\u2019s liberty interest. <em>In re Commitment of D.L., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 90, 797 A.2d 166 (App.Div.2002). However, confinement under the SVPA does not render the statute penal or punitive. As the Court said in <em>Poritz, </em>the punitive impact only becomes dispositive if punitive intent is the sole explanation for the statute. <em>Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 662 A.2d 367. Here, the legislative intent is manifested by a desire to both protect the public and treat the individual-impacts that are regulatory rather than penal. The punitive impact does not derive from \u201caspects of the law unnecessary to accomplish its regulatory purposes.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">We conclude that a commitment under the SVPA is not penal. The predicate offense is only one of the regulatory prerequisites for involuntary civil commitment. The legislative intent underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ing the SVPA remains regulatory. Confinement as a sexually violent predator is a collateral consequence which may, but not necessarily will, be sought by the Attorney General upon conviction of an underlying predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Decisions of other states support these propositions. <em>See Martin v. Reinstein, </em>195 <em>Ariz. </em>293, 987 P.2d 779 (Ct.App.1999); <em>People v. Moore, </em>69 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>626, 81 <em>Cal.Rptr</em>.2d 658 (1998); <em>Watrous v. State, </em>793 So.2d 6 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2001); <em>In re Detention of Lindsay, </em>333 <em>Ill.App</em>.3d 474, 267 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>167, 776 N.E.2d 304 (2002); <em>People v. Norris, </em>328 Ill.App.3d 994, 263 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>178, 767 <em>N.E.</em>2d 904, <em>appeal denied, </em>202 Ill.2d 646, 272 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>350, 787 N.E.2d 165 (2002); <em>In re Detention of Campbell, </em>139 Wash.2d 341, 986 P.2d 771 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1125, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>880, 148 L.Ed.2d 789 (2001); <em>Abolafya v. State, </em>114 <em>Wash.App. </em>137, 56 P.3d 608 (2002); <em>State v. Zanelli, </em>212 <em>Wis.2d </em>358, 569 <em>N.W.2d </em>301 (Ct.App.), <em>review denied, </em>215 <em>Wis.2d </em>423, 576 N.W.2d 279 (1997). The trial judge was not required to inform defendant of his possible future commitment pursuant to the SVPA when defendant entered his guilty plea. Consequently, defendant has not demonstrated a manifest injustice as to permit him to withdraw his plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Finally, we turn to whether defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s alleged failure to advise him of the potential for commitment pursuant to the SVPA constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. To state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 10, of the New Jersey Constitution, a defendant must first estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>lish that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>State v. Timmendequas, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>515, 598-99, 737 A.2d 55 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>858, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>136, 151 L.Ed.2d 89 (2001); <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 67, 519 A.2d 336 (1987) (referencing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) and <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>648, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)). Second, a defendant must show a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different but for counsel\u2019s deficiencies. <em>Timmendequas, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 598-99, 737 A.2d 55; <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 691-96, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2066-69, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Generally, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are better raised in a collateral proceeding \u201cbecause such claims involve allegations in evidence that lie outside the trial record.\u201d <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). Here, to evaluate defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it will be necessary to go beyond the record to determine, among other things, what action defendant would have taken had he known before entering his plea of the potential for commitment pursuant to the SVPA. We therefore affirm defendant\u2019s conviction without prejudice to any subsequent PCR proceeding he may pursue. <em>See State v. Sparano, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 419, 592 A.2d 608 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\"> These identical issues are currently pending before the New Jersey Supreme Court. <em>See State v. Bellamy, </em>(A-3568-00T4) (App.Div. July 30, 2002), <em>certif. granted, </em>175 <em>N.J. 76, </em>812 A.2d 1108 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Although the failure to advise a defendant of possible commitment pursuant to the SVPA does not render the plea involuntary, we recognize that commitment may have severe consequences for certain defendants. Therefore, the better practice would be for both the trial judge and defense counsel to advise a defendant who could be affected by the SVPA of the consequences of the SVPA\u2019s application. <em>See Watrous, supra, </em>793 So.2d at 10-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
