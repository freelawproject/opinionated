As a result, all five fingers on her right hand were amputated at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which is the joint nearest the hand. The doctors who attended petitioner attempted to reattach her fingers but were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Petitioner filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The parties entered into a settlement agreement under which petitioner was awarded the costs of her medical treatment and temporary disability benefits. The parties also agreed that petitioner was entitled to 15% partial, permanent disability for psychiatric disability and 100% partial, permanent disability for loss of her right hand, which totaled 335 weeks of partial, permanent benefits. However, they were unable to reach agreement concerning petitioner\u2019s entitlement to the 30% \u201camputation bonus\u201d for loss of a hand provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21). Consequently, the parties submitted the issue of petitioner\u2019s entitlement to this additional benefit to a judge of compensation for decision. The judge concluded that because \u201cthe loss of fingers is not specifically mentioned in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21)],\u201d petitioner was not entitled to an amputation bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">Amputation between the elbow and the wrist shall be considered as the equivalent of the loss of a hand and amputation at the elbow shall be considered equivalent to the loss of the arm. Amputation between the knee and ankle shall be considered as the equivalent of the loss of a foot, and amputation at the knee shall be considered equivalent to the loss of the leg. <em>An addition,al amount of 30% of the amputation award shall be added to that award to compute the total award made in amputations of body members, </em>provided, however, that this additional amount shall not be subject to legal fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The final sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21), providing for the amputation bonus at issue in this appeal, was added to this subsection as part of a comprehensive package of amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>142, enacted in 1980, <em>L. </em>1979, c. 283.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the Sponsor\u2019s Statement, the primary purpose of these amendments was to \u201cmake available additional dollars for benefits to seriously disabled workers while clarifying and tightening awards of compensation benefits based upon insignificant permanent partial disabilities.\u201d <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement'to S. 802 of1979.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In <em>Trinter v. Esna Div., </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 452 A.2d 678 (App.Div.1982), we held that entitlement to the amputation bonus provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) is limited to the amputation of a hand, arm, foot or leg and therefore cannot be claimed by a worker who has a finger amputated. We concluded that even though the term \u201cbody member\u201d used in the final sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) ordinarily would include a finger, \u201creading \u00a7 12(c) as a whole in conjunction with the available legislative history requires a construction that the term as used in \u00a7 21 is only meant to refer to hands, arms, feet and legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 452 A.2d 678. In reaching this conclusion, we considered it significant that the provision for an amputation bonus was added to a subsection of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c) which deals exclusively with amputations of the hand, arm, foot and leg:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Given the paragraph structure of \u00a7 12(e) and the division of topics among those paragraphs, the logical conclusion is that if the added sentence was to apply to body members other than hands, arms, feet and legs (the members treated in the first sentence of paragraph (21)), it would have been set off in a numbered paragraph of its own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 319-20, 452 A.2d 678.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We also noted that this construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201412(c)(21) was consistent with the general intent of the 1980 amendments to provide increased benefits only to the most seriously injured workers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">[T]he number of weeks of compensation to be paid for amputation of a thumb, \u25a0finger or toe was not changed by the 1980 amendments. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(1) to (7). The number of weeks of compensation to be paid for loss of a hand, arm, foot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>or leg, however, was increased by the 1980 amendments. This comports with the expressed intent of the Legislature to make increased awards to \u201cmore seriously injured workers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 320-21, 452 A.2d 678.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Although it is clear under <em>Trinter </em>that petitioner would not be entitled to an amputation bonus if her accident had resulted in the amputation of only one of her fingers, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201412(c)(8) provides for an award of the same partial, permanent benefits for amputation of a \u201cthumb and first and second fingers ... or four fingers\u201d as for a hand. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201412(c)(1) to (11) establishes the following schedule for partial, permanent disability benefits for \u201clost members\u201d: o</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Number of Weeks\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Lost Member Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">1. Thumb............................................... 75</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">2. First finger (commonly Called index finger)............... 50</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">3. Second Finger......................................... 40</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">4. Third finger........................................... 30</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">5. Fourth Finger (commonly called little finger).............. 20</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">6. Great toe............................................. 40</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">7. Toe, other than a great toe.............................. 15</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">8. Hand, or thumb and first and second fingers (on one hand) or four fingers (on one hand)................245</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">9. Arm..................................................330</p>\n<p id=\"b133-20\">10. Foot .................................................230</p>\n<p id=\"b133-21\">11. Leg..................................................315</p>\n<p id=\"b133-22\">Thus, under this statutory scheme, a worker such as petitioner, who has all five fingers on one hand amputated, is awarded the same partial, permanent benefits provided for loss of a hand under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(8) rather than the lesser benefits that would be awarded for loss of each of the individual amputated fingers under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(1) to (5). The question, therefore, is whether the legislative determination that the loss of all (or nearly all) fingers on a hand should be treated as equivalent to loss of the hand applies only to the calculation of partial, permanent benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(1) to (5) and (8), or also extends to the amputation bonus provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-23\">As indicated by the previously quoted sponsor\u2019s statement, one of the primary objectives of the 1980 amendments to the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>was to provide additional benefits to the most seriously disabled workers. The Legislature viewed the amputation of a major body member, including a hand, as a prime example of a serious disability for which there should be such increased benefits. The joint statement appended to the committee substitute for the senate and assembly bills, enacted as chapter 283 of the Laws of 1979, specifically noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Calculated on the basis of the statewide average weekly wage used to determine 1979 awards, maximum awards to workers for work-related amputations would increase by approximately these amounts: arm \u2014 $12,000.00 to $55,340.00; leg\u2014 $11,000.00 to $52,825.00; hand \u2014 $9,200.00 to $33,440.00; and foot \u2014 $8,000.00 to $28,100.00---- New Jersey\u2019s rank among the 48 contiguous states for these maximum amputation awards would improve as follows: arm, 47th to 6th; leg, 47th to 5th; hand, 47th to 13th; and foot, 46th to 13th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">To provide these' additional benefits to workers who suffer work-related amputations, the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-12(c) in two ways. .First, it increased the number of weeks of partial, permanent disability benefits for loss of a hand, arm, foot or leg, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Lost Member Number of Weeks\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">&amp; Hand, or thumb and first and second fingers (on one hand) or four fingers (on one hand)...........[230] 245</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">9. Arm.............................................[300] 330</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">10. Foot ............................................[200] 230</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">11. Leg.............................................[275] 315</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Second, it added the final sentence to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) which provides an amputation bonus for an amputation of any of those same four major body members. Since the Legislature added the provision for an amputation bonus for an amputation of a major body member at the same time it increased the partial, permanent disability benefits awardable for loss of those same members, it is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended \u201chand\u201d to have the same meaning for purposes of determining eligibility for an amputation bonus under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) as for partial, permanent disability benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>This conclusion is supported by the 1973 Report of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law Study Commission, which originally recommended the provision for an additional benefit for an amputation of a major body member. This report stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">Experience has shown that the loss of any three fingers of the same hand actually constitutes a very serious restriction to a worker as a functioning unit and is comparable to loss of use of the entire hand. The Commission therefore recommends that R.S. 34:15-12(e)8 be amended to read \u201chand or any 3 fingers on one hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Recognizing that loss of a major member by amputation ... constitutes a loss greater than total loss of use of that member, the Commission recommends that amputation of any major member, <em>including the hand as defined above, .. </em>be compensated by allowing an additional 25% of the benefits provided in the schedule for the particular member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\"><em>[Report of the New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Study Commission, </em>pp. 8-9 (1973) (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Although the amendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) to provide additional workers\u2019 compensation benefits for amputations of body members was not enacted until seven years later, the 1980 amendments to the Act, including the amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21), were largely based on the recommendations contained in this report. <em>See Perez v. Pantasote, Inc., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>105, 112-14, 469 A.2d 22 (1984). Therefore, this report reinforces our conclusion that \u201chand\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21) should be interpreted to have the same meaning as under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">We reject respondent\u2019s argument that this interpretation of \u201chand\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201412(c)(21) is inconsistent with the first sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(21), which states: \u201cAmputation between the elbow and the wrist shall be considered as the equivalent of the loss of a hand and amputation at the elbow shall be considered equivalent to the loss of the arm.\u201d The apparent purpose of this provision, which predated the 1980 amendments to the Act, was to provide legislative guidance concerning the circumstances under which a worker is entitled to the partial, permanent benefits for loss of an arm provided under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201412(c)(9), rather than the lesser benefits provided under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(8) for loss of a hand. Thus, the first sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>34:15-12(c)(21) serves a purpose similar to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201412(c)(8), which describes the circumstances under which a worker is entitled to partial, permanent benefits for loss of a hand rather than the lesser benefits provided for the loss of individual fingers under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-12(c)(1) to (5). Therefore, we conclude that a worker such as petitioner, who suffers a work-related amputation of fingers that qualifies for an award of benefits for loss of a hand under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-12(c)(8), also qualifies for an award of an amputation bonus under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15\u201412(c)(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Accordingly, the final decision of the judge of compensation denying petitioner\u2019s claim for an amputation bonus is reversed and the case is remanded for a determination of the amount of that bonus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\"> Although these amendments were part of the laws of 1979, they were not signed into law by the Governor until January 10, 1980, and therefore are commonly referred to as the 1980 amendments to the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
