The summary judgment order, dated May 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>2002, declared the provisions of the City\u2019s Ordinance 1214-2000 (the Ordinance) prohibiting individuals from purchasing more than five seasonal beach tags and banning hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, and other rental units from transferring seasonal beach tags unconstitutional, and declared such tags transferrable. The order also required the City to: (1) maintain complete and accurate records of the revenue generated from its beach tag program, including a separate and distinct \u201cbeach tag program\u201d account into which all beach tag revenue is to be deposited and from which all expenses are to be paid, (2) prepare a quarterly analysis and year-end report of the indirect costs of its beach tag program, and (3) publish modifications to an amended ordinance no later than March 30, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Defendants\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint insofar as it challenged the City\u2019s 2001 and 2002 budgets was granted, and plaintiffs\u2019 application for counsel fees and costs was denied. Plaintiffs cross appeal the order dismissing their challenge to the City\u2019s 2002 budget and the denial of counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We affirm the order insofar as it declared the provisions of the Ordinance banning the sale and transfer of seasonal beach tags to the lodging industry unconstitutional. We reverse the order insofar as it strikes down the provisions of the Ordinance limiting the sale of seasonal beach tags to five per person. We also reverse and remand for further proceedings those provisions of the order requiring the City to account for all the indirect expenses and maintain a separate bank account into which all beach tag revenue is to be deposited and from which all expenses are to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The combined procedural history and relevant facts are as follows. Until the mid-twentieth century, beaches in New Jersey were free and open to the public. <em>Borough of Neptune City v. Borough of Avon-by-the-Sea, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>296, 300, 294 A.2d 47 (1972). In 1955, the Legislature granted municipalities bordering the Atlantic Ocean the authority to charge the public for access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>their beaches and bathing facilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20. In 1977, pursuant to this statute, the City enacted its first beach revenue ordinance, which required users of its beach to purchase \u201cbeach tags.\u201d The 1977 ordinance provided six categories of beach tags: (1) a seasonal tag ($13 if purchased before May 1 and $16 if purchased thereafter); (2) a weekly tag ($10); (3) a daily tag ($4); (4) a \u201c20th Century\u201d tag (entitling the owner to one seasonal tag annually up to and including the year 2000 for a cost of $100); (5) a three-day tag ($7); and (6) a \u201cdecade certificate\u201d (entitling the owner to one seasonal tag annually for a period of ten consecutive years at a cost of $100). That ordinance also provided that the tags, except for the daily tags, could not be \u201csold or leased or transferred to any person or entity by any one other than the City or its duly authorized representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Despite the prohibition on the transfer of beach tags, plaintiffs purchased large quantities of seasonal beach tags, which they would provide to their guests as amenities for their stay. Such a practice was thought to be necessary for plaintiffs to compete with other seaside resort towns, such as Wildwood and Atlantic City, that did not charge for admission to their beaches. From 1997 to 1999, the City\u2019s beach operation ran at a deficit, thus requiring the City to subsidize the operation from its general revenue fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">According to Luciano V. Corea, City Administrator for the City of Cape May,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">Notwithstanding a provision prohibiting the transfer of any but daily beach tags, the practice was widespread, and [the] City Council began to question its advisabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ty. In fact, as we approached the 2000 summer season, proposals were made to enforce the non-transferability of various beach tags. However, we received numerous complaints by owners of various hotel, motel and bed and breakfast facilities, who advised us that they had already created and disseminated marketing materials which provided for the use of free beach tags as supplied by those institutions. Those businesses were, quite understandably, concerned that any enforcement of the then existing beach tag ordinance would render their advertisements incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As a result, in 1999, the City enacted Ordinance 1209-2000 (1999 ordinance), amending the 1977 ordinance to provide two classes of seasonal beach tags: a personal seasonal beach tag and a commercial seasonal tag. The personal seasonal tag was defined as \u201ca beach tag ... for personal use by the purchaser of such beach tag or by any person to whom such beach tag is transferred gratuitously and without consideration, remuneration or other financial benefit, directly or indirectly.\u201d A personal seasonal tag cost $13 before May 1 and $17 thereafter, and a limit of ten tags per person was imposed. The commercial seasonal beach tag, which was created as an accommodation to the lodging industry and to increase revenue, was defined as \u201ca beach tag ... lor commercial use and which may be transferred by the purchaser for consideration, remuneration or other financial benefit.\u201d A commercial seasonal tag cost $22, and there was no limit on the number that could be purchased. The daily, three-day, and weekly beach tags were still available.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With the addition of commercial seasonal beach tags for the 2000 season, the City\u2019s beach operation deficit shrank to $35,595.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The 1999 ordinance was only in effect for the 2000 bathing season. During the summer of 2000, the City Council conducted hearings concerning the advisability of the commercial seasonal beach tag and the transferability of beach tags. According to Corea,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">many owners of hotels, bed and breakfast facilities requested the elimination of the commercial beach tag \u2014 these owners simply did not feel that it was right or proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>for those establishments to supply beach tags and felt it would be better if those beach tags were purchased by a guest in a [manner] much like most other New Jersey municipalities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In August 2000, the City enacted the Ordinance to take effect on September 4, 2000, in time for the 2001 bathing season. The Ordinance dropped the commercial seasonal beach tag and limited seasonal tags to personal seasonal beach tags. Section 8-2 of the Ordinance defined \u201cSeasonal Beach Tags\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cSeasonal beach tag\u201d shall mean a beach tag to use the public beaches in the City of Cape May during a bathing season for personal use by the purchaser of such beach tag or by any person to whom such beach tag is transferred gratuitously and without consideration, remuneration or other financial benefit, directly or indirectly. No more than five (5) seasonal beach tags may be purchased by one (1) person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Additionally, section 8-7(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">Seasonal beach tags shall not be sold, leased or transferred for consideration, remuneration or other financial benefit, directly or indirectly, such as, without limitation, for use by hotel, motel, inn, bed and breakfast or other rental unit guests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">As a result of the Ordinance, the lodging industry was effectively precluded from purchasing seasonal beach tags, thereby forcing its guests to buy daily, weekly, three-day or seasonal tags, which, like the general public, they could do by mail or via the Internet. In 2001, for the first time in five years, the City\u2019s beach operation ran at a surplus, $109,838.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">During discovery, several members of the City Council gave their reasons for voting for the Ordinance. Former Mayor William G. Gaffney testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">[T]he city council was always trying to obtain the proper funds from the sale of tags to pay for the beach operation. We felt over the years that we were not able to do that, that the taxpayers had to subsidize the beach operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">[S]ome people, council members in particular felt that the sale of tags to the individual tourist on a one-on-one situation with no business transferring tags back and forth, that that particular way of selling tags would generate more income. I can only assume that, I don\u2019t know of no [sic] feasibility study that would say you will gain this X number of thousands of dollars more if you don\u2019t do it. I can only assume that they were \u2014 people felt that that would happen and what the numbers are producing right now, as we sit here, the sale of beach tags so far this year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>[2001] .. I think those numbers will show that by doing it the way we\u2019re doing it with this ordinance, it\u2019s producing the needed revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Councilmember Edward J. Mahaney, Jr., recalled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">[AJ draft [of the Ordinance] was proposed, it was circulated widely throughout the city to find out what people felt of it. And it was truly impressive that every segment thought this was a good compromise and that they could live with it. Okay? I wasn\u2019t personally happy with it because I felt we still had a distinction between the residents and the businesses and I voiced that at council meetings that I had great reservations, that I would have preferred that the residents buying seasonal beach tags wouldn\u2019t be able to transfer them, even if it was gratuitously, you know, a beach tag was a beach tag and it belonged to that person and I felt that was fair. However, when we had the public hearing on this ordinance, all the special interest groups were there. And they all testified that they were in favor of this and that they thought it was fair and they could live with it, and it was a good way to start. So, in the spirit of cooperation, I voted for it. There was no pressure on me there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Councilmember Jerome E. Inderwies was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">Q. [T]he reason that you voted for the change from [the 1999 ordinance] to [the Ordinance] wasn\u2019t just the transfer of a beach tag, but you felt that you want[ed] to prohibit transfer to guests or as an incentive to conduct business?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">Q. Because that\u2019s what the statute did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">Q. Was there any other reason that you voted for the change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-15\">Q. Was there an economic reason why you voted for the change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-16\">A. Well, we felt that \u2014 I guess I felt that the sale of beach tags should pay for the use of the \u2014 should pay for the beach maintenance and everything related to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-17\">Q. ... Did anybody do a feasibility study for you that you would either make or lose money as compared to the old ordinance by the passing of a new one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-19\">Q. And who did that feasibility study?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-20\">A. CFO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-21\">Q. That would be your chief financial officer, Mr. MacLeod?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-23\">Q. And what did Mr. MacLeod advise you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-24\">A. That he felt that the fees they were charging and the budget that he drew up and the money that we collected had to support the beach operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-25\">Well, I guess we did do it for economy purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A65\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>A. We tried to balance it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">Q. Did anybody give you an economic reason why you would make more money by not selling commercial seasonal beach tags as compared to selling commercial seasonal beach tags?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Finally, Councilmember Harry A. Stotz testified as to the reasons he voted to change the ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">Q. So, the complaint was that you sold a beach tag and other people would use it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">Q. How did you hope to rectify that complaint with the ordinance, change in the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">A. We got rid of the commercial tag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">Q. Did you think that the commercial tag was the one that was being transferred over and over again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">Q. Why did you vote to change this previous practice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">A. Because I didn\u2019t believe in a commercial tag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-16\">The change was made because it\u2019s still not fair to have a commercial tag and keep giving it to somebody else each day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-17\">I\u2019ll give an example of it. If you go to the movies and you buy a ... ticket ... do you come out of the movie and give it to somebody else to go in to see the show? Q. And that\u2019s what you think was happening with beach tags?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-18\">A. Oh, I know that\u2019s what was happening with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-19\">And I think that\u2019s totally wrong. That ticket that\u2019s being used, you buy one ticket and you use it a hundred times.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-20\">Hits called greed, and that\u2019s the way I feel about it, and I get very hyper and very mad when greed steps into a picture. I\u2019m here for the taxpayer of this city; when I see they\u2019re not getting a fair deal, I\u2019m going to do something or try to do something, and all of these people hollering about the beach tags, they can\u2019t give a free beach tag, but they can charge 200, 250 a night for a room, that upsets me, because to me, now it\u2019s greed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Q. Aren\u2019t you really passing on the cost of a daily beach tag to people who come down and rent a hotel room rather than people who just get a room from you, isn\u2019t that the distinction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">A. The distinction is that a motel charging 200, and $250.00 a night, or a rooming house or whatever, right, wants to give a free beach tag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">Q. Sure. Does that bother you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">Q. ... Councilman, it\u2019s my understanding that if a fellow comes down from Newark and visits one of the residents of this town, and uses that resident\u2019s beach tag for free, he\u2019s okay; but, if he comes down and goes to one of the hotels and they give him ... the same beach tag, it\u2019s not okay; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">What\u2019s the difference\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">A. I\u2019m going \u2014 there\u2019s a big difference, I\u2019m going to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">I have two people that come to my house, my aunt and uncle, all right? And they come down for a week for the whole summer, so let\u2019s say I let them use two beach tags. Now, there\u2019s two people, there\u2019s not a hundred people; in one hotel, there\u2019s a hundred people using it to my two people. Every day, seven days a week, a hundred and some days for the summer, every day they\u2019re using that same beach tag, boom, boom, boom, every day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Larry Muentz, president of Secure Heritage, Inc., submitted a certification demonstrating the effect of the Ordinance on his business and the Cape May lodging industry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-14\">To a reasonable probability, elimination of \u201ccommercial seasonal beach tag\u201d sales has been a financial disaster for the hotels, motels, Inns and Bed and Breakfasts of Cape May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-15\">To a reasonable probability, nearly all of the guests to whom I could not provide a beach tag for the 2001 summer season and who had to purchase such tags on their [own] were non-residents of the City of Cape May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-16\">Irreparable harm will be suffered if my hotel is unable to purchase seasonal beach tags for the 2002 season.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">Just prior to the 2001 bathing season, on April 24, 2001, plaintiffs filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs seeking to invalidate the Ordinance as violative of the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions, <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. XIV, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, IT 1, and the public trust doctrine on the basis that it \u201cdiscriminate[s] against hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts and those who operate rental units, in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>residents of the City of Cape May and their families in an effort, <em>inter alia, </em>to discriminate against use of the public beaches by non-residents.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also sought to invalidate the City\u2019s 2001 budget as violative of the public trust doctrine because it estimated indirect expenses and placed the revenue generated from the sale of beach tags in its general revenue account. Plaintiffs also requested the court to: (1) order a summary investigation into the fiscal affairs of the City; (2) order the appointment of an expert to conduct such investigation; (3) restrain the sale of beach tags until the completion of such investigation; and (4) restrain the payment of any funds derived from the sale of beach tags.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 order to show cause filed in conjunction with its complaint seeking unspecified injunctive relief was denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following discovery, plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment and defendants responded with their cross motion. On April 29, 2002, the judge rendered his oral opinion, which was memorialized in the order of May 3, 2002. Defendants filed their notice of appeal, and on May 13, 2002, we granted their emergent application staying imposition of the Law Division order pending appeal. Plaintiffs filed their cross appeal on May 16, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On appeal, defendants contend that the prohibition on the transfer of seasonal beach tags by the lodging industry is valid because: (1) it is a rational prohibition related to a legitimate governmental interest; (2) it does not violate the public trust doctrine because seasonal tags are available to all residents and nonresidents at the same prices; and (3) it is authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20. Defendants also contend that the motion judge improperly abrogated the City\u2019s legislative and budget-making function by declaring seasonal beach tags transferable and not sending the matter back to the City for revision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Ordinance. Finally, defendants assert that the motion judge erred in finding the City\u2019s method of accounting for its beach tag program improper because, by doing so, he placed the burden of proof on defendants and decided a disputed issue of material fact. In their cross appeal, plaintiffs contend that the 2002 City Budget is void because it violates the public trust doctrine and they are entitled to counsel fees and costs. We address these issue seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We first consider the validity of the Ordinance\u2019s ban on the transfer of seasonal beach tags by the lodging industry. Plaintiffs urge that the ban on transferability is contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20 and violates equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and conferred by Article 1, Paragraph 1, of the New Jersey Constitution. Defendants take a contrary stance, claiming the prohibition on transferability violates neither statutory nor constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20, which grants authority to municipalities to charge beach user fees, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">The governing body of any municipality bordering on the Atlantic ocean, tidal water bays or rivers which owns or shall acquire, by any deed of dedication or otherwise, lands bordering on the ocean, tidal water bays or rivers, or easement rights therein, for a place of resort for public health and recreation and for other public purposes shall have the exclusive control, government and care thereof and of any boardwalk, bathing and recreational facilities, safeguards and equipment, now or hereafter constructed or provided thereon, and may, by ordinance, make and enforce rules and regulations for the government and policing of such lands, boardwalk, bathing facilities, safeguards and equipment; provided, that such power of control, government, care and policing shall not be construed in any manner to exclude or interfere with the operation of any State law or authority with respect to such lands, property and facilities. Any such municipality may, in order to provide funds to improve, maintain and police the same and to protect the same from erosion, encroachment and damage by sea or otherwise, and to provide facilities and safeguards for public bathing and recreation, including the employment of lifeguards, by ordinance, make and enforce rules and regulations for the government, use, maintenance and policing thereof and provide for the charging and collecting of reasonable fees for the registration of persons using said lands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>bathing facilities, for access to the beach and bathing and recreational grounds so provided and for the use of the bathing and recreational facilities, but no such fees shall be charged or collected from children under the age of 12 years; and the municipality may by ordinance provide that no fees, or reduced fees, shall be charged to persons 65 or more years of age and to persons who meet the disability criteria for disability benefits under Title II of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the statutory construction doctrine <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(the expression of one is the exclusion of the other) prohibits the classification made by the City because the statute \u201chas not specifically afforded [the City] the delegated authority to distinguish between classifications of beach goers.\u201d We disagree. Because beach property is held by a political subdivision and the State in trust for the common use of all people, a municipality must not discriminate unfairly among different users of the beach. However, a municipality is permitted to differentiate between beach goers so long as the classification is reasonably related to a proper governmental objective and implemented in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with equal protection and due process. <em>Hyland v. Township of Long Beach, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 206, 389 A.2d 494 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>395, 396 A.2d 582 (1978). New Jersey courts have repeatedly upheld classifications not specifically authorized by the statute. <em>Neptune City, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 294 A.2d 47 (upholding portion of fee structure that imposed different fees for seasonal, weekly and daily badges); <em>Hyland, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 204-08, 389 A.2d 494 (upholding a fee structure that charged a lower rate for seasonal badges if purchased prior to May 31 and that allowed for the purchase of seasonal or weekly badges); <em>Sea Isle City v. Caterina, </em>123 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 430-31, 303 A.2d 351 (Cape May Cty.1973) (permitting a differential rate for seasonal and weekly badges). We conclude that the strict application of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We turn to the issue of whether the ban on transferability runs afoul of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20, because it violates State and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>federal principles of equal protection and the public trust doctrine. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits any state from \u201cdenying] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. XIV. Although the term \u201cequal protection\u201d does not appear in the New Jersey Constitution, Article 1, \u00b6 1, has been interpreted as conferring a right analogous to that available under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 94, 662 A.2d 367 (1995). Indeed, \u201cthe right under the State Constitution can in some situations be broader than the right conferred by the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The motion judge relied on two distinct bases to conclude that the provisions in question violated equal protection. First, he found that allowing individuals to transfer beach tags while disallowing the lodging industry from doing the same was not rational, thus arbitrary and a violation of equal protection. Second, he determined that the prohibition on transfer by the lodging industry discriminates against non-residents by imposing on them a higher per diem cost for use of the beach. The judge reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">[Finally, and not the least important \u2014 and under the public trust doctrine, actually the most important \u2014 Mr. Muentz certified, Judge, if not all, certainly the vast majority of our clients are out of town guests. By denying us the right to buy, as we have in the past, seasonal beach tags, in whatever volume we wish, and offer those beach tags ... as an amenity, the [City] is forcing our clients, our customers, our lodging out of town guests to pay a per diem fee to get to this beach beyond what other persons are entitled to pay, at a lesser price. That is discriminatory, in this record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Essentially, under both the Federal and State Constitutions, equal protection requires that similarly situated individuals be treated alike. <em>Brown v.

Just like the Federal approach, the challenging party has the burden to show the unconstitutionality of the provision at issue. <em>McKenney v. Byrne, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>304, 317, 412 A.2d 1041 (1980). Although the State approach differs analytically from the Federal approach, the two approaches \u201cwill often yield the same result.\u201d <em>Barone, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 368, 526 A.2d 1055. \u201cTo a large extent,\u201d the considerations involved in the State equal protection analysis are implicit in the Federal rational basis test. <em>Ibid. </em>Irrational legislation is similarly barred by the State Constitution. <em>McKenney, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 412 A.2d 1041. The public trust doctrine, which is premised on the common rights of all citizens to use and enjoy tidal land seaward of the mean high water mark, dictates \u201cthat the beach and the ocean must be open to all on equal terms and -without preference and that any contrary state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>municipal action is impermissible.\u201d <em>Neptune City, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 309, 294 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the arguments on appeal. Defendants first argue that the Ordinance does not discriminate against non-residents of the City. <em>See Neptune City supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 310, 294 A.2d 47. The only evidence in the record that non-residents will be forced to pay a higher per diem rate for use of the beach came from the certification submitted by Larry Muentz, which stated that nearly all the guests of his hotel were non-residents who had to purchase tags because the hotel could not provide them. Conspicuously absent are certifications from non-residents that their use of the beach would be deterred by the provisions of the Ordinance. Also lacking is any expert testimony that the per diem cost for non-residents is higher than that for residents. Generally, \u201ca heavy burden is placed on the party attacking the classification to show that it clearly lacks a rational relationship to a legitimate state objective.\u201d <em>In re Regulation of Operator Serv. Providers, supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 778 A.2d 546. Here, by his ruling, the motion judge mistakenly shifted the burden to the City to show that the Ordinance had a rational basis for discriminating against non-residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Moreover, the Ordinance specifically provided that any individual, whether resident or non-resident, is permitted to purchase seasonal beach tags, even providing for sales by mail and over the Internet. Nothing prevents a non-resident, who anticipates staying at a lodging facility in the City, from purchasing a seasonal beach tag for personal use. Because residents and nonresidents are treated alike, we conclude that the provisions of the Ordinance banning sale and transferability of seasonal tags to the lodging industry does not discriminate against non-residents nor does it offend the public trust doctrine. <em>Neptune City, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 310, 294 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We also conclude that the judge erred in striking down the five-tag limit. The judge provided the following reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>There may be some rational basis for five seasonal beach tags purchased per one person, but it\u2019s not found in the ordinance and it\u2019s not found in the record---[W]hat\u2019s the basis for the five? For example \u2014 and where is the equal protection if ... any one person can purchase no more than five, yet the ordinance doesn\u2019t address, for example, mom, dad and the three children over the age of 16 each purchasing five, now you\u2019ve got 25 beach tags in one house. And you may be precluding someone else who lives in a single family with six bedrooms from purchasing more than five. There\u2019s no factual basis in the record for the limitation of five. And as I sit here, I mean I can guess, if you will, well, five may relate to the average nuclear family, mom, dad, three children, or \u2014 it may. But there\u2019s nothing in the ordinance and nothing in the record that establishes a reasonable relationship between the five and some stated aim of the ordinance. And so for that reason, and the inequities that I\u2019ve cited, I have no choice but to find that the limitation on five seasonal beach tags as well is arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious and, therefore, a denial of equal protection. Actually, it\u2019s illusory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">As in his analysis of the non-resident issue, the motion judge improperly shifted the burden to the City to prove the rationality of the Ordinance. Under the rational basis analysis, \u201can adequate factual basis for the legislative judgment is presumed to exist.\u201d <em>In re Regulation of Operator Serv. Providers, supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 778 A.2d 546. Therefore, the City was not required to present any evidence on this issue, and plaintiffs presented no evidence of the irrationality of the five tags per person limit, thus failing to meet their heavy burden. Furthermore, any conceivable rationale suffices to uphold the legislation. <em>Barone, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 367, 526 A.2d 1055. Thus, the motion judge\u2019s proffered rationale, that \u201cfive may relate to the average nuclear family,\u201d was sufficient to justify the five tag limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">We next consider plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the ban on transferability impermissibly discriminates against them under the rational basis test. Finding that the ban on transferability was not rational, the motion judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">What is a beach tag license? What is a beach tag? Is it a license? And if it\u2019s a license, is it a license which flows only to the specific person who purchases it? And if so, what in that contract, between the City and purchaser of the beach tag, ties that purchaser to that tag? Or that purchaser to those five tags, which is the maximum permitted under this ordinance? Nothing. And because there is, at least in this record, no specific identifying information required by the City when it sells between one and five tags to a person qualified under this ordinance, the tag as a license becomes really a bearer license. And the ordinance contemplates the bearer nature of that license. How do we know that? Well, if you\u2019re not a hotel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>motel, inn, bed and breakfast or other rental unit, and still a person, you can walk down to the beach tag office and buy your five. And by the way, unless the person selling the beach tags knows your particular family and who\u2019s in it and how old you are, everyone else in your family ... can walk in and ask for his or her or their own five. Which means, for example, if you\u2019re the family of say two parents and three children ... you\u2019re going to qualify in your family for 25 beach tags. Which this ordinance allows you to transfer without limitation. Transfer to whom? To anyone to whom you elect to give the bearer license, because there\u2019s no restriction against that. In fact, the ordinance affirmatively authorizes that. And that family of five, with their 25 beach tags, can then, if not regulated by the City, turn around and rent their home on a weekly basis. And what do we have within the permissible language of the ordinance, the very thing that Councilman Stotz testifies under oath he was out to stop. While, at the same time, the ... lodging industry, including hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts or other rental units, are being denied the right to purchase as those entities, or as any one of those entities, a single beach tag. That is unequal treatment and, therefore, undeniably a violation of equal protection____[T]ags are permitted to be sold to any individual other than principals, agents of hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts or other rental unit guests. So the ordinance itself, in my view, discriminates against those commercial uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We agree essentially with the judge\u2019s analysis that the distinction in the Ordinance respecting transferability between the lodging industry and the general public is arbitrary. The two stated purposes for the provision against transferability are (1) to raise sufficient revenue to cover the cost of the beach operation; and (2) to place the cost of running the beach on those who use the beach. While these objectives are legitimate, they are not achieved by restricting the lodging industry from transferring beach tags while at the same time permitting transfer by the general public. <em>See, e.g., State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., 115 N.J. </em>83, 110, 557 A.2d 277 (1989); <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. City of Perth Amboy, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>205, 225 (1987) (finding that raising revenue and distributing the cost of government are legitimate State objectives).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The approach here lacks rationality when one considers that the reason for the ban on transfer by commercial lodging enterprises is to increase income in order to support the beach operation. Under the Ordinance, individuals can transfer as many as five tags each day, thus the economic benefit gained by the City is diluted by the number of seasonal tags purchased. A family of five can legitimately obtain twenty-five beach tags and transfer them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>gratuitously to whomever they wish. That family could have guests come in from out-of-town every week and give those guests their beach tags. The ban <em>not </em>only militates against increasing income but also is unfair to plaintiffs who seek to provide an accommodation to their guests, while private individuals may purchase and transfer five seasonal tags to whomever they desire. We conclude that sections 8-2 and 8-7(a) of the Ordinance insofar as those sections ban the sale of seasonal beach tags to hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts and other rental unit guests, but permit individuals to purchase transferable seasonal beach tags are not rationally related to the legislative intent and violate both the Federal and State Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Defendants assert that the motion judge improperly abrogated the City\u2019s legislative function by declaring seasonal beach tags transferable and not sending the matter back to the City to revise the Ordinance to comply with his findings. Our May 3, 2002 stay of the judge\u2019s order renders defendants\u2019 contention moot. Moreover, at oral argument before us, the parties confirmed that during the pendency of this appeal the Ordinance was amended to ban the sale, lease, and transfer of seasonal beach tags.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We consider next those findings that impact on the administration of the City\u2019s budget, specifically the provisions of the summary judgment order requiring the City to maintain a separate account reflecting beach tag revenue deposits and expenses paid, and the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge seeking to void the City\u2019s 2002 budget as violative of the public trust doctrine. As previously stated, the City contends that the judge erred in requiring it to maintain a separate beach tag bank account. Plaintiffs counter that depositing beach tag revenue into and paying all beach operation expenses from the City\u2019s general account is a violation of the public trust doctrine and, therefore, the judge should have voided the 2002 municipal budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">At the outset we note that our stay of the judge\u2019s order renders moot plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal of the judge\u2019s denial of their request to have the City\u2019s budget for fiscal 2002 declared void because the 2002 budget has been fully implemented. We need only consider that portion of the judge\u2019s order requiring the City to maintain a separate account pursuant to the public trust doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In support of its position, plaintiffs presented a report prepared by Gerard Stankiewicz, CPA, which found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">Based on the direction that the [c]ourt gave in <em>Slocum v. Belmwr </em>and indications by the State of New Jersey Department of Treasury Budget Review Team, it is my opinion that, in order to properly account for the finances of a beachfront operation, a separate Beachfront Utility Fund should exist in the City of Cape May----The system internally for the expenses would have to be developed based upon input from various department heads, review of time sheets for allocation of time and, in some cases, direct or indirect allocation of other expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">At deposition, however, Stankiewicz testified that he did not believe a detailed analysis of time records was required for the municipality to determine indirect expenses. He \u201cimagined\u201d that the department heads should have some type of information regarding the time spent by subordinates on a particular function.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Plaintiffs also presented a January 2001 Department of the Treasury budget review of the City, which made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Based on a review of the beachfront operations report prepared by the city, the team believes that the city is not keeping sufficiently detailed financial records of beachfront operations and is employing estimates in the allocation of cost to the beachfront. Reliance on estimates in determining the cost of beachfront operations and subsequently the price of beach tags is a flawed approach exposing the city to criticism and possible litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">With the above observations in mind, the budget review team recommended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">that the city take the necessary steps to comply with the <em>Slocum v. Belmair </em>ruling concerning the proper determination of cost for beachfront operations. The <em>Slocum </em>decision provides for 30 separate categories of eligible costs that can be allocated to a beachfront operation. Adhering to the cost guidelines established in this decision would insure that the city is charging a \u201creasonable\u201d fee for beach tags.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">The team recommends that the city immediately establish an accounting system that will track the cost of beachfront operations. The team considers the existing beachfront operation cost report to be inadequate since it appears to rely on estimates and educated guesses rather than actual accounting data. This will require the creation of a cost accounting system that will record all eligible beachfront expenditures. In addition, the CFO/Treasurer will need the cooperation and assistance of all municipal departments to determine actual city resources being devoted to beachfront operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">According to the City\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Bruce MacLeod, the City broke down its beach operation into direct and indirect expenses for its fiscal year 2001 budget. The direct expenses were estimated to be $965,908 and included: salaries, wages and benefits for lifeguards and beach taggers; operating expenses for lifeguards and beach taggers; public works salaries, wages, operating expenses, and water/sewer department operating expenses; beach equipment and facilities; insurance; and expenses related to the beach fill program and jetty maintenance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Indirect expenses were estimated to be $155,000 and included: the percentage of the salaries and wages for City employees, such as employees of the clerk\u2019s office and the finance and collection department, the mayor, and the administrator, devoted to beach operation; the percentage of the salaries and wages for public safety employees, such as police officers, fire fighters, and EMT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>workers, devoted to handling calls from the beach; and other professional services conducted by the City\u2019s auditor, engineer, and legal counsel. Because detailed time records were not kept respecting the specific time allocated to these part-time beach operations, the indirect expenses were not exact but rather estimated by MacLeod based upon his discussions with heads of the respective departments. In a certification, MacLeod asserted that' the Local Government budget review was initiated at the City\u2019s request, and that the reports issued are for informational purposes only, not binding. He also indicated that the City is audited annually by an independent accounting firm and its budget has been submitted and approved by the State Division of Local Government Services in accordance with statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:14B-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The City also retained a CPA, Leon P. Costello, who refuted Stankiewicz\u2019s report, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">There is no statutory requirement to establish and maintain a Beachfront Utility [Fund]. It is acceptable to record revenues and expenditures from this type of operation in the City\u2019s Current Fund____[Although there is a requirement to maintain separate accounting records for Beach Fees, there is no requirement to maintain a separate bank account for them. The City identifies all items of deposit as to their source in compliance with statutory accounting requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">[T]he State Treasury Budget Review Team recommends ... \u201cadhering to the costs guideline established in <em>[Slocum] </em>would ensure that the City is charging a \u2018reasonable\u2019 fee for beach tags.[\u201d] The Budget Review Team did not recommend that a separate utility fund be established. The Budget Review Team is stating that the City is to charge a reasonable fee for the use of the beach. Additionally, cost accounting system ... does not constitute a separate utility. There are two negatives associated with the establishment of a separate utility. First, any shortfall in a municipal utility would be raised as an appropriation in the Current Fund Budget. This would have occurred in many of the past several years. Such an appropriation is funded with tax dollars. Secondly, there is significantly more unnecessary paperwork for a utility fund of this type, as opposed to maintaining a cost accounting system as reported by the Budget Review Team.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Finding that the methodology used by the City in calculating the indirect expenses ran afoul of <em>Slocum v. Borough of Belmar, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 569 A.2d 312 (Law Div.1989), and the public trust doctrine, the motion judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>I\u2019ve reviewed the testimony of Stankiewiez who indicated that yes, guesstimates may be enough____The guesstimates [of indirect expenses] are MacLeod\u2019s, based upon his conversation with somebody else, presumably department heads in those five indirect cost departments. That is not enough competent evidence, in my view, to sustain a <em>Slocum </em>charge to the City\u2019s current methodology\u2014 [B]y commingling the revenues with other <em>municipal revenues </em>... the tracing <em>of the </em>revenues becomes more difficult. Tracing of the costs becomes more difficult. It certainly doesn\u2019t occur in a vacuum. Treatment of surpluses on an annual basis suddenly no longer becomes profit or loss to the City, but, if excess revenues, becomes potentially a capital reserve for the following year____For example, [ifl the imaginary senior citizen ... walk[s] in and say[s] ... [w]here did our surplus last year go to? Show me how it reduced this year\u2019s operating expense budget. I haven\u2019t seen anything before me that establishes how the excess of revenue over costs is applied in a fashion consistent with <em>Slocum </em>and more so than <em>Slocum, </em>consistent with trust law in the State of New Jersey and the <em>Avon </em>decision. And so while I am immensely concerned about rendering a decision short of concluding that a separate accounting system must be maintained, I\u2019m not able to find any other option that I could consider properly, as I\u2019ve evaluated the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">I have no choice but to conclude that the City has, for the reasons indicated, not complied with its affirmative obligations under <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:61:22.20] and <em>Neptune v. Avon. </em>And that it hereafter commence the process of maintaining, first, complete, accurate, traceable records documenting costs relative to beach front facilities. A separate beach account and separate accounting system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The public trust doctrine dictates that trust lands must be \u201cheld, protected, and regulated for the common use and benefit.\u201d <em>Arnold v. Mundy, </em>6 <em>N.J.L. </em>1, 71 (1821). In <em>Slocum, </em>the trial judge found that, because these lands are held in trust for the public, municipalities have a duty to take special care to account for all costs and revenue related to the beach operation. Although we agree with <em>Shewn </em>that this approach is consistent with the duties of a trustee in other contexts, <em>see Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 169 to 185 (1959); <em>see also Coffey v. Coffey, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 668 A.2d 76 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>172, 675 A.2d 1121 (1996), we cannot agree, on this record, that plaintiffs proved that the City\u2019s accounting methodology was inappropriate or a violation of law. The facts in <em>Shewn </em>were developed after eight days of trial that included the testimony of six experts. Here, by contrast, the judge made a summary determination based upon the reading of depositions and conflicting expert reports. Generally, summary judgment is not appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>priate where there are differing expert opinions. <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chem. Corp., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>421, 440-41, 593 A.2d 733 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Moreover, we are not convinced that <em>Slocum </em>should be read, as plaintiffs demand, to require a municipality to maintain a separate acco\u00fant for beach tag revenue in all cases. <em>Slocum </em>provides an example of a remedy that may be used in a case where serious accounting irregularities have been proven. The nature of the remedy is necessarily dependent on the severity of the irregularities uncovered. Here, the dispute centered only upon the indirect expenses, not the revenue generated or the direct expenses paid. The motion judge mistakenly found that the . creation of a separate account was the only way to ensure that the City could appropriately account for its beach tag revenue. Before passing on such a remedy, it was incumbent on the judge to determine, after assessing the credibility of the witnesses, whether estimates were the only viable means of allocating the costs of each particular type of indirect expense or whether they are capable of actually being accounted for by time and costs. After deciding these issues, the judge should then have determined whether the general municipal account could be used to track the total revenue received, and the direct and indirect costs expended, thereby generating a year-end figure, whether a deficit or surplus, that could be carried forward to the subsequent year\u2019s beach tag budget. If it is determined that the accounting method utilizing the general fund can ensure that a surplus in the beach operation budget is not spent on purposes other than beach operation as required by <em>Neptune City, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 294 A.2d 47, then there would be no need for a separate account.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Lastly, we consider and reject plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they are entitled to counsel fees. Courts are without authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of a statute or rule. <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(7), (8); <em>see also Community Realty Mgmt. v. Harris, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>212, 235-36, 714 A.2d 282 (1998). Plaintiffs contend that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>entitled to counsel fees because they brought suit to benefit the public and are entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of their suit. They cite no rule or statute that supports this contention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Secondly, plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to fees because they brought suit to vindicate an encroachment on their constitutional rights. However, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not allege a civil rights action, such as 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983, under which they would be entitled to counsel fees under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988(b). <em>Clark v. Bd. of Educ., </em>907 <em>F.Supp. </em>826, 829 (D.N.J.1995). Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 claim cannot be construed as a \u00a7 1983 claim because it is not based in tort. <em>Freeman v. State, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 21, 788 A.2d 867 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>178, 796 A.2d 895 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We conclude that sections 8-2 and 8-7(a) of the Ordinance, insofar as they ban the sale of seasonal beach tags to hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, and other rental unit guests, but permit individuals to purchase transferable seasonal beach tags, do not pass constitutional muster. We affirm the order for summary judgment insofar as it declared the provisions of the Ordinance banning the sale and transfer of seasonal beach tags to the lodging industry unconstitutional. We reverse the order insofar as it strikes down the provisions of the Ordinance limiting the sale of seasonal beach tags to five per individual. We also reverse and remand for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, those provisions of the order requiring the City to account for all its indirect expenses and maintain a separate bank account into which beach tag revenue is to be deposited and from which all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>expenses are to be paid. Finally, we affirm the order denying counsel fees to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The original statute precluded the collection of fees from persons under twelve years of age.
