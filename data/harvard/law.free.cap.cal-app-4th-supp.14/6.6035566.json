As we explain, the parking-citation system is two-tiered. After the parking citation is issued, any person can post bail and appear in court to contest the citation. Only if the citation remains unpaid is the registered owner cited to appear in court. We conclude that no error of substance occurred, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-6\">First, the Vehicle Code does not require that the registered owner be proved, where, as here, a person posted bail on the citation and appeared in court to contest the citation. Vehicle Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 40202 authorizes the issuance of parking citations by attaching the citation to some part of the vehicle. That section also specifies the information to be included in the citation: approximate time; location; license number; registration; expiration date; last four digits of the vehicle identification number, if visible; color of the vehicle and, if possible, make of the vehicle. A person can then either pay the citation or post bail and contest the citation. (\u00a7\u00a7 40203, 40205.) If the citation remains unpaid, only then must the registered owner be notified about the delinquent citation. (\u00a7 40206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-7\">The procedures described in section 41102,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> relied on by defendant, do not apply unless the citation remains unpaid and the prosecution must prove the case against the registered owner. In this case, a person chose to appear, pay the fine, and contest the citation. No one forced defendant to appear; he was entitled to wait until the People initiated proceedings under section 40206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-8\">Defendant contends that a violation of a parking ordinance cannot be proved unless the citation contains all the information required under section 40202. The contention is without merit. A fully completed citation is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>jurisdictional requirement in proving a parking violation. The obvious purpose of the information requirements under section 40202 is to permit identification of the vehicle and sufficient information to prove that a violation has been committed. Defendant does not contend that the vehicle was incorrectly identified or that the information contained in the citation was inadequate to prove the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments are without merit. He was not forced to incriminate himself; he was not denied equal protection; and he was not denied due process. Defendant chose the simplified system for paying and/or contesting parking citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-6\">Second, although we agree with defendant that under section 40230, subdivision (a) a complaint must be filed within 15 days after the defendant requests a court hearing, defendant does not contend that the court was without jurisdiction to proceed, absent a complaint, or that the citation did not provide him with adequate notice of the illegal parking that led to the citation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, defendant can show no prejudice by the People\u2019s failure to file a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-8\">Johnson, Acting P. J., and Watai, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1566-9\"> All further statutory references shall be to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1566-10\"> Section 41102, in part, provides that \u201c[i]n any prosecution against the registered owner of a motor vehicle charging a violation of any regulation governing . . . the parking of a vehicle under . . . any ordinance enacted by local authorities, proof that the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of any provision of . . . that ordinance, together with proof that the defendant named in the notice of delinquent parking violation issued under Section 40206 or the complaint was at the time of parking the registered owner of the vehicle, is prima facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who parked ... the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1567-9\"> Section 40205 provides that when a person appears to contest a parking violation, the processing agency \u201cshall proceed in accordance with Section 40215.\u201d That section describes the duties of the processing agency as to persons who appear to contest a notice of parking violation or notice of delinquent parking violation. Section 40230, subdivision (a) provides that a criminal complaint pursuant to various sections, including section 40215, \u201cshall be filed with the court within 15 days after the defendant requests a court hearing or fails to appear.\u201d However, section 40230, subdivision (b) specifically authorizes the processing agency to \u201cfile a copy of the notice of delinquent parking violation . . . and a copy of the affidavit of service or of the promise to appear,\u201d and further states: \u201cThat notice shall serve as a complaint on which a warrant may issue.\u201d Thus, the reason for requiring a complaint is to permit the issuance of a warrant, and, under the parking violation system, no warrant is ever issued based on the initial notice of parking violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
