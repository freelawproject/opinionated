Action by husband to recover for his pecuniary </em>loss, <em>and for the loss of the services and comfort of the society of his </em>wife, <em>caused by the wrongful act of the defendant.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-11\">On Christmas night, 1888, the plaintiff, his wife and two young nieces, hoarded a train of defendant in the lower part of the city, intending to go to plaintiff\u2019s home, near Seventy-second street and Ninth avenue. On reaching the railway station at the latter place they started to leave the car. The plaintiff started first, and the two little girls followed next, and Mrs. Allen was last in the order. Before Mrs. Allen could leave the car and get off the train, and as she stood in the open door of the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>platform, the train started. She was told by the guard to get off. She said, \u201c How can I when the train is in motion <em>? </em>\u201d The guard then said, \u201c Get off, I say,\u201d and putting his hand upon her back, pushed her. Mrs. Allen was lame, having a stiff knee, and when she was pushed she fell off the platform of the car upon the platform of the station, and the train, which was full of passengers, passed on, leaving Mrs. Allen with the plaintiff and the two little girls on the station platform. The result of the fall was a fracture of the scapula of the left shoulder, which never united, and she was permanently disabled in her left arm and shoulder. The injury is claimed to be incurable, and she is compelled to wear an iron frame about her body to support the shoulder, and she can make no exertion without pain; and it is also claimed that some of the muscles were permanently detached from the shoulder. The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for three thousand dollars, and the defendant claims that this amount is excessive.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-5\"><em>Jleld, </em>that the verdict of the jury settles the facts as stated, and the proofs were sufficient to sustain the verdict. In actions of this kind the loss of the society and companionship of the wife is an element of damage in addition to the loss of service. The claim comprehends and includes the loss which will continue during her life. In view of the facts and circumstances, the recovery was not excessive. The various exceptions taken during the trial to the reception and refusal of evidence, to the judge\u2019s charges and his refusals to charge as requested, are without merit.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b255-6\">Before Freedman, P.

On Christmas night, 1888, the plaintiff, his wife and two young nieces started to go from the lower part of the city to plaintiff\u2019s home, near 72d street and 9th avenue. They took a train on defendant\u2019s elevated road and on reaching the station at 72d street and 9th avenue, started to get out. The plaintiff started first, the two little girls following, and Mrs. Allen being last. Before Mrs. Allen could get off, the train started and, as she stood in the open door of the car platform, she was told by the guard to get off. She said, <em>\u201c </em>How can I when the train is in motion ? \u201d The guard then said<em>, </em>Get off, I say,\u201d and putting his hand on her back, pushed her. Mrs. Allen was lame, having a stiff knee, and when she was pushed she fell off the platform of the car upon the platform of the station, and the train, which was full of passengers, passed on, leaving Mrs. Allen with the plaintiff and the two little girls on the platform. The result of the fall was a fracture of the scapula of the left shoulder, which never united, and which left her permanently disabled in her left arm and shoulder. The injury is claimed to be incurable, and she is compelled to wear an iron frame about her body to support the shoulder, and even then it is claimed that she can make no exertion without constant pain. It is also claimed that some of the muscles were permanently detached from the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The jury having found in favor of the plaintiff, their verdict settles the facts to he as stated. The proofs satisfactorily establish the result reached by the jury; so that we need not trouble ourselves with the conflict in evidence which arose during the trial. The jury brought in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for three thousand dollars and the defendant claims that the amount is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">It is a recognized rule of law that in actions of this kind the loss of the society and companionship of the wife is an element of damage in addition to the loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>service.

Co., 2 <em>Abbott\u2019s Appeals Dec., </em>277.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife was no doubt permanently injured, and his loss will continue during her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In view of the facts, the recovery was not excessive, but moderate. We have examined the various exceptions taken during the trial to the judge\u2019s charge, and to the requests to charge, and find them to he without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">It follows that the judgment and order appealed from must he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Freedman, P. J., and Gildersleeve, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
