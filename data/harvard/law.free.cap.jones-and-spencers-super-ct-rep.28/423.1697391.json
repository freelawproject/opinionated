Lathrop, Jr., </em>of counsel, for appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">There having been no <em>laches </em>or delay, and the plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to sue as a poor person having been denied, the defendant was entitled as a matter of right to security for costs. <em>Code Civ. Pro., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 459, 469 and 3268 (all as amended by chap. 170, Laws of 1891); \u00a7\u00a7 3271 and 3272. Whatever doubt existed before the amendments of chapter 170, Laws of 1891, is removed by those amendments. They give a defendant an absolute right to security. Before these amendments the following cases held this to be law. Meredith <em>v. </em>42d St. and Grand St. R. R. Co., 1 <em>Civ. Proc. R., 15n.; </em>Healey <em>v. </em>23d St. R. R. Co., 1 <em>Ib., </em>15; Blake <em>v. </em>Dolan, 2 <em>Law Bulletin, </em>14; Buckley <em>v. </em>Gutta Percha Manfg. Co., 3 <em>Civ. Proc. R., </em>428; Churchman <em>v. </em>Merritt, 50 <em>Hun, </em>270; Robertson <em>v. </em>Barnum, 29 <em>Ib., </em>657; McDonald <em>v. </em>Peet, 7 <em>Civ. Proc. R., </em>200; Weber <em>v. </em>Moog, 12 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>108. The case of Steinberger <em>v. </em>Manhattan El. R. R. Co., 46 <em>Superior Ct. Reports, </em>216, which seems in conflict with the above authorities, was decided by this court before subdivision 5 of \u00a7 3268 and \u00a7 3272 of chapter 12 of the <em>Code of Civil Procedure </em>took effect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-7\"><em>Adam Finch, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b448-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aif\">The defendant\u2019s right to security for costs depended upon section 3268 Code Civ. Pro., as amended by chapter 170, Laws of 1891. It says that a defendant may require security for costs to be given where the plaintiff is, when the action was commenced, subd. 5, an infant whose guardian <em>ad litem, </em>had not given such security excepting as otherwise provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 459 and 469 of the act. These sections refer to the right of an infant to obtain leave to prosecute as a poor person.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As in this case it did not appear that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>had filed security for costs, or that the plaintiff had obtained leave to sue as a poor person, the defendant\u2019s motion should have been granted. The order appealed from is reversed and defendant\u2019s motion below granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
