There was no allegation that defendant made such promises with intent to deceive. The defendant moved upon the papers on which the order of arrest was granted to vacate the same, which motion was granted. <em>Held </em>no error ; that no facts are set forth showing the defendant guilty of fraud ; that because defendant failed to perform his agreement does not raise a presumption that he intended non-performance at the time he made the agreement ; retroactive presumptions are not applicable to cases of this character.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b513-8\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.
