The answer contained a general denial. On the trial the plaintiffs offered, and the court received, in evidence against the defendant\u2019s objection a paper in the following words : \u201c New York, April 15th, 1885. Received from W. A. Wilchers, Esq., three thousand dollars for which I agree to pay him April 30, 1885, $3,250. Jno. W. Kohlsaat.\u201d Against like objection the court admitted in evidence a letter from the defendant to plaintiffs\u2019 testator, dated May 16, 1885, containing the following words <em>: </em>\u2018' Herewith please find 23 Mexican State Bonds of the face value of $1,000 each, as collateral security until payment of the $3,250 for loan of $3,000, April 15, 1885.\u201d Plaintiffs then rested and defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that no evidence had been shown within the pleadings and that the alleged agreement as shown by the note and letter was void for usury.

At the trial no claim was made that there was any question for the jury, nor was there a fatal variance between the proof and the allegations of the complaint. The action was brought to recover $3,000, being the amount of a loan made to defendant by the plaintiffs\u2019 testator, and the complaint alleged the making of the said loan and a promise on the part of the defendant to repay the $3,000. The proof established the allegations of the complaint and incidentally some evidence was introduced from which the jury, if the issue had been made, might have found that the defendant, on obtaining the loan, had further agreed to pay a usurious rate of interest. But the only defence pleaded was a general denial and usury did not conclusively appear as matter of law from the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs. Under the circumstances stated the defence of usury was not available to the defendant. Millbank <em>v. </em>Jones, 28 N. <em>E. Rep., </em>31, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The record discloses no error, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
