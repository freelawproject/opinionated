The agreement was not void for the want of consideration <em>(Barnes </em>agt. <em>Perrine, </em>12 <em>N. Y., </em>23; <em>Willets </em>agt. <em>Sun Mutual Insurance Co., </em>45 <em>N. Y., </em>45 ; 6 <em>Am. Rep., </em>31; <em>Adams </em>agt. Hanness, 62 <em>Barb., </em>326 ; <em>Hammon </em>agt. <em>Shepard, </em>40 <em>How. Pr., </em>452; 29 <em>id., </em>188; <em>Cope </em>agt. <em>Atkinson, </em>8 <em>Exch., </em>185, 187, <em>note).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-13\">II. Haw had authority to transfer the agreement, and, having transferred it to the plaintiff, and he having made the boxes, relying upon the agreement, has a right to recover <em>(Van Rensselaer </em>agt. <em>Aiken, </em>44 <em>N. Y, </em>126; <em>see, also, Eastern Plank Road Co. </em>agt. <em>Vaughn, </em>20 <em>Barb., </em>155; <em>Muller </em>agt. <em>Mitchell, </em>70 <em>N. Y., </em>437; <em>lawroson </em>agt. <em>Mason, </em>3 <em>Cranch, </em>492).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-14\">III. The contract was transferable, and plaintiff,, on showing compliance with its terms, can recover, though not named in it <em>(Hays </em>agt. <em>Willis, </em>4 <em>Daly, </em>261 <em>and cases there cited; Wait's Actions and Defenses, vol. </em>1, <em>pp. </em>355, 356, 357 <em>and cases there cited).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>It could be assigned orally, and Haw would then be divested of all right to sue defendant <em>(Marcus </em>agt. <em>St. Louis Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>68 <em>N. Y., </em>625; <em>Sheridan </em>agt. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., </em>68 <em>N. Y., </em>30).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-5\"><em>Alexander Thain, </em>of counsel <em>{James S. Graces </em>attorney), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">I. <em>{a.) </em>The agreement is not addressed to the plaintiff, does not constitute a contract and is not evidence of any contract between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">(5.) It is not a direction to plaintiff to make boxes; it is a mere offer to contribute to the treasury of an association.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\"><em>{c.) </em>There is no definite promise by defendant or acceptance by plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-9\">{d.) Defendant was a stranger to the plaintiff and to the paper and there is no privity <em>(Simson </em>agt. <em>Brown, </em>68 <em>N. Y., </em>355.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-10\">II. The paper lacks the elements of a contract (1 <em>Chitty on Contracts [11th ed.], </em>11). There was no consideration for any promise as in <em>Farley </em>agt. <em>Cleveland </em>(4 <em>Cow., </em>432) and <em>Simson </em>agt. <em>Brown </em>(68 <em>N. Y., </em>355).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-11\">III. Haw could not even maintain an action upon this agreement, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-12\"><em>{a.) </em>There was no consideration for the offer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-13\">(5.) There is no evidence that Haw assented to, or accepted, the offer or acted upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-14\">(c.) Ho recovery can be had on the agreement <em>(Stewart </em>agt. <em>Trustees of Hamilton College, </em>2 <em>Denio, </em>403; <em>S. C, </em>1 <em>N. Y., </em>581 <em>and cases cited).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-15\">TV. But even if Haw could recover the plaintiff cannot, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-16\"><em>{a.) </em>There is \u00f1o assignment to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-17\">(5.) The paper does not constitute Haw defendant\u2019s agent <em>(Raney </em>agt. <em>Weed, </em>6 <em>Sand., </em>577).</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-18\">(&lt;5.) There is no evidence that Haw directed or authorized the plaintiff to make the boxes.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Van Hoesen, <em>J. </em>\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AL_\">Thomson\u2019s letter to Haw shows clearly that Thomson expected Haw to procure the boxes and to induce some carpenter to build them by promising that the boxes would be paid for when the bill for them was presented at Thomson\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">If Haw was not to order the boxes, why did Thomsom refer to the presentation of a bill for them at his office ?</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">If Thomson intended merely to send to Haw a contribution towards the expense of Beyea\u2019s canvass, there would have been no propriety in his saying any thing concerning the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">A request from Thomson to Haw to contract for the boxes and a promise by Thomson to pay not more than three dollars per district for the boxes furnished, appearing on the face of the letter, or being naturally implied by its terms, I think Haw had power to employ a carpenter to build the boxes, and that any carpenter, hired by Haw, who built the boxes, relying upon the promise contained in the letter, had the right to look to Thomson for his pay. It appears that the letter was handed by Haw to Egan, who then went on and finished the boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Ho question is made respecting the delivery. I think the plaintiff, upon the evidence, made out a case, which, within the decisions hereinafter cited, entitled him to a verdict <em>(Trustees of Hamilton College </em>agt. Stewart, 1 <em>N. Y., </em>581; <em>Barnes </em>agt. Perrine, 12 <em>N. Y., </em>18; <em>Van Rensselaer </em>agt. Aiken, 44 <em>N. Y., </em>126).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The judgment should be reversed, a new trial ordered, with costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Daly, O. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
