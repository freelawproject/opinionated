M. Porter, Esq., their attorney, $3,996.50, that being the amount realized from action, Keiley, <em>as. Receiver, </em>agt. <em>Charles Dusenbumy, </em>and now in the receiver\u2019s hands, to the credit of the action of <em>Morris et al. </em>agt. <em>Hiler </em>(after deducting several small claims upon the funds due to parties having judgments against the receiver, as such), said Porter claiming the right to such fund, by an \u2022order from the judgment creditors, Morris <em>et al., </em>and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>professional services rendered by him as counsel for the receiver, in the action, <em>Keiley </em>agt. Dusenbury, and in other proceedings in realizing said fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">Upon the coming on of said motion, the receiver stated that he had been threatened with an action for false imprisonment, at the instance of Charles Dusenbury, growing out of certain Stilwell act proceedings, instituted by Mr. Porter, in the receiver\u2019s name, in the superior court, in an action of Keiley, <em>as receiver, </em>agt. <em>Dusenbury.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">And it also appeared that an application was, at the same time, made to the court for leave to sue the receiver.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-7\"><em>D.

The receiver, as such, is liable for false imprisonment, and he is not <em>personalty </em>liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-12\">II. Hot being personally liable, the fund is Dusenbury\u2019s only security to collect any judgment he may recover for false imprisonment, and it should not be paid out.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-13\">J. F. Daly, J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"APG\">The \u201c Stilwell act \u201d proceedings under which Dusenbury was arrested were ostensibly brought by the receiver, but were really instituted in his name by the attorneys for the judgment creditors acting as the receiver\u2019s attorneys and for the benefit of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">Under such circumstances the receiver would not probably be personally liable; but for the acts of his attorney and agents would be liable as receiver, and the fund in court be subject to the claim of the injured party <em>(Camp </em>agt. Barney, 4 Hun, 373: <em>Cardot </em>agt. <em>Barney, </em>63 <em>N. Y., </em>281).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>I think it reasonable that any recovery of damages for false \u25a0imprisonment in such a case should be payable out of the fund. The <em>\u201c </em>Stilwell proceedings \u201d were instituted to benefit and increase the fund and to satisfy the judgment creditors\u2019 \u25a0claim. An injury, such as false imprisonment inflicted by proceedings taken in the name of the receiver, may be the \u25a0subject of an action against the attorneys or other persons \u25a0directly responsible for it; but while there is a fund out of which it may be satisfied there is no good reason for turning over \u25a0the injured party to the chances of individual responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The parties prosecuting proceedings under the Stilwell act are not required to give an undertaking against damages, as in the case of arrests under the Code, and the defendant, if unlawfully imprisoned, must have recourse to an action against \u25a0the persons causing the imprisonment. If a receiver is the ostensible party liable the court should, in ordinary cases, provide for the satisfaction of the injured party out of the fund. Motion for distribution of fund denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
