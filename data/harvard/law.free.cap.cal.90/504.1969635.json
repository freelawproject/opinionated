The summons in this case notified the defendants that something would be done by the clerk which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>had no authority to do, viz., enter up judgment without any presentation of the plaintiff's cause of action to the court. This could not be done in a case of this kind. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 585; <em>People </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>53 Cal. 253.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-5\"><em>D. G. Collier, </em>and <em>Haines &amp; Ward, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">Since the summons states that the action is \u201cfor the relief demanded in the complaint,\u201d the notice is in legal effect comprised in it that the application will be to the only source whence that relief can be obtained, to wit, to the court. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 565, subd. 2.) As the complaint was served with the summons upon defendant Gunn, and the application for the relief given by the judgment was in fact made to the court, and as no objection is made to the nature or extent of the relief actually granted by the court, the supposed defect in the summons could not and did not effect or prejudice any substantial right of the defendant. <em>(McCoun </em>v. <em>New York etc. R. R. Co., </em>50 N. Y. 176; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>37 How. Pr. 327.) Section 475 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 4, 475. See <em>McCoun </em>v. <em>New York etc. R. R. Co., </em>50 N. Y. 176; <em>Polack </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>2 Cal. 193; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>44 Cal. 635.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-7\">Vanclief, C.</author>\n<p id=\"ALf\">This action was brought in the county of San Diego by Clark against Eliza M. Palmer, Douglas Gunn, and C. E. Johnson to foreclose a mortgage executed by Eliza M. Palmer to secure the payment of her promissory note to the plaintiff for the sum of five thousand dollars and interest. The ground upon which Gunn and Johnson were made parties defendant is expressed in the complaint, as follows: \u201cThat Douglas Gunn and Charles Edward Johnson have, or claim to have, some interest in or claim upon said premises as mortgagees or otherwise, which claims or interest were acquired by them subsequent to the mortgage of plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>No relief is asked affecting Gunn and Johnson, except that plaintiff\u2019s mortgage be first satisfied from the proceeds of a sale of the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The summons, with a copy of the complaint, was served on Gunn in said county. The summons contained the following notice: \u201c And you are hereby notified that if you fail to appear and answer the said complaint as above required, said plaintiff <em>will take judgment against you for the relief demanded in his complaint.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The summons also contained a specific statement of the nature of the action, and of Gunn\u2019s interest in it as subsequent mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The defendant Gunn failing to appear within the time required by law, his default was regularly entered, and thereupon a decree of foreclosure in the usual form was rendered <em>by the court </em>on the thirty-first day of December, 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On the twenty-third day of December, 1890, the defendant Gunn filed his notice of this appeal from the judgment of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The only point made by the appellant is, that the notice in the summons does not comply with subdivision 5 of section 407 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which, in a case of this kind, requires a notice that \u201cthe plaintiff will <em>apply to the court </em>for the relief demanded in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The Code of Civil Procedure, section 4, enacts that \u201c its provisions and all proceedings under it are to be liberally construed, with a view to effect its ohjecls and to promote justice\u201d; and the courts have emphatically sanctioned the application of this rule of construction to section 407 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and to a similar section in the code of New York. <em>(Berwick </em>v. <em>Muir, </em>83 Cal. 368; 18 Am, St. Rep. 192; <em>King </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>41 Cal. 315; <em>McCoun </em>v. <em>New York etc. R. R. Co., </em>50 N. Y. 176.) So construed, I think the notice that plaintiff would \u201c take judgment .... for the relief demanded in his complaint\u201d was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>in substance, a notice that he would <em>\u201c apply to the coxirt\u201d </em>for that relief. That being the only <em>laivjul </em>mode by which he could take it (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 585), the notice, as expressed, implies that he intended to take it in that mode, and not in any unlawful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">As the record shows that the plaintiff did apply to the court for his relief, that the court did grant such relief as was given, and that the relief given did not differ from or exceed that demanded in the complaint, it seems inconceivable that the defendant could have been misled or injured by the variance of the summons from the form of words prescribed by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Fitzgerald, C., and Belcher, C., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b535-8\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aah\">\u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
