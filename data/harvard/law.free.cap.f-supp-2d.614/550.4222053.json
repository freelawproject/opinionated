ROBRENO, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b590-24\">1. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-25\">MDL no. 875 involves claims relating to personal injuries allegedly caused by asbestos products. In 1991, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the \u201cPanel\u201d) transferred and consolidated these cases in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as MDL 875. According to the January 1, 2009 Panel report, there were 58,625 cases, encompassing 3.3 million claims, pending in MDL 875.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-26\">To manage this complex case, over the course of the litigation, the Court has issued 17 administrative orders. To complement this administrative architecture, the presiding Judicial Officer has instituted several new policies and procedures<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that expanded upon the case management sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>tem put in place by Judge Weiner and Judge Giles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, a significant number of pending claims have been resolved in the past several months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 motion requests amendments to six of these administrative orders. For the reasons set forth below,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court declines to adopt Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">II. DISCUSSION OF THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">A. <em>Procedure for Remand of Appropriate Cases to Transferor District Courts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first request that the Court remand: (1) the 151 malignancy cases listed in Exhibit \u201cJ\u201d of their motion; and (2) any case in which a motion for remand has already been filed. (Pis. Mot. at 17, Ex. J.) This request for a wholesale remand does not include specific information regarding the circumstances or procedural status of any individual ease. The motion simply lists the respective Plaintiffs name, civil action number, case style and disease. <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. J.) Previously, the Court declined a similar wholesale disposition of cases suggested by defendants in connection with enforcement of Administrative Order no. 12. <em>In re: Asbestos Prods. Liab. Litig. (No. VI), </em>254 F.R.D. 266, 268 (E.D.Pa.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">Remanding cases to the transferor court at an early date remains an important administrative goal of the Court. Remand of individual cases, however, should occur only in a manner consistent with the goal of the efficient administration of the case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in the interest of justice in the individual case being remanded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order to promote these goals the Court will implement a procedure whereby requests for a suggestion of remand in <em>individual </em>cases may be brought to the attention of the Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">By order on this day, the Court will issue Administrative Order no. 18, which provides that Plaintiffs may file a motion requesting the entry of a suggestion of remand with the Court. This motion must include, at a minimum, the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-18\">1.) The civil action number of the case in the district where it was originally filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>2.) The civil action number of the case in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, if the case has been assigned an E.D. Pa. civil action number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">3.) The name of the plaintiff in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">4.) The diagnosing report or opinion relied upon by the plaintiff in compliance with Administrative Order no. 12;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">5.) The identity of defendants that are still viable<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">6.) A certification that the motion requesting the suggestion of remand has been served upon counsel for all other parties to the action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">7.) The specific reasons why remand is appropriate in this</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">a.) Whether Plaintiff has complied with Administrative Orders 12 and 12A;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">b.) Whether the injured Plaintiff is alive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-18\">c.) Whether the parties have submitted a Rule 26(f) report to the Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-20\">d.) Whether all relevant discovery has been completed or has been substantially completed. If not, identify the discovery still to be completed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-22\">e.) The extent to which settlement conferences have been held in the case and the status of settlement negotiations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-24\">f.) Whether there are any outstanding motions in the case. Counsel seeking remand should be able to certify that there are no outstanding motions remaining in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-28\">g.) Whether, if the case is remanded, the Plaintiff is prepared for trial without delay once on the transferor court\u2019s normal docket; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-30\">h.) The status of congestion in the transferor court docket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-32\">Once a motion requesting a suggestion of remand has been filed with the Court and served on all other parties to the action, any party opposing the motion will have fourteen (14) days in which to file a response. If a response is filed, then the Court will decide whether to suggest remand based on the contents of the motion and the response, or schedule a hearing on the matter. If there is no response within fourteen days, the other parties to the action are deemed to have consented, and the Court will decide whether to suggest remand based on the content of that respective Plaintiffs motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-33\">Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs\u2019 request to remand the 151 named malignancy cases, and the numerous other cases in which a motion to remand has been filed previously is denied. If Plaintiffs believe that remand is appropriate in any <em>individual </em>case, the Plaintiff in such case may file a motion for suggestion of remand that conforms to the requirements of Administrative Order no. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-34\">B. <em>Motley Rice\u2019s Role as Plaintiffs\u2019 Steering Committee Liaison Counsel for the MDL 875 Submissions Database</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-35\">Next, Plaintiffs\u2019 request that the Court relieve Motley Rice (\u201cMotley Rice\u201d) of its duties regarding the MDL 875 submissions database. (Pis. Mot. to Amend at 17.) The database was created by Admin\u00edstra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tive Order no. 13 as a tool for the Court to manage the information submitted by Plaintiffs pursuant to Administrative Order no. 12.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Administrative Order no. 13, doc. no. 5040, Jan. 29, 2008.) The law firms of Forman, Perry, Watkins, Krutz &amp; Tardy, LLP (\u201cForman Perry\u201d) and Motley Rice were appointed to assist the Court in managing the database by Defendants\u2019 steering committee and Plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee, respectively. <em>Id. </em>Forman Perry was also tasked with uploading to the database any paper Administrative Order no. 12 submissions that had been submitted prior to the creation of the database. When Forman Perry last updated the Court on the progress of uploading paper submissions, Forman Perry indicated that the database included 80% of such submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The continuing assistance of counsel from each steering committee is important in maintaining the functionality and impartiality of the database. The Court is very appreciative of the many hours that both Motley Rice and Forman Perry have spent assisting with the administration of the MDL 875 submissions database.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">With that said, the Court has no particular preference as to which member of the Plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee is liaison counsel in charge of the MDL 875 submissions database. Nevertheless, Motley Rice has not provided the Court with the name of another member of the steering committee that is ready, willing and able to fill their role. The Court is reluctant to appoint another law firm <em>sua sponte </em>to fill this important position. If Motley Rice reaches an agreement with another steering committee member to take over these duties, the Court will entertain a motion to relieve Motley Rice at that time. Meanwhile, Motley Rice\u2019s obligations as Plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee appointee for the database, pursuant to Administrative Order no. 13, shall continue until further order of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">C. <em>Filing Dismissal Orders on PACER/ECF in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">The third request made by Plaintiffs is that the Court allow Plaintiffs to file dismissal orders and/or orders for transfer to the \u201cbankruptcy only\u201d docket on PACER/ECF. (Pis. Mot. to Amend at 17.) The Clerk of the Court is in the process of transferring all electronic files in all cases to this judicial district and assigning each individual plaintiff in the MDL 875 litigation from across the country an Eastern District of Pennsylvania civil action number.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the case involves multiple plaintiffs, the Court is severing the cases and requiring such Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and pay a filing fee. Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Plaintiff who files an amended complaint is then assigned an E.D. Pa. number.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Once a Plaintiff is assigned an E.D. Pa. civil action number, either by transfer of the file from the transferor district or by the filing of an amended complaint in this district, these motions may be filed electronically in the E.D. Pa. using the PACER/ECF system. Until Plaintiff is assigned an E.D. Pa. civil action number, any motions filed on behalf of that Plaintiff must be filed in the transferor district court and a separate copy must be sent to the clerk in the E.D. Pa. This policy is reflected in the recently amended Administrative Order no. 11. (Administrative Order no. 11, doc. no. 5986, Mar. 16, 2009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Once all of the cases are transferred from the various district courts to the E.D. Pa., which the Court expects will occur in the next few months, PACER/ECF filing on the E.D. Pa system will be available to all Plaintiffs and Defendants in the entire MDL 875 litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">D. <em>Grouping Non-Malignant Claims for Settlement Conference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Finally, Plaintiffs request that the Court allow them to group non-malignant cases for settlement conferences. (Pis. Mot. to Amend at 17.) The Court is scheduling settlement conferences, both in individual cases and groups of cases, on an ongoing basis. Four Magistrate Judges and at least one District Judge are also conducting settlement conferences in appropriate cases on an ongoing basis. With these available resources, the Court is able to schedule many individual and group settlement conferences simultaneously. If Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wishes to request a settlement conference in a case or group of cases, the procedures making such request are available on the MDL 875 website. <em>See </em>\u201cSettlement Conference Procedures,\u201d MDL 875: In re: asbestos website, <em>available at wum.paed.uscourts.gov/mdl875.asp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The Court\u2019s case management procedures are not arbitrary. These procedures are designed to help manage a large and diverse docket and to accommodate fairly the many diverse interests present in the litigation. The request by certain Plaintiffs to alter it wholesale will neither improve efficiency nor promote the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">An appropriate order follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">AND NOW, this 30th day of April, 2009, it is hereby ORDERED that certain Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to alter or amend Administrative Order nos. 3, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 (doc. no. 5539) is DENIED without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">It is further ORDERED that Administrative Order no. 18 shall be entered forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">AND IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>EXHIBIT \"A\"</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-16\">.
