In order to appeal to the Law Court, a party must demonstrate that he was aggrieved by the lower court\u2019s order or decision. 15 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2115 (1980) (criminal); 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1851 (1980) (civil). Because neither of the defendants, nor their counsel, has shown that he is aggrieved by, or has any legally cognizable interest in, the Superior Court\u2019s order, we must dismiss this appeal. <em>See State v. Drown, </em>447 A.2d 466, 471 (Me.1982) (State\u2019s appeal of indictment dismissal as improvident for want of ag-grievement where State could seek a proper indictment); <em>Jamison v. Shepard, </em>270 A.2d 861, 862-63 (Me.1970) (defendant is not aggrieved by possible confusion where jury returned verdict for full amount consented to by defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-23\">The entry is:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-24\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-25\">All concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
