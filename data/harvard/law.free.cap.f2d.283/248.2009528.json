The appellant was surety on the bond. The principal on the bond failed to appear when the conviction was affirmed, and the appellant, after judgment of forfeiture, paid over the penal sum of the bond to the United States. The appellant made unsuccessful efforts to locate its defaulting principal and expended $2,909.52 in so doing. After two and a half years the principal was apprehended by agents of the United States. The appellant moved for a remission of the forfeiture. No showing was made of the cost to the United States of the apprehension of the appellant\u2019s principal. Perhaps such a showing could not have been made. We are asked to reverse the order of the district court denying the appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number> If justice does not require the enforcement of a forfeiture it may be set aside or remitted.
