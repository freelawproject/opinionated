Biglione, an employee of respondent, testified that he joined a union during the course of a strike, that he stayed away from work while the strike was in progress and that when he went back to the garage after its conclusion Katz, respondent\u2019s president, conditionally offered to reinstate him in his job. There were several self-contradictions in Big-lione\u2019s testimony as to whether this offer was on condition that he write to the union and resign his membership therein, or on condition that he obtain a letter addressed to him from the union stating that he was no longer a member, or on condition that Katz receive such a union letter. Katz, the other witness, testified that Biglione never spoke to him. However, his testimony was impeached by the Board\u2019s counsel, and the trial examiner specifically discredited it. The trial examiner also concluded that Biglione \u201cwas not a reliable witness\u201d and held that there was insufficient trustworthy evidence for him to hold that respondent had committed an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Board reversed its trial examiner. It chose to accept the testimony of the discharged employee as the more trustworthy testimony, and ordered him reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">It is beyond question that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to make non-membership in a union a condition of employment. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1940, 313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The Board\u2019s decision that such a condition was proposed to be exacted here must be measured by whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. In support of the Board\u2019s-order is the finding of the examiner discrediting the employer\u2019s testimony. It is a fair inference that Katz wished to cover up the true purpose of his conversation with Biglione. The Board further-relies on the testimony of the employee, which, though found unreliable by the-examiner, was considered by the Board to be sufficiently reliable to warrant a different result from that reached by the-examiner. The Board based its conclusion on the fact that though there was confusion in the details of the employee's \u25a0 testimony he did not vary his claim that a condition of his rehiring was his disaffiliation with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Because he has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness the \u2022 credibility to be accorded a witness is ordinarily a matter for the trial examiner. N. L. R. B. v. James Thompson &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 743. But an examiner\u2019s findings, based upon his opinion of credibility, are not necessarily to-be taken as determinative, for the record bn review may well create doubts with respect to the truthfulness of a witness-so powerful that they outweigh any - evaluation based upon demeanor. N. L. R. B. v. James Thompson &amp; Co., supra, at page 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\"> Under the above test it would: appear that, in the light of the confusion and self-contradiction in Biglione\u2019s testimony, the examiner who saw and heard the witness could properly discredit him. However, the Board, in its turn, could rely on the totality of the testimony given, evaluated in the light of the examiner's findings of credibility unfavorable to both employer and employee, and thereby support its ultimate decision contrary to that of the examiner. See N. L. R. B. v. Pacific Intermountain Express Co., 8 Cir., 1956, 228 F.2d 170. In view of all the evidence before it, it cannot be \u2022 said that the Board\u2019s result was not supported by substantial evidence in the-record.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Respondent maintains that the Board failed to prove its own jurisdiction. This claim is of no avail. See N. L. R. B. v. Pease Oil Co., 2 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 135, 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
