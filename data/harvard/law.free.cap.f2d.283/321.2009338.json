We briefly summarize that evidence. Booker was born in 1900. He went to elementary school for eight years, and left school at the age of seventeen or eighteen. When 25 years of age he went to work for the Birmingham Transit Company, and thereafter worked steadily for that Company until he was 56. An examination by his family physician, Dr. C. W. Deaver, then revealed a blood pressure of 220/120, and on January 9, 1957, Dr. Deaver made a detailed report to his employer concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">\u201cDiagnoses: 1. Hypertension with albuminuria</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">2. Psychoneurosis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">3. Hypertrophied prostate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-16\">\"I believe it would be detrimental to Mr. Booker\u2019s health and to the safety of the Birmingham Transit Company for him to continue as a bus operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">Booker did not work for the Birmingham Transit Company after November of 1956. Since that time, he has not been bedridden or continuously confined to his home, but has driven a car, and has been able to help his wife with the housework to the extent of sweeping the front porch and walk. His wife has been under a doctor\u2019s care for 10 or 12 years, and has no earnings. His drug bills run about $20.00 to $30.00 a month. He receives $80.65 as a monthly disability payment from the Transit Company. His children are married and have their own responsibilities, but help their parents to the extent of $10.00 or $12.00 a month. His wife\u2019s brother has contributed a total of $500.00, $300.00 of which went to pay for a prostate operation in January of 1956. The only evidence of gainful employment since 1956 was furnished by Booker himself, and since that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>is important we quote Booker\u2019s testimony on that subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cQ. Have you done any work for anybody at any time since November of 1956? A. Yes, Sir. I have got a friend that owns a used car lot, and I hang around there and pick up $15 or $20 a week out of that. I have to have something to try to help pay drug bills, and he is good enough to me to help me out a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cQ. What does he expect you to do for this $15 or $20 a week? A. Well, I answer the telephone and stay around there when he is gone. I help him in any way that I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201cQ. Well, do you sell cars? A. I help him. I am no salesman. I have never done anything but streetcar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cQ. How do you help him sell a car? A. I talk to the folks that come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201cQ. If two people come in there at once, do you talk to one and he talks to the other? A. Yes, I will talk to one until he gets a chance to get to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201cQ. If you sell a car before he comes over, do you get anything for that? A. No, I never close a deal. He does the closing of a deal. I never sell a car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201cQ. When did you first start doing this? A. I had been helping him some before I was ever disqualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">\u201cQ. Do you recall when you first started doing that? Was it a year before you left your job, or six months. A. It was about six months, I presume.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">\u201cQ. Six months before you left work? A. Approximately. I don\u2019t know the definite time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">\u201cQ. Do you sweep up or dust around the o\u00edfiee? A. No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">\u201cQ. Do you ever drive a car around with a customer in it to show them how it runs? A. Only if he is busy. That is his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">Q. But you do it on occasions? A. Yes, on a few occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">\u201cQ. Do you do this with new cars? A. No, used cars. It is a small lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-18\">\u201cQ. How many hours a day does this involve? A. About ten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-19\">\u201cQ. Ten hours a day? A. Yes. I tell you, it\u2019s awful \u2014 sometimes twelve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-21\">\u201cQ. Is that day time or night time? A. Day time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-22\">\u201cQ. Do you do this every day? A. Yes, Sir, every day I am physically able. Some days I ain\u2019t able to get out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-23\">\u201cQ. How many days a week do you work at this used car lot? A. I can\u2019t answer that. I never have tried to keep up with it. I am going to doctors at different times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-25\">\u201cQ. Would you say you average about five days a week? A. Yes, about that. Sometimes I am off a week when I am down with this nephritis, but I would put that as an average figure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-26\">\u201cQ. And you make between $15 and $20 a week? A. Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-27\">\u201cQ. Since you have stopped work, have you done anything else for any other person? A. No, Sir. - The only reason I could do that is that there isn\u2019t any work to it\u2014 just sitting around. The doctors won\u2019t let me do nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-28\">The five doctors, whose statements were submitted by Booker, all agreed subsantially that he suffered from high blood pressure (the readings ranging from 180/120 to 240/130), from psychoneurosis, and from chronic nephritis. Dr. Deaver, his family physician, advised him \u201cnot to work.\u201d Dr. Young, who operated on him for chronic prostatitis, advised \u201clight work.\u201d Dr. Herren, on consultative examination, requested by Alabama\u2019s Disability Determination Team, recommended \u201creferral to State Vocational Rehabilitation Service for relocation in non-hazardous work.\u201d Dr. Williamson concluded: \u201cIn view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>history and findings, it is our opinion that Mr. Booker is totally and permanently disabled.\u201d Dr. Gaines\u2019 conclusion was: \u201cIn view of the Hypertension and Chronic Nephritis, it is my opinion that he is totally and permanently disabled from pursuing any gainful occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYb\">The Referee, found that, \u201cthe regularity and continuity of claimant\u2019s services in the used car lot during this statutory period makes a finding of inability to engage in gainful work wholly untenable.\u201d We do not agree. There is no reason why the rules established by the Supreme Court and by this Circuit in connection with other statutes should not be here applicable. In Berry v. United States, 1941, 312 U.S. 450, 455, 456, 61 S.Ct. 637, 639, 85 L.Ed. 945, Mr. Justice Black, speaking for a unanimous Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">\u201cIt was not necessary that petitioner be bedridden, wholly helpless, or that he should abandon every possible effort to work in order for the jury to find that he was totally and permanently disabled. It cannot be doubted that if petitioner had refrained from trying to do any work at all, and the same evidence of physical impairment which appears in this record had been offered, a jury could have properly found him totally and permanently disabled. And the jury could have found that his efforts to work \u2014 all of which sooner or later resulted in failure \u2014 were made not because of his ability to work but because of his unwillingness to live a life of idleness, even though totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of his policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In Mabry v. Travelers Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1952, 193 F.2d 497, 498, Judge Holmes, for this Circuit, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cPinched by poverty, beset by adversity, driven by necessity, one may work to keep the wolf away from the door though not physically able to work; and, under the law in this case, the fact that the woman worked to earn her living did not prevent a <em>jury from </em>finding, from the evidence before it, that she was totally and permanently disabled even while working.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Moreover, the inability must be \u201cto engage in any <em>substantial </em>gainful activity\u201d (See n. 1, supra). Booker\u2019s total yearly earnings in the used car lot must have been less than $1,000.00, and that does not measure up to the Department\u2019s policy as described in a report submitted to the House Committee on Ways and Means by the Subcommittee on the Administration of the Social Security Laws on March 9, 1960:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cPresent Department policy in interpreting the effect of earnings on a finding of \u2018substantial gainful activity\u2019 is found in the confidential manual, which states that if an individual earns over $1,200 a year he is engaging in \u2018substantial gainful activity\u2019 in \u2018absence of evidence to the contrary.\u2019 The binding nature of this guide is shown by the fact that, upon subcommittee request, a survey was undertaken which showed that no disability beneficiary was maintained on the rolls after he demonstrated an earning capacity of more than $1,200 a year in competitive non subsidized employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The Referee, in his decision, further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">\u201cThe Statute and federal regulations pertinent thereto prescribe the criteria for evaluation: the medical impairment or combination of impairments must be so grave as to be equatable to the loss of use of two limbs. 20 CFR 404.1501 (1958 Supp.).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">The cited regulation does not support the Referee\u2019s statement, but simply gives \u201closs of use of two limbs\u201d as one among many \u201cexamples\u201d of inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity. Another part of that regulation states that, \u201cConsideration is also given to such other factors as the individual\u2019s education, training and work experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number> We agree with another attempt of the Referee to elaborate upon the statutory definition of \u201cdisability\u201d (See n. 1, supra):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201c To come within the standard of \u2018disability\u2019 as defined by the Congress, the claimant must be unable to engage in <em>any </em>substantial gainful activity, his former or <em>any other </em>job or occupation in which he might be employable, taking into consideration his age, training, work experience, and physical and mental capacities (Report of Senate Committee on Finance, Report 1987, 83rd Congress, 2nd Session, p. 20, 21).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">See also, Aaron v. Fleming, D.C.M.D. Ala.E.D., 168 F.Supp. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Measured by that standard and the statutory definitions of disability, we agree with the learned district court that the findings of the Secretary are not supported by substantial evidence. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-28\">. So far as applies to this case, the definitions of disability in Section 216(i) (1) and in Section 223 are identical. We quote from Section 223 (c) (2) :</p>\n<p id=\"b389-30\">\u201c(2) The term \u2018disability\u2019 means inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. An individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless he furnishes such proof of the existence thereof as may be required.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. In pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u201c(g) Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow. * * * As part of its answer the Secretary shall file a certified copy of the transcript of the record including the evidence upon which the findings and decision corn-plained of are based. The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing. The findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive * * *. The judgment of the court shall be final except that it shall be subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in other civil actions.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b390-20\">.

Upon the present record we find it unnecessary to decide whether any presumption of correctness should be accorded to the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
