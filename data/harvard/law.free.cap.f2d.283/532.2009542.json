The claim is based on an alleged employment contract purportedly approved by the board of directors of the corporation at meetings on June 6, 1957 and July 1, 1957. Both the referee and the district court found and held that no meeting of the corporation directors was held on the dates specified and that the alleged contract was not authorized, approved or ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Appellant contends that the findings of fact referred to are not supported by the evidence and that efforts of the California Corporation Commissioner to terminate appellant\u2019s employment were void because based on unconstitutional state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">When reviewed and considered as a whole, the record discloses substantial evidence from which.inferences can reasonably be drawn that fully support the facts found as above stated- Such holding obviates consideration of appellant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
