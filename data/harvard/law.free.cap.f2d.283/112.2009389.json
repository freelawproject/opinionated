It also ordered respondent to make whole the employee discharged for loss of pay suffered thereby, and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\"> The credibility of the witnesses and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence are matters for determination by the Board. United Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 6 Cir., 252 F.2d 428, 430. We are of the opinion that the findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole and must be accepted on this review. N.L.R.B. v. Bishop, 6 Cir., 228 F.2d 68, 70; N.L.R.B. v. Aluminum Workers, etc., 7 Cir., 230 F.2d 515, 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">The order of the Board based on such findings is not erroneous, and it is decreed that said order be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
