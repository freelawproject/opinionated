United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28, United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b947-22\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b947-23\">This is an appeal from a decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>(120 USPQ 402) affirming a decision of the Examiner of Interferences, which dismissed an opposition brought by Lever Brothers Company against an application by Producers Chemical Service (Petroleum Specialty Company, Assignee, Substituted), for the registration of \u201cShux\u201d as a trademark for Toilet, Laundry, and Industrial Cleaners in the form of Liquids, Solids, Pastes and Powders. Applicant claimed use of the mark \u201cShux\u201d since July 18, 1955, and was adjudged entitled to the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The opposition is based on appellant\u2019s well-known trademark \u201cLux\u201d used for soap flakes, toilet soap and liquid detergent. \u201cLux\u201d was first used and registered by appellant for soap flakes in the year 1900 and has been used in its business continuously since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The original opinions in this case were rendered on July 13, 1960. Appellant filed a petition for rehearing on August 25, 1960 and a \u201cSupplemental Statement\u201d on October 3, 1960. Appellee\u2019s brief in opposition to appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing was filed October 12, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">In accordance with our usual practice, our former opinions were withheld from formal publication. They are hereby withdrawn and replaced by the present opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">The sole issue here is whether there is any likelihood of purchaser confusion by the concurrent use of the marks \u201cShux\u201d and \u201cLux\u201d on the goods of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">From our study of the record we find that it supports the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-9\">\u201cThe products of the parties are alike in that they remove dirt, but they are specifically quite different. Opposer\u2019s products are (a) a toilet soap, (b) a mild soap flakes for washing innumerable commodities in water and (c) a mild detergent for washing innumerable commodities in water. Applicant\u2019s product is a hand cleaner for use with or without water for removing grease, paint, tar, grime, ink and carbon black.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">We also agree with the Assistant Commissioner in her comparison of the two marks in their entireties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">\u201cThe marks are alike only in that they rhyme. Applicant\u2019s mark is an obvious misspelling of \u2018shucks,\u2019 an ordinary English word which might, as reasoned by applicant, suggest that the cleaner bearing the mark \u2018shucks,\u2019 or \u2018removes\u2019 or \u2018strips\u2019 the dirt, grime, ink or grease from the hands of the user; or it might suggest the exclamation \u2018Shucks!\u2019 often used to express disappointment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Further support for the view taken by the Assistant Commissioner is found in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Unabridged, 1954, which contains the following significant definitions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-14\">\u201cShucks, inter j.: An exclamation expressing contempt or disappointment; pshaw! slang, U. S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-15\">\u201cshuck, v.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-16\">\u201c1. to strip off the shucks, or husks, as to shuck nuts, corn, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-17\">\u201c2. to remove (oysters) from the shell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-18\">\u201c3. to remove; to turn (out); to lay aside or discard. Colloq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aad-dedup-0\">Appellee\u2019s mark \u201cShux\u201d being but a phonetic spelling of the common word \u201cshucks,\u201d has its own definite and distinctive meanings which, in the mind of the potential purchaser, would clearly distinguish it from the word \u201cLux.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-19\">Since we can see no likelihood of the marks \u201cLux\u201d and \u201cShux\u201d being confused by a potential purchaser, the decision of the Assistant Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"atg-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
