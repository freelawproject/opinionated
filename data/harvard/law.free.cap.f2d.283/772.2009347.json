At his trial, evidence was introduced tending to show that appellant, via statements to the press, remarks at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, and the mails, falsely misrepresented the prospects of the Uran Mining Corporation, in which he was the leading figure, resulting in the sale of $245,000 worth of Uran stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-21\">Appellant urges that no evidence of a \u201cscheme\u201d was introduced. But we find the record replete with evidence of deliberately false statements concerning Uran, demonstrating a generally fraudulent purpose. This was sufficient to show the requisite \u201cscheme or artifice,\u201d even if appellant\u2019s initial activities had proceeded from a wholly legitimate motive. Cf. United States v. Dilliard, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 829, 834, certiorari denied 306 U.S. 635, 59 S.Ct. 484, 83 L.Ed. 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-22\">Appellant also complains of the admission of evidence. Some of these claims of error are patently without merit; as to others, he fails to show prejudice. In particular, he claims, that the evidence admitted tended to minimize the testimony of the defense witness Tip-ton, a geologist. But Tipton had not been engaged by Uran until April 1958 and evidence of an earlier period was admissible for its direct bearing on the issues. Moreover, any tendency such evidence might have to minimize Tipton\u2019s testimony would not render it inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-23\">We have examined appellant\u2019s other contentions and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
