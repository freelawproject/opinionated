The alleged bribery related to the exportation of the arms. Appellant\u2019s principal contention here is that there was insufficient evidence to connect him with the conspiracy, and that, therefore, knowledge of others charged with him could not legally be imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">We think the record amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict on all points. Appellant\u2019s criticism of the extensive participation by the trial judge in the conduct of the trial does not disclose any prejudice resulting from the questioning of witnesses by the judge. It is not contended that such interrogation was carried on in a manner that would in any way discredit the defendant or his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-20\">There being no prejudicial error in the conduct of the trial, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
