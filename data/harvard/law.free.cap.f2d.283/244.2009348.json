Delaney v. United States, 263 U.S. 586, 44 S.Ct. 206, 68 L.Ed. 462, requires a holding that no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">The appellant Miller asserts that the evidence showed that there were four stills and a separate conspiracy with respect to the operation of each of them resulting, as to him, in a variance between the indictment and the proof. We find no necessity for a recital of the evidence that was adduced at the trial. The case calls for an application of the statement that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-19\">\u201cUnder the evidence in this case, we think that it was for the jury to say whether there was any conspiracy and if so, whether one or more than one. If more than one conspiracy was proved, of at least one of which the appellant was guilty, it is clear that there was no variance affecting his substantial rights.\u201d Jol-ley v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 232 F.2d 83, 88.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">No error or variance which affects the substantial rights of the appellants being shown, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
