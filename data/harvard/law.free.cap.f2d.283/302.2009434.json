The evidence relating to the issue of whether this claimant was disabled within the terms of the definition stated above was carefully examined and weighed by the trial judge and his conclusions are supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. We therefore cannot set them aside even though we were to reach a different result approaching the matter <em>de novo. </em>The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
