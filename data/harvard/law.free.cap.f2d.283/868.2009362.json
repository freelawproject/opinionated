Plaintiff\u2019s complaint relies on Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (Title 29, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185) for its assertion of jurisdiction of the United States District Court. Defendant's motion charges that the plaintiff\u2019s action is not one that could be brought under said Section 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-19\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint sought enforcement of a contract between the plaintiff union, representing defendant\u2019s employees, and defendant company, providing a pension plan to cover said employees. The legal question involved in the motion and relevant authorities are carefully reviewed by the opinion of Judge Freeman. We agree with his conclusion and are satisfied that his opinion adequately covers and disposes of the matter before this Court upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-20\">Now, therefore, upon consideration of the record, the briefs, and the oral argument of counsel, IT IS ORDERED that the order of the District Court denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is hereby affirmed for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the District Judge. Local No. 90, etc. v. Welbilt Corporation, D. C., 178 F.Supp. 408.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
