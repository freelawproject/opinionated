The ease was tried to a jury and the jury under instructions from the trial judge which are not complained of returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-14\">The plaintiff bases his appeal upon the claim that there was not substantial evidence t'o support the jury\u2019s finding and that we should review the order of the trial judge in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial. The difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s position is that the facts were fully developed at the trial and submitted to the jury. The jury evidently did not accept the plaintiff\u2019s version of the claimed operative facts. There was a fair basis for the jury\u2019s consideration and its \u25a0verdict must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
