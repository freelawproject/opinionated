Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 1960, 398 Pa. 415, 158 A.2d 461 and are moved by it to conclude that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would hold that the Commission is not immune from actions premised on its negligent construction, operation or maintenance of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">In Lichtenstein v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission it was held that where the Commission condemns and enters upon land and a board of viewers awards the landowner damages the Commission is liable for interest on the award. Of special significance is the fact that in so holding the Pennsylvania Supreme Court expressly overruled its earlier decision in Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. Smith, 1944, 350 Pa. 355, 39 A.2d 139 insofar as that case equated the Commission with the Commonwealth in respect of liability for interest on claims against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">In overruling the Smith case the Court said (398 Pa. at pages 419-420, 158 A.2d at page 462):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">\u201cNothing could be clearer than that claims against the Turnpike Commission are not chargeable to the Commonwealth. Yet, the above quoted statement from the Smith case plainly implies that the liabilities of the Turnpike Commission do not bear interest because the Commission is, in effect, the <em>alter ego </em>of the Commonwealth which is not liable for interest. This conclusion was reasoned from the fact that the Act of May 21, 1937, P.L. 774, No. 211, 36 PS \u00a7 652a et seq., which created the Turnpike Commission, constituted it \u2018an instrumentality of the Com--<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>monwealth,\u2019 performing \u2018an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth.\u2019 But, equally so is every legislatively ordained municipal corporation, school district or political subdivision. School districts especially afford notable examples of in-strumentalities of the Commonwealth engaged in the performance of an essential governmental function, the responsibility for the discharge whereof is laid primarily on the Commonwealth by the Constitution, which declares that the General Assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient public school system. Art. X, Section 1, P.S. Certainly, no one can justifiably contend that, under the Act of 1929, as amended, governmental instrumentalities, such as school districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions are not liable for interest on awards of viewers for damages for property taken under the power of eminent domain; and no meritorious reason is apparent why the Act of 1929, as amended, is not also applicable to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission * -K * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">\u201cIn the Culver case, supra [Culver v. Commonwealth, 348 Pa. 472, 35 A.2d 64 (1944)], it was said that to make the Commonwealth liable for interest, the legislature would expressly have to so declare, the <em>rationale </em>being that, without such legislative declaration, the Commonwealth is free from liability for interest because of its sovereign immunity. But, it would be carrying this particular immunity beyond justifiable limits to extend it to an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, created for the performance of an essential governmental function, where liability for the principal sum involved resulted from the appropriation by the instrumentality, under its power of eminent domain, of private property for use in the furtherance of the public purpose for which the instrumentality was created * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It seems clear from the foregoing that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Lichtenstein did not subscribe to the concept of the Pennsylvania Common Pleas Courts that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission is the alter ego of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and that its status as an \u201cinstrumentality of the Commonwealth\u201d and the fact that it was engaged in the performance of \u201can essential governmental function\u201d endow it with the sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">It is also clear from what was decided and said in Lichtenstein that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission occupies the status of a \u201clegislatively ordained municipal corporation, school district or political subdivision\u201d and as such is suable for negligence in the discharge of its legislatively assigned functions to construct, operate and maintain the Pennsylvania Turnpike. It is settled in Pennsylvania that municipalities or political subdivisions may be sued for negligent maintenance of their highways. Clark v. Allegheny County, 1918, 260 Pa. 199, 103 A. 552; Camp v. Allegheny County, 1919, 263 Pa. 276, 106 A. 314; see generally 17 Pa.Law Ency., Highways \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The holding in Lichtenstein that the Commission is not the <em>alter ego </em>of the Commonwealth is in consonance with what was earlier said in Gitlin v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 1956, 384 Pa. 326, 121 A.2d 79. There the Court in disposing of the contention that the Commission as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth was endowed with its sovereignty stated (384 Pa. at page 330, 121 A.2d at page 81):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">\u201cThe Commission is not the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">Of interest is the recent case of Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. County of Fulton, 143 Leg.Int. 71 (Common Pleas Court Fulton Co. 1960) where it was held that land acquired by the Commission in connection with the acquisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tion of a right of way but not actually used for Turnpike purposes was subject to county taxes. The opinion writer was Judge Sheely who had written the first of the Common Pleas Court decisions\u2014 House v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, supra \u2014 holding the Commission to be immune from suits for negligence on the ground that as an \u201cinstrumentality of the Commonwealth\u201d performing a governmental function it was endowed with the sovereignty of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. County of Pulton, Judge Sheely said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201c * * * it is also true that the Act of May 21, 1937, P.L. 774, 36 P.S. \u00a7 652a et seq., which created the Turnpike Commission, constituted it \u2018an instrumentality of the Commonwealth\u2019 performing \u2018an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth,\u2019 but it does not follow that the Turnpike Commission is thereby vested with all the immunities of the Commonwealth. This was expressly decided in Lichtenstein v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 398 Pa. 415 [158 A.2d 461] (1960) * * * It was specifically held that the Turnpike Commission was not, in effect, the alter ego of the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In view of the foregoing we are of the opinion that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would hold that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission may be sued for negligence in the construction, operation and maintenance of the Turnpike.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">There remains for disposition the contention of the Commission that if suable it must be sued in the \u201cproper courts at the county of Dauphin\u201d under Pennsylvania law. In doing so it points to the following provision in the Pennsylvania Turnpike Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201cThe commission may sue and be sued in its own name, plead and be impleaded: Provided, however, That any and all actions at law or in equity against the commission shall be brought only in the proper courts at the county of Dauphin.\u201d Act of May 16, 1940, Extra Sess., P.L. 949, \u00a7 6, 36 P.S. \u00a7 653e(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">The Commission urges that should this Court find a \u201cwaiver\u201d of the immunity of the Commission, such \u201cwaiver\u201d, by virtue of the above quoted proviso, has been limited to actions brought in the state courts in Dauphin County, relying upon Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm., 1946, 327 U.S. 573, 66 S.Ct. 745, 90 L.Ed. 862; Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 1945, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389; Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 1944, 322 U.S. 47, 64 S.Ct. 873, 88 L.Ed. 1121. The plaintiffs, however, contend that a state is without the power to deprive a federal court of its other-1 wise proper diversity jurisdiction by restricting suit against the state-created entity to state courts, where, as here, they argue that entity is deemed separate and distinct from the state. Lincoln County v. Luning, 1890, 133 U.S. 529, 10 S.Ct. 373, 33 L.Ed. 766; Louisiana Highway Comm. v. Farnsworth, 5 Cir., 1935, 74 F.2d 910, certiorari denied 294 U.S. 729, 55 S.Ct. 638, 79 L.Ed. 1259. Plaintiffs further contend that the Kennecott, Ford Motor and Read cases, supra, are in-apposite \u201csince their rulings are restricted to fiscal claims against the State on State taxation matters. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">We find it unnecessary to decide this very interesting issue as posed by the parties. See Markham v. City of Newport News, D.C.E.D.Va.1960,184 F.Supp. 659; Hart &amp; Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 609 (1953); Note, Waiver of State Immunity to Suit With Special Reference to Suits in Federal Courts, 45 Mich.L.Rev. 348 (1947). As we have already determined that a suit against the Commission is not a suit against the Commonwealth, the problems raised by the Kennecott, Ford Motor and Read cases, supra, in ascertaining whether a state has limited its consent to suit in state courts is not here present. The Commission is a \u201ccitizen\u201d of a state for purposes of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the federal courts. Suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The Middle District of Pennsylvania includes Dauphin County. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania is one of the \u201cproper courts at the county of Dauphin\u201d., Therefore the statutory provision has been complied with and we need not determine what its effect would be had suit been brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, see Eastern Motor Express, Inc. v. Espenshade, supra, or had the statute purported to expressly limit suit against the Commission to a state court, see Lincoln County v. Luning, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">. The action was brought on behalf of the minor plaintiff, Carl Gerr, and his father, plaintiff Stanley Gerr, to recover damages for injuries sustained by Carl as the result of an automobile accident on the Philadelphia Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The negligence of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission is alleged to have been its failure to erect a guard rail at the point where the vehicle operated by Carl went off the Turnpike after being struck by a vehicle operated by the defendant Harry William Emrick. Jurisdiction was based on a diversity of citizenship \u2014 the plaintiffs are citizens of Connecticut, defendant Emrick is a citizen of Illinois and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission is a citizen of Pennsylvania. In its Answer to the Complaint the Commission averred as its \u201cFirst Defense\u201d lack of jurisdiction on the part of the District Court \u201cbecause it [the action] is in substance and effect against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which has not consented to be sued or waived its immunity from suit.\u201d The Commission also urged in the court below, as it does here, that assuming absence of immunity the Commission could be sued only in the Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) Courts. The District Court did not reach the latter contention and dismissed the action as to the Commission on the ground of its immunity from suit. It further entered an Order in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., expressly determining that there was no just reason for delay in the entry of a final judgment of dismissal as to the Commission and this appeal followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-17\">.
