The jury was justified in finding negligence on defendant\u2019s part in the failure of its attendant to assist her in her attempts to open the gate to get out. The court\u2019s charge requiring the highest degree of care for plaintiff\u2019s safety by defendant as a common carrier was required by Vermont law if the defendant was to be regarded as such carrier; on the meager authority available in that state, as well as in reason, the judge\u2019s ruling to that effect was justified. Perhaps the court might have stressed somewhat more that the care required must still be that \u201ccommensurate with the circumstances\u201d calling for its exercise. See Ploesser v. Burlington Rapid Transit Co., 121 Vt. 133, 149 A.2d 728, 731. Nevertheless its earlier general charge on negligence and its references to \u201cthe circumstances surrounding\u201d plaintiff\u2019s accident could hardly have been misunderstood and were adequate, particularly in the absence of any request by defendant\u2019s counsel for further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
