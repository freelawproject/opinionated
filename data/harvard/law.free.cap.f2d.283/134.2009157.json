The jurisdiction of the district court was predicated on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3231, and this court has jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-19\">Counsel for appellant characterizes \u201cany appeal as one chance in a million,\u201d and that \u201cthe whole appeal process is ruled into predetermined absurdity.\u201d He states \u201cthere are no disputed facts whatsoever in this entire record or the Reporter\u2019s Transcript.\u201d Yet he says the appellant denied what the police officer had testified to concerning the participation by Rios in facilitating the transportation and sale of heroin. This police testimony, says counsel for appellant, only <em>\u201cimplies\u201d </em>knowledge of the violation, of the narcotic laws by the defendant Rios, and only \u201csuggests by words of the officer\u201d that the appellant was remotely connected with the traffic. Despite his disapproval of appellate procedures, he asks a reversal of the conviction by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-20\">From the transcript we read that defendant Rios was sitting in his Chevrolet automobile with his six year old son at a service station. Somewhere between six and twenty feet away an undercover officer was attempting to make a purchase and obtain delivery of heroin. Co-defendant Garcia, also known as \u201cTito,\u201d approached the agent, Gjertsen, displayed a packet with a number of white capsules in it and said (testimony of Gjertsen on direct examination):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-21\">\u201c \u2018This is the connection and he is going to pick up and he is going to pick up for the fellow in the Chevrolet and I just told him that we would like to get hold of a quarter ounce and he says he can do it, but you have to advance the $75.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-22\">\u201cHe says, \u2018The man is okay and he won\u2019t burn you for your money. He won\u2019t steal your money,\u2019 and he says, \u2018As proof, the guy is holding right now,\u2019 and he displayed this packet of, oh, I would say 15 to 18 capsules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201cSo I got out of the ear when I saw the capsules, I got out of the car and Garcia walked back to Ross Ruiz and gave him the packet of capsules, and I spoke to Ross Ruiz and I said, \u2018Look, I want to pick up a quarter ounce, but,\u2019 I said, T have been burned too many, times and I don\u2019t want my money 'out front.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cBy Mr. Bevan:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">\u201cQ. Were you still at your automobile at that time ? A. No. I got out and approached Ross Ruiz in the company of Jesus Garcia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cQ. How close were you to the defendant Rios at this time? Did you move any closer ? A. Yes. We were right next to his car, about eight feet, six or eight feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cQ. The driver\u2019s or passenger\u2019s side ? A. Of the car, that would be the passenger side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201cQ. Was Mr. Rios seated in the driver\u2019s side? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201cQ. Proceed. What was the conversation? A. I told Ruiz I wouldn\u2019t let the money go out front, I wouldn\u2019t turn loose of the money. I said, T got my car and my partner sitting there and,\u2019 I said, \u2018if you are going to go pick up, I will follow you out to the area and then I will give you the money, because I want a guarantee that you don\u2019t steal my money without bringing back the heroin.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\">\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, \u2018No,\u2019 he says, \u2018When I go pick up, I am not going to let these two guys,\u2019 referring to Garcia and Rios, Frank Rios, Jr., he said, \u2018When I go pick up, they are not going to meet the connection, either, but,\u2019 he says, T am going to let them follow me to the immediate area and then I will go make the connection and I will bring them their stuff and they can bring you your stuff.\u2019 He says, \u2018You can\u2019t come with me in my car, but,\u2019 he said, \u2018talk to the other guy and if he will let you go in his car, it\u2019s all right with me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-15\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate anyone? <em>A. </em>Yes, Frank Rios, Jr. I turned and stuck my head into the car of Frank Rios, Jr., and I said, \u2018Look, I want to pick up a quarter piece and this guy won\u2019t let me follow in my ear and he won\u2019t let me go in his car. How about if I go along with you ?*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-16\">\u201cHe said, \u2018No, man. Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018If we are going into an area where there is a lot of police and sheriffs in the area\u2019 \u2014 he said, \u2018When I go pick up, I don\u2019t want anybody-in the car with me because when you get two more people in the ear, the sheriff stops you and,\u2019 he said,. \u2018When I pick up, I always take the kid along with me and they don\u2019t bother me. If you get into the car, you might have some heat on you and Tito is going to get in the ear and I know we will get busted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-17\">\u201cSo he said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t come with me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-18\">\u201cI turned around and I said, \u2018Look,\u2019 I talked to Ross Ruiz, I said, \u2018I will agree to this. I trust Tito. I will let him have the $75. He can go. He will go with you.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-19\">\u201cHe said, \u2018No, he is not going with me,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Let him go with Rios.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-20\">\u201cSo I said, \u2018Okay, he can go along with this man.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-21\">\u201cRuiz said, \u2018He will go with this guy and they can follow me and you go over to Tito\u2019s house and wait at Tito\u2019s house and the deal will only take about an hour and you will have your stuff in about an hour/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1f\">\u201cSo then I turned to Frank Rios\u201d car and talked with \u2014 at that time Jesus Garcia was getting into the car of Frank Rios, Jr., and I said, \u2018Well, look, you take care of my money and see I don\u2019t get burned and I will meet you back at your house.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-22\">\u201cQ. Had you already given some money to Mr. Garcia at this time? A. Yes. Already I had given him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>$75 official government funds in the presence of Ross Ruiz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cJesus Garcia got into the Chevrolet and then Ross Ruiz pulled ahead in the Ford and he stopped and called back and he said, \u2018I am going to be watching and,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you follow me, the deal is off, so don\u2019t follow.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201cI said, T am not going to follow and I will be over at Tito\u2019s house.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cHe said, \u2018Okay. Good.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\u201cSo Ruiz drove off toward the freeway and Frank Rios, Jr., and Jesus Garcia and the child headed in the same direction and followed the Ford and they went off in the direction of the freeway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cQ. What did you do then? A. I then, as per instructions of Ruiz, went over to 406% Bauchet Street, the residence of Garcia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201cQ. Did you later see Mr. Garcia there in the evening? A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201cQ. About how long after this? A. Oh, it was pretty late. It was about 11:30, 11:50, close to midnight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">\u201cQ. Did you have a conversation with the defendant Garcia? A. Yes, I did. Garcia at that time, I was parked in the rear of his house, in the back parking area, and Garcia came up to the car and he handed a rubber contraceptive, a white powder, to my partner, handed it across me to my partner and my partner accepted it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">\u201cHe said, \u2018I am sorry for the delay, but,\u2019 he says, \u2018We had to go all the way out to City Terrace and we had a big hassle and,\u2019 he says, \u2018I tried my best to get back as fast as I could.\u2019 He says, \u2018Were you worried about it ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-13\">\u201cI says \u2018No, I wasn\u2019t worried. After talking to your wife, she told me you had called and everything was all right.\u2019 So I said, \u2018After she told me that, I was no longer worried that anything was wrong, so I just waited here.\u2019 I said, \u2018How did you get back yourself?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-15\">\u201cHe says, \u2018A guy in the Chevrolet, after we picked up, he picked up, we picked up three balloons, three quarter pieces,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Ross got one and Rios got one and I got this one.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-16\">\u201cI said, \u2018How did you get back here?\u2019 I said, \u2018You came up on foot.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-17\">\u201cHe says, \u2018Well, Rios drove me down to a bus station, after we picked up he drove me to the bus line. I wanted him to drop me off here and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take you to where those guys are waiting,\u201d \u2019 so he got on the bus and came back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">Thus, according to the testimony of the agent Gjertsen, appellant Rios knowingly transported Garcia to the place where both Garcia and Rios could buy narcotics. Garcia stated not only that he had gone to get the narcotics with Rios in Rios\u2019 Chevrolet, but that Rios had driven him part of the way back. Garcia returned with the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-20\">Thus there was substantial evidence to support the verdict of the trial court, unless we assume agent Gjertsen testified falsely. We are required to regard the evidence and all\u2019 inferences that may be drawn therefrom most favorably in support of the judgment of the trial court. Sandez v. United States, 9 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 239. We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the trier of facts below where there is a conflict in the evidence. Glasser v. United States, 1941, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-21\">\u201cFacilitate,\u201d as used in this statute (21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174), has been defined as follows: \u201cto make easy or less difficult; to free from difficulty or impediment; as to facilitate the execution of a task.\u201d Cellino v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 941, 943; Bruno v. United States, 9 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 8; Pon Wing Quong v. United States, 9 Cir., 1940, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>F.2d 751. There was here proof appellant facilitated a sale of narcotics within the meaning of that word in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Appellant next charges prejudicial misconduct on the part of government counsel in argument to the jury. Appellant misquotes the evidence, interprets it to suit his purpose, and relies on wild flights of oratorical fancy. Such cannot take the place of hard facts, represented by the language of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">There is no merit in this, or any, aspect of this appeal. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
