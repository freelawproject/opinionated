Relator was represented by assigned counsel in both of his collateral attacks upon his conviction in the state courts. Moreover, although he now alleges that his assigned counsel, in one of the collateral attacks, was \u201cunfaithful\u201d in failing to exhaust state judicial remedies, he has failed to raise this in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">In any event, the relator\u2019s claim that he was illegally arrested by a local police officer raises no federal question. The legality of the arrest is immaterial in view of the subsequent indictment. Even where illegality is conceded, habeas corpus does not lie to release a prisoner who has been convicted, as appellant was, after an indictment by a grand jury has established a sufficient basis for holding him for trial. See Price v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 1944, 144 F.2d 260; cf. Frisbie v. Collins, 1952, 342 U.S. 519, <em>72 </em>S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541. Nor are the relator\u2019s vague references to a confession sufficient to raise any federal question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
