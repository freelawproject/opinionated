Background</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">The gas delivered under the 1935 agreement originally constituted Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>gan Consolidated\u2019s sole supply of natural gas. But Panhandle\u2019s deliveries failed to keep pace with the growth of the Detroit market and by 1945, Michigan Consolidated was forced to turn to other sources. It organized through its parent, American Natural, two interstate pipe lines \u2014 Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company (\u201cMichigan Wisconsin\u201d) and American Louisiana Pipe Line Company (\u201cAmerican Louisiana\u201d) \u2014 to bring gas to the Great Lakes area from Texas and Louisiana. Each of these companies now sells some gas to Michigan Consolidated for resale in the Detroit area; the balance is sold through Michigan Wisconsin to local utility companies, for resale in their respective markets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Panhandle obtains gas from both independent producers and its own large reserves in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. Its pipe line extends from these gas fields to northern termini in Michigan. Panhandle sells its gas in the intervening states to two main classes of customers: &lt;1) independent local utilities (some 60 in number) who resell primarily, but not exclusively, to domestic and commercial space heating consumers; (2) industrial customers who use the gas as industrial fuel. Significantly, the sale of gas to utilities for resale is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission; sales made directly to industrial customers are not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">There are strong indications that one of Panhandle\u2019s primary purposes in seeking abandonment is to shift gas from regulated to unregulated sales. According to the Commission, \u201cat least part of the trouble [between Panhandle and Michigan Consolidated] seems to have arisen from competition [between them] to serve industrial consumers in the Detroit area.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Another factor, which clearly appears from the \u201cchronical of [their] disputes and litigation,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is Panhandle\u2019s failure to enlarge its pipe line capacity to satisfy the great demand for natural gas in its market area. Many of Panhandle\u2019s resale customers are operating under severe shortages which prevent them from serving many would-be consumers. Moreover, the rising demand of their presently attached consumers has forced many of these utilities to manufacture artificial gas at a cost much greater than the price of natural gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Michigan Consolidated charges, and the Commission agrees, that Panhandle\u2019s failure to expand implements its deliberate aim to avoid the Commission\u2019s rate regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Evidence of this policy is said to appear from the following: (1) Panhandle\u2019s large volume of unregulated sales to industrial and Canadian customers; (2) Panhandle\u2019s announced desire to keep its gas reserves in the ground, except insofar as they can be utilized for unregulated sales, until the rate ceilings on presently regulated sales are lifted; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>and (3) Panhandle\u2019s vigorous efforts before the Commission, including the present proceedings, to divert more gas from utility to industrial customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The present proceeding is not Panhandle\u2019s first attempt to abandon service to Michigan Consolidated. In 1951, when their contract expired, Panhandle sought permission to reduce its deliveries. This request was denied on the ground that Michigan Consolidated needed the gas more than Panhandle\u2019s other utility customers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The denial was ultimately sustained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1956.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Its opinion stated, however, that Panhandle would be free to renew its application for abandonment \u201cif and when\u201d Michigan Consolidated obtained gas from American Louisiana \u2014 the second major transportation pipe line built by Michigan Consolidated\u2019s parent, American Natural.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">II. The Instant Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The present abandonment proceedings grow out of American Louisiana\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a thirty-inch pipe line from Louisiana to Detroit. The line\u2019s capacity was to be 300,000 Mcf per day, two thirds of which American Louisiana proposed to sell to Miehi-gan Consolidated and one third to Michigan Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Panhandle intervened in opposition to the project, claiming that, as a supplier for the Detroit market, it would be adversely affected by the proposed sale to Michigan Consolidated. The Commission set the American Louisiana construction application for hearing in proceedings known as \u201cDocket G-2306\u201d and granted a certificate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Upon review in 1955 the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>. At that point there only remained the task of allocating American Louisiana\u2019s gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">Hearings in Docket G-2306 were resumed in December of 1955 for the purpose of allocation. At these proceedings Michigan Wisconsin requested gas to meet the increased demands of the utility customers it was already serving as well as gas to supply a number of previously unserved Wisconsin communities through proposed pipe line extensions. Allocation to Michigan Wisconsin for this latter purpose was complicated, however, by the fact that Midwestern Gas Transmission Company (\u201cMidwestern\u201d) had also filed an application to construct a pipe line to serve a number of the same new Wisconsin markets with Canadian gas. Since the Midwestern and Michigan Wisconsin construction applications were mutually exclusive, a comparative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>hearing was required to determine which proposal would best serve the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Instead of awaiting the outcome of the necessarily lengthy comparative hearing between Michigan Wisconsin and Midwestern, the Commission immediately allocated 240,115 Mcf of American Louisiana\u2019s 300,000 Mcf capacity in order to meet the requirements of Michigan Consolidated and those existing and potential Michigan Wisconsin customers which Midwestern did not propose to serve. The remaining 59,885 Mcf of American Louisiana\u2019s capacity was reserved for possible future allocation to the new Wisconsin markets. This amount, the Commission found, \u201csafely exceeds any reasonable requirements for new markets.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Before permanent allocation of its initial capacity was completed, however, American Louisiana filed an application for a certificate of public convenience to increase its capacity by 57,000 Mcf. In order to have this badly needed gas available for the winter (1956-57), the Commission issued a temporary, emergency certificate authorizing immediate construction and operation. Shortly thereafter, Panhandle intervened in opposition to American Louisiana\u2019s expansion application and simultaneously filed an application to abandon totally its deliveries to Michigan Consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The Commission thus had before it three separate applications concerning the American Natural system: (1) Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s proposal to build a pipe line to serve the new Wisconsin communities with the previously reserved 59,885 Mcf of American Louisiana\u2019s initial capacity, (2) American Louisiana\u2019s application to expand its capacity by 57,-000 Mcf, and (3) Panhandle\u2019s request to abandon service to Michigan Consolidated. The Commission chose to process these three applications in two proceedings. The first was the previously ordered comparative hearing between Michigan Wisconsin and Midwestern. The second was a consolidated hearing on the American Louisiana expansion and the Panhandle abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">After lengthy hearings in the expansion-abandonment case, the Examiner, in June of 1958, issued his decision, granting American Louisiana a permanent certificate for its proposed expansion, and denying Panhandle\u2019s abandonment application. He found that if the Panhandle deliveries to Michigan Consolidated were withdrawn the American Natural system would not have sufficient gas to met its customers\u2019 needs. In October the Commission affirmed the Examiner with respect to the American Louisiana expansion, but reserved decision on the abandonment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">In the meantime, the comparative hearings between Midwestern and Michigan Wisconsin in the so-called \u201cMid-west omnibus\u201d ease were completed. On October 31, 1958, the Commission rejected both proposals on the grounds that they lacked economic or technical feasibility.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Commission found, however, that the central Wisconsin area was still in need of gas and invited the parties to submit revised proposals. But it also noted that its earlier reservation of 59,885 Mcf of American Louisiana gas was not for all times, and did not mean that \u201cshould demands on the part of existing markets become of greater importance in the public interest the new Wisconsin markets * * * must be forever favored * * <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Six weeks later, on December 19, 1958, and without acting upon the proposals invited in the Mid-west omnibus case, the Commission issued its decision in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>abandonment case. It authorized Panhandle to abandon totally its deliveries to Michigan Consolidated; and to replace the abandoned Panhandle service, it allocated to Michigan Consolidated both the 57,000 Mcf of American Louisiana\u2019s expanded capacity and the 59,885 Mcf of its original capacity previously reserved for new markets.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, the Commission\u2019s order rejected Panhandle\u2019s proposed plan of distribution for the 127,000 Mcf of abandonment gas on the ground that it would have made some gas available to Panhandle for direct sales to industrial customers. Panhandle was therefore directed to present a new allocation plan which would \u201cprovide that the gas should be sold for resale primarily to domestic and commercial [space heating] consumers.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Michigan Consolidated, its affiliates in the American Natural system, and some of their customers filed applications for rehearing. Shortly thereafter, Michigan Consolidated also submitted a settlement proposal pursuant to the Commission\u2019s rules of practice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The proposal contemplated that Michigan Consolidated, which has large underground storage facilities in the Great Lakes area, would purchase the same <em>annual </em>volumes from Panhandle as at present but would do so during off-peak periods. This would allow Panhandle to use its maximum daily capacity, including the 127,000 Mcf, to meet the peak-day demands of other customers in its market area for winter space heating.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">On February 13, 1959, the Commission denied all of the applications for rehearing,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and refused to consider Michigan Consolidated\u2019s plan \u201cwhatever its virtues\u201d because it was inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s order and unacceptable to Panhandle and some of its customers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s order also rejected Panhandle\u2019s revised plan for allocating the abandonment gas among its resale customers because (1) it failed to show how much of the abandonment gas would be made available to space heating customers, and (2) it proposed to allocate the abandonment gas to utility customers who were less in need of gas than Michigan Consolidated. The Commission thereupon postponed the effective date of the abondonment order and set a hearing for June 16, 1959, at which \u201cproperly interested parties could present plans and evidence with respect to the disposition of Panhandle\u2019s gas * * But the Commission added that members of the American Natural system and their customers were not \u201csuch parties\u201d and would thus be excluded from the hearing.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">These eleven consolidated petitions for review <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> challenge three related orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of the Commission: (1) the December 19, 1958 order authorizing the abandonment and allocating American Louisiana\u2019s gas to Michigan Consolidated; (2) the February 13, 1959 order denying rehearing, summarily rejecting the proposed settlement, and excluding the American Natural system and its customers from further proceedings involving disposition of the abandonment gas; and (3) an order, issued during the course of the hearings, affirming the Examiner\u2019s exclusion of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">III. The Criteria for Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">1. <em>The statute: </em>Petitioners assert that the Commission rested its action on an erroneous construction of \u00a7 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act. That section provides that \u201cNo natural-gas company shall abandon all or any portion of its facilities [or service] subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission\u201d without Commission approval based on a finding, after due hearing, either (1) that the supply of gas is depleted, or (2) that \u201cthe present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Panhandle sought and the Commission approved total abandonment solely upon a finding in accordance with the second provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The fact that abandonment of public service requires Government approval symbolizes the special legal status and obligations of common carriers and public utilities. This includes an obligation, deeply embedded in the law, to continue service. When Panhandle sought and obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity to serve the Detroit market, it became the exclusive supplier for that market. If it wants to abandon service because it must now share that market, or because it prefers to use that gas for more profitable unregulated sales, or because it wants to be rid of what it considers a vexatious servitude, these are not reasons for granting its request. Abandonment may be allowed only if the \u201cpublic convenience or necessity permit.\u201d And the word \u201cpermit,\u201d instead of \u201crequire,\u201d does not shift the burden to those opposing the application. An applicant for abandonment under \u00a7 7(b) of the Act has the burden of making the factual showing which will assure the Commission, charged with protecting the public interest, that that interest will in no way be disserved; just as the applicant under \u00a7 7 (c) for a certificate to commence service must bear the burden of proving that that public interest will be served.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">2. <em>The Commission\u2019s rationale: </em>Our responsibility for determining whether the Commission properly concluded that the public interest would not be jeopardized by abandonment is hampered at the outset. For the Commission\u2019s opinions in this ease are not models of clarity as to the standards it applied in determining that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity permit such abandonment.\u201d In its original opinion the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">\u201cAn appropriate standard is set forth in our [previous] Opinion * * * denying partial abandonment where we said that Panhandle had \u2018made no showing that the needs of the consuming public served by these other customers for natural gas are <em>greater than, or as great as, </em>the needs of the consuming public in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the areas served by Michigan Consolidated and Michigan Wisconsin in the event of the cutback at Detroit\u2019 or no showing \u2018of benefits to the consuming public along the Panhandle system * * * which would offset the injury and damage to the consuming public * * * \u2019 served by the other systems.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The Commission\u2019s starting point in applying this \u201cappropriate standard\u201d was its finding that \u201cThere is sufficient gas available from the capacity of American Louisiana\u2019s pipeline that has not been permanently allocated * * * to permit abandonment without depriving Michigan Consolidated or the American Natural System of gas allocated to them other than on a temporary basis.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This conclusion was based, in part, on statistics showing that, even without Panhandle, the American Natural system had enough (but barely enough) gas on an annual basis to meet the past demands of its presently attached loads.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Commission nonetheless recognized that \u201cthe record contains extensive testimony on the needs of both the American Natural * * * [and] Panhandle [systems] for additional supplies of gas. An objective way to approach this problem,\u201d said the Commission, \u201cis to compare the heating saturation of * * * Michigan Consolidated * * * with the heating saturations of other customers of Panhandle * * <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Finding that fewer Panhandle customers heated with gas, it ordered the abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">On rehearing the Commission appears to have shifted its ground. It declared that under the statute, \u201cabandonment will be permitted unless <em>inconsistent </em>with the public convenience and necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, said the Commission, \u201cthe standards mentioned here and in our previous order were but partial criteria used in reaching a result within the language of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Utilizing this broadened test, the Commission recognized the relevance of at least two factors militating against abandonment \u2014 the added costs to Michigan Consolidated and the unconsidered needs of Michigan Wisconsin customers. But it concluded that \u201cwhatever detriments there may [be] to Michigan Consolidated * * * and Michigan Wisconsin * * * consumers,\u201d they were outweighed by the \u201cgreat demands for service on Panhandle\u2019s system.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Panhandle\u2019s greater need was further demonstrated by a comparison of each system\u2019s ability to supply its customers on days of maximum demand. Finally the Commission averted to the advantages of separating the two systems as another factor supporting abandonment.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Although the Commission\u2019s rationale is not altogether clear to us, we are able to glean from its opinions three ultimate determinations upon which it rested the abandonment and allocation orders: (1) that the gas supply in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tion could be used \u201cto greater advantage\u201d by Panhandle\u2019s customers than by the customers of American Natural; <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> (2) \u201cthat each system will more efficiently procure gas supplies and serve its own customers if separated from the other one;\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and (3) that there was sufficient unallocated gas on the American Natural system to replace the supply which Michigan Consolidated would lose by the abandonment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">If valid, these determinations are sufficient to establish that \u201cthe present or future convenience and necessity permits * * * abandonment.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Petitioners contend, however, that these determinations are fatally defective. We shall discuss their objections to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">IV. The Finding of \u201cGreater Need\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Recognizing that the demand for gas in both the American Natural and Panhandle market areas far exceeded the available supplies, the Commission made three comparisons in order to determine which system could utilize the gas to better advantage. We shall refer to them as the \u201cheating saturation\u201d test, the \u201ccapacity-demand ratio,\u201d and \u201cthe considerations of economic burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">1. <em>Comparative space heating </em>saturat-<em>tions: </em>This test, upon which the Commission relied most heavily, purported to assess relative need by determining the percentage of existing residential and commercial consumers on each system who use gas for space heating purposes. This percentage is called the \u201cspace heating saturation.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Applying its formula to the facts in the record, the Commission found that, in 1958, 54.67 percent of Michigan Consolidated\u2019s residential and commercial consumers utilized natural gas for space heating, while only 50.4 percent of comparable Panhandle consumers bought gas for that purpose. (The remaining customers presumably utilized gas only for cooking, hot water and similar purposes). The Commission concluded from this disparity that Panhandle had the greater need.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Petitioners\u2019 first objection to the heating saturation test is that the Commission adopted an erroneous basis of comparison. They contend that in computing Panhandle\u2019s average saturation, the Commission should not have included the very low saturation (16 percent) of one customer that is primarily interested in reselling to industrial, as distinguished from space heating, consumers, and that the Commission should not have excluded from the computation the high saturations of two other Panhandle customers on the ground that they had another source of supply. Since the purpose of the comparison was to determine relative needs among those who might obtain the gas, and since the Commission stated that it would not allocate any of the abandonment gas to the two customers with high saturations and an alternate supply, we think their saturations were properly eliminated. Conversely, the saturation of the customer with only a 16 percent saturation was properly included since it might have been allocated gas on the condition that it be resold to non-industrial users.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 second allegation of erroneous comparison, however, is well taken. As they point out, the Commission originally announced that \u201cappropriate standard\u201d for determining whether the public interest permitted abandonment required a comparison of the needs of \u201cthe consuming public along the Panhandle system\u201d with \u201cthe needs of the consuming public in the areas served by Michigan Consolidated <em>and Michigan </em>Wisconsin.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In implementing this standard, however, the Commission actually compared the Panhandle saturation with that of Michigan Consolidated alone. When this inconsistency was called to its attention, the Commission, in its opinion denying rehearing, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">\u201cAlso relevant, but not controlling, is the need for additional gas on the systems of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s distributors, some of whom have comparatively low space heating saturations. While we have carefully considered the problems of these companies, the space heating saturation of Michigan Consolidated, which is being directly deprived of the Panhandle gas and the advantages of separating the two systems have greater weight.\u201d [21 P.P.C. 218, 221.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"> We think that the Commission erred in excluding the Michigan Wisconsin distributors from the space heating saturation test. It is clear that \u201cIf the requirements of the public interest are to be satisfied, the Commission must consider not only the public benefit * * but also any public loss * * Democrat Printing Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 1952, 91 U.S. App.D.C. 72, 75, 202 F.2d 298, 301. As the Commission itself recognized in the first abandonment case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201cPanhandle says that it has no obligation to the public served by distributors supplied by the Michigan-Wisconsin pipeline other than Michigan Consolidated. But the considerations of the public convenience and necessity in testing the abandonment are not restricted to that portion of the public living in Detroit, and include, certainly, the impact on other areas as well.\u201d [Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 11 F.P.C. 167, 169 (1952)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Viewed realistically, abandonment has a substantial \u201cimpact\u201d upon consumers in the areas served by Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s utility customers. It is these distributors who are actually being deprived of gas as a result of abandonment, for under the Commission\u2019s orders Michigan Consolidated is a conduit through which the unallocated gas on the American Natural system flows to Panhandle\u2019s customers. This is so because Michigan Consolidated is ultimately not deprived of any gas. Its entire loss is to be replaced with the American Louisiana unallocated capacity. True, Michigan Consolidated might well have obtained some of the replacement gas, even if abandonment had been denied, but it is equally clear that significant quantities would still have been left for use by Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s existing, if not potential, customers. The interest of these customers in attaching new loads and meeting other future demands while \u201cnot controlling\u201d should have been fairly reflected in the space heating saturation figures by which the Commission measured the impact of abandonment on the American Natural system. This is required for at least two reasons: (1) by using the unallocated gas to replace Michigan Consolidated\u2019s lost supply, the Commission has made Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s and Panhandle\u2019s use of this gas, as a matter of economic fact, mutually exclusive, Delta Airlines, Inc. v. C. A. B., 1955, 97 U.S. App.D.C. 46, 51, 228 F.2d 17, 22; and (2) if the unallocated American Natural gas is used to replace Michigan Consolidated\u2019s loss, the future needs of the Michigan Wisconsin consumers must be met by expensive expansion on the American Natural system. City of Pittsburgh v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Federal Power Comm., 1957, 99 U.S.App. D.C. 113, 237 F.2d 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Although the Commission concedes that the gas needs of these Michigan Wisconsin customers are \u201crelevant,\u201d it failed to say <em>how much </em>an appropriate weighing of these Michigan Wisconsin saturations would reduce the Michigan Consolidated saturation of 54.67 percent. The record shows that the space heating saturations of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s existing customers in Wisconsin ranged from a low of 27 percent to a high of 44 percent. The average was 35 percent. Thus, a sizeable market for attaching new loads existed. Since Panhandle\u2019s saturation of 50.4 percent is only 4.27 percent less than Michigan Consolidated\u2019s, even some weight to the Michigan Wisconsin figures might well have indicated a contrary result.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We are not unmindful that one of the two reasons the Commission gave for excluding Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s satura-tions from its comparison formula is that Michigan Consolidated was being \u201cdirectly deprived of the gas.\u201d But in the circumstances of this case we think that a distinction between \u201cdirect\u201d and indirect\u201d deprivation is without a difference. Such a distinction might have been relevant if Michigan Consolidated\u2019s loss to Panhandle were not replaced and the effect of abandonment were to reduce the level of service to Michigan Consolidated\u2019s presently attached customers. Although abandonment without replacement would have deteriorated Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s competitive claim for new gas on the American Natural system to the extent that it aggravated Michigan Consolidated\u2019s need for new gas, no existing Michigan Wisconsin consumers-would have been cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">But instead of considering the' abandonment separately from the allocation of the free American Natural gas,, the Commission chose to treat them together, and clearly indicated that it predicated the abandonment upon the availability of replacement gas. In this situation neither Michigan Consolidated nor Michigan Wisconsin were required to detach existing loads. . Since each of them will feel the effect of the Commission\u2019s-action only with respect to future demands for new service, Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s interest has not been shown to-be less \u201cdirect\u201d than Michigan Consolidated\u2019s (or the Panhandle resale customers\u2019) . It follows that Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s interest in attaching new loads to meet the demands of prospective customers was entitled to some demonstrable weight.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 final objection with respect to the saturation test is this: even if the comparison were otherwise valid, a comparison of \u201cunsifted averages\u201d did not and could not show <em>how much </em>abandonment was necessary to equalize distribution. Consequently they contend that the Commission erred in ordering <em>total </em>abandonment based upon a system-wide comparison of average heating sat-urations rather than first determining which of Panhandle\u2019s customers would receive the abandonment gas and in what amounts. They point out that some of Panhandle\u2019s other customers have far higher saturations than Michigan Consolidated, and some lower, and that, under the Commission\u2019s stated objective of fairly distributing natural gas, the abandonment gas will presumably be allocated only to Panhandle customers having lower saturations than Michigan Consolidated. Petitioners urge that the volume of gas necessary for such allocations may require only partial rather than total abandonment, and therefore the Commission cannot validly order total abandonment until these allocations are actually made. They also contend the Commission compounded its error by excluding them from the proceedings which it ordered to determine a suitable plan for allocating the abandonment gas among Panhandle\u2019s other customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">We do not say that the Commission may never rest total abandonment on a comparison of needs based on system-wide averages rather than individual communities. But we do think that it cannot do so without a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances which were thought to require or justify it. The need for such an explanation is particularly pressing where, as here, a gas supply which would ordinarily have been available to certain communities is allocated to other communities in order to facilitate an abandonment and these deprived communities are not afforded an opportunity to show that such allocation does not constitute fair distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">2. <em>The capacity-demand ratios: </em>The Commission\u2019s second test of relative needs measured the ability of each system to meet the peak-day demands of its customers. The Commission found that American Natural was able to supply 96 percent of the gas consumed on its system on a peak day; Panhandle only 83.5 percent.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Petitioners contend that this comparison rests on two errors: (1) the capacity of Panhandle was derived from evidence in another proceeding to which Michigan Consolidated was not a party;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and (2) the demands of some of Panhandle\u2019s customers were based on evidence in the current proceeding not subjected to cross-examination since it was introduced by Panhandle for \u201cinformation only,\u201d with an express disclaimer of reliance upon it \u201cfor any purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> They therefore claim they were denied due process in that they had no opportunity to contradict the evidence upon which the comparison was based. Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., 1937, 301 U.S. 292, 300-301, 57 S.Ct. 724, 81 L.Ed. 1093. They also point out that the Commission invoked this comparison for the first time in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>opinion denying rehearing, thereby depriving them of a constitutional right to present their objections. Morgan v. United States, 1938, 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 999, 82 L.Ed. 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Because the capacity-demand test was advanced after the Commission\u2019s original decision, it would appear that the Commission did not view it as a ground which would alone support the finding of greater need. Hence, even if this comparison were unassailable, a remand is required by our holding that the space heating comparison is fatally defective. In the proceedings on remand, the Commission will necessarily have an opportunity to consider petitioners\u2019 objections to the capacity-demand comparison. We therefore refrain from passing on petitioners\u2019 objections to allow initial consideration by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">3. <em>Considerations of economic </em>burden: Some of the petitioners raise another objection to the Commission\u2019s finding that the public served by Panhandle can make more effective use of the gas than Michigan Consolidated. They point out that, due to Panhandle\u2019s depreciated rate base, its gas is cheaper, and that the American Natural replacement gas will cost consumers in the Detroit area over four million dollars more per year. But in its opinions, the Commission considered this increased cost to Detroit consumers against the even greater cost which Panhandle customers would incur by the use of expensive manufactured gas to meet their shortages. We cannot say its consideration was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Y. The Availability of Replacement Gas</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The second ultimate determination upon which the Commission based its order is that there is sufficient unallocated gas on the American Natural system to replace the 127,000 Mcf of abandonment gas. This volume was to come from three sources: \u201cexpansion\u201d gas, \u201cover-pumpage\u201d gas, and \u201creserve\u201d gas. Petitioners vigorously assert that none of this gas can be used as replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">1. <em>The expansion gas: </em>This refers to the 57,000 Mcf resulting from the first-step expansion of American Louisiana\u2019s pipe line. Petitioners claim that the issuance of emergency, and later the permanent, certificates of public convenience authorizing expansion were predicated, at least in part, upon Commission determinations that Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s existing utility customers urgently needed this expansion gas.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> From this they conclude that it cannot all be allocated to Michigan Consolidated. We agree that there is an inconsistency between certificating an expansion on the ground that it is needed by one market, and then permanently allocating the fruits of that expansion to another market. But we do not think this was beyond the authority of the Commission providing that it found, upon a valid comparison, that other markets were in <em>greater </em>need of the gas. The difficulty is, as we found earlier, that the Commission\u2019s comparison was not valid since it failed to accord proper consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to the needs of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s customers. Hence the determination of where this gas is needed most must await a proper comparison in further proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">2. <em>The overpumpage gas:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">This refers to gas which the Commission suggested would be available on the American Natural system if American Louisiana operated its \u201cspare\u201d compressors full time and continually obtained gas from the fields at maximum contract demands. There is some conflict in the testimony as to the prudence of this procedure in terms of safety and the adequacy of gas reserves. And it is not altogether clear that American Louisiana\u2019s contracts with its suppliers allow it to take its maximum volumes on a permanent basis. But we cannot say upon the record before us that the Commission\u2019s action was arbitrary or unsupported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">3. <em>The reserve gas: </em>This refers to the 59,885 Mcf of American Louisiana\u2019s initial capacity, originally reserved in Docket G-2306 for distribution to new Wisconsin markets in the event that Michigan Wisconsin prevailed in the Mid-west omnibus case. The expansion-abandonment hearings proceeded on the assumption that the reserve gas was available for allocation only in Docket G-2306.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> By the time the Commission rejected Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s proposal to serve the new communities, the expansion-abandonment hearings had terminated and the Examiner had rendered his report denying abandonment. Thereafter, the Commission took the gas reserved in Docket G-2306, and allocated it in these expansion-abandonment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Petitioners urge that this violates the Ashbacker rule<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and elemental principles of procedural due process in two respects: (1) Those petitioners who</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">were seeking gas for new markets and intervened only in Docket G-2306 suddenly found that the gas which had been reserved for disposition in those proceedings had been allocated in the abandonment case without notice to them or opportunity to be heard. (2) Other peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tioners who had intervened only in these expansion - abandonment proceedings (mostly Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s existing customers seeking the expansion gas for their markets in Michigan and Wisconsin) were effectively precluded from asserting any claim to the reserve gas in any forum because they did not, and could not reasonably, anticipate that gas reserved for disposition in another proceeding would be allocated in this one <em>after </em>the hearing in this proceeding had terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Although these contentions raise serious questions,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> we need not decide them since the alleged lack of notice and hearing will perforce be remedied by the comparisons already required by this opinion on remand to the Commission.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In such proceedings, the Commission will, of course, be free to consider the extent to which needs of any of the communities requesting gas service from Michigan Wisconsin have been met or are likely to be met by other natural gas pipe lines.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">YI. The Advantages of Total Separation</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">We come now to the last of the three basic determinations upon which the Commission predicated its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The Commission\u2019s opinions make it abundantly clear that it considered total separation of these warring giants a major benefit<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and relied upon it as an element of the public interest supporting abandonment.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>It is not clear, however, what the Commission thought these benefits were. The Commission said several times in its opinions that total separation would make each system more \u201cefficient\u201d and \u201cstronger.\u201d But it failed to make clear whether this efficiency and strength would be achieved by the termination of controversy or from some other consequence of total abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Petitioners argue that it was the termination of controversy upon which the Commission relied. They contend that this was improper because the Commission affirmed the Examiner\u2019s exclusion of evidence relating to the origins of and reasons for the controversy, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201c* * * we are fully aware of the fact that there is a long history of controversy between the parties, but <em>we find nothing in the Act setting forth the existence of controversy as a basis for permitting natural gas service to be abandoned. </em>If such a basis could be found in the law, the issue herein would have long since been resolved.\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Assuming, as petitioners argue, that the Commission relied upon the termination of controversy as a ground for ordering total abandonment, we cannot agree that the exclusion of this evidence necessarily precluded the Commission from such reliance. The Commission could nonetheless find a proper basis for its action in its great knowledge of the controversies, derived from the mountains of records amassed by these antagonists over many years in previous cases before it. Based upon this experience, it might know, for example, whether the expenses and delays of litigation and the other social costs of the controversy have adversely affected quality and cost of service to the ultimate consumer. Such information is, of course, relevant to the question of whether the public convenience permits abandonment. Similarly, it may have an expert\u2019s knowledge that does not require evidence in the record that each system will be more efficient and stronger after abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">But we think that, in these circumstances, the Commission cannot invoke particular knowledge, sight unseen, under the cloak of past experience. Instead it must reveal what this knowledge is and how it supports the conclusion for which it is invoked. Since it is by no means clear from this record that (1) abandonment will terminate the series of controversies between the parties<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>or (2) that \u201ceach system would more efficiently procure gas supplies and serve its own customers if separated from the other one,\u201d the Commission\u2019s action cannot be sustained on this ground. Federal Communications Comm. v. RCA Communications, 1953, 346 U.S. 86, 96-97, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">VII. Settlement Proposal</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We think the Commission also erred in its treatment of the settlement proposal filed by Michigan Consolidated and that the Commission must reconsider the matter upon the remand of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This proposal was filed after the original abandonment order was issued, but before the petitions for rehearing were denied. Under this proposal the full 127,000 Mcf of abandonment gas would be available to Panhandle during the winter months to satisfy space heating needs of its domestic and commercial customers. In summer months, however, Panhandle would be required to continue its sales to Michigan Consolidated, and, indeed, to step up its rate of delivery so that the same annual volume would be supplied. Michigan Consolidated offered to store this summer gas in its large underground fields in order to have it available to meet the winter space heating needs of <em>its </em>domestic and commercial customers. Michigan Consolidated further charges that neither Panhandle nor its utility customers are presently capable of storing this volume of off-peak gas, so that it will either be sold directly to industrial customers (which Panhandle favors) or will remain in the field (which would mean that Panhandle\u2019s pipe line was not being used to capacity all year round). The Commission did not pass upon these charges, however, for it refused to consider the settlement proposal \u201cwhatever its merits,\u201d and excluded American Natural and its customers from the post-abandonment allocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Even assuming that under the Commission\u2019s rules Panhandle\u2019s rejection of the settlement rendered the proposal ineffective <em>as a settlement, </em>it could not, and we believe should not, have precluded the Commission from considering the proposal <em>on its merits. </em>Indeed, the proposal appears prima facie to have merit enough to have required the Commission at some stage of the proceeding to consider it on its own initiative as an alternative to total abandonment.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The consuming public with which the Commission is concerned \u2014 residential and commercial space heating users \u2014 require large uninterruptible supplies during the winter months, but little or no gas during the other months. The settlement proposal promises to fulfill the Commission\u2019s announced objectives of distributing gas to this consuming public on the basis of need, even more fully than total abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Of course, there may be valid objections to the settlement proposal which the Commission has not explained, or which a hearing upon the proposal would reveal. Such considerations may merit modification or total rejection of the proposal. But we think that, since the Commission is charged with the duty of protecting the ultimate consumer from \u201cexploitation at the hands of natural gas companies,\u201d Federal Power Comm. v. Hope Natural Gas, 1944, 320 U.S. 591, 610, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333, it cannot refuse <em>to consider </em>a proposal which appears, on its face at least, consistent with that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The Commission\u2019s orders will be set aside and the ease remanded for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">On Petition of Federal Power Commission for Modification of Opinion and Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> In its petition for rehearing in bane, which has been denied today by the court in banc, Panhandle argues that the Commission\u2019s action in rejecting Michigan Consolidated\u2019s settlement proposal was beyond this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review because the proposal was not included in a timely application for rehearing. The division of this court which heard this case deems it appropriate to comment upon this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Panhandle\u2019s argument rests upon \u00a7 19 of the Natural Gas Act. Subsection (a) provides that \u201cany person * * * aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission * * * may apply for a rehearing within thirty days after the issuance of such order.\u201d And subsection (b) provides that \u201cNo objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court [of appeals] unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.\u201d 52 Stat. 831 (1938), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r. See Federal Power Commission v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 1958, 348 U.S. 492, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On December 18, 1958, the Commission overruled the trial examiner\u2019s decision denying Panhandle\u2019s application and ordered total abandonment. Michigan Consolidated filed its settlement proposal on January 23, 1959 \u2014 five days beyond the thirty-day period prescribed by \u00a7 19(a). We point out, however, that under the Commission\u2019s own regulations \u201cany party [may submit] at any time offers of settlement or proposals of adjustment to all parties and to the Commission * * * \u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.18 (1949). We think this may be construed to authorize the Commission to consider such filings <em>at any time </em>while the case is in its bosom. Quite evidently the Commission did so construe it, for the Commission did not reject the filing of Michigan Consolidated\u2019s offer on the ground that the proposal was not included in a timely petition for rehearing. Instead, rejection was based on the ground that the offer was inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s order and unacceptable to Panhandle and some of its customers. This refusal was included in the Commission\u2019s opinion of February 23, 1959, denying rehearing.

We still think that in the special circumstances of this case, the Commission erred in brushing aside the settlement proposal on the grounds that it was unacceptable to Panhandle and inconsistent with the abandonment order. The proposal contained no surprises. The Commission knew, or should have known, from its files and records that Panhandle\u2019s resale customers could not use all of the abandonment gas during the summer months, and that Michigan Consolidated had fields in which it could store summer deliveries. These matters, on their face, reflected the basis for an alternative to total abandonment, so apparently in the public interest, that their consideration at some point in the proceedings was indispensable to the validity of any public interest determination in support of total abandonment. In viewing the public interest, the Commission\u2019s vision is not to be limited to the horizons of the private parties to the proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Where, as here, a regulatory agency has ignored factors which are relevant to the public interest, the scope of judicial review is sufficiently broad to order their consideration.

In its parting shot, the Commission summed up thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">\u201cIn applying the standard of the Act all of the considerations referred to in this order and in our prior order were weighed. Certainly the needs of Panhandle\u2019s customers for the gas coupled with the general considerations expressed in our previous order and again referred to below with respect to the relations between the two systems and their place in the natural gas industry show that the public convenience and necessity \u2018permit\u2019 such abandonment.\u201d [21 P.P.C. at 222]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">. Despite some language to the contrary, we find that the Commission actually relied upon its finding that the gas could be used to <em>greater </em>advantage on the Panhandle system. Hence it is unnecessary for us to consider petitioners\u2019 argument that the Commission misconstrued the statute by suggesting that the public interest would \u201cpermit\u201d abandonment if the needs of Panhandle\u2019s consumers were only <em>as great as </em>the needs of Michigan Consolidated\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">. 21 F.P.C. at 227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b284-13\">.

The Commission argues in its brief that, with the denial of American Louisiana\u2019s application in the Midwest omnibus case to serve the new Wisconsin communities, Michigan Wisconsin lost its claim to any of the 59,885 Mcf of gas originally earmarked for its market. Furthermore only 55 percent of the 57,000 Mcf of \u201cexpansion gas\u201d (or roughly 29,000 Mcf) had been temporarily allocated to Michigan Wisconsin, with the possibility that an even smaller amount might be permanently certificated. From this, the brief concludes that this 29,000 Mcf, which equals only 22 percent of the 127,000 Mcf which Panhandle attempted to abandon, would \u201cplainly not warrant the use of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s saturation for comparison <em>at anything U7ce equal weight </em>of that of Michigan Consolidated * * (Brief for Respondent at 32.) Even assuming the premises of this argument to be correct, the short answer is that the Commission gave these Michigan Wis-cousin saturations <em>no </em>weight, or at least failed to tell how an appropriate weighing would affect Michigan Consolidated' saturation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\">.

Panhandle has argued that any injury which the petitioners representing new markets may have sustained, as a result of the Commission\u2019s decision to allocate the reserve gas in the abandonment case, is now moot, for these same communities will shortly obtain Canadian gas from another supplier. After argument we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs on this issue. It appears that on October 31, 1959 the Commission approved a combined Midwestern-Michigan Wisconsin application to serve the same Wisconsin communities as Michigan Wisconsin originally proposed to serve with the reserve gas. But petitioners contend that, despite Commission approval, the project may not reach completion as it requires the approval of Canadian authorities to export the gas, and financing at favorable rates. Conversely, petitioners urge us to notice that Panhandle has filed an application for a rate increase which, if approved, will provide it with the incentive to expand enormously its present capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"Aym\">We express no opinion on the relevance of either of these proposals.

The Commission mentioned these benefits in the concluding passages of both its original and rehearing opinions: \u201cMoreover, with the separation for which we are providing both Panhandle and Michigan Consolidated should be in a stronger and in an independent position.\u201d 20 F.P.C. at 858. \u201c[I]t is our opinion that each system will more efficiently procure gas supplies and serve its own customers if separated from the other one.\u201d 21 F.P.C. at 227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b290-16\">. At the point in its rehearing opinion where it disclaimed reliance upon a single standard, the commission said:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">\u201cIn applying the standard of the Act all of the considerations referred to in this order and in our prior order were weighed. Certainly the needs of Panhandle\u2019s customers for the gas coupled with the general considerations expressed in our previous order and again referred to below <em>with respect to the relations between the two systems and their place in the natural gas industry </em>show that the public convenience and necessity \u2018permit\u2019 such abandonment.\u201d [21 F.P.C. at 222 (emphasis supplied) ]</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">In discussing the proper weight to give the space Cheating saturations of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s customers, it stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">\u201cWhile we have carefully considered the problems of these companies, the space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>heating saturation of Michigan Consolidated, which is being directly deprived of the Panhandle gas <em>and the advantages of separating the two systems </em>have greater weight.\u201d [21 F.P.C. at 221 (emphasis supplied) ]</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Finally, in the section of its rehearing opinion, entitled \u201cConclusions on Rehearing,\u201d the Commission said:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\u201cIt may be true, as contended, that we have never before permitted an abandonment of service over the protests of the buyer, but here we have a peculiar situation where one of two great rival natural gas systems is required to serve the other. This situation has been subject to our regulatory authority for some time as indicated in our prior order. Up to the present time because of shortage of gas supplies we have been unwilling to permit the .abandonment. Now because of American Louisiana\u2019s increased capacity and the availability of the gas reserved in Docket No. G-2306, et al. abandonment has become feasible * * *. [21 F.P.C. at 226-27]</p>\n<p id=\"AWUa\">Commissioner Kline also understands the Commission to rely heavily upon the advantages of separating the American Natural and Panhandle systems. In his concurring opinion on rehearing, where he explains why he favors only partial abandonment, he says: \u201cThe majority are of the view that the benefits which will accrue to the public by reason of the complete severance of relations between the two systems outweigh other aspects of the public interest.\u201d 21 F.P.C. at 228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b291-13\">.

As petitioners point out, there is much evidence which suggests that separation will not terminate the controversies. The Commissioner tells us that: \u201cAt least part of the trouble seems to have arisen from competition to serve industrial consumers in the Detroit area.\u201d Yet Panhandle\u2019s application to abandon service candidly states that it intends to continue its efforts to capture industrial customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>in the Detroit area.

The letter stated that the petition was rejected because the Commission\u2019s order of February 13, 1959, had \u201cdiscussed the proposal of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company without reaching any determination. Hence [the] application is not addressed to any affirmative action on the part of the Commission * * While it is true that the Commission entered no formal findings or orders concerning the proposal, it clearly rejected it.
