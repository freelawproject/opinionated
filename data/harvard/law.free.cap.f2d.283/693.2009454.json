Plaintiff-inventor chose neither to file an earlier application for a patent, nor to <em>himself </em>restrict or limit the use of the valves by others. By his own actions he has prevented the protection ordinarily granted by a patent to apply to him, under the unusual circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-23\">It was agreed by opposing counsel at oral argument that paragraph II of the opinion rendered below, incorporated by reference in the Findings, should be modified to correct an error appearing therein. The <em>second, </em>reference to the March 29th date should read \u201c1953,\u201d rather than \u201c1954,\u201d in order to be in accord with Conclusion of Law 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">As thus modified, the opinion of the able trial judge below is adopted by us, in all particulars, as our opinion herein. Cf. D.C.S.D.Cal.1959, 176 F.Supp. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-25\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
