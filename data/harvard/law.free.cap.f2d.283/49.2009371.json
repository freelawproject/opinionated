His sole contention is that the evidence at trial did not show that the crime was perpetrated in that portion of the burglarized building dedicated to the functions of a federal post office. Relief was denied by trial court in the form sought and also as considered under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-24\">The judgment is affirmed. Coram no-bis is neither a substitute for direct appeal nor for proper relief under \u00a7 2255. Adam v. United States, 10 Cir., 274 F.2d 880. Appellant\u2019s conviction was considered and affirmed on direct appeal, Cito v. United States, 10 Cir., 238 F.2d 766, and the collateral issues determined in a companion case, Skoog v. United States, 10 Cir., 268 F.2d 218.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
