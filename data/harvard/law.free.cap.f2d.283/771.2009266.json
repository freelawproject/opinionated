We have no hesitation in saying that the information received by the officers as to the identity of the automobile and the strong suspicion that it contained bootleg liquor communicated to them by others who had seen and appraised the evidence was sufficient to warrant the arrest and search of appellant\u2019s car. Here there is no doubt that the facts that had come to the attention of the officers were \u201csufficient, in the circumstances, to lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that liquor [was] illegally possessed in the automobile to be searched.\u201d Husty v. United States, 282 U.S. 694, 51 S.Ct. 240, 242, 75 L.Ed. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
