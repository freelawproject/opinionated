Odien, Incorporated, which had a contract with the Board of Education for the construction of a storm and sanitary sewer system in the Kearsley Street area of the Flint College and Cultural Development.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-22\">It was not disputed that the injuries sustained by decedent, which resulted in his death, were accidental in nature and were sustained in the regular course of his employment. Both decedent and his employer were subject to the provisions of the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act at the time. (Act 10, Public Acts of Michigan 1912, as amended; Compiled Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 411.1 to 417.14a, M.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 17.141 to 17.230).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-23\">The administrator, with the approval of the Probate Court, received and accepted an award of compensation under the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which was paid by the contractor\u2019s insurance carrier and was for the benefit of the dependents of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-24\">Appellant claims that notwithstanding his acceptance of benefits under the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, he has an additional remedy against the employer of decedent for damages under the Michigan Wrongful Death Act (M.S. A. \u00a7 27.711), Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 691.-581, which was in force prior to the passage of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and asserts it has never been repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>The title to the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides among other things \u201cand restricting the right to compensation or damages in such cases as are provided by this act.\u201d It is further provided in the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-3\">\u201cWhere the conditions of liability under this act exist, the right to the recovery of compensation benefits, as herein provided, shall be exclusive remedy against the employer.\u201d Part I, Sec. 4, M.S.A. \u00a7 17.144, Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 411.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">In the face of the plain language of the Act, we would not be justified in allowing the administrator to recover twice for the death of the decedent. No Michigan cases have been cited to us upholding appellant\u2019s contention and in the absence of such authority, we will follow the clear language of the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The general rule is that Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts provide the exclusive remedy against an employer. 58 Am.Jur. p. 588 Sec. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The District Judge dismissed the complaint against the Board of Education on the ground that it was an agency of the State of Michigan and in contracting for the construction of storm and sanitary sewers it was engaged in the performance of a governmental function for which the Board could not be held liable in damages. Cf. Daniels v. Board of Education of City of Grand Rapids, 1916, 191 Mich. 339, 158 N.W. 23, L.R.A.1916F, 468; Daszkiewicz v. Detroit Board of Education, 1942, 301 Mich. 212, 3 N.W.2d 71; Richards v. Birmingham School District, 1957, 348 Mich. 490, 83 N.W.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim is that the contractor violated the specifications in the contract by improper shoring and bracing of the ditch; that the Board of Education was under a continuing duty to daily inspect the work; that the Board acquiesced in the contractor\u2019s violation of the specifications and, therefore, was legally liable for the wrongful death of the decedent occasioned as a result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Assuming that the Board violated a legal duty, this would not convert a governmental function into a proprietary one. We have some difficulty in following appellant\u2019s contentions that the Board was under a duty to inspect the work daily or that it acquiesced in the contractor\u2019s violation because it failed to do so. Ordinarily inspections are made of the work of a contractor performing public work in order to protect the public. We know of no duty on the part of a governmental agency owing to the employees-of an independent contractor to make such inspections or liability imposed on the agency for failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">We find no error in the judgment of the District Court and it is, therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Extraordinary Motion for a Rehearing on the Merits, En Banc, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">The word \u201caccidental\u201d as used in the opinion connoted an unforeseen or unexpected happening. It would not exclude a claim of negligence. Before recovery may be had under the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the injuries must have been accidental in nature. The title to the Act expressly provides for \u201ccompensation for * * * accidental injury to or death of employees * * M.S.A. \u00a7 17.141, Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 411.1; Twork v. Munising Paper Co., 275 Mich. 174, 266 N.W. 311; Scott v. Alsar Co., 336 Mich. 532, 58 N.W.2d 910; Adkins v. Rives Plating Co., 338 Mich. 265, 61 N.W.2d 117. Having accepted the benefits under the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, appellant is in no position to claim that the Act did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Where the injury is covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the provisions of the Act constitute the exclusive remedy against the employer. The employee no longer has an action against his employer at common law or under the wrongful death statute. M.S.A. \u00a7 17.144, Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 411.4; Dershowitz v. Ford Motor Co., 327 Mich. 386, 41 N.W. 2d 900; Totten v. Detroit Aluminum &amp; Brass Corp., 344 Mich. 414, 73 N.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>882; Remington v. General Motors, D.C., 127 F.Supp. 672 (Action under Michigan Death Act.); Douglas v. Detroit Edison Co., D.C., 145 F.Supp. 1; King v. Chrysler Corp., D.C., 150 F.Supp. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The case of Rookledge v. Garwood, 340 Mich. 444, 65 N.W.2d 785 involved a claim against a third party tortfeasor and is not in point. Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing contains a rehash of many \u25a0of the arguments made in his brief on the merits and with the citation of substantially the same authorities. In our .judgment, appellant\u2019s case is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The Extraordinary Motion for a Rehearing on the Merits, En Banc, etc. is denied. National Labor Relations Board v. Cambria Clay Products Co., 6 Cir., 229 F.2d 433 and Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Glenn L. Martin Co., 6 Cir., 229 F.2d 434, 50 A.L.R.2d 882.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
