As set out in the findings of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-26\">\u201c1. In 1953 the plaintiff, Anthony Santilli, communicated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the defendant, Philip Morris &amp; Co., Ltd., Ine., for the purpose of suggesting an idea for a packaging improvement to be used in the manufacture of cigarettes. The plaintiff received a reply stating that it was the policy of the defendant not to consider unsolicited suggestions unless their submission was \u2018as part of the attached form letter.\u2019 On July 29, 1953 the plaintiff, on the supplied submission form, disclosed his packaging idea to defendant. The signed form letter, with the inclusion of the idea, read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201c \u2018It is represented that the undersigned has the exclusive right to offer the following suggestion or idea for the purpose hereof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\u201c \u2018The idea is to get the cigarette out of package of cig. easly (sic) to have 1 or more cigarettes with the top of the cig. paper lap over about *4 to % of one inch or have a piece of cellophane about % inch wide put under the cig. to pull out same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201c \u2018This idea or suggestion is offered without solicitation on your part, and you may examine the same and make disclosure thereof. It is understood that the use to be made of it and the compensation, if any, to be paid therefor are matters resting solely in your discretion.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">\u201c2. On August 3, 1953, the defendant replied to the plaintiff that \u2018Our Advertising Counsel and Planning Committees have given your thought consideration. * * * We must formulate and schedule our advertising plans far in advance. * * Unfortunately your suggestion does not fit into our present plans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The plaintiff alleged that several years later Philip Morris constructed a package on a machine built by a foreign manufacturer that embodies the \u201cidea\u201d submitted by Santilli.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The court found that at the time of Santilli\u2019s submission the idea was not new, but had been used by this defendant in 1935 and the basic idea had been known to the cigarette industry long before 1953. The court found also that the manufacturer of the machine used to embody the \u201cself-starter\u201d idea in question, developed it without \u201csuggestion, assistance or request from defendant or any of its employees,\u201d and that San-tilli\u2019s \u201csuggestion played no part in the adoption of this self-starter by defendant.\u201d ^</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The court held that \u201cthe offer of plaintiff\u2019s idea, since that idea was not new, novel or practical, would not support a finding of any contract or the incurring of any liability,\u201d citing Soule v. Bon Ami Co., 201 App.Div. 794, 195 N.Y.S. 574, affirmed 235 N.Y. 609, 139 N.E. 754; Singer v. Karron, 162 Misc. 809, 294 N.Y. S. 566; 1 Williston on Contracts, Sec. 115 at 457 (3d Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Whether the trial court was strictly accurate in stating that under New York law there was no contract, cf. Keller v. American Chain Co., 255 N.Y. 94, 97, 174 N.E. 74, is unimportant for there can be no doubt about the correctness of the finding that the absence of novelty prevented the \u201cincurring of* * * * liability\u201d under the facts as found. If there was a contract, it was one relating to an idea which the plaintiff represented himself to have \u201cthe exclusive right to offer.\u201d Since an old and well known idea could not be such as was bargained for, there was, of course, no performance of the contract, if one existed. Without performance on his part, Santilli had no cause of action for compensation. See, in general on the requirement that in seeking compensation for an idea, the idea must be novel and useful: Lueddecke v. Chevrolet Motor Co., 8 Cir., 70 F.2d 345; Masline v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 95 Conn. 702, 711; 112 A. 639, 641, 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
