But the plaintiff insisted that a letter from the defendant to the proposed purchasers of the assets of the Randall Park Jockey Club amounted to an acknowledgment of an existing contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The district court ruled that even if the ambiguous language of the letters indicated a willingness by the defendant to abide by the written, but unsigned, agreement, the plaintiff must still show complete agreement as to the contract, which it was unable to do. The court found that the assignor of the plaintiff had not consented to the terms of the unsigned agreement; and that, therefore, there was never a contract. Support for this view was found from the entire correspondence in the case. It was pointed out that the defendant merely expressed willingness to negotiate an agreement with the purchasing group for a five-year period, beginning in 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">In submitting the case to the court on motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff-appellant in no wise indicated that any proof was essential to establishment of any proposition of fact to be proved by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">In the circumstances of the case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the United States District Court should be affirmed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
