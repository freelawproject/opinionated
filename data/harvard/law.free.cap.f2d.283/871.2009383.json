L. R. B. v. California Date Growers Association, 9 Cir., 259 F.2d 587 affirming 118 N.L.R.B. 246; and Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 4 Cir., 232 F.2d 158, affirming 114 N.L.R.B. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">Accordingly, the decision of the National Labor Relations Board is affirmed; and its order is directed to be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
