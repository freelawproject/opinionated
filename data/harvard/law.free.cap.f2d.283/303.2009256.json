This, appellant contends, is to be deduced from the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Beard v. United States, 4 Cir., 222 F.2d 84, 85, certiorari denied 350 U.S. 846, 76 S.Ct. 48, 100 L. Ed. 753. Appellant contends that that case stands for the proposition that if a taxpayer, who is subsequently tried for criminal tax evasion, appears in response to a subpoena and then relies on the Fifth Amendment as a basis for refusing to answer specific questions, such use of the Fifth Amendment can be shown to the jury on the subsequent trial as an inference of guilt. In our view Beard v. United States stands for no such proposition. It is based rather on the doctrine announced in Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787, the \u201crequired records\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\"> We hold that the trial court correctly decided that it could not quash \u2022the subpoena on the general allegation that it was intended for purposes other than those for which it purported to issue and that it might result in questions which the subpoenaed witness could constitutionally refuse to answer. The privilege of the Fifth Amendment must be exercised in connection with precise questions and not as a general excuse for refusing to appear in response to subpoena. Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 438, 95 L.Ed. 344.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
