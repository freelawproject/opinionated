United States, 353 U.S. 43, 77 S.Ct. 613, 1 L.Ed.2d 631. Under the principle enunciated in that case we think that the jury could find not only that the insured serviceman was dead at the expiration of the seven year statutory period, but also that he died between his last appearance on March 23, 1944, and the expiration of his insurance policy on June 30, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-28\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
