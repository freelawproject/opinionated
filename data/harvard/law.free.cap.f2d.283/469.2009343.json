We think the order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">The first appearance of this case in this Court was <em>sub </em>mom. Miami Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association et al. v. Callander et al., 5 Cir., 256 F.2d 410. We there ordered that certain allegations of the original complaint be stricken from the pleading. Thereafter appellants filed a second amendment and a subsequent supplement thereto. The trial court held, on motion of the defendants, that there was no longer federal jurisdiction over such complaints as then remained in the pleadings. We agree that no substantial federal question was raised as against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and any claim appellants may have had against the other appellees was not one arising \u201cunder the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
