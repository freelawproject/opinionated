But the letter does not name plaintiff as the person intended to be libeled; and the declaration fails to charge (either hs a conclusion of fact, if such pleading is permissible, or by an exhibition of extraneous facts that have the necessary effect of showing) \u2019that the recipient of the letter, or any other third party, understood the libelous matter to refer to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-21\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> To allege that defendant wrote and published (by mailing) the lei ter \u201cof and concerning plaintiff\u201d is not enough. As this court said in Duvivier v. French, 104 Fed. 278, 43 C. C. A. 529:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201cThe gravamen of an action for libel is not injury to the plaintiff\u2019s feelings, but damage to his reputation in the eyes of others. * * * It is not enough, to constitute libel, that the plaintiff knew that he was the subject of the article, or that the defendants knew of whom they were writing; it must appear upon the face of the declaration that persons other than these must have reasonably understood that the article was written of and concerning the plaintiff, and that the so-called libelous expressions related-to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">See, also, Robinson v. Drummond, 24 Ala. 174; De Witt v. Wright, 57 Cal. 576; Patterson v. Edwards, 7 Ill. (2 Gilman) 720; McLaughlin v. Fisher, 136 Ill. 111, 24 N. E. 60; McCallum v. Lambie, 145 Mass. 234, 13 N. E. 899; Carlson v. Minnesota Tribune Co., 47 Minn. 337, 50 N. W. 229; Miller v. Maxwell, 16 Wend. (N. Y.) 9; Sasser v. Rouse, 35 N. C. 145; Dunlap v. Sundberg, 55 Wash. 609, 104 Pac. 830, 133 Am. St. Rep. 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">As plaintiff refused to plead the necessary additional facts, we must believe that (but for the filing of her present declaration) her reputation with the world at large remained as good as if the letter had been written in a code unknown to any one except defendant and herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
