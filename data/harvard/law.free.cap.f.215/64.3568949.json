According to schedule, the crew of train 303, west bound, left T. at 1:40 p.. m. daily, arriving at P. at 6:45 p. m., and, returning, left P. at 7:25 the next morning, arriving at T. at 12:35 p. m. The crew left on time May 12, 1913, but were detained by a serious wreck of another train until 6 p. m., when the crew and the passengers of train 303 were transferred around the wreck to train 314, which had come up from P., when they proceeded to P., reaching there at 12:30 a. m. May 13th. The crew, after being off duty about 6% hours, returned to T. on their regular run, and in doing so was on duty about 17 hours without having had 8 continuous hours off duty. <em>Held, </em>that the failure of the train dispatchers to appreciate the fact that the transfer of the crew would prevent their return to T. on their regular train without keeping them on duty more than 16 hours without 8 consecutive hours rest was a casualty or unavoidable accident, within the exception of the Hours of Service Law (Act March 4, 1907, c. 2939. 34 Stat. 1416 (U.

Their regular run required them to leave Portland for the return trip at 7:25 the next morning, arriving in Tacoma, if on schedule time, at 12:35 p. m. of the same day, making the time of the crew on duty on the return trip, including the preparatory time, 5 hours and 40 minutes, so that this regular crew was off duty at Portland 12 hours and at Tacoma 24 hours and 35 minutes, when the trains made their schedule time. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The record shows without dispute that, between the stations of South Tacoma and Lake View on this line, there is a single track over which the trains of three railroad companies were operated, namely, the Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Oregon-Wasbiington Railroad &amp; Navigation Company, aggregating 28 passenger trains daily, besides a large number of freight trains. The evidence showed without conflict that, on the occasion in question, the crew in question left Tacoma on train 303 at 1:40 p. m. of May 12, 1913,' and was due to meet passenger train No. 362 of the Oregon-Washington Railroad &amp; Navigation Company at the station of South Tacoma at 1:56 p. m. of the same day, but that train 362 was derailed between Lake View' and South Tacoma at about 1:50 p. m., about six minutes before the regular time of the meeting of the two trains. That derailment tore up the track, overturned the engine and coaches of train 362, resulting in the death and injury of a number of passengers, and prevented train 303, on which was the crew here in question, from proceeding on to Portland until about 6 p. m. of the same day, when that crew, with the passengers of train 303, were transferred to passenger train 314, which had come up from Portland. Train 314, with the crew and passengers of train 303, was then backed to a place near Centralia, where it was turned around and then proceeded to Portland, reaching there at 12:30 a. m. of May 13th. The crew in question, after being off duty about 6 hours and a half at Portland, returned to Tacoma on its regular run on train 308, and\u00bb in doing so was on duty about 17 hours without having had 8 hours off duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The demoralization of the traffic over the road at the time in question, growing out of the derailment, is clearly shown by the uncontra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>dieted testimony in the case; indeed, it is expressly conceded by counsel for the government that the delay of the crew in question on its regular run from Tacoma to Portland was due to the \u201cunavoidable accident at South Tacoma.\u201d It is equally plain from the undisputed evidence that the accident was the sole cause why the crew in question was engaged on its run for more than 16 hours without a rest of 8 consecutive hours, so that the question is whether the circumstances of the case bring it within the first proviso to section 3 of the act'of Congress, upon which the action is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Undoubtedly the train dispatcher both at Tacoma and at Portland would, under ordinary conditions, be held to have known that the delay of train 303 at South Tacoma, and the transfer of its crew and passengers to train 314, could not have enabled them to reach Portland in time for the same crew to return to Tacoma on its regular train 308 without being kept on duty for more than 16 hours without a consecutive rest of 8 hours; but the evidence is uncontradicted to the effect (indeed, it could hardly have been otherwise) that both dispatchers were deeply engrossed in arranging and caring for the movement of the large number of trains, including the necessary wrecking outfits, together with the numerous incidentals, necessarily growing out of such a disaster. Under such circumstances, it would not, we think, be reasonable to hold the company liable for their failure to check up the time of service of the various crews of the very numerous trains passing over this particular piece of road at that particular time. And such we think was the view of Congress in providing, as it did, that the act of May 4, 1907, should \u201cnot apply in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We are of opinion that the court below was right in holding that the circumstances of the present case brought it within that proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
