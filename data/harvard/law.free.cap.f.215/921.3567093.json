This patent has been the subject of so many reported decisions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that it is useless to set out the details of the present controversy. Infringement is not denied The contest is on the issue of validity</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">If it had been made clear to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit, as it now seems to appear from the Scientific American articles, that Thomson\u2019s armor not only really had the creeping motion around the tire, but that he knew and understood this function and claimed merit for it, that court might not have sustained the first and the other very broad claims of the Parsons patent. These claims are not confined to non-skidding devices, or to vehicle wheels, but extend to protective armor and to all kinds of wheels or pulleys. However, we do not doubt that Parsons\u2019 development of the idea and his practical application of it to rapidly running wheels by the cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>chains, or equivalent device well adapted to creeping, was a meritorious invention, and this\u2014the invention in its commercial form\u2014is protected by claim 6. Whether the remaining claims are valid is of no vital importance to defendant, and in such a situation any uncertainty we may feel regarding some of them does not justify us in declining to follow the repeated adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Thq decree below must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-16\"> Weed Chain Tire Grip Co. v.
