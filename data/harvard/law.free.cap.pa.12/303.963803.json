By the Act he is required to give bond to appear; by the bond taken he is not only to appear, but to appear, answer, and abide the decision. In case of a second adjournment, there ought to be a. second bond. The one taken, therefore, is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
