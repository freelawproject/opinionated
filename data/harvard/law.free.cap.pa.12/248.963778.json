The plaintiff was the owner of a mill, propelled. by the water of a stream, without a dam. The defendants subsequently built a mill on their land, on the stream above that of the plaintiff\u2019s, and there erected a dam ten or twelve feet high, in which they collected and retained the water long enough for the uses of their mill, hut no longer. They used a wheel called a \u2022flutter-wheel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">It was proved that this detention of. the water injured the plaintiff\u2019s mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-8\">The defendants contended that if they used no more water than was reasonable, customary, and necessary for the running of their saw-mill, and detained the water no longer than was necessary for that purpose, they were not liable in damages to the plaintiff, though he may have suffered injury from the works of <em>the </em>defendants in detaining the water in the manner testified to in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">Church (P. J.) instructed the jury <em>that:\u2014\u201c </em>The owner of land through which a stream of water passes has a right to the use of the water while so passing, either for irrigating or manufacturing purposes. But in the exercise of this right he must he reasonably careful of the rights of others. Defendants owning the land above the plaintiff on this stream, have a right to the reasonable and necessary use of the water running in it for a mill, unless it <em>be </em>taken and used or shut off hy them so as to materially destroy the privileges and rights of plaintiff below. They have also a right to a reasonable detention of the water for the same purpose, hut not to every kind and extent of detention which the peculiar construction of their machinery may seem to require as necessary. When constructing their works they should provide against such results as will materially injure the reasonable use of it hy plaintiff in his works below. To shut off the water altogether and then let it go in such unreasonable and unnatural quantities that the plaintiff is unable to use it, when passing, hy the exercise of reasonable care and attention, and thereby causing a material injury and damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to his works, gives the plaintiff a right to compensation for the actual damage thus sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-4\">\u201cWe cannot assent to the defendants\u2019 point in the strong language used therein, without qualifying it in the manner we have. The reasonable use or detention of the water by defendants is such as does not materially injure or prevent the use of it by plaintiff below. This is what we are to understand by the reasonable use of the water by a riparian owner. Any other definition of the term would, it seems to us, be a violation of the spirit of the rule, so to use one\u2019s own as not to injure another in the enjoyment of his legal rights.\u201d \u2022 -</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-5\"><em>Galbraith </em>and Walker, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Q\">The jury could not but have understood from this charge that the defendants were not entitled to use the whole of the water-power within their land, if the plaintiff was thereby injured. But it is the settled law of this State, that a prior occupation gives no right to water-power as against parties not injured, and hence the supra-riparian owner, unless his right is limited by adverse occupation for twenty-one years, is in the same situation when he comes to build his min as if there were no mills below him. He has an absolute right to the water up to the levels of his own land, and may detain it there unless he acts merely maliciously or diverts the water permanently. Such is the rule established by 2 Watts, 327; 6 Barr, 33.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-6\"><em>Brown </em>and <em>Curtis, </em>contr\u00e0.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATa\">Every proprietor has an equal right to the flow and use of the water of the stream, nor can one materially diminish or affect the applicability of the water by any proprietor above or below himself: Ang. on Water-Courses, 13, 15, 17, 18; 3 Kent, 438, 440, 441; 2 Hilliard on Real Prop. 108, 104; 4 Dall. 211; 3 Cain. 307; 8 Mass. 136; 13 Ib. 420; 3 Pick. 269; 2 N.

The elaborate opinion of Mr. Justice Rogers, pronounced on deliberation, is sound in every particular. That case is like the present, and the only difference is that Hay\u2019s grist-mill had a possession on the stream upwards of thirty years before Sterrett\u2019s saw-mill was constructed. In that case it was established that the mere prior occupation of a stream of water for the purposes of a mill, will not vest such an exclusive right to the occupant as to enable him to maintain an action against a person who erected a mill and dam above his, by which the water is in part impeded, and he in some degree injured. Every riparian owner is entitled to use the flow of water through his land, although the owner of a mill below may be in some measure injured thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In order to establish a right to the use of water for the purposes of a mill, exclusive of a riparian owner above, founded upon the presumption of a grant from lapse of time, there must have been an actual occupation of the flow of water upon the land above, for a sufficient length of time. It is not enough to establish such a right, that the water had been accustomed to flow uninterruptedly through the land above for any length of time. An improper or malicious use of the water through the land above, gives a right of action to the owner of a mill below, who is injured thereby. The Court there affirmed the instruction to the jury, that if the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s mill arose from the detention of the water in Sterrett\u2019s dam for its ordinary and proper use for mill purposes, it was <em>damnum absque injuri\u00e1, </em>and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The evidence was, that Sterrett frequently withheld the water in his saw-mill dam for <em>two days </em>and <em>one night, </em>to the injury of Hay\u2019s mill. This was held to be properly referred to the jury <em>to </em>determine ; and they were instructed, that if they believed the water was no longer detained than was necessary for a proper enjoyment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>of it, as it passed through Sterrett\u2019s land for' the use of his mill, it is a damage to which plaintiff must submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">I need only refer to that case for a lucid and learned exposition of our law, as well as to the case of Hetrich <em>v. </em>Deachler, 6 Barr, 33. We think the defendant\u2019s point was well put, and ought to have been answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The defendant had a right to use the water for his lawful purposes on his own land, and that, whether he uses the old flutter-wheel or the modern scroll-wheel. On the evidence, the .plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendant, and the jury ought to have been so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
