This instrument is set forth in the opinion. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>evidence that either of the other defendants had any knowledge or notice of this agreement.

S. Bosworth, Beferee.\u2014The principal question in this case is this,\u2014was C. Brown Snyder a member of the firm of \u201cStrang, Platt &amp; Co.,\u201d which was formed December 31,1869, by articles of copartnership, signed by each of the above-named defendants, except C. Brown Snyder. If he is to be deemed to have been a member of that firm, or to be liable as such to its creditors, this must result from written articles of agreement, dated the same day as the said copartnership agreement entered into by and between C. Brown Snyder, and the above-named Peter O. Strang &amp; Ammon Platt. This last said agreement recites the fact, that all of the aboved-named defendants except C. Brown Snyder had that day formed a copartnership, \u201cunder the firm name of Strang, Platt &amp; Co., for the purpose of doing a wool brokerage and commission business in the cities of New York and Boston, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>whereas it is deemed expedient and for the interest of said firm that the aforesaid C. B. Snyder, party of the first part, should have an interest, and become a co-partner in the said firm of Strang, Platt <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d and then proceeds and concludes thus, viz.: \u201cNow therefore know all men by these presents, that it is hereby agreed by and between the parties to this contract, that the said C. B. Snyder is a copartner in the said firm of Strang, Platt &amp; Co., this day formed, and in consideration of this agreement and for other valuable considerations, the said C. B. Snyder shall and he is hereby entitled to receive from the said Peter 0. Strang <em>&amp; </em>Ammon Platt, one-third of the profits earned and received by each of the aforesaid parties of the second part from their interest in said firm of Strang, Platt <em>&amp; </em>Co., and it is further agreed by the said C. B. Snyder, that he will become liable for and pay to the said Strang &amp; Platt, an amount equal to one-third of any and all loss, that the said Strang &amp; Platt, or either of them may sustain or be charged with by reason of their connection as copartners or otherwise with Strang, Platt &amp; Co. It is further agreed by all the parties to this contract, that they will each and all of them do all that they can, and to the extent of their ability, to sustain, further and protect the interest of the said firm of Strang, Platt <em>&amp; </em>Co., and that they shall at all proper times during the continuance of this copartnership and agreement give each other true and exact statements of the affairs and accounts of the firm. This agreement to commence with the said copartnership of Strang, Platt &amp; Co., and to continue until the same is dissolved as provided for in the said articles of agreement, and it is further understood and agreed by the parties to these presents that they hereunto bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns. In witness whereof, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">There is no evidence that either of the other de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>fendants had any knowledge or notice of the existence of this agreement. The plaintiff was employed by this firm from its commencement until it was dissolved by the death of Ammon Platt, on or about April 24, 1870. He was also employed by a firm of Strang, Platt &amp; Co., which preceded the firm of that name, formed December 31, 1869, and he was also employed by a firm of that name formed shortly after the death of Ammon Platt, and about May 1, 1870, and continued in such employment until last said firm was dissolved. He loaned to, or deposited moneys with each of said firms from time to time, aggregating many thousands of dollars, and did not believe, until some time in 1875, that C. B. Snyder was a member of the firm now sued, or of any firm of that name. Instead of C. B. Snyder being held out to the plaintiff, or to others dealing with the firm, either by Snyder himself or by P. 0 Strang or by Ammon Platt, as being a member of this firm of Strang, Platt &amp; Co., or in any way interested in its business, or the results thereof, there seems to have been care and caution used not to do or say anything to induce or lead any one to suspect that he was in any way interested in the firm or in the profits of its business. Hence the practical question is, what is the legal effect of the agreement between Snyder of the one part, and P. O. Strang and Ammon Platt, of the other part, of the date of December 31,1869. Omitting for the present any consideration of the words, \u201cit is agreed . . that the said C. B. Snyder is a copartner in the said firm,\u201d the agreement provides that Snyder shall receive and be entitled to receive from P. O. Strang and A. Platt, one-third of the profits \u2018 earned and received\u201d by each of them \u201cfrom their interest\u201d in the firm; and that he shall pay to them \u201can amount equal to one-third of any and all losses that they or either of them may sustain or be charged with\u201d as such copartners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>This is not an agreement, even if full effect be given to it according to its terms, as against everybody, that Snyder shall share generally in the profits of the firm, as profits, but only that he shall share with P. O. Strang and Ammon Platt, the profits which they may derive and receive from their interest in the firm. This does not give, or attempt to give, to Snyder any special lien on the profits of the concern. It does not give, or attempt to give to Snyder, a certain share of the whole profits, but only a specified part of a share thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">\u201cHe does not receive this part of a share, nor is he entitled to interfere with it all, to say whether it shall be more or less in amount, until it has been actually set out, and the time has come for a division between him only and the partners with whom he has contracted. Of course he has nothing to do with the general firm or its creditors, or they with him; nothing with the general firm, because they have not assented to his being a partner; nothing with the creditors thereof, because he is not in fact a partner; and on the case supposed\u201d (which is strictly true of this case) \u201che has npt held himself out as such, nor does he draw out of the general concern any of its profits\u201d <em>(Collyer on </em>Partnership, note 1). This extract from Mr. Perkins\u2019 note on the cases reported up to the time it was written expresses, as I think, the rule which they establish; and subsequent decisions have not modified it. Pitch <em>-t). </em>Harrington (13 <em>Gray, </em>468), relied on by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as a case in point in his favor, does not, in any thing decided by the court, conflict with it. The court in that case granted a new, trial, not so much because the judge erred in his charge to the jury by stat-i ng as law what was not law, as because the court thought that the statement of the rule should be accompanied with explanations which wduld more fully instruct the jury as to its correct application. Reynolds <em>v. </em>Hicks (19 <em>Ind. </em>113), is in point, and in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>All elementary works to which my attention has been called, hold, on the facts of this case, that Snyder was not a member of the firm, bnt a sub-partner of P. O. Strang and Ammon <em>Platt. </em>Such <em>an </em>agreement as the one under consideration constitutes what is called in the books a sub-partnership. It makes the parties to it, partners <em>inter sese; </em>but it in no way affects the other members of the principal firm. There does not seem to be any authority for saying that, because a stranger to the firm shares in that way, and in that sense, the profits of the firm, he can be made liable to parties dealing with it, as if he were a partner therein (1 <em>Lind. Part. </em>53). The clause in the agreement, viz : \"it is hereby agreed by and between the parties to this contract that the said C. B. Snyder is a copartner in the said firm of Strang, Platt &amp; Co.,\u201d did not and could not make him such a partner. That result could not be effected without the consent of the other members of that firm. It made the three, as between themselves, members of that firm, in such sense and to such extent as the clauses of the contract in relation to sharing in the realized profits of P. O. Strang, and Ammon Platt, and paying to them an amount equal to one-third of their losses, made them all members of that firm. That made them partners as between themselves, but did not make Snyder a partner in the firm of Strang, Platt &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">If this agreement had been shown to the plaintiff before he made the loan on which a recovery is sought a question might arise which the case does not now present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">Having reached on this branch of the case the conclusion expressed, a very careful consideration of the other grounds of defense is rendered unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">After the delivery of this opinion, a re-argument of the case was had and the referee subsequently delivered another opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>J. S. Bos worth, Referee.\u2014This action involves the question whether there can be an agreement between one of several members of a firm and a third person, when made without the knowledge or consent of the other parties, by which that one partner is to pay a specified part of the profits, which he may earn and receive as such partner, to such stranger, without such stranger being thereby made liable for all the debts of such firm to its creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">Collyer, section 194, states the rule thus :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>stranger may share the profits of a particular partner with whom he contracts, and, not being engaged in the general partnership, will, of course, not be liable for their debts, and, upon the bankruptcy of the particular partner, may prove against his separate estate\u201d <em>(Vide Lindley Partn. </em>vol. 1, p. 53, 55).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">I am not referred to <em>any </em>adjudged case which holds to the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-8\">There is a class of cases which hold that a third person who receives a sum equal to a specified part of the profits, as a compensation for his services, is not liable as a partner to third persons, notwithstanding that it is intended that such third person is to be paid, and is in fact paid, this specified part out of the profits. And the rule, in its application, includes cases where, in addition to a salary, the third person is to receive a specified part of the profits, if any are made, he having nothing to do with the losses (Vanderburgh <em>v. </em>Hull, <em>20 Wend. </em>70).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">The reason for extending exemption from liability as partners to the creditors of the firm in the class of cases last stated, is said to be that it is an arrangement made simply in reference to the measure of compensation (I<em>d.). </em>Burckle <em>v. </em>Eckhart <em>(Coms. </em>132, 138), Shackland, J. (dissenting), argued that \u201c the person who receives of the profits, as profits, of a concern, any amount, although in the name of wages, or compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tion for services, should not be exempt from liability as partner to the creditors of the firm.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">It is essential, to make a person liable as a partner who is not in fact a partner, that he has a right to a share of the profits of the business, as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">In Heimstreet <em>v. </em>Howland (5 Denio, 68), this rule was carried to the length of holding that the lessor of a ferry for a year, upon an agreement that the lessee should take charge of the business, pay all the expenses, and pay over to the lessor one-half of the gross receipts of the ferriage, did not thereby make himself liable to third persons as a partner of the lessee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">In that case the lessor took half of the gross proceeds, and, of course, more than one-half of the net profits, but what he received was as a compensation for the lease of his ferry. The court held: \u201cThere must, to constitute a partnership, be a vested interest in the profits in the person sought to be charged as partner, such as would, for that reason alone, entitle him to an account in equity, against the other persons concerned in the business.\u201d I understand the court to be here speaking of cases where a third person is sought to be charged solely on the ground of Ms right to participate in the profits. It is in the same sense, as I suppose, that the court say, in Fitch <em>v. </em>Harrington (13 Gray, 474), that, \u201cAn agreement between one copartner and a third person, that he shall participate in the profits of the firm, as profits, renders him liable, as a partner, to the creditors of the firm, . . but if such third person, by his agreement with one member of the firm, is to secure compensation for his labor, services, &amp;c., in proportion to the profits of the business of the firm, without having any specific lien on the profits, to the exclusion of other creditors,\u201d he is not liable for the debts of the firm.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>That case is relied on by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as directly adjudicating the rule for which he contends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">That case states that there was evidence tending to show \u201cthat the share in the concern standing in the name of Leonard Harrington (one of the members of the firm), was owned jointly by Leonard and Samuel P. Harrington,\u201d who was sought to be charged as a partner <em>(Id. </em>468).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">It will be observed that in the statement of facts, in the charge of the judge, and in the opinion of the court, there is no allusion to the question whether this joint ownership of a share, if it existed, was with or without the knowledge and consent of the other partners. The judge charged <em>(Id. </em>470), \u201c That if the share in the partnership concern, which stood in the name of Leonard Harrington only, was owned jointly by him and Samuel P. Harrington, then Samuel P. was liable in this action; but if there was a sub-partnership between Leonard and Samuel P., by which Samuel P. was to share in the profits of the firm to which Leonard was entitled, this alone would not make Samuel P. liable for the debts of the firm.\u201d H the judge, in this part of the charge, and the court in its opinion, had in mind, as a fact, that the joint ownership by the two Harringtons of the share standing in the name of Leonard only, was created with the knowledge and consent of all the members of the firm, the rule that such joint ownership, with such knowledge and assent of all the members of the firm, would make Samuel P. \u25a0 liable as a partner, no one, probably, would dispute. It would seem that such fact would make them partners <em>inter sese. </em>In such case each would be interested in the whole profits of the business, as profits, by consent of all the partners, and Samuel P. would have as much right to his share of the profits, as profits, to the exclusion of individual creditors of Leonard, as any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>member of the firm would. The court concluded its opinion that \u201cIn order to enable the jury to decide whether Samuel P. Harrington was liable for the debts of the firm of Whittemore, Harrington <em>&amp; </em>Co., by reason of a sub-partnership between him and Leonard Harrington, they should have received instructions more definite and discriminating than they could derive from the mere words of Mr. Collyer. The kind of agreement which would render Samuel P. liable for the debts of the firm, and the kind of agreement which would not render him liable therefor, should have been so explained to them that they might intelligently decide whether the agreement between the two (if any was proved), was such as did or did not render Samuel P. liable as a partner for the debts due from the firm to the plaintiffs. The other instructions given <em>to </em>the jury seem to us to have been unexceptionable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">J ixdicial opinions should be read remembering that they are written in view of the facts of the case in which they are delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">There is nothing in this opinion that intimates that an agreement between Leonard and Samuel P. Harrington, made without the knowledge and consent of the other members of the firm, that Samuel P. should be paid by Leonard one-third of the profits, which the latter should earn and receive as a partner, would alone make Samuel P. liable for the debts of the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">That is the question in this case, whatever it may have been in that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">Snyder had no money or capital stock in the firm ' of Strang, Platt <em>&amp; </em>Co. ; the agreement between him and P. 0. Strang and Ammon Platt was unknown to the other members of the firm, and Snyder was not expected to be able, or to be permitted, to take personally any part in the conduct of the affairs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>firm, or in the transaction of its business. He was not to be, and he was not held out by himself or others as, a member of the firm. And the plaintiff, who was an employee of the firm during its continuance, had no belief or suspicion that he was a partner until over five years after its dissolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">On principle the case seems to me to be as strong in favor of Snyder as the cases of Vanderburgh <em>v. </em>Hull, Burckle <em>v. </em>Erhart, and Heimstreet <em>v. </em>Howland <em>(supra) </em>are in favor of the persons they held exempt from liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">Snyder had no property or interest in the profits of the firm of Strang, Platt <em>&amp; Go., </em>as such. It is conceded that an action in his favor would not lie against the firm for an accounting. He had no power to compel an adjudication-between the members of the firm of the amount of profits earned by P. O. Strang and Ammon Platt, respectively, and as between himself and P. O. Strang and Ammon Platt he had no claims against them until they had received profits, or their right to them, as between them and their co-partners, was clear and indisputable, and then his right of action would be against P. O. Strang and Ammon Platt only. Anything which they might pay to him out of profits they had received from the firm, and after they had received it, he would not receive as profits of the firm, but'as a share of their realized profits, which, but for their agreement with Mm, they might pay to their individual creditors, or otherwise dispose of, as to them might seem meet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">Newland <em>v. </em>Tate (3 <em>Ired. Eq. N. C. </em>226), contains nothing in conflict with the views here expressed. In that case two persons were partners in a government contract for carrying the mails in stage coaches. After the contract was made, the defendant J. H. Tate agreed with his brother, Robert W. Tate, that the two brothers, as between themselves, became part-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ners in the original share of J. H. Tate; the whole business was under the personal care and management of the two Tates jointly, though chiefly that of Robert W., who received the fare of passengers in the coaches in which the mail was carried, the pay from the government, and made the disbursements, and finally sold the stock and contract to one Wilson, and received the contract price. The court held that the three were not copartners <em>inter se, </em>and. that Robert H. Tate could not be compelled to account as a partner of the plaintiff, but could be compelled, as agent, to account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">The only passage in the opinion affecting the case in hand is this: \u201cThus accounting, it is true, he will not be directly liable to the plaintiff for any losses sustained, if any there be, unless by his own fault as agent; because, although he might be liable for the contracts of the firm to third persons as a partner, yet he was not a partner, as between themselves, to share the profit and loss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">In that case, Robert H. Tate had become owner of one-half of his brother\u2019s interest in the capital stock, * and was to have half of his brother\u2019s share of the profits as such, and took an active control of the business as the agent of the firm, and of course in the protection and furtherance of his own interest, and with the knowledge and consent of all the partners. That is not this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">Buckley v. Bramhall (24 <em>How. Pr. </em>455), was decided on the ground that the statutes in relation to limited partnerships made Bramhall liable as a general partner, because he was interested in the partnership, and false statements were made in the certificate and affidavit by which the partnership was formed.

B. Snyder is a copartner in the said firm,\u201d I made such comment in my former opinion as seems to me to be appropriate. He certainly was not a partner in the firm notwithstanding, as the other three partners had not consented to it. He did not thereby become one as to third persons, unless the agreement as to sharing in Strang and Ammon Platt\u2019s part of their profits, when realized, made him such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">An agreement between P.

Brown Snyder as to the circumstances under which he executed that agreement, and upon what solicitation he did it (and as to which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>is uncontradicted) if it may be considered in construing the paper and arriving thereby at the intent of the parties, would not lead to the conclusion that any other effect should be given to this clause than that first suggested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The clause by which the three agreed to do all they could \u201c to sustain, further and protect the interest\u201d of the \u201csaid firm,\u201d and that each should give to the other \u201cexact and true statements of the affairs and accounts of the firm,\u201d seems to me unimportant. Snyder could not linow anything about the affairs of the firm, except what he might acquire from Strang and Ammon Platt, and he could not have any accounts of \u2022 the firm\u2019s business, as such, to render, unless Strang and Ammon Platt should furnish them to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">In what way it was contemplated that Snyder could protect the interest of the firm is not very obvious.

Strang and Ammon Platt, of December 31, 1869.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-9\"><em>Martin &amp; Smith, </em>attorneys, and <em>A. P.

The defendant Snyder must be held to be a partner, because he agreed to receive a portion of the profits, and to share the losses. The reason why sharing in the profits makes one a partner is, that he thereby deprives creditors of part of the means of payment. This is the well settled law of this State (See Manhattan Brass Co. <em>v. </em>Sears, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>797 ; Leggett <em>v. </em>Hyde, 58 <em>Id. 272). </em>It is of no moment that the defendant Snyder did not agree to receive his share of the profits directly from all the partners, but only through the intervention of two of the partners.' The principle is the same. Snyder is just as much a sharer in the profits, although he obtains them through the machinery of two of\" his partners, as if he received his share of the profits directly from the partnership fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">II. The position taken by counsel for the defendant Snyder, to the effect that the defendant Snyder was a sub-partner, and that he is not liable to the creditors of Strang, Platt &amp; Co. for the firm debts, is untenable. As matter of fact, it appears that Mr. Snyder was not a sub-partner, but that he expressly agreed to become a member of the copartnership of Strang, Platt &amp; Co., and to take a share of the profits, and bear a share of the losses, with two of the members, and to act as a partner in the business of the firm. It is not a case where a.n agreement is made with one member of a partnership for a share of his profits ; it goes iarther, and is an agreement by Snyder to become a member of the copartnership. But assuming that Snyder could be called strictly a sub-partner, nevertheless, inasmuch as he was to take a share of another partner\u2019s profits, and to bear a share of another partner\u2019s losses, he is liable for the debts of the copartnership. The cases cited before the referee by counsel for defendant Snyder, to maintain his proposition (with the exception of the case in 19 <em>Ind. </em>113), do not touch the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>whether a creditor can recover against a sub-partner, but extend only to the question of the right of a sub-partner to compel the other partners to account, and to similar questions. The precise question involved in this case has been very ably considered and decided, and the authorities quoted by the counsel for the defendant Snyder are explained and distinguished, in the case of Fitch <em>v. </em>Harrington (13 Gray, 468). It is there expressly held, that \u201c an agreement between one partner and a third person, that the latter shall participate in that partner\u2019s share of the profits of the firm as profits, renders him liable as a partner to the creditors of the firm, although, as regards the other members of the firm, he is not their partner.\u201d The opinion of Judge Metcalf, on pages 472, 473, and 474, is clear and thorough, is based upon principle, and would seem to be conclusive upon this question. In the case of Reynolds <em>v. </em>Hicks, 19 <em>Ind. </em>113 (cited by defendant\u2019s counsel), the facts will be found, on examination, to differ materially from the facts in this case. (1.) There was no agreement to become a partner. (2.) The defendant sought to be charged advanced money to a partner, who was bound to repay the money. See judge\u2019s opinion, pp. 114 and 116, (bottom of page). (3.) The case seems to have been loosely considered. There is no argument, no reference to authorities on the turning point of the case, and the opinion of the judge does not seem to be based upon any controlling principle. In the opinion of the referee, <em>Lindley on Partnership </em>is cited as an authority for the defendant Snyder, but a subsequent edition of the same author states a contrary view (See <em>Lindley on </em>Partnership, vol. 1, 3rd London edition, p. 55). The only decision in this State touching the question is a strong authority for the plaintiff (Buckley <em>v. </em>Bramhall, 24 <em>How. Pr. </em>455).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Wilson &amp; Wallis, </em>attorneys, and <em>William G. Wilson, of </em>counsel, for respondent, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiZ\">\u2014I. The defendant Snyder was not a partner in the firm in question. It is abundantly shown that he took no part in the business, paid nothing into it, and received nothing out of it. It is also shown that he was not in any manner a party to the copartnership articles', although the firm was formed by a written agreement. The only ground then upon which he can be claimed to have become a partner is, that he was a party to Exhibit No. 1. If he is a partner at all, it is because this instrument makes him one. The plaintiff claims that the instrument has this effect: 1. Because it states that it is thereby agreed that Snyder is a partner; and, <em>2. </em>Because of its provisions in regard to profits and losses. I. An agreement between Strang, Platt and Snyder, that the latter should be a partner in a firm already formed, and composed of Strang, Platt, Lockwood, Clark and A. B. Platt, could not be effectual to make Snyder such partner <em>(Story on Partnership, </em>\u00a73, <em>5 </em>; <em>Collyer on Partnership, </em>\u00a7 194).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">II. Neither are the provisions in regard to profits and losses of such a character as to make the defendant Snyder a partner in the firm, or liable for its debts, even if they had been made with the knowledge and consent of three remaining members of the firm. It is now well settled, that to establish a partnership, the sharing in profits must be such as to entitle the alleged partner to an account as partner, and to a lien for his share of the profits (Catskill Bank <em>v. </em>Gray, 14 <em>Barb. </em>471; Holmes <em>v. </em>Old Colony R. R., <em>5 Gray, </em>58; <em>In re </em>English and Irish Church, &amp;c. Society, 1 <em>Heming &amp; Miller, 85 ; </em>Cox <em>v. </em>Hickman, 8 <em>House of Lords Cases, </em>301 ; Mollwo <em>v. </em>Court of Wards, <em>Law Rep., 4 P. Council, </em>419, overruling Grace <em>v. </em>Smith). Leggett <em>v. </em>Hyde, (58 <em>N. Y. 276), </em>and Manhattan Co. <em>v. </em>Sears (45 <em>Id. </em>797), are not authorities against this position, for, in Leggett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>y. Hyde it is found as matter of fact that the defendant had an interest in the profits as profits, that the agreement was that he should have an account of the business every six months, and a division was then to be made of he profits then appearing; and in Manhattan Co. v. Sears, it is said that there existed in fact\u20141, sharing the profits <em>(i. e., </em>in the profits as profits), 2, sharing in the losses <em>(i. e., </em>as losses of the business), 3, a right to inspect the books, and 4, a common interest in the stock (See also Vanderburgh v. Hall, 20 <em>Wend. </em>70 ; Heinstreet v. Howland, 5 <em>Denio, </em>68). But the contract which existed between this defendant and two of the members of the firm of Strang, Platt &amp; Co. is one well known to the law by the name of sub-partnership, and it is well settled that the sub-partner has neither the rights nor the liabilities of a partner in the principal firm <em>(Dig. </em>Lib. 17, Tit. 2, \u00a7 20 ; <em>Exp. </em>Barrow, 2 <em>Rose. </em>252 ; Bray v. Fromant, <em>Madd. </em>5 ; Brain <em>v. </em>De Tastet, Jacob, 284 ; Frost v. Moulton, 21 <em>Beav. </em>596). Fitch y. Harrington (13 <em>Gray, </em>468), is claimed to be an authority against this doctrine, but is not so in fact. For the court distinctly recognize the contract of sub-partnership as one well known, and as one exempting the sub-partner from liability to creditors, and the decision goes upon the ground that the nature of a sub-partnership was not sufficiently explained to the jury. The court says: \u201cIn order to enable the jury to decide whether Samuel P. Harrington was liable for the debts of th\u00e9 firm of Whitemore, Harrington &amp; Co., by reason of a sub-partnership between him and Leonard Harrington, they should have received instructions more definite and discriminating than they could derive from the mere words of Mr. Collyer. The kind of agreement which would render Samuel P. liable for the debts of the firm, and the kind of agreement which would not render him liable therefor, should have been so explained to them, that they might intelligently decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>whether the agreement between the two (if any was' proved) was such as did or did not render Samuel P. liable as a partner for the debts due from the firm to the plaintiffs.\u201d Reynolds <em>v. </em>Hicks, 19 <em>Ind. </em>113, is exactly in point, and holds that a sub-partner is not liable to the creditors of the firm.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-5\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALR\">\u2014The judgment should be affirmed with costs, for the reasons contained in the opinion of the referee who tried the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Curtis, Ch.
