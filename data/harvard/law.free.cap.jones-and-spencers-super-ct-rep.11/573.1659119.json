Mere inability to deliver is itself <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence. To relieve himself from liability to the bailor, the warehouseman, as bailee, must fully account for the goods, and this he can only do by showing the manner of their loss or destruction, and that the same occurred in spite of proper care and diligence on his part. Thus even proof of larceny or burglary does not of itself relieve the warehouseman. He must, in addition, show that he did not in any wise contribute by any neglect or want of precaution on his part (Schwerin \u00bb. McKee, 51 <em>N. T. </em>180; Coleman <em>v. </em>Livingston, 37 W. <em>T.
