'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-15\">This fact was sworn to by the detective, in an affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>davit made by him, and was also proved by the two gaugers, who, being unwilling witnesses, were examined before a referee, under an order obtained for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">From the affidavit of the detective, and the testimony of the gaugers, it appeared that the firm of gaugers kept a book called a gauger\u2019s book, which contained entries of the gauging made by them ; that there was an evident desire to withhold this book ; that the book, when finally obtained, showed the following entry:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">\u201cFowler &amp; Jova, Pier 4 IST.

E. The detective in his affidavit also swore that the gauger, Webb, told him that the molasses referred to in the above entry in the gaugers\u2019 book, was gauged for Cordon that the direction so to gauge was on the original order which had been destroyed, as was usual; he al&amp;o swore that he had several interviews with Jova, one of the plaintiffs; that Jova in fact seemed willing to impart information, that on the second interview he (the detective) \u201cshowed Jova the bill of lading of forty hogsheads of molasses by the steamer Key West, and Mr. Jova said that this was the molasses he had spoken of\u201d (in a previous interview, as the detective swears, he had spoken of a sale of 40 hogsheads of molasses, in June, 1867, to a distiller named Cordon) as sold to said Cordon, \u201c and that nothing had been received on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of that sale; that he (the detective) subsequently asked Jova to make an affidavit, and Jova said he would not, until he had examined the books, and he had no time then to do so, and would consult with plaintiff Fowler; that he (the detective) again called on Jova, who said he had never had time to fully talk with Fowler ; that on the same interview, upon being again requested to make the affidavit, he said, \u201cNo, I am advised by Mr. Fowler not to sign any papers.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-5\">One of the sheriff\u2019s indemnitors, and Mr. John D. McCormick, made affidavits to the effect that they are well acquainted with the trade of dealing in molasses, and familiar with the trade in regard to gauging of molasses, that the custom of the trade, generally, is to gauge the various packages, only after or upon their sale. Mr. McCormick\u2019s affidavit set forth that this custom is so general and uniform, and has become so well established, that the gauge marks have come to be, and are indications that a sale has been had of the parcels on which they appear, since the arrival of the same at this port, and in the absence of other information showing the facts to be otherwise, said marks would be deemed by all dealers to be evidence that such packages had changed possession upon sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\">The motion for a new trial, on the grounds of newly-discovered evidence was based on these affidavits, and the examination of the gaugers before the referee, as showing the evidence claimed to have been newly discovered. <em>6</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-7\">The motion was opposed on the affidavit of Mr. Jova, who fully met all the statements made in the detective\u2019s affidavit, concerning interviews between them; also on the affidavits of Fowler, one of the plaintiffs, and of said Gordon, to the effect that the molasses referred to in the above entry in the gauger\u2019s book was not sold to said Gordon, Mr. Fowler swearing that it was sold to a man named Dougherty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>On the motion, it was argued that the 40 hogsheads mentioned in the entry in the gaugers\u2019 book, were those referred to in the above order, No. 2016, and that the twenty seized were a part of them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-5\">Vanderpoel, <em>Green &amp; </em>Cuming, attorneys, and <em>Robert D. </em>Green, of counsel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-6\"><em>Henry </em>Daily, Jr., attorney, and of counsel, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b400-7\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">\u2014The only fact on which a new trial could be ordered is the face of the gaugers\u2019 book. The affidavit of the detective, opposed, as it is, by answering affidavits, is not ground enough. The manner in which the gaugers avoid testifying with candor, is, of course, discreditable to them, but on such a motion that does not avail defendant. He must show the new facts by the witnesses themselves, and here the gaugers are his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The gaugers\u2019 book contains the gauge of forty hogsheads of molasses for the plaintiff, on June 7, 1867, ex Key West, marked ,F. &amp; Co., made at pier No. 4, on the North River. The defendant shows that by the practice of the trade, having rare exceptions, a gauging was not directed, unless it was needed to consummate a sale which had been made, so far as the bargain w\u00e9nt. If this be so\u2014if this case did not present an exception, if even the memorandum proves that a sale had been made to G-ordon, the evidence on the trial shows the recovery was had upon a lot which had bean removed from pier 4, had been placed in the warehouse, and had been seized by the sheriff (that seizure being the ground of the action) on June 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">If one of the plaintiffs did not swear on the motion that'the lot gauged on June 7, was sold to Dougherty, one could easily entertain the idea that the gauging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>disclosed in the book did comprise the twenty-two hogsheads in question, in spite of the date and the mark. Even then, if it was possible that it should have been ordered to accompany the very peculiar arrangement that the plaintiff\u2019s case on the trial showed existed between them and Gordon, a new trial could not be granted. The affidavit, having nothing to oppose it, must be taken to show that the lot referred lo in the book went to Dougherty.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Curtis, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
