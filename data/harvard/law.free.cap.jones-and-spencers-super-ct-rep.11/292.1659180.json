Such commissioners designated a route which extends through the Sixth avenue, from Amity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>street to Fifty-ninth street. On June 18, 1875 <em>(Laws of </em>1875, ch. 606), the legislature passed an act, sifice generally known as the \u201c Rapid Transit Act,\u201d which, upon certain terms and conditions therein specified, authorizes the construction of steam elevated railroads in cities, over, under, through or across the streets, avenues, places or lands therein (\u201c except Broadway and Fifth avenue below Fifty-ninth street, and Fourth avenue above Forty-second street, in the city of New York,\u201d and certain other excepted places), upon consent of certain property owners and local authorities, or, in case such consent cannot be obtained, upon a decision by commissioners appointed by the supreme court, to the effect that such railroad ought to be constructed. Corporations formed under that act are thereby empowered to construct and operate railways upon the routes decided upon, as therein provided, and, in all cases, the use of streets, avenues, places and lands, and the right of way through the same for the purpose of such railways, is thereby declared to be a public use, consistent with the uses for which such streets, avenues, &amp;c., are publicly held. The thirty-sixth section of the act relates especially to the construction of such railways as are thus authorized to be built, over routes coincident with horse railway tracks occupying the surface of the street, and confers certain powers and privileges incident or necessary to such construction; and, thereupon, also confers upon <em>existing corporations, formed for the purpose provided by the act, </em>and whose routes, according to their charters, are coincident with routes determined upon by commissioners pursuant to its provisions, like power <em>to construct and operate such railways, as a corporation specially formed under the act, </em>upon fulfillment of the requirements and conditions imposed pursuant thereto. Under the provisions of this-act, an elevated railway route, coincident with that of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>as prescribed by its charter, was fixed and laid out; and thereupon the defendant, claiming authority so to do, under and by virtue of the legislation and proceedings above mentioned, undertook to construct an elevated railway through the Sixth' avenue, between Amity and Fifty-ninth streets, and proceeded therewith, until enjoined by the order,' and, finally by the judgment of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\">Upon the trial, at special term, it was claimed and insisted by the plaintiff, that the Rapid Transit Act of 1875 (and especially section 36 thereof), upon which the defendant relied as constituting its authority to build the road upon the plan prescribed by the commissioners appointed thereunder, was invalid, as in conflict with the State constitution. The judge before whom the trial was held, held that the thirty-sixth section of the Rapid Transit Act was unconstitutional and void; that the defendant had no authority, in law, to construct its proposed railroad, either by virtue of its charter or the provisions of that act; and, accordingly, that the plaintiff .was entitled to a perpetual injunction restraining defendant from building such railway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">Judgment was entered accordingly, and defendant now appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">The arguments of counsel for the respective parties were very elaborate ; the abbreviation of them here presented gives the substance of the points raised.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\"><em>Porter, Lowrey, Soren &amp; Stone, </em>attorneys, <em>Grosvenor P.

As <em>to the limits under which the court should review the special term judgment. </em>1. The duty of the appellate branch of the court would seem to be limited to a review of the bases upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that judgment rests. Such a review having already been had\u2014virtually\u2014in the court of appeals, resulting in a decision that the bases of the special term judgments are erroneous, it would seem that that judgment should be at once reversed and a new trial ordered (Wisser <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 3 <em>Jones &amp; </em>Spencer, 149, 152; Munro <em>v. </em>Potter, 34 <em>Barb. </em>361; Mills <em>v. </em>Van Voorhees, 20 <em>N. Y. </em>412, 423).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-4\">II. <em>As to the pretended franchise. </em>This is claimed under resolutions of the common council of the city of New York, and an act of the legislature confirming all grants previously made to street railroads upon the terms and conditions of the original grants <em>(Laws </em>1854, p. 323). Ho exclusive privilege to use the surface of! Sixth avenue, or the circumambient spaces of the air can be found in these resolutions or contracts ; and no such exclusive privilege or promise of a privilege is, as against the general public interest and in diminution of the general control of the State over public streets and highways, to be implied (Thompson <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 3 <em>Sandf. Ch. </em>625).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">III. As <em>to the obligation of contracts generally. </em>It may be said in general that \u201cIt is competent for the legislature, after granting a franchise to one person or corporation, which affects the rights of the public, to grant a similar franchise to another person or corporation, the use of which shall impair or even destroy the value of the first franchise, although the right so to do may not be reserved in the first grant, unless the right to do so is expressly prohibited by the first grant\u201d (Charles River Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Warren Bridge Co., 11 Peters, 420; Auburn, &amp;c. Co. v. Douglas, 9 <em>N. Y. </em>444; Rennselaer, &amp;c. R. R. <em>v. </em>Davis, 43 <em>Id. </em>137; Mohawk Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Utica, &amp;c. R. R., 6 <em>Paige, </em>554; Ft. Plain Bridge <em>v. </em>Smith, 30 <em>N. Y. </em>44).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">Upon this point, therefore, we contend :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">1. That there is no obligation of contract, binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>on the city or State, to permit the Sixth Avenne Railroad Company to continue its railroad or run its cars, and much less to exclude others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\"><em>2. </em>That such an obligation, if existing, would not be impaired by legislation permitting others to carry on in the same street the business proposed by us, however injurious might be the competition. It is difficult to conceive what can be said in support of the idea, that the building of the defendant\u2019s road brings upon the plaintiff the injury contemplated by section 10 of article 1 of the constitution of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">IV. <em>As to the easement claimed by </em>plaintiff'. 1st. The history of the law affecting streets in this city, informs us that, under the Dutch law, the fee of all roads and streets belonged to the sovereign State ; and that all such title in the State passed by conquest to the crown of Great Britain, and, after the American Revolution, to the State of New York, by which State it has, by the acts above-mentioned, been granted to the city (Dunham <em>v. </em>Williams, 37 <em>N. Y. </em>251).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">The provincial legislature provided a scheme of legislation for the laying out of streets, by which it was arranged that compensation was to be given to the owners of land over which roads or streets were opened. In the case of roads in the country, only an easement was deemed to be taken, and the compensation paid was such damages as were appropriate for the use of the land assessed. But in the city of New York the municipal government, in laying out streets, were required to give reasonable satisfaction, not for the use of the land, but for all such land as should be taken and employed, and the satisfaction was to be for the complete respective interests and estates of the owners in such land (1 <em>Smith &amp; Liv. </em>Laws, p. 8; <em>Laws of </em>1691, ch. 18; <em>Hoffman's Treatise on Estates and Rights of </em>Corporations, vol. 1, p. 199). Various acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the provincial and State legislatures were superseded by the acts of 1807 and 1813.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-4\">The title to streets in this city laid out under those acts is completely in the city (Schuchart v. The Mayor, &amp;c., 53 <em>N. Y. </em>202; The People v. Kerr, 27 <em>Id. </em>188; Kellinger v. Forty-second Street R. R.

Rochester, &amp;c. R. R., 9 <em>How. Pr. </em>553; Higby v. Camden <em>&amp; </em>Amboy R. R., 19 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>279; Currier v. West Side R.

Y. </em>486).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">This is perhaps, however, the proper place in which to cite some authorities in refutation of the notion that there has arisen, from the proceedings by which lands in Sixth avenue have been appropriated and paid for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>an implied covenant in favor of abutting owners. This notion seems to be, that by the payment of the assessment imposed upon them or their predecessors in the title for the benefit of the street opening, there has been created in such abutting owners a private interest in the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-4\">In the exercise by the State of the right of eminent domain and of its taxing power, the citizens\u2019 consent is ignored. Nothing depends upon that consent or the withholding of it, and no right arises from any declaration by the State, when it levies the tax or takes the property, of its then present intentions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">The court of last resort has decided that a local assessment of this nature is a tax, and that \u201cthe payment of taxes is a duty, and creates no <em>obligation </em>to repay otherwise than in the proper application of the tax\u201d (People <em>v. </em>Mayor of Brooklyn, 4 <em>Comst. </em>424).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-6\">2. The provision in the act of 1807, requiring the filing of a general map, which shall be final and conclusive, and enacting that after the streets around a block should be opened no public street should ever be made through the block, and similar provisions in other acts <em>(Laws </em>1831, chap. 252) have never, been considered unalterable provisions creating a private right (Waddell v.

Even if there were any possibility of reverter, that interest is a nominal one merely, not entitling its holder to the intervention of equity (Wetmore <em>v. </em>Story, 22 <em>Barb. </em>488). The value of a possibility of reverter is not assessible at more than one dollar, or at anything beyond a mere nominal sum <em>(In re </em>Thirty-ninth Street, 1 <em>Hill, </em>194; <em>In re </em>Thirty-second Street, 19 <em>Wend. </em>129).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-8\">The value of a similar interest in a much larger part of a dedicated street, which would have been worth $7,000 if not burdened by the public use, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>held to be correctly assessed at one dollar, in Livingston <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 8 <em>Wend. 85.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-4\">An injunction will not be granted where it would cause great injury tb the defendants, and might be of serious detriment to the public, without corresponding value to the complainants (Torrey <em>v. </em>C. &amp; A.

The notion that the land in public streets in this city is, under the terms of the act of 1813, impressed with a trust which can be. availed of by plaintiffs to exclude the proposed use of Sixth avenue, is wholly without support in the language of the act, or in general public policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">The phrases \u201cfor ever\u201d and \u201cin trust,\u201d in the act of 1813, do not constitute an irrepealable engagement between the State and the abutting lot owner.

And it is expressly found, in the same finding, that the row of columns on each side of the plaintiff\u2019s track will exclusively use and occupy spaces in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>street that the plaintiff is entitled to nse for the purposes of its franchise; that the damage- that is suffered by the plaintiff is peculiar to it, and is otherwise than is suffered from the same cause by the public or others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-4\">Upon the ground, then, that we are entitled to compensation for our valuable corporate rights, franchises, and property, that are proposed to be taken away, as a condition precedent to their appropriation we insist with absolute confidence that the decree appealed from should be affirmed, and the defendants perpetually enjoined from proceeding with their proposed structure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">VI. The route laid out by the commissioners through the Sixth avenue, in front of the plaintiff\u2019s property, is illegal and void, and therefore no authority to construct that section of the road, at least, can be derived from their action, because the route there, as so laid out, is an express violation of the prohibitions of the fourth section of the act, by crossing Broadway in two places, as the court below finds, at Fifty-third street, and again at Thirty-third street. The fourth section of the act, which gives to the commissioners power to locate the route over, under, through or across the streets, avenues, places or land in such county, except Broadway and \u00ed\u2019ifth avenue below Fifty-ninth street, and Fourth avenue, above Forty-second street, in the city of New York,\u201d is an absolute prohibition, as strong as language could make it, against the legality of any route which crosses Broadway within the excepted region.

He accordingly rendered judgment, that the defendant be enjoined and forever restrained from building such railway. The question of the validity of the rapid transit act, and particularly of section 36, has since been presented to the court of appeals in certain proceedings entitled In the matter of the petition of the New York Elevated Railway Company, and in other like proceedings, on the .part of the defendant herein, on appeals entitled Kobbe <em>v. </em>The Gilbert Elevated Railway Company, and Anderson v. The same. And that court has, in those cases, finally and authoritatively determined that the Rapid Transit Act is not obnoxious, in whole or in part, to the constitutional objections urged against its validity ; and that, under and by virtue of its charter and the provisions of that act, the defendant has good right and lawful authority to build, over the route provided for it by law, including the Sixth avenue, the railway whose construction is enjoined by the judgment now under review. It is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>therefore, obvious that the judgment appealed from cannot be sustained upon the ground upon which it was rendered, and that, unless other sufficient reasons for affirming it can be gathered from the pleadings, proofs and findings upon which it was based, it will now be the duty of the appellate branch of the court to direct its reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">On the part of the plaintiff and respondent, the Sixth Avenue Railroad Company, it is insisted that the case, as presented, conclusively shows that that company has property, rights and interests, both in its existing railroad and franchises, and also as incident or appurtenant to its lands abutting on the Sixth avenue, the beneficial enjoyment whereof will be' destroyed, impaired or disturbed by the construction and operation of the defendant\u2019s proposed railway; that such rights and interests are protected by the const!-. tutional prohibition against the appropriation of pri-, vate property to public use without just compensation; and that the ascertainment of the amount of such compensation, the appraisal of the damages incurred or sustained by reason of such destruction, injury, or disturbance, and the payment, tender, or offer of such compensation, when the amount thereof shall have been determined in the manner provided by law, are conditions precedent to the right of defendant to construct its proposed road; and, finally, that it is entitled, by reason of the threatened invasion of such rights and interests, to an injunction from a court of equity to restrain the construction of the defendant\u2019s road until such compensation shall have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It is obvious from a perusal of the opinion filed by the learned judge at special term, that the views therein expressed cover but a part of the case as it was presented at the trial. His determination that section 36 of the Rapid Transit Act was unconstitutional and void, rendered it, in his judgment,, unnecessary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>unadvisable to pursue Ms inquiries further, inasmuch as by so doing nothing would be gained toward practically determining the rights of the parties. He accordingly declined to consider or pass upon other \u2018 \u2018 grave and important questions\u201d involved, including those now presented to the consideration of the court. In view of this fact, and as the case has not been fully considered in all its aspects, we should, perhaps, under the authority of Mills <em>v. </em>Van Voorhis (20 <em>N. Y. </em>412), be justified in reversing the judgment, and directing a new trial, without inquiring whether, upon other grounds than that on which the judgment in its favor was rendered, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief thereby accorded to it. The plaintiff would thus have an opportunity to secure more explicit findings of fact in regard to the proprietary rights and interests with which it claims to be vested, and more specific and deliberate conclusions therefrom as to the legality or lawlessness of their threatened invasion. It would seem that such questions ought to be passed upon, deliberately, by the tribunal of first instance before they are presented for adjudication to the appellate branch of the court. We have, however, thought it not improper, at the urgent instance of the respondent\u2019s counsel, to inquire whether the judgment can be sustained, upon the propositions for which they now contend, and we have done so in the hope that the progress of the cause toward a complete and final adjudication might thus be accelerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In announcing the result of our deliberations it will be unnecessary to do more than state, briefly, the conclusions at which we have arrived, with the reasons therefor, without endeavoring to enforce them by illustration or argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">1. The case shows no such invasion and partial destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s road and franchise as entitles it to compensation, under the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>provision for the protection of private property proposed to be taken for public use in the exercise of the right of eminent domain. Compensation must doubtless be made for the appropriation and condemnation of corporate property and franchises, taken in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, equally as in case of the like appropriation or destruction of individual property and rights ; but it appears that no part of the plaintiff s road, as it has been constructed and now exists, will be in any wise disturbed or interfered with by the execution of the plan upon which it is proposed to erect the structure constituting the defendant\u2019 s elevated road. While it is found as a fact in the case, that the columns to be erected on either side of the plaintiff\u2019s tracks, will exclusively use and occupy spaces in the street, <em>to the use of which the plaintiff is entitled </em>for the purposes of its franchise, there is no finding, and no evidence, that any space actually appropriated by the plaintiff to such purposes, or which now is or ever has been in its actual use and occupancy therefor, will be invaded, encroached upon, or injuriously approximated by the defendant\u2019s columns, platforms, stairways, or any other parts or portions of its proposed structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">It cannot, therefore, be claimed that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the deprivation of any part of its road, considered as a physical and corporeal entity. The plaintiff\u2019s franchise entitles it to the use of every part of the entire space in the roadway of the Sixth avenue, to the extent requisite for the laying down thereon of a railroad with a double track ; but its franchise is not to be construed as appropriating to its future exclusive use and occupancy, spaces not requisite for that purpose, after it has already exhausted the privilege accorded to it, by appropriating so much of the roadway to the purposes of a double track as its exigencies actually require (N. Y. &amp; Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>lem R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Forty-second St., &amp;c. R. R. Co., 50 <em>Barb. </em>285, affi\u2019d <em>Id. </em>309).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The alleged appropriation or invasion of any part of the plaintiff\u2019s road is expressly negatived by the finding that the running of defendant\u2019s cars and engines upon the Sixth avenue, over plaintiff\u2019s road, in case the defendant\u2019s road were constructed, would not prevent the practical running of plaintiff\u2019s cars by horses, or materially increase the expense of such running.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The alleged invasion of its <em>franchise, </em>which consists in the right to lay a double track, and to run licensed cars thereon, does not appear, either in the facts found or in the evidence, inasmuch as there is nothing in either tending to show that ample space for laying a double track on the surface of the avenue is not, and will not. be, fully available to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the erection of the structure proposed by the defendant, or that the running of its cars thereon will be in any degree obstructed or interfered with.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The plaintiff, by virtue of its franchise, has no control over or interest in that part of the avenue not occupied by its tracks, or actually traversed by its cars (N. Y. &amp; Harlem R. R. <em>v. </em>Forty-second St. R. R., <em>ut supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s rights and powers, as a railroad corporation organized under the general law, must be exercised in conformity with, and in subordination to such constitutional legislative requirements and conditions as are, or may be, imposed by valid legislative enactment. Legislative authorization of a parallel and competitive railway involves no appropriation or deprivation of the vested rights and franchises of a railway already constructed, and is not an exercise of the right of eminent domain (Charles River Bridge Co. v. Warren Bridge Co., 11 <em>Pet. </em>420 ; Auburn Co. <em>v. </em>Doug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>las, 9 <em>N. Y. </em>444; Rensselaer R. R. <em>v. </em>Davis, 43 <em>Id. </em>137; Ft. Plain Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Smith, 30 <em>Id. </em>44). Any loss or damage sustained by reason of the competition of such lawfully authorized railway is <em>damnum absque </em>injuria, for which no compensation can be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Private property cannot be said to be taken for public use, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, merely because its value is impaired by the proximity of other property legitimately employed for the public use and benefit, under the sanction and by the authority of a legislative enactment. The finding, therefore, that the construction and operation, upon the Sixth avenue, of defendant\u2019s proposed railroad, would occasion special damage and injury to the plaintiff, is of no importance as bearing upon the question of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right to compensation for an interference, for the public benefit, with the beneficial use and enjoyment of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">If the proposed elevated railway, as was held at special term, was unauthorized by law and a public nuisance, such finding would be essential to the maintenance, by the plaintiff, off an action to enjoin its construction ; but, inasmuch as,it is not a public nuisance, and as the use to be made of so much of the avenue as it shall of necessity occupy is duly authorized by law, and is declared to be a public use, consistent with the uses for which such avenue is publicly held, this finding is immaterial. Such special damage results from no interference on the part of the defendant with either the franchise or tracks of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s railroad and its double track may remain on the surface of the avenue in the exact locality it has always occupied, without the displacement of a single rail or switch ; and the franchise of maintaining and operating it, and running licensed cars thereon, so far as appears from the evidence, may be beneficially used and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>joyed, hereafter as heretofore, without let or hindrance on the part of the defendant. The findings of the court at special term are <em>to </em>this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><em>2. </em>The plaintiff has no easement or property right in the roadway of Sixth avenue, incident or appurtenant to its ownership of lands abutting thereon, the beneficial use or enjoyment whereof will be destroyed, diminished, impaired, or interfered with by the construction or operation of the defendant\u2019s proposed railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It does not appear from the evidence that .any one, from or through whom the plaintiff\u2019s title to its adjacent lands is derived, was ever vested with title to the land now constituting Sixth avenue. It does appear that the title of the former owners of that land was absolutely and forever divested, and that the title thereto, in fee simple, was acquired by the corporation of the city of New York, under and by virtue of proceedings had for that purpose, pursuant to the act of 1813.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">A long array of judicial decisions is cited in support of the proposition that the city corporation is fully vested with an absolute title in fee simple to the lands comprised within the limits of streets and avenues opened and laid out pursuant to that act. Nor is that proposition controverted. The contention of the plaintiff is that, notwithstanding the provisions of the act of 1813, under the operation of which the fee of any street or avenue may be deemed to have been taken from the former owners thereof, and vested in the corporation, in trust, as provided thereby, the owners of property fronting on such street or avenue are entitled, by virtue of their ownership, and of the abutment of their property upon such street or avenue, to have the same maintained as a highway, and forever kept open for all the uses and purposes of a highway, unincumbered throughout its length and breadth, by any obstruction which shall prevent or impair the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>every inch of it, either by the public or by abutting owners, for all the public uses and common purposes of a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">And it is insisted, with great earnestness and force, that this right, to which, as an abutting owner upon Sixth avenue,- the plaintiff claims to be entitled, is, in its nature, a proprietary interest in land, a property interest in the maintenance of the aveiiue as a highway, by virtue whereof the plaintiff is entitled to compensation, in case of any infringement thereon, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The argument in support of' this position proceeds mainly upon the assumption, not warranted by the evidence in this case, that the land comprised within the limits of the avenue was taken from persons who were, also, at the time, owners of the land adjacent to and abutting on its exterior lines; and that the compensation awarded to such persons for the land taken consisted chiefly in the benefits and advantages acquired by them, as owners of the abutting lands, in having a broad highway opened in front of their remaining property, the use of which, as such, was forever secured by the trusts declared by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Whatever benefits and advantages the owners o\u00a3 adjacent lands acquired, by virtue of opening the avenue, was paid for by assessments charged thereon, whether such owners were or were not proprietors of the lands within the limits of the avenue. And the trusts declared by the act were as much for the benefit of adjoining owners who had no interest in the land taken, but who paid such assessments .in cash, as of those whose awards for damages, by reason of the condemnation of their lands within the lines of the avenue, proved the equivalent of assessments for bene-, fit imposed upon their lands adjacent to, but without such lines. In each case adjacent owners contributed their respective shares of the expenses incurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>effecting the improvement. But they acquired by such contribution no exclusive right or interest in the street or avenue, and no easement in the nature of a right of way over the same, other than that which is held and enjoyed by the public at large. Abutting owners, as such, have no special and peculiar interest in the enforcement of the trusts declared by the act. Those trusts were created and declared for the benefit of the public, and the people at large, acting through the legislature, are at liberty to determine in what manner they shall be carried into effect. The views expressed in the case of the Brooklyn Park Commissioners y. Armstrong (45 <em>N. Y. </em>245), commend themselves to our approval, and if sound they are conclusive against the claim of the plaintiff to compensation for the deprivation of any supposed property right in the avenue, existing as appurtenant to their lands abutting thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The like conclusion has, very recently, been adopted by one of the learned judges of the New York common pleas, in the case of Story v. New York Elevated Railroad Company (October, 1877), and the following cases, cited by him, seem to sustain fully the correctness of his decision: Lansing v. Smith, 4 <em>Wend. </em>9 ; Benedict v. Goit, 3 <em>Barb. </em>459 ; First Baptist Church v. Utica &amp; Schenectady R. R. Co., 6 <em>Id. </em>313 ; Drake <em>v. </em>Hudson R. R. Co., 7 <em>Id. </em>508; Radcliff v. Mayor of Brooklyn, 4 <em>N. Y. </em>195 ; Gould v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 6 <em>Id. </em>522; People <em>v. </em>Kerr, 37 <em>Barb. </em>357; S. C., 27 <em>N. Y. </em>193; Coster v. Mayor of Albany, 43 <em>Id. </em>414 ; Kellinger v. Forty-Second St. R. R. Co., 50 <em>Id. </em>206.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">But it is further urged, as a fatal objection to the defendant\u2019s claim of full right and authority to construct its road through Sixth avenue, that the route laid out for it by the commissioners appointed under the Rapid Transit Act is in direct violation of the implied prohibition contained in the fourth section of the act, with respect to crossing Broadway. The court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>appears seems to have determined, in the cases of Kobbe and Anderson, above cited, that the right of the defendant to proceed under the act with respect to any part or portion of its road, not directly affected by this implied prohibition, is clear and unquestionable ; that, if crossing Broadway is prohibited by the act, such crossing is excluded by the commissioners from the routes designated by them, inasmuch as they expressly exclude from such routes, any street or part thereof, the use of which for the purposes of an elevated railway is excluded by the act; and that such exclusion does not invalidate the authority conferred by the act with respect to the residue of the designated route. In so far as such residue coincides with the existing route of a railroad corporation, such corporation may build upon the route designated. The authority is at least co-extensive with the coincidence. If, therefore, the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction upon this ground, it would only extend to and operate upon such portions of the defendant\u2019s route as are included within the intersecting lines of Broadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">But the elements of interest and irreparable injury which are essential to the invocation of equitable interposition by injunction are wanting to any claim of the plaintiff with respect to merely that part of the defendant\u2019s route which intersects Broadway, and we do not understand counsel as claiming anything by virtue of this particular objection, unless it be held to invalidate the authority of the defendants with respect to the whole o\u00a3_Sixth avenue. We are of opinion that the judgment cannot be upheld either upon this or the other grounds urged in support of it. It must therefore be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. '</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Curtis, Ch.
