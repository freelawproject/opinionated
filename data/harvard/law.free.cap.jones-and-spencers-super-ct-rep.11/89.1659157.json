J. It has not been shown to me satisfactorily that this court has the power to order the payment of this award and grant this summary species of relief as sought for in this proceeding. During the interval of more than twenty-five years since the passage of the act, it is not shown to have ever in a single instance attempted to exercise such power. The constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of property <em>without due process of law'. </em>Private property cannot be taken from one person and delivered to another person or applied to the private use of another, except by a suit instituted and conducted in accordance with the prescribed course of procedure for determining the title to property. The institution and conduct of such a suit is what is meant by \u201c due process of law.\u201d The title to the property in question, this award of $1,560, is sought to be determined by a proceeding unknown to the common law. A conflicting claimant, and possibly the rightful owner of this sum, thus held, is liable to bp deprived of it without the advantage of a suit or proceeding where his rights can be passed upon by a jury or asserted on appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">Moreover, it is not shown that this mode of practice by petition and order is, as far as this court is concerned, authorized by the legislature (Taylor <em>v. </em>Porter, <em>Hill, </em>147; <em>In re </em>Dodd, <em>27 N. Y. </em>632).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The case here is different from what it may be in the supreme court, which is clothed with the jurisdiction of proceedings for opening and improving streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">Where the parties and the proceedings are before that court, and these questions arise in applications in their nature interlocutory and in respect to which there is no question of jurisdiction, this mode of remedy may exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">But this court, a stranger to this species of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>diction, cannot properly undertake to determine questions of title to property between private parties, except in accordance with such process of law as is known to the administration of justice, and which preserves to suitors the authorized and constitntional modes of asserting and protecting their rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">The application to the court, in this matter, must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">Thereupon an order was made dismissing the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">From this order said Bowes appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-8\"><em>William Marsh, </em>attorney, and <em>John D. MacGregor, </em>of counsel, for appellant, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ7\">\u2014I. The statute (<em>Laws of </em>1852, chap. 52, \u00a7 4) which authorizes the award, directs that when the title to it is \u201c disputed, it shall be lawful for the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of New York to pay \u2018the money \u2019 to the chamberlain ... to be secured, disposed of, and improved as the superior court shall direct.\u201d This language is clear and positive, free from obscurity or ambiguity, and being the language of the legislature, is ample to confer the jurisdiction asked for in this case. 1. It is not obnoxious to the constitutional inhibition that it deprives any one of property, without due process of law. The award is not \u2018 \u2018 property \u2019 \u2019 in the constitutional sense ; it is a mere gratuity returned by the State for the exercise of its right of eminent domain, and there are no precedents in the common law applicable to it. The same statute which gives the gratuity has a right to prescribe the modes of its payment. The case is analogous to a pension or bounty, granted by the government, which is governed by the act itself, and does not come within the ordinary laws of descent or distribution. It might as well be contended that the act is unconstitutional in respect to the assessments, because it deprives the party assessed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>his property without trial by jury. The constitutional provision has never been extended beyond rights which were known to the common law. 2. If any inference is to be derived from the fact that the provision was enacted twenty-five years ago, and that no attempt has ever been made to enforce it, it is quite as logical to say that during that period, in the repeated compilations of the laws relative to the city of Mew York, by the common council, by Judge Davis, Judge Hoffman, and others, this important provision has never before been questioned. The order should therefore be reversed, and the special term directed to hear the motion to confirm the report on the merits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">II. If, however, this court had no authority to determine the title to the award, it had jurisdiction to direct how it should be \u201c secured and improved.\u201d This is authority enough to enable the court to award costs against the petitioner when he has asked for relief which is refused. The petitioner Hatch comes voluntarily into court and brings the other parties here. He has submitted himself to its jurisdiction on him, so far as that jurisdiction may extend. This court certainly had some authority in this proceeding. It is a court of general jurisdiction in law and equity, and possesses the power to make a complete disposition of whatever proceeding is brought before it. This power embraces the right to impose costs upon the dismissal of a proceeding for want of jurisdiction against the party who has unwarrantably instituted it. \u2018 On dismissal of an action for want of jurisdiction to hear and determine it on its merits, the defendant is entitled to a judgment against the plaintiff for costs\u201d (McMahon v. Mutual Ben. Life Ins. Co., 3 <em>Bosw. 644, </em>approved; Kings v. Poole, 35 <em>Barb. </em>248; Brocket v. Bush, 18 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>337). The order should be amended by allowing the respondent his costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>James A. </em>Beering, attorney, and of counsel, for respondent, Hatch.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-5\"><em>Wm. O. </em>Whitney, corporation counsel, and <em>Arthur </em>Berry, of counsel, for The Mayor, &amp;c.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-6\">By the Court.\u2014Sanford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">\u2014If the provision of chapter 52, section 4, of the <em>Laws of </em>1852, which \u25a0 authorizes the payment by the corporation, to the chamberlain of the city of Hew York, of an award to unknown owners, <em>\u201cto be </em>secured, <em>disposed of and improved </em>as the superior court shall direct,\u201d can be construed as conferring jurisdiction upon this court, to determine the rights of adverse claimants to such award, and to direct the payment thereof to snch party as shall be adjudged entitled thereto, the statute-referred to is silent as to the mode in which such jurisdiction shall be exercised ; and we are not aware of any principle, authority, or precedent, upon which a proceeding for obtaining such an adjudication can be-summarily instituted by petition, or otherwise than, in the ordinary course of practice, by civil action. The objections to such a summary exercise of jurisdiction are sufficiently indicated in the opinion which accompanied the order appealed from. But it will be-observed that the words \u201c disposed of,\u201d as employed in the statute, and under which alone it can be insisted that the statute confers authority to direct payment to a claimant, are so connected with the words, <em>\u201cto </em>be secured\u201d and \u201cimproved,\u201d as to leave little doubt that the legislature intended to confine the action of this court under the statute, to such disposition of the money, as, in its discretion, may be proper, only so-long as the same remains in the hands of the chamberlain. If the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d had been used instead of the copulative \u201cand,\u201d there would be some ground for supposing that the disposition of the fund intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>might be deemed to include its withdrawal and payment ; but when the authority conferred is in terms confined to a direction as to the securing, disposing of, <em>and </em>improving the fund, the maxim, <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>seems applicable, and we must, therefore, construe the language as importing only a supervisory authority over the chamberlain, with respect to his custody, care, management and investment of the fund, and not as authorizing its withdrawal from his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On this ground, as well as on those suggested in the opinion of the learned chief justice, we think the court should decline to adjudicate upon the rights of claimants, in any such summary manner as is contemplated in this proceeding, and that the order appealed from should, accordingly, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
