The first exception, the benefit of which is claimed by appellant, is to the admission of the article published in No. 15 of The Dramatic News. (1.) The articles in suit, if untrue, were libelous <em>per se, </em>and in contemplation of law malicious ; and as no proof to negative the legal presumption of malice would have been allowed, so none should have been taken to prove malice, except such as would have been also admissible in aggravation of damages. Malice, as a part of the cause of action, being already conclusively presumed (See <em>Townshend on Slander and Libel, </em>3rd Edition, \u00a7 176 ; <em>Id. </em>132, note 1; Daly v. Byrne, 1 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>15, and note), the only effect of the proof excepted to was to enhance damages, and all the authorities are agreed that no subsequent publication can be used for this purpose (See Burson v. Edwards, 1 <em>Carter </em>[Ind.] 164; Forbes v. Myers, 8 <em>Blackf. [Ind.] </em>74; Mix v. Woodward, 12 <em>Conn. </em>292-3). (2.) The article admitted to prove malice, is itself libelous <em>per se </em>(See <em>Townshend on S. &amp; L. </em>3rd Ed. \u00a7 176), and to admit it in this action, is to render defendant liable to double punishment, as the same article may be made the basis of another action (Mix v. Woodward, 12 <em>Conn. </em>292-3; Frazier v. McCloskey, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>337; Root v. Lowndes, 6 <em>Hill, </em>518; Titus v. Sumner, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>266 ; Runkle v. Butler, 7 <em>Barb. </em>260). (3.) If this article was considered by the jury in aggravation of damages, still it would not bar a suit upon the article itself as a substantive cause of action (Campbell v. Butts, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>173).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">II. The next exceptions are to the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>articles published in Nos. 18 and 35 of The Dramatic News, respectively. (1.) The observations in Point I. also apply to these exceptions. (3.) These articles appear on their face to have been published after the commencement of the action, and on that ground alone were inadmissible (Frazier <em>v. </em>McCloskey, 60 N. <em>Y. </em>337).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">III. A witness was asked respecting the similarity of \u201cPique\u201d to \u201cHer Lord and Master.\u201d The questions were objected to and excluded, and defendant excepted. Prior to the offer of this proof, plaintiff had put in evidence, under defendant\u2019s objection and exception, and in proof of malice, an article published by defendant, charging this similarity. The questions were material, if this article was properly admitted, to prove the truth of the latter. We concede that this would be trying a collateral issue, but claim that the error was in opening .the door (See Point II.). As. the issue was raised by plaintiff, we had the right to meet it. It is the province of this court to determine which ruling was erroneous ; both cannot be correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">IV. The plaintiff introduced in evidence (objection and exception taken), an article from. the New York World, purporting to be a letter from \u201cEleanor Kirke, the reputed authoress of \u201cFlirtation.\u201d The letter, even if genuine, was immaterial; and if material, it was not proved to have been written by Mrs. Kirke ; and if it had been proved, it was incompetent testimony. The ground taken by the justice, that it formed a part of a letter to the defendant from plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, is insufficient. No such letter appears in evidence, and if offered, might itself have been made the subject of objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">The fact, which we concede, that Mrs. Kirke\u2019s letter in the \u201c World,\u201d was referred to in a letter from plaintiff to defendant, which defendant published as a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of the libelous article (the second cause of action), has no effect. That article (the letter from plaintiff\u2019s attorneys was a part of it) cannot be enlarged by extraneous matter, even though referred to in the article, except for purposes of explanation. No explanation was -necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">Y. The defendant excepted to the refusal to admit in evidence in mitigation of damages, and in explanation of an exhibit of plaintiff, an article published in No. 24 of The Dramatic News. For the purposes of this argument, it is not claimed that this article could have been properly admitted if the plaintiff had not previously introduced in evidence an article from No. 25 of The Dramatic News. The article offered by defendant and excluded by the court, was published prior to plaintiff\u2019s exhibit, and explains it. The two should have gone to the jury together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">YI. In sustaining the objection referred to in Point Y., the judge said, in the hearing of the jury: \u201cI could not admit that article in evidence. The idea that a man can one day blackmail another man in that way, and another day turn round and make another statement, will never do.\u201d This remark may be considered in two aspects\u2014(1) as in the nature of a charge to the jury ; and, (2) as improper influence exerted upon the jury during the trial of a cause. (1) If we consider the expression objected to as in the nature of a charge to the jury, it was erroneous (Vedder <em>v. </em>Fellows, 20 N. <em>Y. </em>126; Burke <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 16 <em>Albany L. J. </em>209). (2) If we consider the expression as an improper influence exerted on the jury in favor of a party pending a trial, we shall find the only questions to be: Whether any influence was exerted; whether it was improper; and, whethe. it was in favor of a party to the cause. Under the authorities this expression calls for a new trial (Thurman <em>v. </em>Chapman, 45 <em>Barb. </em>98 ; Green <em>v. </em>Selfair, 11 <em>How. Pr. </em>260 ; Cilley <em>v. </em>Bartlett, 19 N. <em>H. </em>324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>State v. Hascall, 6 <em>Id. </em>352; Perkins v. Knight, <em>Id. </em>474 ; Coster v. Merest, 3 <em>Broderip &amp; </em>Bingham,, 272; Knight v. Inhabitants of Freeport, 13 <em>Mass. </em>318). The case of Caldwell v. N. Y. Steamboat Co. (47 <em>N. Y. </em>398), is not in conflict. In that case the jury had returned for instructions, when the circuit judge remarked that he thought there was not much difficulty in arriving at a conclusion. As the circuit judge had expressed no opinion on the merits, and given no intimation of what his opinion was, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment. The remark did not tend to prejudice either party against the other. This is the reason the appellate court did not interfere, and this is the only difference between the cited case and the case at the bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">VII. When the defendant had rested (having examined two witnesses upon the bad character of plaintiff), counsel for plaintiff stated that he had sent for witnesses on the question of plaintiff\u2019s character, to which the court replied, in the hearing of the jury: \u201cSo far as regards the last witness, on the subject of character, you need not give yourself any \u2022 trouble about it.\u201d To this remark, exception was taken. Here, again, the court erroneously invaded the province of the jury. It would have been proper to explain to the jury the principles which should guide them in weighing the testimony of a witness ; but it was for the jury alone to determine what weight to give to the testimony. The court had no right to say to the jury, or in their hearing of a witness whose testimony was pertinent to the issue, as the testimony of the witness referred to was, that they should not consider it,\u2014and such was the clear import of the objectionable language (See authorities cited in Point VI.). It cannot be argued, to bring the case within some authorities, that this was a mere expression of opinion qualified by the judge in Ms charge when he explicitly left the question to the jury. He did leave to the jury, the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the defendant had proved bad character ; but he did not leave it to them to determine the credibility of this particular witness and the weight of his testimony. Taking the expression excepted to, together with the charge proper, the matter was left to the jury, in substance as follows ; You are to pay no attention whatever to the testimony of the witness Hallam, but may consider whether, upon the testimony of Brown, the other witness on character, the defendant has proved the plaintiff to be a man of bad character.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-5\">Olin, <em>Rives &amp; </em>Montgomery, attorneys, and <em>Stephen H. </em>Olin, of counsel, for respondent, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACc\">\u2014I. The subsequent publications were properly received. The evidence offered was of the same character in each case, and offered for the same purpose, and the objections and exceptions were, except the first, in the same words, <em>(a) </em>The objections and exceptions state no ground. \u201c The rule is settled beyond discussion that a general objection will be disregarded\u201d (Valton <em>v. </em>National Fund Life Assurance Co., 20 N. <em>Y. 35 </em>; Shaw <em>v. </em>Smith, 3 Keyes, 316 ; McDonald <em>v. </em>North, 47 <em>Barb. 532 </em>; Requa <em>v. </em>Holmes, 16 N. <em>Y. </em>201; Chester <em>v. </em>Dickerson, 54 <em>Id. </em>13 ; Levin <em>v. </em>Russell, 42 <em>Id. </em>255; Somerville <em>v. </em>Crook, 9 Hun, 668 ; Frazier <em>v. </em>McCloskey, 60 N. <em>Y. </em>339). <em>(b) </em>The evidence was properly received as proof of malice and in aggravation of damages. The rule is in England well settled that other publications by the defendants are admissible to show actual malice <em>(Folkard on Libel and </em>Slander, 459 ; Barnett <em>v. </em>Levy, 3 <em>H. L. </em>395, 414; Barnwell <em>v. </em>Adkins, 1 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>Gr. </em>807). And this although such publications are subsequent to the bringing of the action (Pearson <em>v. </em>Le Martin, 1 <em>Scott </em>N. <em>C. </em>607. See also Macleod <em>v. </em>Wakley, 3 <em>C. &amp; P. </em>311; <em>Folkard on Libel and </em>Slander, 460; Camfield <em>v. </em>Bird, 3 <em>Car. &amp; Kin. </em>56; Chambers <em>v. </em>Robinson, <em>Str. </em>691). Exactly in point is Chubb <em>v. </em>Westly (6 <em>C. &amp; P. </em>436). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>There is in this State some apparent conflict of decision (Bissell <em>v. </em>Elmore, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>564; Thorn <em>v. </em>Knapp, 42 <em>Id. </em>478). This case is distinguishable from Frazier <em>v. </em>McCloskey (60 <em>N. Y. </em>337). In that case the charge made by defendant to the admission of which exception was taken was actionable <em>per se. </em>In the case at bar the articles complained of, or at least parts of each of them, would not have sustained an action, since they were within the bounds of legitimate criticism, while they showed, nevertheless, hostility and malice toward the plaintiff (See also Thomas <em>v. </em>Croswell, 7 <em>Johns. </em>269 ; Defries <em>v. </em>Davis, 7 <em>Car. &amp; </em>Payne, 112). (c) The learned judge in his'charge directed the jury on this point properly and as requested by the defendant, thereby preventing the evidence admitted from having any improper effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\">II. The questions as to the resemblance between the play \u201c Pique\u201d and the novel \u201cHer Lord and Master\u201d were properly overruled. The three objections were properly sustained, (a) Ho authority exists for permitting a witness to state the resemblance between two writings, neither of which is in evidence, though both are within the reach of subpoena. The questions called for statements of the contents of writings not produced, and worse still, for the conclusion of the witness in regard to them. The rule heretofore followed in similar cases, is to cause the writings to be read in court (Reade v. Sweetzer, 6 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>9 ; Toole <em>v. </em>Young, <em>Corylon on Stage </em>Right, 84 ; Strauss <em>v. </em>Francis, 4 <em>Fost. &amp; F. </em>939, 1107). The rule allowing witnesses to compare absent objects has always been based by the courts on necessity (Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Germania Ins. Co., 5 <em>Hun, </em>90; De Witt v. Barly, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>342; Com. <em>v. </em>Sturtevant, 117 <em>Mass. </em>122). Ho such necessity exists here. (5) The witness was not competent to give the testimony asked for. He had never read \u201c Pique,\u201d and had seen it acted only once, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>a year and four months before the trial. It did not appear when he had read \u201cHer Lord and Master.\u201d Hence no foundation had been laid for his testimony, (c) The evidence sought was wholly immaterial <em>(Townshend on Libel, </em>3rd Ed. 679 ; Fitzgerald <em>v. </em>Stewart, 53 <em>Penn. </em>343; Fountain <em>v. </em>West, 23 <em>Iowa, </em>9 ; Andrews v. Vandeuser, 11 Johns. 38; Lamos <em>v. </em>Snell, 6 <em>N. H. </em>413; Daly <em>v. </em>Munro, <em>Sup. Ct. Sp. T </em>1876; Reade <em>v. </em>Conquest, 11 <em>C. B. (N, S.) </em>479 ; Boucicault <em>v. </em>Fox, 5 Blatchf. 87). It was inadmissible in mitigation of damages (Dolevin <em>v. </em>Wilder, 34 <em>How. Pr. </em>488). Nor could the evidence be offered to show the bad character of the plaintiff <em>(Townshend on Slander and Libel, </em>3rd Ed. 679, \u00a7 407; Inman <em>v. </em>Foster, 8 <em>Wend. </em>602; Kennedy <em>v. </em>Gifford, 19 <em>Id. </em>296 ; Mapes <em>v. </em>Weeks, 4 <em>Id. </em>659 ; Watson <em>v. </em>Bush, 5 <em>Cow. </em>499 ; Fitzgerald <em>v. </em>Stewart, 53 <em>Penn. </em>343 ; Fountain <em>v. </em>West, 23 <em>Iowa, </em>9 ; Andrews <em>v. </em>Vandeuzer, 11 <em>Johns. </em>38; 1 <em>Greenl. on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 55 ; Lamos <em>v. </em>Snell, 6 <em>N. H. </em>413). <em>id) </em>Bor was the evidence material to prove statements in the articles from defendant\u2019s paper not sued on. If the evidence had been offered for this purpose, counsel should have so stated on the trial, and cannot now take advantage of this ground (Cases cited, <em>infra).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-4\">III. The letter from the <em>World </em>was properly received. It had been read by the defendant, and had been referred to in the letter of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys written after the first, and printed in the second libelous article <em>(supra).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">IV. The article offered by defendant was properly excluded <em>(Townshend on Slander and Libel, </em>3rd Ed. 687, and cases cited; Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Olyphant, 2 <em>Hill, </em>510).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">Y. The remarks of the court were not subjects of exception. They were proper, and the charge prevented any possible injury from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">VI. The damages were not excessive (Fry <em>v. </em>Ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>nett, 9 <em>Abb. Pr. 45 </em>; Coleman <em>v. </em>Southwick, 9 <em>Johns. 45 </em>; Southwick <em>v. </em>Stevens, 10 <em>Id. </em>443 ; Knight <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 18 <em>Barb. </em>212).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b286-5\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOS\">\u2014The plaintiff, a theatrical manager, sues the defendant, the editor of a weekly publication, called <em>The New YorJc Dramatic News, </em>to recover damages for publishing two articles, charging him with committing a fraud by producing a play, and claiming to be the author of it, when in fact it was written by another person, and sent to him for examination, and wrongfully retained by him, and produced as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The answer is a general denial, except as to the publication of the first article. It also presents, as pleas in mitigation of damages, that one Wheeler had so informed the defendant, and that the publication was without malice, and that plaintiff\u2019s character as a dramatic author was bad, and that he plagiarized from the productions of other people ; also that the play in question was plagiarized without material change from Miss Florence Maryatt\u2019s novel, \u201cHer Lord and Master also that he was willing to publish any statement the defendant chose to make, with the same publicity that he had given to the alleged libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The plaintiff offered in evidence as proof of malice four articles, subsequently published in <em>The Dramatic News. </em>To three of these, the defendant simply objected, assigning no ground of exception, and excepted to the ruling of the court. To the other article, being the first offered, the defendant objected to plaintiff\u2019s putting in evidence, subsequent articles to those in the complaint, unless the plaintiffs would allow the entire matter contained in <em>The Dramatic News, </em>relating to the plaintiff, to go in evidence. The defendant now claims that the court erred in admitting these articles, because malice being already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>conclusively presumed, their only effect was to enhance damages, for which no subsequent publication could be used, and further, that the articles being <em>per se </em>libelous, that to admit them in this action is to render the defendant liable to double punishment, as the same articles may be the basis of another action.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It was but just to the judge before whom the trial was being conducted, that these grounds of objection should have been stated to him, so that his attention would have been specifically directed to the reasons for the defendant\u2019s objections. If the defendant elected not to pursue this course, when he made these objections at the trial, where there was an opportunity of meeting them, or obviating them, he is too late in first assigning his grounds^ before the appellate court (Levin <em>v. </em>Russel, 42 <em>N. Y. </em>255; Chester <em>v. </em>Dickerson, 54 <em>Id. </em>13).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The defendant excepts to the rulings of the court, sustaining the objections of the plaintiff to the questions addressed to the defendant, asking him if he can state the differences between the plot of \u201cPique\u201d the play, and the plot of the novel \u201cHer Lord and Master,\u201d and if there is any difference, except in names, between the characters in the two, and if the situations and incidents are not substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">This evidence sought to be introduced was immaterial. The plaintiff had a right to dramatize the novel, and such dramatization became his property, though there appeared in it substantial similarity in plot, situations and incidents, to the novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">If the defendant had been competent, and had given testimony to this effect, it would not have established anything either relevant to the issue or in mitigation of damages, and it was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The defendant offered in evidence a statement, published in <em>The Dramatie News, </em>after the commencement of this action. If the statement had been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>withdrawal of the charges made, and had been intended as some reparation for the injury done, it would have been admissible in mitigation of damages. But the statement discloses <em>no </em>such intention on the part of the defendant, and the exclusion of it by the court is in accordance with the views expressed by Ch. J. Nelson in Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Oliphant (2 <em>Hill, </em>516). In sustaining the objection of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the judge said, in the presence of the jury : - \u201cI could not admit that article in evidence. The idea that a man can one day blackmail another man in that way, and . another day turn round and make another statement, wall never do.\u201d The defendant excepted to this remark, and claims that it is to be considered as a charge to the jury, or as improper influence exerted upon them during the trial of a cause. It is clearly no part of a charge to the jury, and appears to have been called out by something stated by counsel, but which is not contained in the printed case. There is nothing in the pleadings to which the term \u201cblackmailing\u201d is relevant, and it may have referred to some hypothetical statement made by counsel. If the defendant was prejudiced by this observation of the court in sustaining the objection after a discussion between counsel, the case should disclose in what way, or in what connection it was called forth, so that the appellate court can- see wherein, if at all, he was injured by its utterance in the presence of the jury. In determining what is admissible as evidence, both the. court and counsel, in their consideration and discussion of questions, are uncontrolled by the presence of the jury, who are in no respect parties to the matter. The defendant, perhaps, with greater reason could complain that the reading of the not very mild language of Ch. J. Nelson, in the analogous case above cited, if it had been done at the time, exerted an improper influence upon the jury. In the charge that was made to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>jury, there is nothing in this behalf stated unfairly by the court, or objected to by the defendant. To select a remark by the court to counsel, in the course of passing upon a question as to the admissibility of evidence ; and then, without connecting it with the issue, but in its isolated form, to claim that there may be a surmise based upon it that influenced the jury, is an insufficient reason for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The defendant excepted to another remark of the court which was made during the progress of the trial, not only in the presence, as in the preceding instance, but in the hearing of the jury. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that he had sent for witnesses on the question of the plaintiff\u2019s character, to which the court replied, \u201c So far as regards the last witness on the subject of character, you need not give yourself any trouble about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">What has been said in the preceding paragraph applies, to some extent, to this. This remark was addressed to counsel, and is claimed by the defendant to be equivalent to directing the jury to disregard the testimony of this witness. The case shows that the memory of the witness referred to failed so much on his cross-examination, that what was said to the counsel by the court in reply, must have been quite apparent to the jury, whether they heard this conversation or not. The charge in respect to this witness was of a character to prevent any injury from the remark, and in this respect appears not to have been excepted to by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">There is no valid exception to the charge. The court charged all the defendant\u2019s requests but one, and when the court declined to charge that, no exception was then taken. At the close of the defendant\u2019s requests to charge, which were some ten in number, and after his exceptions to the charge, the defendant stated: \u201cI also except to your Honor\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>charge our requests.\u201d It is said by Allen, J., in Ayrault <em>v. </em>Pacific Bank (47 <em>N. Y. </em>476), that the court of appeals had uniformly held that exceptions in this form present no question for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The question whether the damages given are not excessive, is one that is not easily determined. But after such consideration as I have been able to give it, and in view of the fact that the publications were in a theatrical journal, circulating especially among those upon whom the plaintiff relied for his reputation and his business, and were of a character to injure him among them, I cannot say that the jury, after a full hearing of the testimony, were not the best judges of the amount of damages that should have been awarded to the plaintiff, or that they transcended the limits of a proper discretion in their verdict. The publications complained of by the plaintiff exceed the limits of just criticism. To be wrongfully held up to the public as the perpetrator of a literary fraud, and as wrong - fully retaining and using the production of another, is a grave accusation. The wrong and the injustice are not easily measured pecuniarily. Nor can it be entirely overlooked, that where the courts fail to afford adequate redress, the public peace is liable-to be disturbed by the acts of the sufferer, seeking violently to redress his wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The judgment and orders appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Sanford and Freedman, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
