Plaintiff and her husband had for many years prior to this resided, and carried on business, at Paradara, on the Island of Cuba; and these deposits were made while they were on a temporary visit to this country. Shortly after making the deposits they returned to their residence on the Island of Cuba, and resumed their business there. On March 4, 1871, plaintiff\u2019s husband died at Paradara.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">On May 81, 1872, plaintiff demanded of defendant the said two deposits, and the interest thereon. Defendant refused to pay, on the ground, that it had already, on May 29, 1869, paid the same to one Isabella McNeil, upon the faith of a certain paper purporting to be letters of administration, issued on 2nd day of April, 1869, by the surrogate of the county of New York, to said Isabella McNeil, upon the goods, chattels, &amp;c., of the plaintiff. Such paper recited that plaintiff departed this life intestate, at or immediately previous to her death an inhabitant of the county of New York, by means whereof the ordering and granting of let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ters of administration, etc., appertained to the surrogate of the county of New York; but did not recite that the surrogate had made inquiry as to the death of the plaintiff, and had determined that she was deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\">The case was tried once before, and plaintiff had judgment, the court, at special term, holding that the surrogate at common law had no jurisdiction to grant letters of administration on the estate of a person in being, and that the statutes of this State had not conferred such jurisdiction ; that the letters issued in the case were consequently void; and that, therefore, the fact of payment to the' person named in them as administratrix did not stand in the way of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The general term affirmed this decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">On appeal to the court of appeals, the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered (63 <em>If. Y. </em>460); that court holding that jurisdiction depended, not on death in fact, but upon a judicial determination by the surrogate, upon a judicial inquiry had before him, that death had occurred ; and that, from the evidence as it stood in the then appeal book, it appeared that the surrogate had made such judicial determination as to the death of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">On the re-trial evidence (which is particularly mentioned in the opinion), was given to the effect that the surrogate had made no such judicial determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint was dismissed on the retrial, and an appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-9\"><em>Culver &amp; </em>Wright, attorneys, and <em>S. Jones, </em>of counsel for appellant, among other things, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az\"><em>\u2014First. </em>We presume it is not open to argue before this tribunal any of the questions which have been passed on by the court of appeals in this case; we do not, however, waive the points heretofore presented, but for ulterior purposes insist on them. Those points briefly are: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>That at common law the surrogate had no jurisdiction over the estate of a person in being ; and consequently the letters of administration issued in this case were wholly void and did not stand in the way of plaintiff\u2019s recovery. (2) That neither section 26, art. 2, title 2, chap. 6, part 2, <em>M. </em>/S'., nor any other law or act passed by the legislature of the State, or any proceeding had thereunder, gave, granted or vested in the surrogate any jurisdiction to grant letters of administration on the estate of a person in being, and that the surrogate did not and could not by any proceedings under any law or act of the said legislature, obtain j urisdiction to grant letters of administration on the estate of a person in being. (3) That any act or law passed by said legislature, assuming by its own force or by proceedings had thereunder to give the surrogate jurisdiction to grant letters of administration on the estate of a person in being, is unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">Second.\u2014I. If the surrogate had no jurisdiction to issue the letters in question, they are wholly void, and a payment upon them does not stand in the way of plaintiff\u2019s recovery. (1) This was determined by the general term of this court, and is not denied by the court of appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">II. The court of appeals has, however, decided that a surrogate has jurisdiction to issue letters upon a judicial determination made by him, upon a judicial inquiry before him, that death has occurred; in other words, that the jurisdiction of the surrogate depends, not on death in fact, but on his judicial determination, made in a judicial inquiry before him, that death has occurred. \u2022 (1.) It follows that if no judicial inquiry has been had before the surrogate, and no judicial determination of death been made by him, the fact, on which the jurisdiction to issue letters depends, is wanting, and the letters are without jurisdiction and void, <em>(a) </em>It will not do to say that death has in fact occurred, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>jurisdiction under the court of appeals decision does not rest on that fact. (&amp;) It will not do to say that sufficient facts, circumstances and evidence exist upon which the surrogate might determine in favor of death ; because the jurisdiction does not depend upon the existence of such facts, circumstances and evidence, but upon the surrogate\u2019s judicial determination upon them, (c) It will not do to say that evidence of death satisfactory to a clerk in the surrogate\u2019s office was presented to such clerk, and that such clerk acted thereon; because it is the judicial determination of the surrogate which is required\u2014not that of a mere clerk. The power to be exercised is a judicial power, and cannot be delegated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\">Third.\u2014Defendant\u2019s counsel in the court below claimed that the action and proceedings had before the clerk were a sufficient compliance with the statute, and by virtue thereof there was jurisdiction to issue the letters ; and in support of the proposition he relied on <em>Laws of </em>1850, ch. 201; Matter of Will of Daniel Clark, 1 Tucker, 119.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">I. As to the law of 1850 : it provides that the assistants appointed by the surrogate \u201c shall have power to administer and certify oaths and affirmations in all cases in which said surrogate is authorized to administer the same;\u201d then provision is made for the collection of fees for the services performed under the act and the payment thereof into the treasury of the city and county of New York. (1) The authority to administer oaths and affirmations does not include or confer authority to make a judicial inquiry or render a judicial determination. (2) By section 62 of chap. 460 of the <em>Laws of </em>1837, a surrogate was authorized to administer oaths in all cases where it might be necessary in the exercise of the powers and duties of such surrogate. <em>(a) </em>The power given to clerks by the law of 1850 is that given to the .surrogates by the act of 1837. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>mere ministerial power. (6) The surrogate is a constitutional officer and to be elected <em>(Laws </em>1847, vol. 2, \u00a7 14).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\">II. As to the case of Daniel Clark, 1 Tucker, 119. The surrogate in this case regards the functions which the act of 1850 authorizes the clerk to perform, as subsidiary, ministerial functions, and as intended to relieve the surrogate <em>from the detail of mere clerical duty, {a) </em>He intimates a doubt whether without this act the surrogate could delegate <em>even ministerial functions.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">Fourth.\u2014I. The want of a jurisdictional fact may always be shown to avoid a judgment, decree or other judicial or ministerial proceeding, even though the existence of such jurisdictional fact may be recited in the record (Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks, 7 <em>N. Y. Superior Court, </em>193 to 203, and cases there cited).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">II. In the court below defendant claimed that want of jurisdiction could not be shown, and relied on Martin <em>v. </em>Hood, 8 <em>Johns. </em>45. 1. This case, so far as it tends to hold that want of jurisdiction may not be shown against recitals in the records, is clearly overruled by Bigelow <em>v. </em>Stearns, 19 <em>Johns. </em>33; Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks, <em>supra, </em>and cases there cited. 2. This case, however, does not sustain the proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">III. But we are not compelled in this case to invoke the doctrine that recitals in a record of jurisdictional facts may be disproved. 1. The surrogate\u2019s court is one of special and limited jurisdiction, and a party relying on any of its judgments, decrees or orders must show jurisdiction. Parol or other evidence outside of the record may be adduced in support of jurisdiction, and recitals in the record of jurisdictional facts are <em>prima facie </em>evidence thereof (see cases <em>supra). </em>2. The jurisdictional fact in this case (under the decision of the court of appeals) is a judicial inquiry had before, and a judicial determination made by, the surro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>gate. 1. Defendant introduced no proof even tending to show this. 2. There is no recital of this fact in any record produced on the trial. 1. The letters of administration merely recite that Martha Devine departed this life intestate, <em>(a) </em>The court of appeals, however, has determined that jurisdiction does not depend on the fact of death. 2. Neither the letters of administration nor any other record contain a recital that the surrogate, on an inquiry had before him, had determined that Martha Devine had departed this life intestate, (a) The court of appeals has decided that the jurisdiction to issue letters depends on such a determination by the surrogate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-4\"><em>J. W. C. Leveridge, </em>attorney, and <em>S. P. Nash, </em>of counsel, for respondent, urged as follows :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A69\">\u2014This is a second trial of the case decided by the court of appeals in 63 <em>N. Y. </em>460. The only new facts proved on the second trial, are that the proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s, office, which the court of appeals held were a protection to the defendant paying over the money claimed under them, were had before the surrogate\u2019s clerk and not before the surrogate himself. These facts cannot change the result. 1. The reason of the rule which confers protection upon parties obeying the judgments and process of courts of justice, is based on public policy. The protection does not depend upon the proper performance of his duties by the judicial officer, after he has acquired jurisdiction, and the court of appeals has held that the presentation of a proper application confers the jurisdiction. That t\u00edie surrogate did not in person pass upon the application, does not impair the protection of a third person acting on the faith of the letters issued under the hand and seal of the surrogate, and all evidence on this subject should have been excluded (Savacoal v. Bougton, 5 <em>Wend. </em>170; Stanton <em>v. </em>Schell, 3 <em>Sandf. </em>323 ; Chegaray <em>v. </em>Jenkins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>1 <em>Seld. </em>376). 2. The surrogate\u2019s clerk has by statute powers which, when coupled with the surrogate\u2019s own signature and seal, make the entire act that of the surrogate (Matter of Daniel Clarke, 1 Tucker, 119). The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-4\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHv\">\u2014The court of appeals has held that the surrogate, in granting lettters upon the estate of the plaintiff, who was not then dead, acted judicially ; that under the statutes of thM State, he had'jurisdiction to issue the letters upon a judicial inquiry and determination by him, that death had occurred; and hence, that the letters so granted protected the defendant as an innocent third party as to the amount paid to the administratrix on the faith of the letters, though they were, in fact, granted on false evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">This determination was made upon the construction of the statutes of this State regulating the jurisdiction and proceedings of surrogates\u2019 courts, and it was held, that the said statutes furnish a complete system ; that in enacting the same, the legislature intended to confer upon surrogates\u2019 courts sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject of granting letters of administration, and as part of that jurisdiction to determine, upon sufficient evidence, the facts upon which their action must rest; that, if the case be a proper one, the surrogate must act and issue letters ; and that thereupon the letters so issued are conclusive evidence of the authority of the administrator, until reversed on appeal or revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The conclusion was reached by a vote of four to three, and in the prevailing opinion of Earl, J., it was conceded that the question decided was not free from doubt; that a decision either way would be confronted with some authority, and meet with some logical difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>As far as it goes, the decision, rests upon the assumption that there was a judicial inquiry into, and determination of, the question of death, by the surrogate, in due course of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">It has now been shown, however, and the court below has found as facts, that the'petition was presented, not to the surrogate, but to the clerk in the office of the surrogate, who was entrusted by the latter with the duty of entertaining such applications ; that said clerk drew up the petition, swore the applicant thereto, passed upon the sufficiency of the evidence presented, and thereupon either himself filled up, or caused another clerk to fill up, a printed blank form of letters of administration <em>signed in \"blank </em>by the then surrogate of the city and county of Hew York ; that upon said blank being filled up, said first-named clerk attached thereto the seal of said surrogate\u2019s court, and delivered the same to the applicant upon the execution by her of the bond required by statute ; and that the then surrogate of the county of Hew York neither saw the applicant, nor the petition, nor the letters of administration, after the same had been filled out as aforesaid, and gave no instructions in respect to or regarding the issuing of the said letters. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Upon these facts and findings, which were not before the court of appeals, and plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions to the main conclusions of law found by the learned judge below, two important questions arise,\u2014namely, first, as to the competency of the testimony establishing these facts, and secondly, as to the effect to be given to the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>As to the competency: </em>The court of appeals having held that the jurisdiction to issue letters in this case depended, not on death in fact, but on the judicial determination of the surrogate, made after a judicial inquiry, that death had occurred, it seems to follow as a logical and necessary conclusion, that if there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>no such judicial inquiry and determination, the fact on which the jurisdiction to issue the letters depends, is wanting, and the letters are without jurisdiction, and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Such want of jurisdiction may be shown by proof outside of the record, for no court, no matter how general its jurisdiction may be, which proceeds without jurisdiction in a particular case, can make a valid record, or confer any rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks, 6 <em>Robt. </em>166, in which case the authorities on this point were examined by this court with great particularity, the rule was stated as follows : \u201cWant of jurisdiction will render void the judgment of any court, whether it be of superior or inferior, of general, limited or local jurisdiction, or of record <em>or </em>not; and the bare recital of jurisdictional facts in the record of a judgment of any court, whether superior or inferior, of general or limited jurisdiction, is not conclusive, but only <em>primafacie </em>evidence of the facts recited; and the party against whom a judgment is offered, is not, by the bare fact of such recitals, estopped from showing, by affirmative facts, that they were untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In Boiler v. The Mayor, &amp;c., 40 <em>N. Y. Superior Ct. </em>523, this court was called upon to, and did, re- \u2022 examine the rule thus laid down, in the light of the criticism which Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks had undergone in the court of appeals in the case at bar, and the conclusion was reached that, though the soundness of the decision was impugned in so far as it proceeded upon the assumption that the habitation of a testator at the time of his death was a jurisdictional fact, which, if erroneously decided by the surrogate in admitting a will to probate, might be collaterally attacked,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ness of the rule itself, as above stated, was not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">It having therefore been already decided that there is nothing in the language of the court of appeals in the case at bar inconsistent with the general doctrine of Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks, the case last referred to must be considered as a controlling authority in favor of the competency of the testimony adduced by the plaintiff in opposition to the letters relied upon by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><em>As to the effect of the testimony: </em>Surrogates\u2019 courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>are courts of limited and special jurisdiction, and yet their jurisdiction to grant administration upon the estates of deceased persons is general and exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">With respect to courts having general jurisdiction, the intendment of law is always in favor of the validity of their judgments. In regard to tribunals of limited and special jurisdiction there is no such intendment, and every fact necessary to uphold their jurisdiction must either appear by the record, or be affirmatively shown by evidence <em>aliunde. </em>In either case the bare recital of jurisdictional facts in the record is not conclusive, but only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In the present case the defendant introduced no proof outside of the record relied upon showing a judicial inquiry and judicial determination, and of the record the letters of administration simply recite the fact that Martha Divine departed this life intestate, which is not enough, as it has been determined that jurisdiction does not depend upon the existence of that fact, but upon a judicial determination of it made in the course of judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">This record and all presumptions properly arising therefrom, if any, the plaintiff meets with proof showing that whatever inquiry was made, was made, not by the judicial officer clothed with the powers of the surrogate, but by his clerk ; that whatever determination was had, was made in the like manner ; and that all this was done by said clerk, in the absence of the surrogate and without consultation with or instructions from him so far as this particular case is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Even if it be claimed, therefore, that as regards the letters in question the same presumption attaches as to jurisdiction and regularity that attaches in any other case to the judgment record of a court of original and general jurisdiction,\u2014and this is the theory most favorable to the defendant,\u2014the presumption,. it seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>me, has been completely destroyed by affirmative and uncontradicted testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">I concede that if the proof simply showed an erroneous or negligent or improper performance by the surrogate of his duty after he had acquired jurisdiction, the letters so issued would be good i\u00f1 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">But the proof goes beyond that. It shows that he did not act judicially at all; that he refused to act in such cases ; that he considered the examination of the petition a mere ministerial function, and that he delegated that function to the clerk. Such delegation might not be open to legal objection, if the jurisdiction of the surrogate in issuing letters depended, as has been heretofore supposed, on the fact of death. But as the court of appeals has determined that the surrogate must act judicially, and that his jurisdiction in issuing letters depends upon a judicial determination to be made by him in the course of a judicial inquiry, the delegation of power referred to cannot be sustained, any more than the practice could be sustained, if the judges of a court of original and general jurisdiction were to authorize the clerk of their court, upon presentation of applications sufficient in form, to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence produced, and the sureties offered, and if deemed sufficient, to fill up and issue orders of arrest, injunction, appointment of Receivers, and warrants of attachment,'Kyrhich had been previously signed by them in blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Judicial power cannot be delegated, because it involves the exercise of judgment and discretion (Powell <em>v. </em>Tuttle, 3 <em>Comst. </em>396.; Keeler <em>v. </em>Frost, <em>22 Barb. </em>400)<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">True, a <em>rrimisterial </em>officer is protected in the execution of process whether the same issue from a court of limited or general jurisdiction, if the subject-matter of the suit is within that jurisdiction, and nothing appears upon the face of the process to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>person was not also within it, although the court have not, in fact, jurisdiction in the case (Savacool v. Boughton, 5 <em>Wend. </em>171). And in Chegaray v. Jenkins (1 <em>Seld. </em>376), this principle was extended to a constable acting under a warrant in due form, issued by the receiver of taxes of the city of New York, and directing the collection of a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">But this protection is confined strictly to ministerial officers who have no discretion, but are bound by law to execute the process entrusted to them. As to all other parties, the record, and the process issued thereon, may be impeached for want of jurisdiction. In Stanton <em>v. </em>Schell (3 <em>Sandf. </em>323), cited by defendant\u2019 s counsel, the judge had acquired jurisdiction under the non-imprisonment act, and hence it was held that subsequent errors of judgment did not oust him of his jurisdiction, nor subject him or the applicant to an action of trespass or false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It is insisted, however, that the proceedings before, and the action by the clerk in question, coupled with the surrogate\u2019s own signature and seal, were a sufficient compliance with the statute; and in support of this proposition reference is made to ch. 201 of <em>Laws of </em>1850. By that statute power is conferred upon the assistants appointed by the surrogate of the city and- county of New York, to administer and certify oaths and affirmations in all cases in which said surrogate is authorized to administer the same. By \u00a7 62 of ch. 460 of the <em>Laws of </em>1837 a surrogate was authorized to administer oaths in all cases where it might be necessary in the .exercise of the powers and duties of such surrogate, and the power given to the assistants or clerks named in the statute of 1850 is that given to the surrogates by the act of 1837. It is a mere ministerial power, which was conferred for the purpose of relieving the surrogate of the city and county of New York from the detail of mere clerical duty, and that is the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of it as construed by the surrogate himself in the case of Daniel Clarke (1 <em>Tucker, </em>119). But it does not include or confer authority to make a judicial inquiry or render a judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The surrogate of the city and county of \u00a1New York is a constitutional officer, and to be elected. No provision of law exists which enables him to delegate his judicial functions to subordinates, nor can any existing statute be construed to work that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The case as now presented differs from that presented to the court of appeals in the particulars herein discussed, and the judgment appealed from cannot be sustained upon the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Sanford, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\"> The criticism here alluded to is to found in Judge Earl\u2019s opinion (63 N. Y. 469), and is as follows: \u201cIn Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks (6 <em>Robertson\u2019s Sup. Ct. R.), </em>there is a learned discussion of the question of the jurisdiction of courts, and it was there held that if a surrogate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>admitted to probate a will of a testator, not at the time of his death an inhabitant of his county, he acted without jurisdiction, and that his proceeding was void and could be attacked collaterally. I believe the decision to be unsound in this respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">It may be suggested that neither the reasoning which led the learned judge to the conclusion he arrived in the case then under consideration by him, nor the principle on which the decision of that case rests, affords ground for the criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The case of Roderigas turned upon and was decided wholly on the effect of' section 26, art. 2, title 2, chap. 6, part 2, R. S., which the court held invested the surrogate with power to judicially inquire and examine as to the death of any person upon whose estate letters of administration were applied for, and to judicially determine as to such death; and that his judicial determination of death was conclusive, even though the fact were otherwise. The court, agreed that were it not for this section and the effect given it, jurisdiction would depend on <em>death in fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">This section of the R. S. has no application to the proof of wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The provision concerning the proof of wills is to be found in chapter 460 of the Laws of 1837, at p. 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Neither in that chapter nor in any other statute, is there any section or provision requiring the surrogate to inquire into the habitancy of the testator, or imposing on him any duty to make such inquiry, or authorizing or requiring him either to examine witnesses on that subject or to subpoena, or authorizing or requiring him to make any determination on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">It would seem that a decision and reasoning founded on said section 26 of the R. S. cannot affect or impugn a decision made in a case to which that section has no application, and as to which there is no similar provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Note.\u2014This case having attracted so much attention in legal circles, and the decision of the court of appeals having' been reviewed in the <em>American Law </em>Review, vol. 10, No. 4, p. 787, and also in the <em>American Law Register, N. S., </em>vol. 15, p. 312, it has been deemed proper to publish with the foregoing general term opinion, the special term opinion rendered on the first trial of the cause, which was concurred in by the general term, it not having been <em>heretofore </em>published.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The following is the opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u201cSpeer, J.\u2014The question in the case is, Had the surrogate jurisdiction to grant ,the letters of administration which protect the defendants in making the payments to Isabella McNeil ? The only justification for doing so as claimed is, that they paid upon the strength of the letters issued by the surrogate of the city and county of New York. <em>It </em>must be conceded if he had no jurisdiction it would be no protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">\u20181 The defendants claim through their counsel, in order to sustain the surrogate\u2019s jurisdiction for their protection, chiefly upon the ground that the State appoints, by judicial authority, certain persons, who upon the death of an' individual, administer upon his personal property, and although the State does not profess to administer it unless the individual be in fact dead, there are many cases where the question of death, like other questions of fact, is difficult of ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tainment, and that in such cases it is within the legitimate province of the State, on presumptive proof of death, to authorize administration on his estate, establish, tribunals to take such proof, providing safeguards sufficient to make the sanction of its judicial authority a protection to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u201cThey claim that the State of New York has done this, and the cases at bar are to be determined by its statutory law alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u201cSection 26, article 2, title 2, ch. 6, vol. 2, <em>R. S. (Edmonds' Ed.) </em>p. 75, is relied on. \u2018 Before any letters of administration shall be granted on the estate of any person who shall have died intestate, the fact of such person dying intestate shall be proved to the satisfaction of the surrogate, who shall examine the persons applying for such letters on oath touching the time, place, and manner of'the death, and whether or not the party dying left any will; and he may also in like manner examine any other person, and may compel such person to attend as a witness for that purpose.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u201cAgain, it is provided that \u2018the letters testamentary and of administration and letters appointing a collector, granted by any officer having jurisdiction, shall be conclusive evidence of the authority of the persons to whom the same may be granted, until the same shall toe reversed on appeal, or revoked as in the chapter provided \u2019 (2 <em>R. S. </em>80, \u00a7 56).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u201cIn section 26 it is assumed by the very letter of the statute, that the proceedings take place only when \u2018 any person shall have died intestate, \u2019 the fact of such person dying intestate shall be proved to the satisfaction of the surrogate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u201cThe court is not authorized to act except when the fact exists that the person shall have died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u201cThe court is set in motion by the admitted jurisdiction that such person has died intestate, and the proceedings are carried forward only upon that assumption. So in section 56, the proviso is that certain letters issued by an officer having jurisdiction shall be conclusive, &amp;c. This the defendant\u2019s counsel says means 1 granted by the proper officer, and on proper proceedings taken before him, and if it means that the letters are a protection only in case the proof before the surrogate was conclusive, the section is useless.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u201cWith great respect I think the learned counsel assumes the premises for the sake of his deduction\u2014jurisdiction here is conceded, and therefore the surrogate is authorized to issue certain letters, but it does not follow that he has authority to issue them under all circumstances, and much less where he has not the acquired jurisdiction. Nor, in logical terms, can the section be said to be useless, for the court acting within the sphere of its original authority, the letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>issued by an officer acting under such authority should be taken r.s conclusive, both as a useful and orderly proceeding on well settled principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u201cSection 47, 2 R. S. 70, is claimed to cover the whole ground assumed by the defendants. It is in the words following : \u2018 All sales made in good faith, and all lawful acts done either by administrators before notice of a will, or by executor's or administrators who may be removed or superseded, or who may become incapable, shall remain valid and shall not be impeached on any will afterwards appearing, or by any subsequent revocation or superseding of the authority of such executors or administrators.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u201c This section, like all others on this subject, is founded upon the fact that the surrogate shall and must have jurisdiction over the subject matter before he could deliberate on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u20181 The proper surrogate obtains control over the personal estate of deceased persons only upon their death. y</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u2018 \u2018 He acts upon the estate, either through administrators according to the statute of distributions, or through executors according to the provisions of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u201c Having acquired jurisdiction by the event of death, the \"question whether there was a will or not as determining the mode of distribution, falls within his province, and his action either in granting letters of administration or probating a will, as the case may be, cannot be attacked collaterally. By the actual facts of death and inhabitancy, the surrogate acquires jurisdiction over the whole subject; and his actionin granting letters of administration cannot be attacked for want of jurisdiction. In case of a will being subsequently proven, relief tiould be obtained by application to the surrogate himself for <em>a </em>revocation of the letters of administration, in which case, as the grant of letters of administration was avoidable only, the acts done under it would be valid. In Prosser v. Wanger, 1 <em>Com. B. N. S. </em>289, both the death of the party and the granting the letters by the proper officer was conceded. See also Sheldon v. Wright, 5 <em>N. Y. </em>497, as to the necessary result of the principles there laid down. The statute of 1870, 1 <em>Laws of </em>1870, p. 826, is also referred to as sustaining defendant\u2019s position. \"He claims that it being remedial it may well retroact.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u201c The answer to this is, that \u2018All lawful orders and decrees in proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s court . . . and the objection of want of jurisdiction, except by appeal in the manner prescribed by statute, &amp;c.,\u2019 relate only to the case where such original jurisdiction has been acquired, and is to be construed in harmony with other statutes on the subject (1 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>p. 524, 525, 10 Ed.) I hope to show pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>sently it is not in the power of the legislature to confer jurisdiction on a surrogate over the estates of a living person.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u201cIn the case at bar the parties not being dead, all the proceedings were totally void, and consequently the payment to an executor or administrator appointed where the supposed testator or intestate Is alive, would not be a discharge of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u201cI think it may well be conceded that upon evidence being furnished, according to the rules and principles of evidence and the law, establishing the fact of death and of intestacy, the surrogate would be bound to Issue letters, but this is done at the peril of the applicant in case death should not in fact have occurred. But as already shown, a compliance with such duties never, by the statutes of this State, gives him jurisdiction when the supposed intestate or testator was in actual being. The surrogate must always inquire and decide whether the person whose estate is to he committed to the care of others be dead or in life. Yet, bis decision that the person \u25a0on whose estate he acts is dead, if the fact be otherwise, does not invest the person he may appoint with the character or power of an administrator. The case is not within his' jurisdiction (Griffith v. Frazer, 8 <em>Cranch, </em>9, Opinion of Marshall, C. J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s position is, that admitting there are cases in the hooks to the effect that administration granted during the lifetime of a person upon Ms estate is void, because the ecclesiastical courts have jurisdiction only in the estate of dead persons (Allen v. Dundas, 3 <em>T. R. </em>125 Griffith v. Frazer, 8 <em>Cranch, </em>24), yet they do not override the statute of New York, which provides for a judicial inquiry into the fact of death, and that there is Ho New York ease which decides otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u201c I think the assertion too broad and not well considered. Sections 3 and 5 of chapter 79 of the <em>Laws of </em>1813 <em>(Laws </em>1813, p. 445) are analogous to those before cited. Section 5 of the act of 1813 is in substance the same as section 26 of R. S. In fact, the act of 1813 goes further than the R. S., for it requires in express terms that satisfactory proof shall be made of the <em>death of the party, </em>as well as that he died intestate, while R S. does not require proof of the death of the party except as going to establish the fact required to be proved,\u2014 that is, that the party died <em>intestate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u201c The court of appeals held, in Sheldon <em>v. </em>Wright, 5 <em>N. Y. </em>497, 510-512, that this provision in section 5 of the act of 1813 was merely directory, and did not affect the surrogate\u2019s jurisdiction, but that Ms jurisdiction depended on the actual existence in fact, <em>first?, </em>of the death of the person, and, <em>second, </em>that at bis death he was an inhabitant of the county in which the surrogate who issued the letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>was empowered to act. It clearly appears by reference to sections 3 and 5 of the act of 1813, that upon the existence of the above \"two facts, the same surrogate, who would, in case there was no will, have power to grant letters of administration, would, if there were a will, have power to probate it and issue letters testamentary thereon. In Sheldon v. Wright, the non-existence of a will is not put as one of the facts on the <em>actual existence </em>of which the jurisdiction to issue letters of administration depends, and the <em>actual existence </em>of the will is not one of the facts on which the jurisdiction to admit a paper purporting to be a will to probate, and to issue letters testamentary thereon, depends. If neither one of the above two matters does not <em>aetualbj exist </em>as matters of fact, the surrogate is without jurisdiction, while if both do exist as matters of fact, the same surrogate has complete jurisdiction over the whole subject, either to grant letters of administration or letters testamentary, as the case may require, and his action in granting one or the other could not be attacked for want of jurisdiction, but could be reversed or modified only by a court of review or in pursuance of sound statutory remedy. See decision of the case of Sheldon v. Wright, by the learned judge in Bolton v. Jacks, 6 <em>Robertson, </em>281-232.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201cThe above provisions of the Revised Statutes did not cover the case of a will, but the act of 1837 did, and the two together give to the surrogate precisely the same jurisdiction as the act of 1818, with but one substantial difference, viz., the act of 1813 gives no jurisdiction to grant letters of administration, or to admit wills to probate in certain cases when the decedent was not an inhabitant of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201c The additional clauses in section 26 of Revised Statutes respecting the examination of a party on oath, and the subpoenaing and compelling the attendance of witnesses, are merely express enactments of power implied in the direction given by section 5 of the act of 1813, being necessary to a compliance with such direction (1 <em>Kent's Com. </em>525, 10th Ed.). The case of Sheldon v. Wright seems to me to be an exposition of the law of this State on this subject, and .controlling over the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201cAt common law, administration 'granted upon the estate of a person in life was wholly void, even though granted by a court which had full power and jurisdiction over the granting of letters of administration (Allen v. Dundas, 3 <em>T. R. </em>125 ; Griffith v. Frazer, 8 <em>Cranch, </em>1 ; Joachimson v. Suffolk Savings Bank, 3 <em>Allen, </em>87).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201c The above and cases therein cited are directly in point. The case in 3 <em>Allen </em>rests its decision upon the principles of the English laws, and does not depend upon any peculiar statute. The cases of Carter v. Buchanan, 2 <em>Kelly, </em>337 ; Noel v. Wells, 1 <em>Lewis, S. R. </em>235, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and Prosser v. Wagner, 1 <em>Com. B. N. S. </em>387, referred to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, do not apply the case at bar. The party, whose will was offered for probate, being conceded to be dead, the question whether the paper propounded was his will or not, was the question which the court was authorized to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u201c It is difficult to break the force of the case of Joachimson v. Suffolk Savings Bank, as bearing directly on the case at bar, and it furnishes a direct adjudication in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Neither the legislature nor the courts have power to confer jurisdiction on surrogates over the estates of living persons. The foundation of the theory of distribution of estates, whether under statutes of distribution or according to provisions of wills, rests upon the event of death. \u2018 No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or \"property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.\u2019 The substance of these provisions have been incorporated in all our State constitutions. They are simple and comprehensive, and I do not perceive that they derive any additional force or meaning by any historical review of the many learned disquisitions of jurists on the causes and sources of their origin. These provisions mean, that whenever the citizen acquires rights under the existing fundamental law, there is no authority given to the law-making power to take them away. In this State, as in others, they are imposed as restraints upon the legislature, and whenever the rights of property are admitted to exist, the legislature cannot say they shall exist no longer, nor will it make any difference, even though a tribunal like the surrogate\u2019s court should be appointed to pronounce the judgment. Bronson, C. J., in Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 146, says : 1 It must be ascertained judicially that he (the citizen) has forfeited his privileges, or that some one else has <em>superior rights to the property ho possesses, </em>before either of them can be taken from him. It cannot be done by mere legislation.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201cI cannot find any definition of property which does not include . the power of disposition and sale as well as the right of private use and enjoyment. Blackstone says (1 <em>Com. </em>138) ; \u2018The third absolute right of every Englishman is that of property, which consists in the free use and enjoyment and disposal of all his acquisitions without any control, or diminution, save only by the laws of the land.\u2019 Chancellor Kent says (3 <em>Com. </em>320) : \u2018 The exclusive right of using and transferring property follows as a natural consequence from the perception and admission of the right itself ; \u2019 and, again (p. 326) : <em>\u2018 </em>The power of <em>alienation of property </em>is a necessary incident to the right, and was dictated by mutual convenience and mutual wants.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AeOO\">\u201cThe object of the constitution is not to grant legislative power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>but to confine and restrain it; without the constitutional limitation, the power of the legislature to make laws would be absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u201cIt follows, from these elementary principles, that property is sacred and inviolable in the possession of living persons, and is equally so by <em>transmission </em>on their death, whether by will or intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u201c The power of the legislature to confer on a surrogate any jurisdiction over the estate of a living being, comes within the constitutional prohibition, and is absolutely void, and no act of the legislature can give it validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff must have judgment for the amounts claimed in both cases, and interest, with costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
