The motion was denied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b583-10\">HELD,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b583-11\">no error.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b583-12\">Before Cttbtis, Ck. J., Sanford and Freedman, JJ.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-14\">This action was brought against defendants, who are attorneys at law, to recover the sum of $14,253.02, being the balance of $17,253.02, collected by them for the plaintiff from The Commercial Warehouse Company of New York, after deducting the amount which plaintiffs alleged to be a reasonable compensation for their services. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-15\">Defendants alleged, that after a long, difficult and laborious litigation in an action brought by the plaintiff against The Commercial Warehouse Company of New York, in which the plaintiff originally acted in.\" person, and in which they were substituted in Ms place as plaintiff\u2019s attorney, they succeeded in collecting from said Commercial Warehouse Company, the sum of $50,971.19 damages, interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-16\">That out of this sum they retained\" $15,000,. and $2,253.02 (the latter sum being the amount of the costs included in the $50,971.19), less the sum of $500, which they loaned to plaintiff, and which had never been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>been repaid. This retention was under and pursuant to an agreement between them and the plaintiff in respect to their compensation for their services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">The referee reported that defendants were entitled to judgment in their favor on the merits, dismissing the complaint with costs. Plaintiff appealed. The evidence given on the trial was not contained in the appeal book. The only question presented on the appeal from the judgment was, whether the conclusions of law of the referee were supported by his findings of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\">Plaintiff also appealed from an order denying a motion made by him to compel the referee to make further findings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b584-7\"><em>Thomas M. Tyng, </em>plaintiff and appellant, in person, on the points mentioned in the head-note, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGK\">\u2014The referee erred in refusing to pass specifically upon the actual reasonable value of the defendant\u2019s services. - Not only was this a very material issue in this cause, but the action cannot be properly decided, until this fact is specifically passed upon (Haight <em>v. </em>Moore, 5 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>161). There was evidence upon which such a finding could have been made, had the referee deemed i.t material. The main reason why the referee refused to make a finding upon the subject was that it was immaterial. His refusal to pass upon this question was duly excepted to, and his erroneous action is thus properly presented for review' as a question of law <em>(Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 993; Vanslyke <em>v. </em>Hyatt, 46 N. <em>Y. </em>259; Rogers <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 52 <em>Id. </em>262; Fallman <em>v. </em>Bressler, 58 <em>Id. </em>123; Dalrymple <em>v. </em>Hillenbrand, 62 <em>Id. </em>5; Smith <em>v. </em>Glen Falls Ins. Co., <em>Id. </em>85). Even if the compensation of the defendants was purely contingent upon their success, that does not make the actual value of their services an immaterial fact here (Wright <em>v. </em>Wright, 9 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>432).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Marsh &amp; Wallis, </em>attorneys, <em>Wm.
