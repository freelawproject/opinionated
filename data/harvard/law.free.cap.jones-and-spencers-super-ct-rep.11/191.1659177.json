As Ballard and Halley are insolvent and cannot pay, the amount of their indebtedness becomes a loss to be borne by the two creditor partners, in the same proportion as the profits and losses have been divided between them heretofore, viz : as 22 is to 18. The relative proportions of Butler and Moore, the creditor partners, to each other, by the partnership agreement, was as 22-40ths or <em>55 </em>per cent, to Butler, is to 18-40ths or 45 per cent, to Moore. The relative proportions of Butler &amp; Moore to each other, being 55 per cent, to Butler, and 45 per cent, to Moore, or as 22 is to 18, Butler will owe Moore 45 per cent, of his account, and Moore will owe Butler 55 per cent, of his account. The difference between these two sums will adjust the accounts of Butler and Moore with each other, thus :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>45 per cent, of Butler\u2019s acc\u2019t, $9,286.78, is $4,179.05</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeo\">55 \u201c \u201c Moore\u2019s \u201c 17,922.81, is 9,857.54</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">Difference due Moore, by Butler, $5,678.49</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>Weeks &amp; </em>Forster, attorneys, and <em>George H.

The principles which regulated the reference, are briefly stated in if Newdecker <em>v. </em>Kohlburg (3 Daly, 410). In taking or stating the final accounts of a copartnership, it is to be ascertained what each partner is entitled to charge in account with his copartners, each being entitled as against the other to everything he has advanced or brought in as a partnership transaction, and also what the other has not brought in, or has taken out more than he ought (cites West <em>v. </em>Skip, 1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>239), and then to apportion between them the profits to be divided, or losses to be made good, and ascertain what, if anything, any partner should pay to the other in order that all cross claims- may be settled (cites <em>Lind, on Part. </em>828). This accounting is to be governed, however, as between the partners, by the special provisions of the copartnership agreement, and the right to a return of capital invested by each partner, is only to be destroyed by express stipulation to the contrary (3 Daly, 410, 414).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">II.

Defendants cannot complain of the method adopted by the referee, and the order and judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b213-9\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alf\">\u2014It is conceded that the referee has correctly found the amounts withdrawn by, and the balance due to and by, the several parties to the co-partnership. It therefore appears without contradiction that there was due from all sources :</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>To Butler.......$9,286.77</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">To Mpore....... 17,922.82 .</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Total......$27,209.59</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">On the other hand Ballard and Halley had largely overdrawn their respective accounts, and there was due</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">From Ballard......$15,243.08</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">From Halley...... 11,966.51</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Total......$27,209.59</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">\u2014or exactly the aggregate amount to which Butler and Moore were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">The cross claims arising from this state of facts between the partners themselves, the referee determined upon the theory, (1) that the sums due to Butler and Moore should be paid by <em>all </em>the partners in the percentage proportions of their interests ; and (2) that the sums due by Ballard and Halley should be paid to <em>all </em>the partners in like proportions, and that thus each partner should have, in the form of a claim upon one or all the others, just his share of the whole sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">It is also conceded that if this theory is applicable the computations made upon it are not open to objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">In my judgment the theory adopted and acted upon was the correct one. It is in accordance with the principles laid down in Neudecker v. Kohlberg (3 Daly, 407), and the provisions of the articles of co-partnership in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">The alleged insolvency of Ballard and Halley does not call for a different apportionment. For even if such insolvency existed, the amounts overdrawn and due by them cannot, as between the partners themselves, be treated as losses within the true intent and meaning of that word as used in the articles of copartnership. Moreover, the said articles expressly provided \u201cthat at the termination of the partnership, either by death or otherwise, or \u2022 its own limitations after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>payment of all the indebtedness of said partnership, there shall first be paid from the assets of said partnership, to the said parties of the third and fourth parts (Butler and Moore), the capital contributed by the said parties of the third and fourth parts, to the common stock . . . with interest, ... and, secondly, that the respective interests of all the parties hereto, in the profits of said partnership, shall be .adjusted and paid according to their respective shares of per centum in the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The claim, therefore, which has been advanced by the appellants, that the amounts overdrawn by Ballard and Halley constituted losses to be borne by the <em>two creditor partners </em>in the proportion that the profits and losses were divided <em>between </em>them, is quite .untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Curtis, Ch. J., and Van Vorst, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
