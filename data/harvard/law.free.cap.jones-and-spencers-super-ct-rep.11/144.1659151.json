De Wolf, and the disposition thereof by him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">By the decree \u201cIt was further ordered that <em>the question of costs, as well as all other questions, </em>be reserved until the coming in of the report and hearing for further directions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">Having taken proof as directed, the referee reported the same to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">Meanwhile, the defendant, De Wolf, had accounted as administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">It appeared, upon examination before the surrogate, that Mr. De Wolf had mingled the moneys arising from \u00bfthe rents of the real estate with those which were the proceeds of the late Mrs. Offinger\u2019s estate, and in making payments to the several plaintiffs had not discriminated between the different funds. And the surrogate found that defendant had paid to several of the plaintiffs amounts of money largely in excess of their respective shares in their late mother\u2019s estate, and that this excess was properly a charge upon the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">Defendant then applied to the court for leave to set up these facts by way of supplemental answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\">An order was made granting the relief asked for, and referring the matter again to Mr. Wehle, and directing \u201cthat upon the coming in of the supplemental report, <em>the action may be noticed for final hearing and determination </em>at a special term of this court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-11\">After the supplemental report came in, the cause was regularly noticed for trial, and was brought on before his Honor Judge Sanford at the June term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-12\">After the trial, and without procuring from the court any written findings of facts or conclusions of law, the plaintiffs- entered a final judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-13\">Defendant DeWolf thereupon moved to vacate the judgment for the irregularities mentioned in the notice of motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-14\">The motion was denied, and the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Erastus Cooke, </em>of counsel, for appellant, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">\u2014I. It was irregular to enter judgment, without having first procured and filed a written decision by Mr. Justice Sabfobd, containing a separate statement of the facts found, and the conclusions of law. This was necessary under the old, and is required by the new Code of Procedure <em>(Old </em>Code, \u00a7 267; <em>New Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1022, 1228; Wright <em>v. </em>Sanders, 28 <em>How. Pr. </em>395; Van Steenburgh v. Hoffman, 6 <em>Id. </em>492).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">II. Such a decision as the law requires, is necessary in order that the defendant may present the case to the appellate court. The only means for reviewing the decision at the trial, is by excepting to the facts found, and the conclusions of law. Here is nothing to which we can except (Bridger v. Weeks, 30 <em>N. Y. </em>329; Leland v. Cameron, 31 <em>Id. </em>115; Doty v. Carolus, <em>Id. </em>547).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">III. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument is, that in view of the reference to Mr. Wehle, and his report, there was nothing for the court at special term to try, and hence, no written decision containing findings and conclusions was required. This is a fallacy. 1st. It is only upon the report of a referee appointed to hear and determine the whole issue, that judgment may be entered <em>(Code of Pro. </em>[old] \u00a7 272). Where the referee is merely to report the facts, the report has only the effect a special verdict <em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 272). In such case the judgment is left to the court <em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 260). 2nd. Here the court, in the first instance, found certain facts, and referred other specific questions, at the same time stating, that \u201c <em>the question of costs as well as all other </em>questions,\u201d are reserved until the coming of the referee\u2019 s report. This report, then, operated as a special verdict upon the questions of fact referred, and no further. The second order was that 'the referee report upon a single question, and that \u2018 upon the coming in of the supplemental report, <em>the action may Toe noticed for final hearing and </em>determination(N. B.\u2014The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>words \u201c to hear and determine,\u201d in this order, are surplusage, inconsistent, extra-judicial and void. The issue made by the supplemental answer was simply as to certain payments alleged by De Wolf to have been made by him. This only was referred, and it is too plain for argument, that a referee appointed to pass upon one of several questions, cannot \u201c <em>hear and determined) </em>3rd. It follows that after the reports were both before the court, and the cause was ready for a final hearing, numerous questions <em>(i.e., </em>the alleged misconduct of the trustee, his right to costs, and other issues raised by the pleadings), were still undetermined. <em>And even as to the facts actioally found by the referee, there are no conclusions of lato stated. </em>This the cotirt was bound to do, and no judgment could properly be entered until that duty had been discharged.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-5\"><em>Benjamin T. Kissam, </em>of counsel, for respondents, urged :\u2014</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">I. The issues of fact were tried by the court, in \u00a1November, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">Its decision was then given, containing a statement of facts and conclusions of law (See \u00a7\u00a7 250, 252, 267 of <em>Code of Procedure). </em>This decision was filed, and in pursuance of it, and the order of the court entered thereon, the reference as to title, and as to the rents received and disbursed by De Wolf proceeded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">II. The report of the referee was made in August, 1876, and no exceptions being taken, it became absolute after eight days (Rule 39).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-9\">III. The court in March, 1877, allowed the defendant De Wolf to set up certain alleged payments which he claimed were not allowed him, either in his account- , ing before the surrogate, or by the referee in this action, but required him to proceed with great despatch before the referee, and pay the expense out of his own private moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>IV. The order of reference was limited to \u201c such payments as were disallowed by both the surrogate and the referee, and were made in good faith, and for the allowance of which clear equitable grounds exist.\u201d The referee reported payments to some five of the plaintiffs, in the aggregate amounting to $2,177.58, which was nearly the full amount claimed. There was no exception taken to this finding of the referee, and to that extent the report became absolute under the rule (see Rule 39).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">V. The material issues in the action were settled in November, 1875. The report- of the referee in August, 1876 (so far as De Wolf was concerned), not excepted to, settled the account between the plaintiffs, the Hruzas and De Wolf. The second report of the referee, in May, 1877, made a material deduction in De Wolf\u2019s favor, from the amount charged against him in the first report, to which he did not except, and plaintiffs did not except, and that under the rule became absolute. The only question raised by the exceptions of the defendant De Wolf, was in respect to the interest on payments. This was a question of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">VI. The question of interest being disposed of, there was nothing left to be done by the court but to settle the form of the judgment. It was unnecessary and improper for the court to make any decision containing the facts found, and conclusions of law. The provisions contained in the \u201c Code of Civil Procedure\u201d have no application to the case (see \u00a7\u00a7 1022, 1228).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">VII. If any irregularity has occurred the judgment is not affected thereby, and should not be disturbed (See <em>Code of Civil </em>Procedure, \u00a7 721, subds. 11, 12, also \u00a7 722).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b165-8\">By the Court.\u2014Vah Vorst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9v\">\u2014This is an appeal from an order denying a motion to vacate a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ment for an alleged irregularity. The action, which is in partition, came on to be tried before the Hon. John J. Freedman, at a special term of this court, November 4, 1875, without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The learned judge determined the issues, and made his decision thereon in writing, finding certain facts and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">But he directed a reference to a referee named by him to take proof of the interests of the parties, and to report whether the premises were so situated as that an actual partition could not be made. He also directed the referee to ascertain the liens upon the premises, and to take an account of rents, <em>&amp;o. </em>The question of costs, as well as other questions, were reserved until the coming in of the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">After such finding of facts, which disposed of all the issues, no other findings of fact were necessary to enable the defendant to obtain a review of the judgment finally entered in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The further proceedings in court in the action, would be founded upon the referee\u2019s report upon the matters referred to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The findings of facts and conclusion of law, the result of the trial of November, 1875, could have been excepted to, as well as the referee\u2019s report. These latter exceptions could be disposed of by the court, as it appears they were, when application was made for a confirmation of the referee\u2019s report. And the appeal from the judgment and order of confirmation would bring up for review all the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The matter contained in the supplemental answer, which was allowed to be filed, presented no new issue, requiring additional findings of fact by the judge. The matter involved in the supplemental answer, which affected the accounts of one of the parties, was also referred to the same referee, and was passed upon by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>him, and was the subject of adjudication, when the report was before the court for confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">We fail to discover any irregularity in entering up the judgment without findings and conclusions other than those made by Judge Freedman. If exceptions have been taken to such findings and conclusions, and to the order or judgment of confirmation of the referee\u2019s report, the defendant can raise all legal objections upon the appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The question of costs was determined by the judge, by the order made when the report was before him on the final hearing. That question was then properly before him upon the findings and conclusions of Judge Freedman and the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Curtis, Ch. J., and Sanford, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
