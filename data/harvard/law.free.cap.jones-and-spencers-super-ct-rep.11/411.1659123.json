There was a mis trial. The action was purely of an equitable character, and the court had no authority to dismiss the complaint as to some of the parties, and direct another branch of it as a matter of law to be tried by a jury (1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. </em>\u00a7 703, and cases cited; Bay v. Coddington, 5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>54; Lloyd v. Gordon, <em>2 Swanst. </em>180; Patrick v. Harrison, 3 <em>Brown Ch. </em>476; Jackson v. Butler, 9 <em>Mod. </em>297; S. C., 3 <em>Atk. </em>306; Osborne v. U. S. Bank, 9 <em>Wheat. </em>738; Hamilton v. Cummings, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>517; Kobbi v. Underhill, 3 <em>Sandf. Ch. 277</em>; Hasbrouck v. Vandervoort, 4 <em>Sandf. </em>74; State of Illinois v. Delafield, 8 <em>Paige, 527</em>; <em>2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 </em>1032; <em>Eden on Inj. </em>210; Brinkley v. Brinkley, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>192; 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. </em>\u00a7 71; 2 <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 1, 483; <em>Code of Pro. </em>\u00a7 387). (1.) The extension of the jurisdiction of courts of law to cases which formerly were subjects of equitable jurisdiction exclusively has not ousted the jurisdiction of courts of equity (White v. Meday, 2 <em>Edw. </em>486, and cases cited ; Sailly v. Elmore, 2 <em>Paige, </em>497; Mayne v. Griswold, 3 <em>Sandf. </em>464; American Ins. Co. v. Fisk, 1 <em>Paige, </em>90; McLaren v. Pennington, <em>Id. </em>102). Where equity obtains jurisdiction of a cause for any purpose it will retain it until justice is effected (1 <em>Story Eq. </em>\u00a7 74; <em>Id. </em>(11 Ed.) \u00a7 64, k; De Bemer v. Drew, 39 <em>How. Pr. </em>466; Le Roy v. Veeder, 1 <em>John. Ca. </em>417; Rathbone v. Warren, 10 <em>Johns. </em>587, 596 ; King v. Baldwin, 17 <em>Id. </em>384).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">II. The defendant Fred. Butterfield, and the other defendants, composing that firm, did not allege in their answers that they had received the bonds in question in good faith, without notice and for valuable consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>eration (1.) Before the Code of Procedure this was requisite (Wallyn <em>v. </em>Lee, 9 <em>Ves. </em>24, 33, 35 notes; Gallatin <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 8 <em>Cow. </em>361; Frost <em>v. </em>Beekman, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>288; Balcolm <em>v. </em>N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 11 Paige, 454-456). (2.) The rule under the code is as of old; in order to admit testimony that a party is a <em>bona fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration, it is necessary that the answer should contain allegations to that effect (Weaver <em>v. </em>Barden, 49 <em>N. Y. </em>286-9; Field v. The Mayor, 8 <em>Id. </em>179). Therefore the court erred in allowing the defendants to prove that they were <em>bona fide </em>holders of the plaintiffs\u2019 bonds for value, and the ^exception thereto is well taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-6\">III. Frederick Butterfield carried on and transacted \"business under the firm name of \u2018 \u2018 Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co. of 1866.\u201d This was a fictitious name, and having obtained possession of the plaintiffs\u2019 bonds in violation of the statute of the State of New York he cannot hold them as against the plaintiffs <em>(Laws, </em>1833, Ch. 281; see 4 <em>General Stat. </em>[Edm. ed.], 449). (1.) This act of the defendant, Fred. Butterfield, was within the plain provisions of the statute prohibiting such a trans.action and upon principle and authority renders it void (Griffith <em>v. </em>Wells, 3 <em>Denio, </em>226; Swords <em>v. </em>Owen, 2 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>277; S. C., 43 <em>How. Pr. </em>176; Pennington <em>v. </em>Townsend, 7 <em>Wend. </em>276; 1 <em>Story Eq. Jur. </em>296). (2.) <em>If </em>Frederick Butterfield could not recover the purchase money on a sale of the bonds, can he hold them against the owners when it appears he obtained them by and through the same illegal means ? Is it not a fundamental principle of law that no right can be derived from any contract made in express opposition to the laws where such contract is made <em>% </em>(Duncan <em>v. </em>McLure, 4 <em>Dall. </em>308; Hall <em>v. </em>Mullin, 5 <em>Har. &amp; J. </em>693; Clark <em>v. </em>Shee, 1 <em>Cowp. </em>197; Swords <em>v. </em>Owens, 43 <em>How.

A consideration of the pleadings deprives of all force the objections to testimony introduced on behalf of the defendant Butterfield, based upon the ground that it was not pleaded in the answer, viz.: the objection to the proof of the <em>honafides </em>of the loan and pledge of securities, and also of Butterfield\u2019s not being himself interested either in the loan as security for which the' bonds in suit were pledged, or in the bonds themselves.. There was no necessity of pleading such matter in behalf of the firm of Fred. Butterfield <em>&amp; </em>Co., and the complaint contained no allegations against Butterfield, except in his capacity as a member of that firm. They made no attempt to amend their complaint so as to notify Butterfield that they would, upon the trial, attempt to fasten upon him an individual liability, nor did they bring in as parties the persons really interested in the bonds. They chose to go to trial upon the complaint in its original form, and, having introduced evidence tending to show an individual liability on the part of Butterfield, attempted to shut out testimony on his behalf, on the ground that his answer did not properly plead matter of defense to a claim of which no mention is made in the complaint. Such testimony was properly admitted over the objection that it was not pleaded, which was the only objection taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">II. The only ground upon which the special term took, or could take, jurisdiction of the present suit, as containing any equitable cause of action, was the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>set up in the complaint that the plaintiffs were entitled to an accounting and a marshaling of the securities held as collateral by Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co., and to the release of the bonds in suit from the lien of their loan, on the ground that they held sufficient other collateral security for its payment without having recourse to these bonds. The evidence shows that the securities held as collateral would not realize sufficient to pay the loans for which they were pledged. This testimony is uncontradicted. Upon the proof of this fact, there disappeared from the case the only element entitling the plaintiffs to the interference of a court of equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">III. The plaintiffs claim that the loan of $690,000 was, on account of the use of the term \u201cFred. Butterfield &amp; Co. of 1866,\u201d in contravention of the statute of April 29, 1833, prohibiting the use of fictitious names in business. This statute must be construed in connection with chapter 400 of the <em>Laws of </em>1854 (Session laws of that year, page 1084), and chapter 144 of the <em>Laws of </em>1863 (Session laws of that year, page 227), which are in <em>pari </em>materia, and which provide that the use of a copartnership name may be continued upon complying with their provisions as to filing a certificate and publishing an advertisement to that effect. The object of these statutes was to prevent persons from obtaining credit on the responsibility of supposed names included in the term \u201cCo.,\u201d but here Fred. Butterfield represented an actual responsible name as to all the world except his partners, and \u201c Co.\u201d represented two names\u2014William Butterfield and L. A. Jacobus. Fred. Butterfield was a partner liable for all the debts of the firm, and it was only as between himself and the two persons included in the term \u201cCo.\u201d that his liability was limited. The statute in question cannot avail the plaintiffs. For (1.) no case can be found in which a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>has been allowed to take advantage of the statute, unless it was specially pleaded (O'Toole <em>v. </em>Garvin, 1 <em>Hun, </em>92, and cases there cited). (2.) The court will not deprive the personal representatives of William Butterfield of their property by its judgment in an action to which they are not made parties, and have not had an opportunity to be heard. (3.) The transaction was not within either the spirit or the letter of the law, even if it be conceded that the making of the loan was \u201ctransacting business\u201d within the meaning of those terms as used in the statute. The law was intended to prevent persons obtaining credit to which they were not entitled. In the present case credit was given to Clews &amp; Co. The term was used in the liquidation of the affairs of a firm which had ceased doing business, and with the addition of the words \u201c of 1866,\u201d employed simply as an ear-mark to keep the proceeds of the property of that firm entirely separate from other funds. (4.) There is no proof that the provisions of the enabling statute of 1854 have not been complied with. In the absence of such proof, the court will not presume that a party committed a misdemeanor (Hartwell <em>v. </em>Root, 19 <em>Johns. </em>345; People <em>v. </em>Pease, 27 <em>N. Y. </em>45; Farmer\u2019s Loan Co. <em>v. </em>Curtis, 3 <em>Seld. </em>470).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">IY. Finally, should it be held, not only that the statute applies, and that the plaintiffs can take advantage of it, but also that no subrogation takes place, still the judgment of the court below should be affirmed, as the plaintiff\u2019s remedy at law, by an action of replevin, was perfect against the parties holding the bonds ; and with such a controversy the special term, or, in other words, the equity side of the court, had nothing to do, the defendants being entitled to a trial by jury (People v. Albany R. R. Co., 57 <em>N. Y. </em>161; Hudson <em>v. </em>Caryl, 44 <em>Id. </em>553; Bradley v. Aldrich, 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Id. </em>[1 <em>Handd] </em>504; Mann <em>v. </em>Fairchild, 2 <em>Keyes, </em>111; Heyward <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo, 14 N. <em>Y. </em>534).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-5\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A22L\">\u2014As to the defendant Taylor, it was found below, as a conclusion of law, that he has no interest in the bonds in controversy, either individually or as a member of the firm of Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co., or as assignee of Henry Clews &amp; Co. This finding was not excepted to, nor does the record contain any exception whatever under which the dismissal of the complaint as against him as assignee of Henry Clews &amp; Co. could be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">As against the defendants constituting the firm of Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co. the action proceeded on the theory that they, as against the plaintiffs, were not <em>bona fide </em>holders of the bonds in question for value, or, if they were, that the plaintiffs were entitled to an accounting and a marshaling of the securities held by Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co. as collaterals, and to the release of the bonds in suit from the lien of their loan to Henry Clews &amp; Co., on the ground that they held sufficient other collateral security for the payment of the loan without having recourse to these bonds. If the evidence given upon the trial failed to establish this theory, but a single issue remained to be tried between the plaintiffs and Henry Clews &amp; Co., and that related solely to the alleged conversion of the bonds. For the purpose of trying that issue, the last named defendan ts had a right to demand a jury (Sternberger v. McGovern, 56 N. <em>Y. </em>12; Hudson <em>v. </em>Caryl, 44 <em>Id. </em>553; Kinne <em>v. </em>Kinne, 2 <em>Sup'm Ct. [T. &amp; C.] </em>393).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The bonds in suit were negotiable instruments, and as holders in good faith and for value Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co. could, if necessary for their protection, retain them as against the plaintiffs. Under the issues raised by the pleadings they had a right to show that they were such <em>bona fide </em>holders for value, and the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>given by them clearly established and fully justified the learned judge below in finding, as he did, not only that they had parted with full value upon the faith of the bonds and without notice of plaintiffs\u2019 rights in the premises, but also that in making the loan or loans to Henry Clews &amp; Co. they had acted as agents only for others. Moreover, the plaintiffs not only failed to show that Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co. held sufficient other col-laterals, but the latter proved by testimony which remained uncontradicted, that all the securities held as collaterals would not realize sufficient to pay the loan for which they stood pledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">It is insisted, however, that inasmuch as Frederick Butterfield made the loan in question under the firm name of \u201cFred. Butterfield &amp; Co. of 1866,\u201d and at a time at which no such firm existed, he obtained possession of plaintiffs\u2019 bonds in violation of the statute of the State of New York forbidding persons to transact business under fictitious names (L. 1833, ch. 281), and that for this reason, if no other, the complaint was improperly dismissed as against him. The statute referred to, provides that no person shall transact business in the name of a partner not interested in his firm, and where the designation \u201cand company\u201d or \u201c&amp; Co.\u201d is used, it shall represent an actual partner or partners. It further provides that any person offending against its provisions shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Upon this branch of the case the facts appear to be as follows:' \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">About August?, 1873, Frederick Butterfield, as agent of the estate of Sarah Hannah Butterfield, and out of the moneys in his hands belonging to said estate, and on securities including the twenty-nine bonds in suit, loaned to Henry Clews <em>&amp; </em>Co. the sum of $112,939.69.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>About September 4, 1874, Frederick Butterfield, as agent of the estate of William Butterfield, and out of moneys then in his hands belonging to said estate, loaned to Henry Clews &amp; Co. the sum of $690,000. Out of the sum so obtained Henry Clews <em>&amp; </em>Co. repaid the loan had from the estate of Sarah Hannah Butter-field, and at the same time they transferred the securities held by Frederick Butterfield as agent of the estate of Sarah Hannah Butterfield to him, as agent of the estate of said William Butterfield, as security for said loan of $690,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Prior to 1866, William Butterfield and one Lyman A. Jacobus had carried on business in the cities of London and Hew York under the firm name of \u201cFred. Butterfield <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d and to this business Frederick Butterfield had given the use of his name. The business ceased in 1866, and the said sum of $690,000 formed part of the proceeds of the assets thereof which belonged to said William Butterfield, and as such it passed into the hands of Fred. Butterfield for management. In order to distinguish the proceeds of the said assets from the assets of the firm of Fred. Butterfield <em>&amp; </em>Co. as subsequently formed, they were kept in a separate account under the title of \u201cFred. Butterfield &amp; Co. of 1866.\u201d The transaction with Henry Clews &amp; Co., as above stated, was made under that title in September, 1874, and by a check signed \u201c Fred. Butterfield &amp; Co. of 1866,\u201d though William Butterfield had died during the preceding month of June.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Upon this state of facts, it is clear that prior to and in 1866 the name of Fred. Butterfield represented an actual party responsible to all the world, except his partners, for the use of his name, and the term \u201c <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201d represented two other parties, William Butter-field and L. A. Jacobus, who were partners in fact. By this arrangement Frederick Butterfield became liable for all the debts of the firm bearing his name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and ifc was only as between himself and the two persons included in the term <em>\u201c&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d that his liability \u25a0 was limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Under these circumstances it may be a question whether the statute applies. This statute must be construed in connection with chapter 400 of the <em>Laws of </em>1854, and chapter 144 of the <em>Laws of </em>1863, which are in <em>pari </em>materia, and which provide that the use of a copartnership name may be continued upon compliance with their provisions as to filing a certificate and publishing an advertisement to that effect, and there is no proof that the provisions of these enabling statutes have not been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">But another, and fatal objection is, that Frederick Butterfield was not declared or proceeded against under the statute referred to. The alleged violation of the statute, if any there was, not having been made the basis of the action, and the fact being that he acted as agent only for principals not before the court, the law will- not deprive these principals of their property by means of a judgment to be rendered in an action to which they were not made parties, and in which they have had no opportunity to be heard. If the plaintiffs intended to rely upon the statute, they should have pleaded its violation (O\u2019Toole <em>v. </em>Garvin, 1 <em>Hun, </em>92).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The case also contains exceptions to the admission \u00f3f testimony, to the findings as made, and the refusal of the court to find as requested by the plaintiffs, but under the views, above expressed they are clearly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The judgment, should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Curtis, Oh. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
