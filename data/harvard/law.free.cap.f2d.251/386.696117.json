The ground for the denial in the District Court was that the subject matter of the claims was nonpatentable over prior art and patents, and, in the case of one of the claims (No. 11), unpatentable on the ground of double patenting. The Primary Examiner and the Board of Patent Appeals had reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">An examination of the record discloses, no error which would warrant disturbing the findings of the District Court.
