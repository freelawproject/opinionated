Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3929, 4041 (1875), as amended, 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 259, 732, and enjoining its enforcement on the ground of its alleged invalidity at the time it was issued June 20, 1925. The motion of plaintiffs for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ment was denied and that of the defendant Postmaster General was granted on the ground of plaintiffs\u2019 laches. We affirm. This does not preclude appellants from initiating before the Postmaster General proceedings for such relief, if any, as they may be entitled to receive by reason of the current situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-21\">.
