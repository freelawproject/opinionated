The plaintiff Kathryn Johnston consulted the defendant Dr. Rodis for the purpose of obtaining certain treatments and \u201cquestioned\u201d him concerning the treatments. He advised her \u201cthat the treatments as given by him were perfectly safe\u201d. \u201cRelying upon the statements\u201d he made, she submitted herself to him for the treatments. On May 10, 1952, he commenced a treatment \u201cand upon her regaining consciousness she learned that while under the direction, care and supervision of the defendant she sustained a fracture of her left arm.\u201d Serious, permanent and painful injuries resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">The defendant\u2019s answer says that because of the plaintiff\u2019s condition he gave her electric shock therapy in accordance with the approved method and practice of physicians specializing in psychiatry. The answer denies that the defendant \u201cadvised the treatments were perfectly safe\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Though the complaint does not say the defendant knew the treatments were not perfectly safe, the defendant says in a deposition that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by the \u201cconvulsive seizure which ensued as a result of the electric shock treatment\u201d; that in the defendant\u2019s practice, about 5 or 6 or 7 fractures of the arm had been caused in this way; and that the \u201cusual, the most common, are fractures of the vertebrae; that is, the backbone. * * * The long bones are next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">The District Court gave summary judgment for the defendant and the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">The plaintiffs relied at pretrial on <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and breach of warranty. As the District Court said, the plaintiffs made no charge of specific negligence and did not propose to offer any evidence of negligence. We agree with the District Court that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not apply. Doubtless a physician\u2019s statement that he would cure a disease could seldom if ever be regarded as a warranty. But that is not this case. The statement attributed to the defendant, that shock treatments are \u201cperfectly safe\u201d, contains less of prediction and more of present fact. We think this statement, if the defendant made it and did not qualify it in any way, might properly be found to be a warranty. It follows that summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
