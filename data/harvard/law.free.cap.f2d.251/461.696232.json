In short, it is an effort in a collateral attack on the judgment to retry the case, and as such it is directly contrary to the decision of this court in Arthur v. United States, 5 Cir., 230 F.2d 666 and other cases to the same effect. Cf. Adams v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 222 F.2d 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-23\">Among the matters which appellant sought to retry by his motion, one was whether counsel of his own choice competently defended him. The motion does not allege fraud or any kind of overreaching but merely that his counsel did not try the case as well as it could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>been tried. Other matters sought to be presented are: that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; that the testimony of some of the witnesses against him was false; and generally that his conviction should be set aside and he ought to have a new trial. His final attack on the judgment as wrongly imposing consecutive sentences on the conspiracy count and a substantive count is wholly without legal basis. Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489; Valdez v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">No error of any kind appearing, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
