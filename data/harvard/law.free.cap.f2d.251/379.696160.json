The action of the trial court in denying the bill of particulars was well within the discretion of the court, particularly as appellant\u2019s counsel was furnished with the entire file of the Government and, after this, made no further motion for the bill. The record discloses that prior to the trial appellant was given all reports in the possession or under the control of the Government. Notes of the police officer involved were ordered to be given to defense counsel and this was done. It is not shown that appellant did not receive any statement that was in fact in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Appellant\u2019s point as to the production of the jurors\u2019 handbook was not raised in the District Court and it is now too late to make complaint. Further, it is not shown that the handbook was in any way prejudicial to the rights of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-14\">EDGERTON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXU\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">The defendant was convicted last April. In my opinion Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103, decided in June, requires us to remand if not to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">The government\u2019s case turned entirely on Officer Scipio\u2019s testimony. No one else testified that the defendant bought, sold, or possessed narcotics. If, but only if, the defendant could impeach this officer\u2019s testimony, he could hope for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">A subpoena was served on the Chief of Police requiring him to produce \u201cAll statements and reports reduced to writing, whether signed or unsigned, of Private Rudolph Scipio, MPDC, relating to transactions on or about September 30, 1956 and on or about October 5, 1956, involved in this case * * The defendant was clearly entitled under Jencks to inspect these \u201crelevant statements or reports in [the government\u2019s] possession of government witnesses touching the subject matter of their testimony at the trial.\u201d 353 U.S. 657, 672, 77 S.Ct. 1007. This subpoena was neither complied with nor quashed. The record does not appear to me to show that the defendant received the equivalent of the subpoenaed documents. At the trial, defendant\u2019s counsel was shown some \u201cnotes\u201d Officer Scipio had prepared. But it does not appear that these \u201cnotes\u201d were as full as the subpoenaed documents. The record even implies the contrary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I think it follows that there should be a new trial unless the District Court, on remand, finds that all Officer Scipio\u2019s existing statements or reports were shown to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel. The defendant should not be required to show that they were <em>not </em>shown. An accused person cannot be expected to prove what is in a file that he has not seen.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">. For example, when the officer was asked in cross-examination, \u201cNow, after you made that purchase on September 30, did you make a written report of it?\u201d, he replied, \u201cTes. That is the written report <em>something similar to that one.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
