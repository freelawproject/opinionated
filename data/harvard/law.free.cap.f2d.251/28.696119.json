But a review of the record leads inescapably to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s last residence was in Italy in the city of Trieste. Appellant\u2019s testimony in the deportation hearings in 1951 and in the hearing on his Displaced Persons Act application in 1952 establishes that he left his home in Briani in 1939, and that his permanent home between 1939 and 1946 was in Trieste; appellant\u2019s wife and child still live in Trieste. Accordingly, we think it plain that neither on his Displaced Persons Act application nor on his Refugee Relief Act application has appellant carried his burden of showing that he will be subject to persecution \u201con account of race, religion, or political opinion\u201d in the country of his birth (Yugoslavia), and in the country of his nationality (undetermined), and in the country of his last residence (Italy).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-13\">. 62 Stat. 1011 (1948), as amended, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1953, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">\u201c\u00a7 4(a) Any alien who (1) entered the United States prior to April 30, 1949, and was on that date in the United States * * * and (2) is otherwise admissible under the immigration laws, and (3) is a displaced person residing in the United States as defined in this section, may, within two years next following the effective date of this Act, as amended [sections 1951-1966 of this Appendix], apply to the Attorney General for an adjustment of his immigration status.
