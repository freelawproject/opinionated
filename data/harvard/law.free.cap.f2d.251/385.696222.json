American Automobile Insurance Company, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 124, 220 F.2d 488, certiorari denied, 1955, 350 U.S. 833, 76 S.Ct. 67, 100 L.Ed. 743.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appeal is now taken from an order of the District Court in that case denying plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial under Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A., which alleged newly-discovered evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that while this evidence - \u2014 which appellant argues shows perjury - \u2014 was of a character tending to impeach the testimony of a witness at the trial, it was not likely to lead to a change in the result reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-20\">We think the District Court did not abuse its discretion. The evidence can only doubtfully be described as newly-discovered : plaintiff-appellant could have taken the witness\u2019 deposition or otherwise made timely discovery. Certainly the matter offered does not reach the gravity contemplated by the \u201cany other reason justifying relief\u201d provision of Rule 60(b) (6), even assuming that provision to be applicable here. Cf. Klapprott v. United States, 1949, 335 U.S. 601, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266; 3 Freeman, Judgments, \u00a7 1241 (5th ed. 1925); 7 Moore, Federal Practice, pars. 60.24, 60.-27 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-22\">.
