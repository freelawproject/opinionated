Both the Commission and intervenor have filed motions to dismiss Dayton's petition on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>the ground that Dayton had not made timely application for rehearing. The order was issued June 29, 1956. It is claimed that Dayton\u2019s application was not \u201cfiled\u201d until August 2, 1956, and for that reason was rejected by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Section 19(a) of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r) provides that a party such as Dayton may apply for rehearing \"within thirty days after the issuance of such order,\u201d and that no proceeding to review \u201cshall be brought\u201d unless an application for rehearing shall have been made. It is certainly so that our jurisdiction depends upon compliance, and \u00a7 19 (b) expressly precludes our consideration of any objection to the Commission\u2019s order unless that objection shall have been urged before the Commission in an application for rehearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of the requirement is clear, logical and compelling, for, properly sought, the administrative judgment when expressed may make unnecessary further judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSimple fairness to those who are engaged in the tasks of administration, and to litigants, requires as a general rule that courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">Section 16 <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the Act authorizes the Commission to prescribe needful rules and regulations, pursuant to which the Commission\u2019s \u201cRules of Practice and Procedure\u201d were promulgated. Rule 1.-15(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> particularly pertinent here, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-13\"><em>\u201cCopies. Except as may be otherwise required by the rules or regular tions of the Commission, </em>or <em>ordered </em>or <em>requested </em>by the Commission, at the time pleadings, documents, or other papers other than correspondence, are filed with the Commission, there shall be furnished to the Commission an original and 19 conformed copies of such papers and exhibits, if any; <em>Provided, however, </em>When service is made by the parties, or service is not required to be made, only an original and 14 conformed copies need be filed. * * * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">With the foregoing in mind, we turn to the facts of record. Dayton prepared its application for rehearing and on July 27, 1956, mailed the original and 14 copies to the Commission, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>cisely as specified by Rule 1.15(b), On the same day Dayton mailed a single copy of the application to the Commission\u2019s General Counsel, which was received by him July 30, at the offices of the Commission. This was in time under the Rule since July 29, 1956, which was the last day for filing, fell on a Sunday.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So far as the command of the <em>statute </em>goes, Dayton\u2019s application was timely.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But the original application and 14 copies thereof, although mailed by Dayton at the same time it mailed the copy to the General Counsel, did not reach the Commission until August 2. The delay was due to the fact that through clerical inadvertence in Dayton\u2019s office, the envelope addressed to the Commission was sent by 4th class mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">The Commission was seasonably put on notice that Dayton sought rehearing when its General Counsel received a copy of the application; nevertheless on August 7, 1956, it returned the original and the 14 copies as having been \u201csubmitted beyond the 30-day period provided in section 19(a) of the Natural Gas Act.\u201d Dayton explained that the inadvertent 4th class mailing had caused the delay, but the Commission refused to reconsider its rejection of the papers. The \u25a0Commission and Ohio Fuel argue that failure by Dayton within 30 days to fulfill the literal procedural requirement of the quoted Rule is, as a matter of law, a fatal jurisdictional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">We do not agree. Dayton met the command of the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Within the jurisdictional statutory period its application reached the General Counsel of the Commission, the very official in charge of the proceedings in which Dayton was a party. Since the Commission had expressly retained authority in its rule to waive exact compliance with its own procedural requirement, it cannot oust itself of jurisdiction on the facts here shown.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not condone Dayton\u2019s laxity in failing to forward all papers on time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We simply say we cannot hold the failure to meet the directive of this procedural rule is jurisdictional so that the neglect defeats Dayton\u2019s status as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">The motions to dismiss Dayton\u2019s petition must be denied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The case will be remanded to the Commission, however, so that it may file, consider and rule upon Dayton\u2019s application for rehearing, and may also make any additional findings and enter any further order it may deem proper, in view of our Memphis and Lancaster decisions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-18\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-5\">.

We may assume it was adopted not only as a matter of convenience but to make possible division of duties among the staff in the administration of the Commission\u2019s burden under the Act.
