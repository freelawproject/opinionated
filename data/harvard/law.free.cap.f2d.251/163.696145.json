In that decision, reported at 26 T.C. 1197, the tax court upheld a $38,304.21 income tax deficiency determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, covering the calendar years 1948 and 1949.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In reaching this decision, the tax court held that the petitioner, Ah Pah Redwood Company, was not entitled to treat as long-term capital gains the receipts from the sale of timber cut and removed from its property by Coast Redwood Company between April 1948 and the end of 1949. The correctness of this ruling presents one of the two questions submitted for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The facts to be considered in determining this question are undisputed. On December 13, 1946, Sage Land &amp; Lumber Company, Inc., (seller) and Union Bond &amp; Trust Company (buyer) entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of certain timberland situated in Humboldt county, California. In October, 1947, immediately after its organization as a corporation, petitioner purchased all of the right, title, and interest of Union Bond &amp; Trust Company in this contract. Petitioner, according to the stipulated facts, then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201c* * * allowed Coast Redwood Co. (an affiliate) to start cutting timber on this tract shortly after purchase and pay $5.00 per thousand feet as removed. This was an oral or implied contract.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Pursuant to this arrangement, Coast began cutting timber on this tract, and, as it did so, paid the stipulated price. This activity continued through the balance of 1947, and throughout 1948 and 1949. On January 9, 1950, petitioner entered into a formal written agreement with Coast, under which the latter company purchased the land and all of the remaining timber covered by the contract of December 13, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Petitioner considered that its receipts from the sale of timber cut by Coast from April, 1948 (six months after petitioner acquired its interest in the tract and timber) to the end of 1949, were reportable as long-term capital gains. The company so reported these receipts in its income tax reports for 1948 and 1949, and claimed the preferential tax treatment accorded such gains, as prescribed by 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C.1939) \u00a7 117. All statutory references in this opinion are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The commissioner held, in his deficiency determination, that these receipts were taxable as ordinary income, instead of capital gains. As before indicated, the tax court concurred in this view.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">It seems to have been the position of both parties in the tax court, and initially in this court, that, if petitioner was entitled to capital-gains treatment on these receipts, it must be by reason of that part of \u00a7 117(j)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which gives application to transactions of the kind described in subsection (k) (2) of the same section. Both respondent and petitioner, therefore, originally turned their attention primarily to subsection (k) (2), the pertinent part of which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">\u201c(2) In the case of the disposal of timber or coal (including lignite), held for more than 6 months prior to such disposal, by the owner thereof under any form or type of contract by virtue of which the owner retains an economic interest in such timber or coal, the difference between the amount received for such timber or coal and the adjusted depletion basis thereof shall be considered as though it were a gain or loss, as the case may be, upon the sale of such timber or coal. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">Petitioner contended that contracts of \u201cdisposal,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (k) (2), were entered into as and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>when the timber was cut and paid for. All receipts from timber cut and paid for more than six months after petitioner obtained its interest in the tract could therefore, according to petitioner, be treated as capital gains. Respondent, on the other hand, argued that the cutting and payment transactions could not be regarded as contracts of \u201cdisposal,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (k) (2), because all such timber had already been disposed of by the act of the parties in entering into the October 1947 arrangement described in the above-quoted stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Both parties recognized that the October 1947 arrangement could not itself qualify as a transaction of the kind described in subsection (k) (2), since it was entered into within six months of the time petitioner acquired its interest in the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The tax court, apparently accepting the issues as tendered by the parties, adopted respondent\u2019s view that the October 1947 arrangement between petitioner and Coast represented a \u201cdisposal\u201d of the timber thereafter cut, so that the later acts of cutting and paying for such timber could not be considered transactions of the kind described in subsection (k) (2). But the tax court, still directing attention to subsection (k) (2), also advanced another reason for holding against petitioner \u2014 a reason which was not urged upon it by respondent. This was that subsection (k) (2) is not applicable in the case of property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, citing \u00a7 117(j) (1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">On appeal, respondent completely disavowed this second reason advanced by the tax court, and pointed to an official ruling to the effect that the tax court decision, in this respect, does not represent the position of the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The result was that, in their initial arguments in this court, both respondent and petitioner took the position, as they had in the tax court, that the controlling issue was whether the \u201cdisposal\u201d of timber took place as and when the timber was cut and paid for, in which event subsection (k) (2) would apply, or at the time of the October 1947 arrangement, in which case subsection (k) (2) would not apply, and petitioner would not be entitled to capital-gains treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Petitioner argued that the October 1947 arrangement, being only a license to cut, coupled with an offer to sell cut timber, and unsupported by consideration, is noncontractual, and therefore not a disposal \u201cunder any form or type of contract,\u201d which is a requirement of subsection (k) (2). It also contended that, even if it be assumed that the October 1947 arrangement is contractual, since it is not in writing it is not binding upon petitioner but is revocable at any time. This being the case, petitioner urged, the arrangement under discussion cannot be considered a \u201cdisposal\u201d of timber, within the meaning of subsection (k) (2). Hence, petitioner reasoned, since the October 1947 arrangement was not a \u201cdisposal\u201d under subsection (k) (2), the later cutting and payment transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>stand undefeated as subsection (k) (2) \u201cdisposals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Respondent, on the other hand, contended that the arrangement of October 1947 was contractual in nature, because the stipulation of facts, quoted above, said it was. Although the October 1947 arrangement was oral, and therefore perhaps revocable under the statute of frauds, respondent pointed out that it was not revoked. Respondent further argued that, while the arrangement in question may have been only a cutting license and not a sale, it was nevertheless a \u201cdisposal,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (k) (2), citing Springfield Plywood Corporation v. Commissioner, 15 T.C. 697. Thus, respondent concluded, there was a \u201cdisposal\u201d of all of the timber in October 1947, and hence there could be no later \u201cdisposal\u201d of the same timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">A new contention, however, was injected into the case when respondent filed its first supplemental brief, responding to appellant\u2019s reply brief. Respondent then contended, for the first time, that if, as petitioner argued, the sales or disposals occurred as the timber was cut and paid for, the transactions involved no retention by the owner of an economic interest in the timber, this being an indispensable requirement under subsection &lt;k) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In our view, the stipulated facts concerning the arrangement between petitioner and Coast, quoted above, indicate that no contract was entered into in October 1947. Under that arrangement, petitioner \u201callowed\u201d Coast to \u201cstart cutting timber\u201d and \u201cpay $5.00 per thousand feet as removed.\u201d Coast was under no obligation to remove any timber, and accepted no risk with respect to timber not removed. Petitioner received no consideration in any form at the time of the October 1947 arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we have not overlooked the concluding words of the quoted stipulation, i. e., \u201cThis was an oral or implied contract.\u201d In view of the immediately-preceding words of the stipulation, which plainly indicate that Coast incurred no contractual obligation at that time, it must be assumed that these last-quoted words refer to the entire transaction. This would include not only the license extended and price quoted in October 1947, but also Coast\u2019s use of the license and acceptance of the offer by cutting and paying for the timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Assuming, as said in Springfield Plywood Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, that a cutting license can be a \u201cdisposal\u201d under subsection (k) (2), it still must be a contractual disposal to meet the requirements of subsection (k) (2). In the Springfield case, the transaction, whether considered a sale or a license, was concededly evidenced by a contract between the owner and the cutter. That is not true here. It follows, therefore, that the October 1947 arrangement was not a \u201cdisposal,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (k) (2), and does not stand in the way of characterizing the later cutting and payment transactions as such \u201cdisposals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">We also hold, however, that these later cutting and payment transactions, which occurred between April 1948 and the end of 1949, were not within subsection (k) (2), because they did not represent disposals in connection with which the owner retained an economic interest in such timber. This, as before noted, is an indispensable requirement of subsection (k) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">If this were the only statutory provision under which the seller of timber could claim capital-gains treatment, the ruling just announced would be conclusive on this phase of the case. Capital-gains treatment is not available to this petitioner under subsection (k) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Noting that the parties, up to and including the filing of first supplemental briefs, seemed to be preoccupied with subsection (k) (2) as a basis for capital-gains treatment, we requested them to submit second supplemental briefs. They were asked to discuss the question of whether capital-gains treatment in the sale of timber is attainable only where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>.the timber is disposed of under a contract by virtue of which the owner retains an economic interest (as provided in subsection (k) (2)), or whether capital-gains treatment is also available under some other statutory provision where timber is disposed of without retention of an economic interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In their second supplemental briefs, both parties call attention to the fact that capital-gains treatment is available for absolute sales of timber (no economic interest being retained) under either subsection (a) (1) or (j) (1) of \u00a7 117, provided that the six-month-holding-period requirement is met, and that the timber was not held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Respondent argues, however, that individual cutting and payment transactions between petitioner and Coast after April 1948 cannot be dealt with as absolute sales, under either of these subsections, since the tax court had stated in its opinion that the timber was held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of such business.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner, on the other hand, contends that these transactions can be dealt with as absolute sales under these subsections of the statute, because the tax court\u2019s statement that the timber was held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is not supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In so far as the record and briefs would indicate, therefore, the only thing which may stand in the way of applying one or the other of these last-mentioned subsections is that petitioner may have been holding the timber primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. If so, the transactions are excluded under the express terms of subsections (a) (1) and (j) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">As before noted, the trial court did not make a finding of fact, as such, on this point. It did, however, make a statement in the course of its opinion, substantially to the effect that the timber was being held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">Respondent and petition are in agreement that there is no evidence in the record to support a finding of fact to this effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> So are we.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">Under normal circumstances, a taxpayer desiring to take advantage of the subsections now under discussion has the burden of proving that he was not holding the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case, however, the factual question concerning petitioner\u2019s purpose in holding the timber was not pertinent to the issues as they were framed in the tax court. Only subsection (k) (2) was then being relied upon, regarding which the purpose in holding the timber was immaterial. Thus, all concerned failed to appreciate the presence of a factual issue which would have to be decided. Under these circumstances, this should not be regarded as a failure of proof for which petitioner must accept sole responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">This presents the further question, however, of whether petitioner is now entitled to rely upon the absolute-sale provisions of subsection (a) (1) or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>(j) (1), having relied only upon subsection (k) (2) in the tax court. The general rule is that for points to be passed upon here, they must have been reserved in the lower court. We should not, however, hesitate to exercise the power and duty to notice error to which the attention of the tax court has not been called, where in exceptional cases this is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice. See Legg\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 114 F.2d 760, 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The fact that subsection (k) (2) makes express reference to timber disposals, while subsections (a) (1) and (j) (1) do not, may account for the sole and, as it turned out, mistaken reliance which counsel for petitioner placed upon subsection (k) (2) in the tax court proceedings. They would not have done so had they appreciated that a transaction consisting of a sale and immediate payment could not qualify under (k) (2) because it would involve no retention of an economic interest. But respondent seemingly shared this misconception at the outset, for he did not call attention to the point until he filed his first supplemental brief in this court. The \u201ceconomic interest\u201d provision of subsection (k) (2) thus constituted a mutually unperceived booby-trap which did not come to light until long after the tax court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">While the circumstance just related may not be sufficiently exceptional to warrant an absolute reversal, we think it sufficiently unique to warrant a remand for further tax court proceedings, if a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. We have no doubts on the latter score. If petitioner did fully qualify for capital-gains treatment under subsection (a) (1) or (j) (1), there was no $38,304.21 deficiency. Insistence that petitioner pay such a nonexistent \u201cdeficiency\u201d (plus the higher penalty assessments associated therewith), because both parties initially cited the wrong subsection of \u00a7 117, would, in our opinion, be a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">We therefore conclude that the case must be remanded, to the tax court for further proceedings and a determination as to whether petitioner was entitled to capital-gains treatment under subsection (a) (1) or (j) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\"> This brings us to the second and last question submitted for our consideration on this review. This is whether petitioner\u2019s claimed depletion allowance for the taxable years 1948 and 1949 should be retroactively adjusted in petitioner\u2019s favor, where it was discovered, in 1952, that the quantity of timber had originally been overstated in a substantial amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">In reporting its income for the taxable years 1948 and 1949, petitioner used a basis for depletion of $3.941566 per thousand board feet. Respondent used the same basis in computing a portion of the deficiencies here in question. Both parties computed the basis for depletion by dividing the amount of timber on the Sage tract, as shown on schedule A of the agreement of December 13, 1946, into the total purchase price paid by petitioner for such timber. In 1952, petitioner first realized that schedule A of the Sage agreement erroneously overstated the quantity of timber by a substantial amount. When petitioner made an actual cruise shortly after logging operations ceased in November of 1954, the overstatement was found to be approximately forty-eight per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">The applicable statute in effect during the years in question was \u00a7 23 (m) (26 U.S.C.A.), which is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The emphasized words in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>statute make clear that the relief which petitioner seeks is not available. The commissioner may not apply a depletion rate, based upon a revised estimate, retroactively to tax years prior to the date of revision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Treasury Regulations 111, \u00a7 29.28 (m)-22, relied upon by petitioner, has no reference to the problem before us. That section of the regulations relates to the matter of <em>revaluation </em>of the basis of timber property as opposed to a redetermination of the <em>quantity </em>of timber, with which \u00a7 29.23 (m)-26 is concerned. A revaluation changes the total depletion to be allowed over the life existence of the wasting asset. A revision of the number of units, on the other hand, leaves the total depletion allowance intact and merely reallocates the'deduction per unit. The last sentence of Treasury Regulations 111, \u00a7 29.23(m)-22, itself, refers the taxpayers specifically to \u00a7 29.23 (m)-26, for the procedure and rules applicable to a revision of the remaining depletive units.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Rust-Owen Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 74 F.2d 18, also relied upon by petitioner, likewise deals primarily with revaluation, although the number of units was necessarily considered in determining total aggregate value.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In Beck v. Commissioner, 15 T.C. 642, affirmed 2 Cir., 194 F.2d 537, the taxpayer was aware of facts which would have required a downward revision of the depletion deduction for the years 1938 through 1941, but did not come forward with the facts. Subsequent to the tax years, the commissioner discovered the facts, and proceeded to revise the depletion allowance for the years involved. Sustaining this action, the court held, in effect, that a downward revision in depletion allowance will be deemed to have been made as of the date that the taxpayer ascertains facts requiring a downward revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Reading together the cited cases, the rule which emerges is that a retroactive adjustment in the depletion allowance is permissible only where there has been suppression of information by the taxpayer. Neither Beck nor any other decision which has come to our attention stands for the proposition, advanced by petitioner, that, if the taxpayer could have ascertained during the taxable years an error in depletion allowance which is adverse to his interests, his later discovery thereof entitles him to retroactive adjustment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">We therefore conclude that the tax court did not err in holding that petitioner\u2019s depletion allowance for the taxable years 1948 and 1949 is not adjustable to reflect the subsequently discovered underrun of timber on the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the tax court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\">. Penalty assessments in the amount of twenty-five per cent of this sum were also made, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C.1939) \u00a7 291, because of the late filing of tax returns for these years. The propriety of making a penalty assessment in this percentage on the amount of tax properly assessable for these years is not questioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">.
