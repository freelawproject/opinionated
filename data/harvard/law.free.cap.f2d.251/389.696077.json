During the Korean War, Time, Inc., publisher of Time magazine, ran a series of defense bond advertisements, sponsored by the United States Government, also entitled \u201cMedal of Honor,\u201d which bore some resemblance to Curtis\u2019 series.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Curtis claimed Time, Inc. appropriated his property, and his proof was (1) the similarity between the two series, and (2) the fact that Curtis had, prior to the Korean War, unsuccessfully attempted to sell his \u201cMedal of Honor\u201d series to Time, Inc., and also to the advertising agency which later prepared the defense bond series.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">The trial court dismissed on the merits. We find no error which would warrant disturbing the action of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">. Curtis\u2019 series each consisted of a strip of ten boxes, each box containing cartoons with narrative captions. The defense bond series each consisted of a single large block of text, with a portrait of the hero, and sometimes a single small cartoon illustration. As we have said, both series had the same title. Both bore a small illustration of the medal. Curtis\u2019 series dealt with World War II heroes, while the defense bond series dealt with Korean War heroes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
