Thereupon the court, having heard the stipulations and examined the pleadings and heard the argument of counsel for both sides, ordered the Writ of Habeas Corpus discharged and the appellant remanded to the custody of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">Here with briefs directed to fully arguing the matter on the merits, appellant urges upon us that the decision was wrong and should be reversed, the appellee that it was right, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">While the questions dealt with are interesting and, on an appeal from a decision on the merits of the case, would engage and receive our careful attention, we do not reach them because of the settled principle that a writ of habeas corpus may not be used to interfere with or interrupt the orderly administration of the criminal laws by a competent court acting within its jurisdiction or as a substitute for the ordinary proceedings of a trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\">The cause is therefore remanded to the District Court with directions: to vacate its order denying petitioner\u2019s application for writ of habeas corpus; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>to dismiss the application without prejudice to the determination of the issues on the merits when they are reached and presented in the orderly administration of justice.
