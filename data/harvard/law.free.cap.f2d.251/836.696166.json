The contract was on the same printed form as that referred to in the Sword case, supra, and some pertinent provisions of which were quoted in footnote 1 to the opinion in that case. A further provision may be noted in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contract further provided that the contractor was to furnish the \u201cswabbing equipment, including swabbing unit, swabbing line and swab.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">The well had been drilled to its required depth of 9,600 feet, and was being swabbed in an effort to bring about the production of gas or oil. The contractor first employed a separate swabbing contractor to do the swabbing work, but took over the work itself when it became evident that it might have to continue for an indefinite period of time. The swabbing operation by the contractor had been going on for about eight days when the swabbing line broke. At the time of the break, the contractor\u2019s employee, Hurst, at the direction of his driller, was spooling the swabbing line. The unit was pulling on the swab which was about 9,400 feet in the hole. It had pulled it \u201capproximately four or five hundred foot of stretch before the line broke.\u201d A part of the line struck Mr. Hurst and he was severly injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>\u25a0 Negligence on the part of Gulf was charged: in. failing to provide a safe place \u25a0 to work, in failing to provide proper- supervision, of. the work; in permitting .the contractor to use a defective swabbing line, a drum which was too small, a sheave which was too small, a groove in the sheave which was too large, or to 'hang the sheave improperly, or otherwise negligently to install the apparatus. No Gulf equipment was involved. ' No Gulf representative had attempted to direct the performance of the work. No Gulf employee was present when Hurst-was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Glenn Stach, Gulf\u2019s drilling foreman, was its representative at this well. He knew that the swabbing line, which was new, had developed a kink and that that had been corrected by splicing the line. The line did not break in the splice or anywhere near it, and the splicing of the line had nothing to do with the accident. If Stach, as Gulf\u2019s representative, had been charged with any duty of supervision owed to the contractor\u2019s employees, he might have discovered that the drum was too small, the sheave too small, the groove in the sheave too large, and the apparatus improperly installed, \u2014all tending to cause unnecessary bending and fatigue of the % inch steel swabbing line and probably resulting in its finally breaking; or, if he had not been absent from the well at the time, .he might have seen that Hurst, an eighteen year old employee of the contractor, was working in a dangerous place. Actually, neither Gulf, nor its representative Stach, undertook to supervise or control the method of work or the direction of the contractor\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the district court formally denied Gulf\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. It submitted the case to the jury under instructions, however, which, when followed by the jury, precluded a verdict for the plaintiff. For example, the court charged the jury, \u201cIf you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Gulf Oil Corporation did nothing with reference to the selection or direction of use of the wire line which broke, then your verdict will be for the defendant.\u201d The undisputed evidence was that Gulf had not done anything with reference to the selection or direction of use of that wire line. There were other instructions which made a verdict for the plaintiffs practically impossible. After the jury had returned its verdict for the defendant, the district court entered judgment not only on that verdict, but also forthrightly on Gulf\u2019s motion for judgment based upon the reasons and grounds which had been stated in its motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">It is not necessary to repeat what has just been said in the Sword case footnote 1, supra, further than to restate two of the rulings reached in that opinion: (1) In the absence of any actual control of the operation, or of any reserved right of control more than that deemed necessary to secure the satisfactory completion of the work, an employer of an independent contractor owes no duty to the contractor\u2019s employees to inspect or to supervise the installation or operation of the machinery furnished by the contractor. (2) In Texas, the rule that an employer of an independent contractor is liable to third persons for negligence of the contractor in the performance of work inherently dangerous does not extend to employees of the independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Under the evidence in this case, the jury could not properly hold the employer of the independent contractor liable for injury to the employee of that contractor. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AD_\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-13\">. Sword v.

Completion Test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoNs\">\u201cContractor agrees, when making a completion test of this well, to run tubing and to swab the well at the request of Gulf for a length of time sufficient to make certain that the hole is free of drill mud or drilling water or both.
