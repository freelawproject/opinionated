She has served only part of her sentence and is now a mental patient in St. Elizabeths Hospital. She contends her conviction and sentence were invalid and asks release in habeas corpus. In a previous habeas corpus case, Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U.S. 341, 72 S.Ct. 699, 96 L.Ed. 988, the Supreme Court sustained her conviction and sentence. She asks us to treat that decision as overruled by Reid v. Covert (Kinsella v. Krueger), 354 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148. But we deem ourselves bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Madsen case itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
