Inasmuch as the petitioner is now confined in the Federal Penitentiary under a valid and unexpired judgment of a federal court, it is conclusively sufficient to say that he is not legally entitled to the relief sought here. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
