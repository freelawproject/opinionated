Following cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 complaint when the appellants sought to set aside the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-20\">Bedney was stricken on November 10, 1955, while engaged with a co-worker in removing scaffolding. The co-worker on a third floor level was handing down to Bedney, on the ground, planks weighing some 90 pounds each. The Deputy Commissioner concluded that this was strenuous work, one of the findings said to lack substantial support in the record. There was no question, however, that Bedney collapsed while on the job. It was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>that he had suffered a paralysis of his right side due to occlusion of a cerebral vessel and that his \u201cstrenuous work\u201d had accelerated a severe pre-existing, but symptom-free, diastolic hypertension. Also diagnosed was a sclerosis of the cerebral arteries. There was much conflicting medical testimony, not unusual in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">The case really turned upon whether or not Bedney\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. Section 20 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 920(a), provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-5\">\u201cIn any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-6\">\u201c(a) That the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">We have given effect to the statute thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-8\">\u201cThat the injury occurs in the course of the employment strengthens the presumption that it arises out of it. Moreover, \u2018where there is doubt, it should be resolved in favor of the injured employee or his dependent family.\u2019 But it is unnecessary to rely on general presumptions as to the correctness of the findings.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-9\"> Quite apart from the presumption which obviously places the burden of proof upon the appellants, we are satisfied that the findings of the District Court do not lack substantial support in the evidence on the record considered as a whole. In this respect and on this account, we think the case comes within principles outlined in O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-11\">. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v.
