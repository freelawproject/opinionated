Appellee was incorporated in 1903 under the name of \u201cThe Edward Katzinger Company\u201d and began using the mark \u201cEkco\u201d (obviously taken from the name of the company) in connection with kitchen and household tools and utensils in 1904. In 1944, the corporate name was changed to \u201cEkco Products Company,\u201d which name is presently that of appellee. In the latter part of 1951, appellee acquired the assets of the Minute Mop Company of Chicago, which at that time had been engaged in the manufacture and sale of mops and various other cleaning implements, including brushes, scouring pads and the like, since July, 1941. The business of the Minute Mop Company has been continued since the date of acquisition by appellee as a division of the latter. Appellee had not, before its acquisition of the Minute Mop assets, ever manufactured or sold mops, brushes and the like. It was further stipulated that, since 1944, appellee has spent upwards of 5 million dollars in advertising its products under the trade-mark \u201cEkco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Appellant was organized as the \u201cW. E. Kautenberg Company\u201d in 1922 and has been continuously since that time in the business of manufacturing and selling mop holders, mops, mopsticks, cellulose sponge mop units, etc. Its earliest use of \u201cWekco,\u201d the mark sought to be registered, was in 1949. It was stipulated that appellant has spent \u201cmany thousands of dollars\u201d in advertising and the like in connection with the marketing of \u201cWekco\u201d products.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Appellee, in opposing this registration, relies on its registrations of \u201cEkco\u201d and \u201cEkcoware\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for kitchen cutlery, pots, pans, kettles, shovels, ice cream dishes and molds and other kitchen utensils. While its use of \u201cEkco\u201d in conjunction with \u201cMinute Mop\u201d on the packages of its mops has been set forth in the record, it does not rely on such use in its opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">Reduced to its simplest terms, this ease presents the question of whether appellee, owner of the mark \u201cEkco\u201d as applied to kitchen utensils generally, may successfully oppose the registration to appellant of the mark \u201cWekco\u201d as applied to mops and related products (the latter mark having been first used subsequent to the former) based upon the confusion-in-trade clause of \u00a7 2 of the Lanham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Act, 60 Stat. 428 (1946), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The Assistant Commissioner was of the opinion that mops and mop heads \u201care a \u2018normal,\u2019 \u2018usual\u2019 or \u2018expected\u2019 expansion of opposer\u2019s line of houseware items\u201d and that, therefore, there was likelihood of confusion. We feel constrained to agree with the decision rendered below. Though appellant\u2019s mark has a \u201cW\u201d added to \u201cEkco,\u201d we are of the opinion that this is not sufficient to distinguish its mark from the \u201cEkco\u201d of appellee. The marks are similar in appearance, sound and spelling and would not be likely to be distinguished by the average purchaser of the merchandise involved. Secondly, the marks were each derived from the initials of the corporate names of appellant and appellee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and present a strange and unusual combination of letters and should be classed, therefore, in the category of coined or fanciful names.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">It is well settled that coined or fanciful marks should be given a much broader degree of protection than words in common use. Intercontinental Mfg. Co. v. Continental Motors Corp., 230 F.2d 621, 43 C.C.P.A., Patents, 841. As stated by Callman, 3 Callman, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (2d ed. 1950) at 1504:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\"><em>\u201c\u00bb </em>* * if fhe mark is weak, its protection may have an \u201cextremely narrow scope\u201d; and may indeed be limited to similar goods similarly marketed. Only the strong mark will be protected against infringements<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> arising out of its use in connection with noncompeting goods. * \"* \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\"> It is in the area of noncompeting goods that the often discussed concept of the \u201cnatural expansion of business\u201d arises, a concept relied upon by the Assistant Commissioner in her decision sustaining the opposition below. This concept has been said to have two aspects: (1) the possibility that the trade practices of the second user may stain the owner\u2019s reputation in the minds of his customers; and (2) the possibility that at some time in the future he may wish to extend his business into that market which the second user has begun to exploit. See S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., v. Johnson, 2 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 176, 179, 180. The first aspect, which represents merely another facet of the subject of confusion-in-trade, is the one with which we are here concerned. The confusion involved, of course, is not a confusion of goods but a confusion of business; the deceived customer here buys one party\u2019s product in the belief that it originates with the other party or that it is in some way affiliated with the other party\u2019s business. 3 Callman, supra, at p. 1539. He does this reasonably thinking that the one party has expanded his business into the field covered by the other party\u2019s mark. The question, in the last analysis, is no different from that presented by the ordinary case involving competing goods: is the public likely to be confused as to the origin of the goods by the concurrent use of the two marks involved ?</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">In the instant case, we believe that this question must be answered in the affirmative. There is no question but that the goods of each party are sold in the same outlets to the same class of customers (housewives, generally speaking) . The goods of each party are in the relatively low-priced field and not apt to be purchased with any considerable degree of discrimination on the purchasers\u2019 part. While the goods covered by appellee\u2019s registrations do not embrace mops and the like, the field covered thereby is so extensive in the area of household <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>utensils that it would be probable that one purchasing appellant\u2019s mops would conclude that appellee had some connection with the manufacture or sale thereof (viz. \u2014 that appellee had expanded into the field of mops).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">We do not wish to convey the impression by what we have stated above that where one enters into a field such as the manufacture and sale of household utensils, he thereby preempts the field as to every item used in a house. We do feel, however, that, in a situation where facts such as those above set forth exist, and where a party has spent upwards of 5 million dollars in advertising, has built up a substantial reputation with respect to the mark used in connection with his products and the mark is as strong and distinctive a mark as is appellee\u2019s, that this court will not view lightly possible encroachment upon that party\u2019s good will by a newcomer in the field. The line of separation between \u201cEkco\u201d and \u201cWelcco,\u201d as used with relation to the respective products with which they are connected, is too fine to permit their concurrent use.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Appellant\u2019s arguments have been carefully considered but do not dissuade us from the conclusion we have reached. Its contention that no trademark use of \u201cEkco\u201d on appellee\u2019s \u201cMinute Mops\u201d has been shown is immaterial to the case in the view we have taken of it. That there has been no actual confusion between the marks is, of course, not conclusive in an opposition proceeding; while this court has on occasion given weight to the absence of actual confusion in the determination of likelihood of confusion, Myers v. Polk Miller Products Corp., 201 F.2d 373, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 739; Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co. v. International Industries Inc., 142 F.2d 1016, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1109, it is well settled that actual confusion need not be shown in a proceeding such as this, the ultimate consideration being likelihood of confusion, Celanese Corp. of America v. E. I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co., 154 F.2d 146, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 948; Bielzoff Products Co. v. White Horse Distillers, Ltd., 107 F.2d 583, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 722. We are of the opinion that the peculiar facts of this case override any consideration which might be given to the absence of proof of actual confusion. Appellant\u2019s further contention that appellee\u2019s marks are classified differently from appellant\u2019s mark in the Patent Office is without significance in this case. Harlan-Wallins Coal Corp. v. Transcontinental Oil Co., 64 F.2d 122, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">.
