To the extent that they are, this case is ruled by Dinwiddie v. Brown (Roark v. West), 230 F.2d 465, in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-18\">\u201cHere the only defendants who acted under the color of state law were the state officers who issued process and levied execution in the Dinwiddie case, and we may presume for the sake of argument, did the same in the Roark case. Although both complaints alleged generally that all the defendants conspired to deprive the respective plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws, there is no allegation that the state officers named therein acted to the plaintiffs\u2019 damage in any manner other than in the ordinary performance of their duties. Merely characterizing their conduct as conspiratorial or unlawful does not set out allegations upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>relief can be granted. Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 8, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497; McGuire v. Todd, 5 Cir., 198 F.2d 60; Morgan v. Sylvester, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 125 F.Supp. 380.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-4\">\u201cStripping the complaints of this verbiage, there is left, at most, only the allegations of the obtaining of a fraudulent judgment by private individuals, and the completely extraneous allegation that Texas' segregation laws operate to deprive these plaintiffs of their constitutional rights. The two real property actions in question here had no connection with the enforcement of such laws. Likewise the allegation that as a result of these laws an attitude of white supremacy is fostered, tending to degrade the Negro and make his oath worthless in state court, is totally beside the point because there is no allegation that any Negroes testified in the state actions, on either side, or even that these plaintiffs were in any way prejudiced in these particular actions because of their race. Rather, the allegations appear to have been inserted in each complaint merely to give a state cause of action the appearance of a suit under the civil rights acts. The circumstances that the parties were of different races could not, of course, operate to convert these torts into federal causes of action.\u201d 230 F.2d 465, 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">To the extent that the complaint alleges a breach of trust against the defendant, it, of course, does not assert a claim on which relief can be granted in a federal court, even though one of the defendants is a state official. See Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651, 71 S.Ct. 937, 95 L.Ed. 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">We conclude that the complaint as amended fails to assert a claim of which the district court had jurisdiction, and the judgment of the trial court in dismissing it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
