Section 151 et seq. Section 8(b) provides that \u201cit shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents \u2014 \u25a0 * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">\u201c (4) to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: (A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or any employer or other person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">A summary of the pertinent facts, some of which were stipulated by the parties and others determined by the trial examiner and adopted by the Board, are: On September 26, 1955, the Cara-dine Company, Inc., the employer, a wholesale grocer, was struck by the respondent. Respondent established a picket line at the employer\u2019s warehouse. Until February 1, 1956, the picketing was confined to the warehouse but subsequently, for a period of approximately a month, respondent extended its picketing to employer\u2019s truck delivery operations. Pickets of the respondent during this period followed the employer\u2019s trucks on their delivery routes, and wherever the trucks stopped to make a delivery to employer\u2019s customers the pickets would patrol near the trucks. Such ambulatory picketing took place at or near the place of business of about forty-eight of the employer\u2019s customers. At about ten other customer establishments such ambulatory picketing extended away from the immediate orbit of the trucks and across or toward the entrance of the customers\u2019 places of business. This picketing was conducted at times when many of the customers\u2019 establishments had employees of their own working on thier respective premises. On two occasions respondent appealed to the employer\u2019s customers to refuse delivery of its merchandise, and when the customers complied with these requests withdrew the pickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>We take the view that the Board was justified by the evidence in finding that the ambulatory picketing \u201c * * * was intended, at least in part, to induce and encourage the employees of secondary employers to engage in a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to handle Caradine\u2019s products or to quit work with an object of forcing the secondary employers to cease doing business with Caradine.\u201d This was in violation of Section 8(b)(4)(A) of the National Labor Relations Board Act. See National Labor Relations Board v. United Steelworkers of America, 1 Cir., 250 F.2d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
