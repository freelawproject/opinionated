Alison, first assistant engineer on respondent\u2019s Liberty ship \u201cJohn A. Quitman,\u201d disappeared after the ship docked at a pier in the Elbe River opposite Hamburg, Germany. His body was recovered from the harbor more than six weeks later. Respondent concedes that his death resulted from drowning. Libelant, his widow, brought this action as a Suit in Admiralty against the United States under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 741 et seq., alleging that Alison fell to his death from the ship\u2019s unseaworthy gangplank. The district court dismissed her libel on the merits, concluding that she had failed to prove any causal relation between the death and the alleged unseaworthiness of the gangplank or the alleged negligence of the respondent. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 150 F.Supp. 308. She appeals from this determination and from the court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The \u201cJohn A. Quitman\u201d docked at Hamburg in the late afternoon of February 15, 1952. The weather was cold and snow was falling. The ship\u2019s chief mate had a temporary gangplank constructed for access to the pier. The gangplank and the surrounding area were well lighted. There was a sharp conflict in testimony concerning the seaworthiness of the gangplank. Libelant\u2019s witnesses stated that it had no handrails and was slippery. Respondent\u2019s witnesses claim that it was adequate and had lines on either side for railings. The pier itself was a concrete wall. Behind the wall was an open yard area some 250 or 300 feet wide bounded by a fence and a road. A tavern called the \u201cDc. und Ich\u201d was located across the road between 60 and 100 feet from a gate in the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">Alison\u2019s actions that evening are the subject of conflicting testimony. Sometime early in the evening Alison went ashore ostensibly to have a few drinks in the \u201cDu und Ich\u201d and then to return to the ship to stand watch. He was seen in the tavern by its owner sometime around 8:00 p. m. Two of libelant\u2019s witnesses stated that sometime between 9:00 and 9:30 p. m. they met Alison dressed in working clothes returning to the ship. Supposedly they spoke with him, and he informed them that he was returning to stand his watch. They also testified that he was sober at the time. One of these witnesses stated that he met Alison approximately 100 feet from the ship\u2019s gangplank. Respondent\u2019s witnesses testified that they saw Alison in the \u201cDu und Ich\u201d around 8:00 p. m. and again between 10:00 and 11:30 p. m., and that Alison was drinking. Another of respondent\u2019s witnesses, the German watchman located forward of the gangplank aboard the ship, testified that he never observed Alison return to the ship. The next time Alison was seen was when his body was recovered on April 9, 1952:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">It is libelant\u2019s contention that Alison was returning to his duties aboard ship early in the evening and in a sober condition. This conclusion is based on testimony that he was seen in working clothes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>only 100 feet from the ship and that he said he was returning to stand his watch. Libelant then points to the alleged unseaworthiness of the gangplank and concludes that the only reasonable explanation for her husband\u2019s drowning was that he fell from the defective gangplank while trying to board the ship. She cites Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 350 U.S. 523, 76 S.Ct. 608, 100 L.Ed. 668, as requiring this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The district court rejected most of the testimony of libelant\u2019s witnesses. It found that Alison, under the influence of intoxicants, was in the \u201cDu und Ieh\u201d tavern at 8:00 p. m. and again between 10:00 and 11:30 p. m. In its view libel-ant failed to prove that Alison returned to his ship on that night or at any other time, or boarded the ship\u2019s gangplank and slipped from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On appeal Mrs. Alison would have us believe her witnesses, discount the testimony of respondent\u2019s witnesses, and entertain all possible presumptions in her favor. In other words she would have us try this case as a jury. But this is not our province. \u201cIn reviewing a judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury in admiralty, the Court of Appeals may not set aside the judgment below unless it is clearly erroneous. No greater scope of review is exercised by the appellate tribunals in admiralty cases than they exercise under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [Citations omitted.] A finding is clearly erroneous when \u2018although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20. Here we are left with no such \u201cdefinite and firm conviction.\u201d The district court saw and heard many of the witnesses. Its findings, in large part, reflect its estimate of the credibility of the witnesses. Certainly there is substantial evidence supporting these findings. To overturn them we must discount testimony given at the trial and believe testimony rejected by the district court. We are unwilling to substitute our judgment of credibility for that of the district court. Petterson Lighterage &amp; Towing Corp. v. New York Cent. R. Co., 2 Cir., 126 F.2d 992. And unless libelant\u2019s witnesses are believed and respondent\u2019s disbelieved, there is no occasion to consider the applicability of the favorable presumptions of Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, 350 U.S. 523, 76 S.Ct. 608, 100 L.Ed. 668, or similar cases cited by libelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">One week after final judgment and over four years after the filing of the libel, libelant moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The substance of this new evidence is contained in an affidavit by Leslie G. Rathbun, Jr., offered in support of the motion. Rathbun was Master of the \u201cJohn A. Quitman\u201d at the time Alison drowned. He was not a witness at trial, but stated in his affidavit that he investigated Alison\u2019s disappearance. His statements tend to support libelant\u2019s story that Alison, in a sober condition, left the \u201cDu und Ich\u201d tavern early in the evening to return to the ship. Rathbun\u2019s conclusions are based on statements ostensibly made to him by a \u201cwoman in the bar,\u201d various crew members, and a watchman located at the gate to the pier area. Rathbun\u2019s testimony also supported libel-ant\u2019s contentions concerning the unseaworthiness of the gangplank. And in an additional letter to Mrs. Alison\u2019s attorney, Rathbun indicated his willingness to testify to other facts which could be evidence of respondent\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\"> The district court denied the motion on the ground that libelant had failed to show \u201cthat the claimed newly discovered evidence was not discoverable in time for trial by diligent effort.\u201d This of course is a necessary requirement, Colonial Book Co. v. Amsco School Publications, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 48 F.Supp. 794, affirmed 2 Cir., 142 F.2d 362. Here Mrs. Alison could have obtained Captain Rathbun\u2019s statement sooner during the four years which elapsed between pleadings and trial had she exercised reasonable efforts to locate him. She failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>do this, and the district court\u2019s decision was well within its discretion. 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 3784 (2d Ed.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Moreover, it does not appear that Rathbun\u2019s testimony would prove the causal connection between Alison\u2019s death and the alleged unseaworthiness of the ship. His testimony was based on hearsay and surmise, and even if admissible, see Pekelis v. Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, Inc., 2 Cir., 187 F.2d 122, 23 A.L.R. 2d 1349, certiorari denied Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, Inc., v. Pekelis, 341 U.S. 951, 71 S.Ct. 1020, 95 L.Ed. 1374, would be entitled to little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
