The same mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>rial facts and the same issues are involved in each of these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Walter Brand\u00e9is and Loyal B. Cohn each acquired a substantial block of J. L. Brand\u00e9is &amp; Sons Corporation stock by virtue of the provisions of the will of their uncle, Hugo Brand\u00e9is. They sold such stock in 1949. The sale price is undisputed. The controversy centers upon the determination of the basis to be used in computing long term capital gain for income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Section 113(a)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 113 (a)(5), provides that the basis of property acquired by bequest \u201cshall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such acquisition.\u201d All parties agree that the statute just quoted controls. The sole issue involved on these appeals is the determination of the time of acquisition of the stock sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The District Court, upholding the Government\u2019s contention, determined that the taxpayers acquired the stock within the meaning of section 113(a) (5) on the date of the death of the testator, Hugo Brand\u00e9is, to wit, July 21, 1912. If the court is right in such determination, the parties agree that since such date is prior to March 1, 1913, the effective date of the income tax laws, the applicable basis under section 113 (a) (14) would be the March 1, 1913, value. Subject to the taxpayers reserving the right to appeal from the court\u2019s determination that March 1, 1913, was to be used as the valuation date, the March 1, 1913, value of the stock has been stipulated, and tax has been paid using the March 1, 1913, value as the basis. The Brand\u00e9is stock has substantially increased in value since March 1, 1913, and if some subsequent date is to be used as the basis a substantial tax refund would be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Taxpayers contend that the time of acquisition of the stock by them was July 29, 1946, the date of the death of Lyela Brand\u00e9is, the widow of Hugo Brand\u00e9is, who was given a life estate in the stock. They base such claim upon the fact that the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Brandeis v. Brandeis, 150 Neb. 222, 34 N.W.2d 159, determined that it was the intention of the testator, Hugo Brand\u00e9is, that, in the event either or both of his brothers who were given a remainder interest in the stock died before the death of the testator\u2019s widow, Lyela, the share given to any brother so dying should go to the lawful male heirs of such brother, determined as of the date of the death of the life tenant, Lyela Brand\u00e9is. Giving effect to such expressed intention, the Nebraska court held taxpayers each took a <em>Vs </em>interest in the stock as a male heir of testator\u2019s deceased brother Emil by reason of meeting the test of being a lawful male heir of Emil at the time of Lyela Brandeis\u2019s death in 1946. Taxpayers state that the acquisition of the stock was the result of the determination of heirship of a person other than the testator, to wit testator\u2019s brother Emil, and that such determination was to be made as of the date of the death of the testator's widow, and hence the doctrine of \u201crelation back\u201d is not applicable. Taxpayers assert that they had no interest at all in the stock prior to the death of Lyela Brand\u00e9is in 1946, but at most had a bare expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">The pertinent facts as summarized by Judge Donohoe in his unpublished opinion are:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">\u201cIn 1901, the J. L. Brand\u00e9is &amp; Sons Corporation was formed and the stock issued to J. L. Brand\u00e9is and his sons in the following proportions:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">J. L. Brand\u00e9is----------1,000 Shares</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Arthur Brand\u00e9is--------1,000 Shares</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">Emil Brand\u00e9is----------1,000 Shares</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">Hugo Brand\u00e9is--------- 500 Shares</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">\u201cJ. L. Brand\u00e9is had only one other child, a daughter, Sarah Brand\u00e9is Cohn. When J. L. Brand\u00e9is died his stock was distributed equally between his three sons; consequently Hugo Brand\u00e9is increased his holdings to 833% shares. These 833% shares, as increased by nontaxable stock split-ups, are the subject of concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u201cOn July 21, 1912, Hugo Brand\u00e9is died leaving a validly executed and probated will which contained the following provision relating to his Brand\u00e9is stock:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">\u201c T give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Lyela Brand\u00e9is, for her sole use and benefit during her natural life, all of the capital stock of J. L. Brand\u00e9is &amp; Sons, now owned by me and hereafter acquired; and, at her death, said stock shall pass to and vest absolutely in my brothers, Arthur D. Brand\u00e9is and Emil Brand\u00e9is, in equal proportions. Should either of my said brothers die during the life-time of my wife, his lawful male heirs, as of the date of her death, shall take his share.'</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cE mil Brand\u00e9is predeceased Hugo Brand\u00e9is and left neither a widow nor issue. Consequently Arthur Brand\u00e9is assumed that he was exclusively entitled, under Hugo\u2019s will, to the remainder interest in the stock. He purchased the life interest that Lyela Brand\u00e9is had and the 833/ shares of stock were reissued in his name. Arthur Brand\u00e9is died on June 10, 1916, and J. L. Ervine Brand\u00e9is, who is still alive, claimed as Arthur\u2019s heir and the stock was reissued in the name of J. L. Ervine Brand\u00e9is.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\u201cSarah Brand\u00e9is Cohn died October 31, 1936, and left two sons, Walter Brand\u00e9is and Loyal B. Cohn, who are still living. When Lyela Brand\u00e9is died on July 29, 1946, Walter Brand\u00e9is and Loyal B. Cohn instituted an action to establish the right of each of them under Hugo Brand\u00e9is\u2019 will, to one-sixth of the 833/ shares of stock originally held by Hugo Brand\u00e9is. The other two-thirds, they conceded, rightfully belonged to J. L. Ervine Brand\u00e9is, who claimed all 833/ shares. The action was terminated by a decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska holding that within the beforequoted provision of Hugo Brand\u00e9is\u2019 will, J. L. Ervine Brand\u00e9is, Loyal B. Cohn and Walter Brand\u00e9is were the lawful male heirs of Emil Brand\u00e9is on the death of Lyela Brand\u00e9is and were entitled to share and share alike one-half of the 833/ shares of stock; the other one-half concededly belonging exclusively to J. L. Ervine Brand\u00e9is. Brandeis v. Brandeis, 150 Neb. 222, 34 N.W.2d 159.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">We agree with the taxpayers that they acquired no vested interest in the stock at the time of Hugo Brandeis\u2019s death. As taxpayers point out, many uncertain events had to occur before they could come into possession of the stock, among them: (a) the death of Arthur Brand\u00e9is prior to the death of Lyela Brand\u00e9is (Arthur Brand\u00e9is would during his lifetime be the sole male heir of his deceased brother Emil); (b) the death of Sarah Brand\u00e9is Cohn, the taxpayers\u2019 mother, prior to the death of Lyela Brand\u00e9is (The taxpayers could not be heirs of their uncle Emil under Nebraska law as long as their mother survived); (c) Taxpayers had to outlive the life tenant, Lyela Brand\u00e9is, in which event the portion they would take would depend upon the number of male heirs surviving the life tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">However, the foregoing events did all occur, and taxpayers each ultimately, by virtue of the provisions of the will of Hugo Brand\u00e9is, obtained full title to <em>Ve, </em>of the Brand\u00e9is stock owned by Hugo Brand\u00e9is at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">The decision in these cases turns upon the meaning of the words \u201cthe time of such acouisition\u201d as they appear in section 113(a)(5). Section 29.113(a)(5)-1 of Treasury Regulations 111, promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">\u201cSec. 29.113(a) (5)-l. <em>Basis of Property Acquired by Bequest, Devise, Or Inheritance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-16\">\u201c(b) <em>Basis </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-17\">\u201c(1) * * * gjnce, under the law governing wills and the distribution of the property of decedents, all titles to property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance relate back to the death of the decedent, even though the interest of him who takes the title was, at the date of the death of the decedent, legal, equitable, vested, contingent, gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>al, specific, residual, conditional, ex-ecutory, or otherwise, the time of the acquisition of such property is the death of the decedent. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The regulation just quoted is in substance the same as Article 113(a)(5)-1(b) of Treasury Regulations 86, promulgated under the 1934 Act, which is the regulation considered by the Supreme Court in Helvering v. Reynolds, 313 U.S. 428, 61 S.Ct. 971, 85 L.Ed. 1438. In the Reynolds case the Court concedes that the word \u201cacquisition\u201d in its statutory setting is ambiguous. The legislative history of the applicable statute is considered and prior interpretations of the statute are discussed. In upholding the regulation as a proper interpretation of the words \u201ctime of such acquisition,\u201d as appearing in section 113(a)(5), the Court states (313 U.S. at pages 433-434, 61 S.Ct. at page 973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201c * * * The definition of \u2018acquisition\u2019 contained in the regulation is not a strained or artificial one. * * * So the test in this type of case is not whether respondent had full enjoyment of the property prior to the delivery of the securities to him but whether he earlier had acquired an interest which ultimately ripened into complete ownership. Respondent has become the taxpayer because he has obtained full ownership of the property and has sold it. The tax is on gains, if any, realized by him in that transaction. Hence, as we indicated in the Maguire [Maguire v. Commissioner, 313 U.S. 1, 61 S.Ct. 789, 85 L.Ed. 1149] and Campbell cases [Helvering v. Campbell, 313 U.S. 15, 61 S.Ct. 798, 85 L.Ed. 1159], to carry into that computation the value of the property at the time the taxpayer had only a contingent remainder interest in it is not to tax him on values which he never received. The statute as thus interpreted \u2018merely provides a rule of thumb ,in alleviation of a fax which would be computed by .reference tto\u201e the entire amount of the original inheritance were it to be based on the cost to the taxpayer.\u2019 Helvering v. Campbell, supra, 313 U.S. at page 22, 61 S.Ct. at page 802, 85 L.Ed. 1159. As stated by Judge Arant in Augustus v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 118 F.2d 38, 43, the regulation was an \u2018apt interpretation to make this part of the statute fit efficiently and consistently into the, scheme of the revenue system as a whole.\u2019 See Maguire v. Commissioner, supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s suggestion that the regulation does not cover this case will not stand analysis. It has a broad sweep and embraces all interests which have their origin in a bequest, devise, or inheritance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">The trial court took the position that the Reynolds case controlled upon the disputed issue in these cases. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Additional support for the result we reach is found in Augustus v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 118 F.2d 38; Van Vranken v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 115 F.2d 709. In said cases attention is called to the fact that the interpretation made by the regulations makes the statute fit consistently into the scheme of the revenue system as a whole. The decedent\u2019s estate pays a tax based upon the value o-f the assets on the date of decedent\u2019s death. The statute as construed by the regulations makes provision for the taxing of the increase in value occurring subsequent to the decedent\u2019s death. Under the interpretation insisted upon by the taxpayers, no provision would exist for taxing the increase in value subsequent to decedent\u2019s death to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">In Helvering v. Campbell, 313 U.S. 15, 61 S.Ct. 798, 85 L.Ed. 1159, the issue involved was the basis to be used in determining the gain or loss from the sale of property acquired by bequest. The Court states (313 U.S. at pages 21-22, 61 S.Ct. at page 802):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFJ\">\u201c * * * we are dealing only with a point of reference and a standard of value for determination of gains or losses realized on subsequent sales of property acquired by bequestj devise, or inheritance. For that purpose distinctions between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>vested and contingent remainders or between absolute and conditional property interests have no relevancy. Each remainderman has become the taxpayer because he has obtained possession and control of the property and has sold it. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 117, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604, a case involving estate tax, the Court calls attention to the wide diversity of opinion expressed by the courts in construing instruments creating remainders and other common law property interests, and states that the bringing of such controversies into the administration of tax laws would preclude a fair and workable tax system. See also Van Vranken v. Helvering, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Taxpayers in their brief state, \u201cWe do not, however, wish to be regarded as assailing the Treasury Regulation. It has already been upheld in Helvering v. Reynolds * * * as applied to the facts of that case.\u201d They then go on to say that the regulation can not be construed to contradict the statute which it interprets. We have no quarrel with taxpayers\u2019 contention that a regulation can not be construed to contravene the applicable statute. However, such is not the situation here. As previously pointed out, the Supreme Court in the Reynolds case, supra, determined that the regulation properly construes the statute with respect to \u201ctime of such acquisition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In our present cases, as in the Reynolds case, it was because of the provisions of the will that the taxpayers acquired the property and became the taxpayers. The taxpayers have realized the full gain in value of the stock that has accrued since March 1, 1913. If the gain is not taxed to the taxpayers here, it will not be taxed to anyone. It seems reasonably clear that Congress intended the recipient of a devise or inheritance to pay the tax on the gain accruing since the decedent\u2019s death regardless of whether the interest created by the will in the taxpayers was originally vested or contingent or otherwise uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">There is nothing about the Nebraska decision establishing taxpayers\u2019 rights in the stock which requires a contrary result. The Commissioner has recognized the ownership of the stock as established by the Nebraska court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">We have here before us for construction a federal revenue statute. The taxpayers do not challenge the right of Congress to tax the gain here involved. They concede that if Congress had used the words \u201cdate of the decedent\u2019s death,\u201d found in section 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1014, rather than the words \u201ctime of such acquisition,\u201d used in section 113(a) (5), the tax involved here would be due. Federal courts are authorized to construe federal statutes. The Reynolds case, supra, has approved the regulation interpreting the words \u201cthe time of such acquisition\u201d as equivalent to the words \u201cthe date of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d Hence, the change in the words of the applicable statute brought about no change in meaning. This is corroborated by the legislative history of section 1014. The House Ways and Means Committee Report on said section, 1954 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, Vol. 3, p. 4407, reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">\u201cThis section corresponds to section 113(a) (5) of the 1939 Code providing in substance that the basis of property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance or by the decedent\u2019s estate from the decedent is the fair market value of such property at the date of the decedent\u2019s death * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Similar language appears in the Senate Report, <em>id. </em>at p. 5065.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">We are satisfied that the trial court correctly determined that, under sections 113(a) (5) and 113(a) (14) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the basis to be used in determining the long term capital gain realized by the taxpayers from the sale of the Brand\u00e9is stock acquired by them from the estate of Hugo Brand\u00e9is was the fair market value of the stock on March 1, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-14\">. The wives of Walter Brand\u00e9is and Loyal B. Cohn are made parties because joint tax returns were filed. Since the husbands inherited the stock here involved, we shall for the purposes of this opinion refer to the husbands as the taxpayers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
