The employees of the station worked as announcers, engineers and announcer-engineers. Among other things they had duties in connection with the Associated Press news reports, operation and maintenance of transmission equipment, preparation of commercials and sale of advertising for the station. These facts brought appellant\u2019s employees within the coverage of the Act. Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 1951, 342 U.S. 143, 72 S.Ct. 181, 96 L.Ed. 162; Associated Press v. United States, 1945, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013; Associated Press v. N.L.R.B., 1937, 301 U.S. 103, 57 S.Ct. 650, 81 L.Ed. 953. There was substantial proof, accepted by the court sitting without a jury, of violations of the Act. Appellant\u2019s contention that application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to him violates the Fifth Amendment is without merit. Though the station has been closed it is conceded that appellant is still interested in at least two other radio stations. In one of these he possesses a fifty per cent partnership interest. The other is a corporation of which he is president. An injunction against violating the Act had been previously issued against the latter station.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The decision of the district court is sound and its injunction against the appellant justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
