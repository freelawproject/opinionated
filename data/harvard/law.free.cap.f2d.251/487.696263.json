Later defendant issued a second card retaining features of the first but making some changes. It is to the defendant\u2019s second card that the orders on appeal are directed. There is still a substantial similarity in the effect obtained from the shape of the card, the legends, the price sign, and the use of the Eiffel Tower in a somewhat similar treatment, sufficient to sustain the court\u2019s Finding No. 8 of infringement. The copying need not be of every detail so long as the copy is substantially similar to the copyrighted work. \u201c * * * The test is whether the one charged with the infringement has made an independent production, or made a substantial and unfair use of the complainant\u2019s work.\u201d Nutt v. National Institute Inc. for the Imp. of Memory, 2 Cir., 31 F.2d 236, 237; and see Ansehl v. Puritan Pharmaceutical Co., 8 Cir., 61 F.2d 131; Deutsch v. Arnold, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 686; College Entrance Book Co. v. Amsco Book Co., 2 Cir., 119 F.2d 874; Alfred Bell &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Catalda Fine Arts, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The court\u2019s refusal to find that plaintiff\u2019s hands were unclean because of its use of the term \u201cfine optical lenses\u201d on the affidavits submitted was not erroneous in view of the conflict of testimony in the affidavits on the meaning of the term in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The wisdom of a finding of contempt may be open to question. However, no penalty has been imposed, and the contempt order remains merely a finding, without judgment thereon, subject to modification, prior to judgment. See opinion of Judge Byers, D.C., 158 F. Supp. 241. Since the contempt finding is not an order granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving an injunction, or refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction and is not a final decision, it is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1292 or 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">So much of the appeal as seeks relief from the order holding defendant in contempt is dismissed as premature. The order appealed from is in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
