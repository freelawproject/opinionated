If it was not, then a proffered amendment to describe the rubbery copolymer as unmasticated would be barred as introducing new matter into the claims. The question is obviously one that the trier of the facts must determine from the testimony of experts. This is what the court did here and we cannot say its determination is clearly erroneous. Since we also find appellant\u2019s other contentions without merit, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"A0z\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
