A bill is not multifarious unless disconnected and independent causes of action are brought upon the record; citing <em>Wales v. Newbould, </em>9 Mich. 58; and a primary rule of equity pleading requires that all persons should be made parties who are inter, ested in the subject-matter; citing Id. 59.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-15\">2. When the subject-matter of the litigation is <em>entire </em>in itself, it is not necessary that each defendant should have an interest in the suit co-extensive with the claim set up in the bill; citing <em>Ingersoll v.

It is a general rule in specific performance cases that all persons who have acquired any interest in the lands from the vendor subsequent to the contract are proper parties, and usually they are necessary parties; citing <em>Daily v. Litchfield, </em>10 Mich. 36; <em>Moris v. Hoyt, </em>11 Id. 17; <em>Woodward v. Clark, </em>15 Id. 104; <em>Covell v. Cole, </em>16 Id. 225; <em>Bird v. Hall, </em>30 Id. 374; <em>Berry v.

In such a case the interests of other persons in the land who are not immediately connected with the contract, or title of the complainant, may be ascertained, and a decree made holding them subject to complainant\u2019s rights or paramount thereto, aud such disputed claims as to rights in the land between such persons when made defendants may be settled upon the pleadings between complainant and the defendants; citing <em>Thurston v.

The bill charges that the attachment was a fraudulent contrivance to prevent the delivery of the deed mentioned in the bill, and a general allegation of fraud is sufficient; citing <em>Tong v.

The bill has a five-fold aspect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-11\">a\u2014To remove cloud from title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfI\">b\u2014To confirm a deed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ_\">c\u2014For specific performance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa-\">d\u2014To obtain possession of a deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-12\">e\u2014To restrain by injunction the return of the deed to the grantors, and the sale or incumbering of the property by them. \u2014Each of which separate causes is supported by appropriate allegations, and followed by an appropriate prayer for relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-13\">2. The respective theories of the bill clearly destroy each other. The different grounds are wholly distinct, and each ground alleged is sufficient as stated to sustain a bill, and the bill is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>therefore multifarious; citing Story, Eq. Pl. (8th ed.) \u00a7 2715.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APW\">3. A bill framed with a double aspect must be consistent with itself. It should not set up different and distinct causes of complaint which destroy each other; citing <em>Hart v. McKeen, </em>Walk. Ch. 417; <em>Winslow v. Jenness, </em>64 Mich. 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">4. To ask alternate relief is proper enough, but to grant it must not result in complete destruction of, or be in opposition to, the other prayer and the allegations on which it is founded; citing <em>Ingersoll v. Kirby, </em>Walk. Ch. 65; <em>Wales v. Newbould, </em>9 Mich. 45; <em>Hunton v. Platt, </em>11 Id. 264; <em>Taylor v. King, </em>32 Id. 42; <em>Woodruff v. Young, </em>43 Id. 548.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">5. It has been held that a bill filed for the two-fold purpose of foreclosing a mortgage and removing a cloud from the title is bad for misjoinder and for multifariousness; citing <em>Chamberlain v. Lyell, </em>3 Mich. 448; <em>Horton v. Ingersoll, </em>13 Id. 409; <em>Bank v. Bronson, </em>14 Id. 361; <em>Wilkinson v. Green, </em>34 Id. 221; <em>McClure v. Holbrook, </em>39 Id. 42.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-9\">Cahill, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANF\">On March 1, 1889, the complainant filed his bill in the circuit court of the county of Kent for the specific performance of a land contract. On May 27, by leave of the court, he filed an amended bill, praying that a contract between himself and the defendants George E. Hubbard and Christiana A. Hubbard, by which they had agreed to convey to him lot 17, block 5, in Ellsworth's addition to the city of Grand Rapids, for the sum of $1,950, be specifically performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The facts set out in the bill are substantially as follows: That on January 5, 1889, Christiana A. Hubbard, the wife of George E. Hubbard, was the owner of the property in question; that her husband, acting for her, and by her authority, entered into \u00e1 contract with the complainant by which he agreed to sell and convey to him the lot in question for $1,950. Complainant was to assume a mortgage on the lot, pay some back taxes, and the balance he was to pay in money. In performance of this agreement, a deed was drawn up and executed by the Hubbards, and sent to the Old National Bank of Grand Rapids, for delivery to the complainant upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>payment of the amount that was due in money. Upon an inspection of the deed by the complainant, it appeared that it had been executed by George E. Hubbard in Arizona, and that there was no clerk\u2019s certificate attached showing that it had been executed according to the laws of that territory. The complainant declined to accept the deed in that form, and it was sent to Arizona for the purpose of having a certificate attached. The bill shows that the contract made by George E. Hubbard with complainant was acquiesced in and ratified by his wife, who joined in the deed. In a few days the deed was returned to the Old National Bank perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In the mean time, and after the deed had been first received at the bank, and before its return from Arizona, the defendant McConnell had commenced an attachment suit against George E. Hubbard, and levied upon the land in question, so that, when complainant called at the bank to close up the trade, he. found this levy as a cloud upon the title. He called upon the defendants Hubbard to remove this cloud, and perform the contract, by delivering him the deed of the property. This they were unwilling or unable to do. Upon this point the bill states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201c And your orator further shows that, after said Christiana A. Hubbard had heard of the said levy of attachment by said John McConnell, the said Christiana A. Hubbard signed and made the following direction and instrument, and sent the same to Harvey J. Hollister, or to your orator, to be delivered to said Harvey J. Hollister, viz.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201c\u2018Grand Rapids, Mich., Feb. 13, 1889.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u2018\u201cH. J. Hollister:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u2018 \u201cPlease hold deed and papers from George E. Hubbard to E. J. Horton until records are satisfactorily fixed up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\u201c \u2018 Mrs. George E.

Hubbard sent to Harvey J. Hollister a communication as follows, viz.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201c \u2018 Grand Haven, Mich., Feb. 27, \u201989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201c \u2018 Mr. H. J. Hollister, Grand Rapids, Mich.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\"><em>'\u201cDear Sir: </em>Please return to me at once the deed I sent you, and oblige,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>Yours resp\u2019ty,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201c\u2018Mrs. Geo. E. Hubbard.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201c And on or about the 1st day of March, A. D. 1889, the said Christiana A. Hubbard wrote, signed, and sent to your orator a letter as follows, which was received by him soon after being sent, viz.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">\u201c \u2018 Grand Haven, Mich., March 1, 1889.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">\u201c\u2018Mr. E. J. Horton,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">\u201c \u2018 Grand Rapids, Mich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">\u201c \u2018 <em>Dear Sir: </em>I don\u2019t think there is any need of your making trouble about the lot. I havernot received any other deed, and should I receive one I will not sign it; but I don\u2019t think I will receive one. I think there is some mistake about it. I know Mr. Hubbard wants to do what is right, and T know he will do right by you. He is so far away, and I do not want to get into any trouble. I have written him to-day, and I know he will do what is right. If you will wait until he can be heard from, I am sure it will be all settled satisfactory to you. I know it will be all right, and I promise you I will not sign any deed should one come. .1 am here alone, and I do not want trouble, and I know there is some mistake, and it will be all right, if you will wait until we can hear from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">\u201c \u2018 Very resp\u2019y yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">\u2018 \u201c Mrs. Geo. E. Hubbard.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">\u201cAnd your orator further shows, on information and belief, that said George E. Hubbard and Christiana A. Hubbard have abandoned the said contract, and have refused to perform the same, and said Christiana A. Hubbard has instructed and required the said bank, or its cashier, to return the said deed to her, with the avowed purpose of destroying the said deed, and refusing to perform said contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">\u201cAnd your orator is informed by the officers of said bank that, in pursuance of said instructions, said bank, or its cashier, will send said deed to said Christiana A. Hubbard; and your orator fears and apprehends that said bank, or its cashier, will send said deed to her, and that she, or said George E. Hubbard, will destoy the same, unless restrained by the injunction of this court,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">\u201c And your orator further show that said premises are not free from incumbrances, as appears by the record in the office of said register of deeds; that said alleged attachment levy is still of record in the said office, and no insurance policy on the houses on said land has ever been sent or delivered to your orator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-18\">\u201c And your orator further shows that said attachment levy is void, and is a gross fraud upon your orator, and that said John McConnell, before said attachment levy was made, or suit com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>menced, had notice that said land had been purchased by your orator of said George E. Hubbard and Christiana A. Hubbard, and that your orator then had said deed in his hands, and said deed was shown to the attorney for said John McConnell, who made the affidavit for him for the said attachment, before such affidavit was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201cAnd your orator charges that said John McConnell has conspired with certain parties unknown to your orator to prevent your orator\u2019s obtaining the said deed after being properly certified, and to obtain the said land for himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201c And your orator charges on information and belief that said George E. Hubbard is not and was not indebted to said John McConnell in any sum, and that said George E. Hubbard was not a non-resident of this State, and that no cause for said attachment existed, and that your orator\u2019s right to said land is prior to said alleged attachment levy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201c But your orator charges that the said levy, being so filed, raises a cloud upon the title to said land, and greatly depreciates the value thereof, and makes the same unsalable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">The prayer of the bill is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">1. That the contract for the purchase of said premises may be specifically performed, and that the Hubbards be required to convey such lands to the complainant discharged of such levy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">2. That the attachment levy may be discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">3. If the levy is of any force, as found by the court, for any amount, that the same may be ascertained, and paid out of the balance of the consideration due from the complainant, and the levy discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">4. That the deed before executed, and on deposit in the Old National Bank, be delivered to complainant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">5. That the court may decree that the said deed was delivered to comxjlainant before said levy, and that complainant is the owner of the land, and that the levy is wholly void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">6. That the deed from the Hubbards be produced and placed upon record, and that they be restrained by injunction from receiving the said deed, now with Harvey J. Hollister, cashier, and from making or executing any deed or conveyance of said land, or incumbering the same, and that the Old National Bank, and Hollister, its cashier, be restrained from returning said deed to said parties or delivering it to any person other than your orator, and for general relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">The defendants Hubbard answered. Defendant McOon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>nelj demurred to the bill, generally, for want of equity, and, specially, that the bill was multifarious. The Old National Bank and Hollister, defendants, did not appear. The demurrer of defendant McConnell was sustained in the circuit, and the bill dismissed as to him. Complainant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">I think the demurrer should have been overruled. Although the bill prays for certain relief to which complainant is not entitled, still it makes a plain case for equitable relief. Complainant, having entered into a contract with the Hubbards for the purchase of the land in question, upon the terms set out in the bill, is entitled to have such contract specifically performed, unless there is some obstacle in the way of such performance, which the court, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, cannot surmount. The only obstacle to such performance is the levy of defendant McConnell. But the bill alleges that McConnell, before commencing his suit, or making his levy, knew that complainant had purchased the land of Mrs. Hubbard, who was the owner of the land; that the attachment was against George E. Hubbard, but that he was not indebted to McConnell, and that no cause for the attachment existed; that the attachment levy is void, and a fraud upon complainant; that\" McConnell has conspired with certain persons unknown to complainant to prevent complainant from obtaining a deed of the land purchased by him. These facts being admitted by the demurrer, to be true, the attachment levy does not stand in the way of a decree for the specific performance of the contract by the Hubbards. The right that a purchaser of land under a contract has to have the contract performed would not be very valuable if the remedy to enforce it could be cut off by fraudulent attachment levies. If the attachment is in good faith, and is prosecuted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>judgment against George E. Hubbard, it can only re^ch his interest in the land, which appears by the bill to be nothing. But the specific performance of a iand contract, at the suit of the vendee, cannot be prevented by the levy of a valid attachment or execution, after the date of the contract, against the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Equity has jurisdiction in such cases, and, having once taken jurisdiction to enforce the contract, will retain it to adjust the conflicting claims to the purchase money due from the vendee. The vendee will be decreed to bring his money into court for the party entitled to it. <em>Stevenson v. </em>Jackson, 40 Mich. 702; <em>Thurston v. Prentiss, </em>1 Id. 198; <em>Hanchett v. McQueen, </em>32 Id. 25. In such case the attachment or execution creditor is a proper party to the bill, for at most he stands in the place of the vendor, bound by his duty, if he claims his interest. <em>Morris v. Hoyt, </em>11 Mich. 17; <em>Daily v. Litchfield, </em>10 Id. 36; <em>Woodward v. Clark, </em>15 Id. 104; <em>Rogers v. Odell, </em>36 Id. 411; <em>Chapman v. Morgan, </em>55 Id. 126 (20 N. W. Rep. 821).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The decree below will be reversed, and the case remanded; the defendant McConnell to have 20 days in which to answer.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-6\">Morse and Grant, JJ., concurred.
