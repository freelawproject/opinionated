J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2B\">Ronald Wayne Smith appeals from a judgment of conviction entered upon a jury verdict of lewd and lascivious acts (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">On March 19, 1964, 13-year-old Marie Gabaldon accepted defendant\u2019s offer of a ride to a high school to pick up Marie\u2019s sister. According to Marie, defendant drove beyond the school, stopped on a dead-end dirt road, and raped her. Released, she cleaned herself up at a market restroom and returned home too afraid to tell anyone about the rape. She first told her mother about it six months later. On the date of the rape, Marie had just finished a seven-day menstrual period. At trial, on October 26, 1964, she claimed to be seven and one-half months pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Defendant contends Marie\u2019s testimony is inherently improbable and the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction. Neither is her testimony totally unworthy of belief, nor is her claimed conception just after finishing a menstrual period, although highly improbable, physically impossible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Headlee, </em>18 Cal.2d 266 [115 P.2d 427]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Penrice, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 360 [15 Cal.Rptr. 733]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 783 [248 P.2d 977].) Marie\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>alone is sufficient to support the conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Breeden, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 343 [28 Cal.Rptr. 693]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stampher, </em>168 Cal.App.2d 579 [336 P.2d 207]<em>; </em>see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>54 Cal.2d 115 [4 Cal.Rptr. 509, 351 P.2d 781].)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Defendant asserts incompetent representation by counsel effected a denial of his right to counsel. Defendant complains of counsel\u2019s failure to call an expert witness, a gynecologist, to testify to the high improbability of conception; of counsel\u2019s refusal to subpoena defendant\u2019s employer\u2019s plant manager and a fellow employee, whose testimony purportedly would have buttressed defendant\u2019s defense, as revealed by his time card admitted into evidence, that he left work at 3 :33 p.m., 20 miles from the location of the alleged rape. Marie testified the incident occurred about 3:20. An examination of the record shows counsel\u2019s failure to procure these witnesses did not reduce the trial to a farce or sham, as required for reversal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]; see <em>In re Rose, </em>62 Cal.2d 384 [42 Cal.Rptr. 236, 398 P.2d 428]).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously allowed the district attorney to introduce evidence of two other instances of defendant contributing to the delinquency of a minor. This evidence is that defendant in 1963 removed the clothing from the body and private parts of one minor girl and touched, rubbed and fondled the body of another minor girl. The Attorney General argues the evidence is admissible to prove the requisite lewd intent (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288). At trial, however, Marie described a rape which, if committed, sufficiently established lewd intent and precluded a defense based on innocent intent. The evidence, therefore, while adding nothing to the People\u2019s proof of intent, impressed upon the jury defendant\u2019s disposition toward committing criminal sexual acts. There was no justification for resorting to mere cumulative evidence the probative value of which was overwhelmingly outweighed by the prejudicial inference of criminal disposition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Baskett, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 712, 718 [47 Cal.Rptr. 274].)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The trial court\u2019s instruction (CALJIC 51) and the district attorney\u2019s lengthy comments on defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand violate <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], a decision which followed the trial here.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments included the following: \u201cNobody can compel him to testify and this is good and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>.proper. We can be very thankful the Constitution is set up \"like this, but the law also allows for you to infer certain things from this lack of accepting this opportunity which he could have taken advantage of.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u201cMr. Smith did not take the stand. You have the facts before you that he forcibly raped Marie Gabaldon, a girl of thirteen at the time and these are facts certainly within his knowledge and he did not take the stand to explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u201cYou can infer therefrom that these things are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201cIt is common knowledge what happens during cross-examination, and you can infer from his lack of willingness to testify as to what would have been his reaction to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u201cWe cannot ask him to get up and explain away Marie\u2019s pregnancy. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Upon an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, we are of the opinion that it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to defendant would have resulted in the absence of the district attorney\u2019s zealous emphasis upon the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand, the trial court\u2019s improper instruction, and the erroneous introduction of evidence the probative value of which was highly outweighed by the prejudicial inference of criminal disposition.

VI, \u00a7 13, formerly \u00a7 4\u00bd; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>62 Cal.2d 820 [44 Cal.Rptr. 649, 402 P.2d 529]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836-837 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
