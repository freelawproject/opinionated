J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoY\">Defendant Garrison, along with Edward Ballard and John Lee, were charged with three counts of armed robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) and one count of burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459). At the first trial the jury was unable to reach a verdict as to Garrison, though the other two were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>convicted. At the second trial Garrison was convicted on all four counts and was sentenced to state prison. The trial judge then granted a stay of execution and fixed bail on appeal at $27,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">At defendant\u2019s request, and upon his representation that he was without funds, this court appointed counsel to assist him on his appeal. A brief, arguing for reversal upon specified grounds, was filed by the appointed attorney. When the case was called for oral argument, Attorney David Marcus arose and asked to be substituted as attorney for the appellant. Since he had no written authorization, and the appellant was not present to give consent, the argument was postponed to the next monthly calendar. The following month appellant appeared in person and requested that Mr. Marcus be substituted as his attorney. The court then made an order relieving the court-appointed attorney and substituting Mr. Marcus, who was present. Attorney Marcus was thereafter permitted, at his request, to file a supplemental reporter\u2019s transcript containing the arguments of counsel at the close of the trial, and a supplemental brief. Mr. Marcus also argued the case orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In this opinion we deal with all of the contentions raised by defendant through either of his attorneys here. These contentions relate to three subjects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">(1) The admission of evidence of a conversation between defendant and his wife in the jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">(2) The argument of the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">(3) The competence of defendant\u2019s trial attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Though no question is raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence, a statement of facts is essential to illuminate the legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">On Saturday evening, November 21, 1964, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Nardoni went to a restaurant for dinner. When they returned to their Glendale home about 8 -.10 p.m., accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Margid, Mr. and Mrs. Erwin, and the Erwins\u2019 two children, they were confronted by two armed men. Each of the two had one of Mrs. Nardoni\u2019s stockings pulled over his head and face. A third stranger attempted to conceal his face with a canvas glove. The two gunmen held the Nardonis and their companions prisoner, threatened to kill them if they did not cooperate, and took Mr. Nardoni\u2019s ring, watch and money, Mrs. Margid\u2019s ring, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Mr. Erwin\u2019s money and Mr. and Mrs. Margid\u2019s wristwatches. After the robbers had left, the Nardonis discovered that the house had been ransacked and that furs, clothing and other valuables were missing. The Glendale police were called and given a description of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">A few days later Mr. and Mrs. Nardoni and Mr. Margid went to the Glendale police station and assisted a police technician to construct a picture of one of the robbers. By matching this construction with actual photographs, the police concluded that Edward Ballard was probably the man. They showed Ballard\u2019s photograph to Mr. Nardoni, who promptly identified him. Ballard was arrested on Friday, November 27, and was identified by the victims as one of the gunmen. Following Ballard\u2019s arrest a bail bond agency reported that it had had inquiries about Ballard from a person who gave his name as John on one occasion, and as Lee on another occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Officers waited in the vicinity of the bondsman\u2019s office on Saturday, November 28, and observed two men who answered the description of the other two robbers. The two men were arrested and identified as John Lee and Gilbert Smith, both of whom were employed at a bar in Paramount called the Music Box. Lee was identified by the victims as the man with the canvas glove. After interrogating Smith the police were satisfied he was not involved and released him.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">It was then reported that a man named Gary was making inquiries about Ballard at the bail bond office on Sunday, November 29. Police learned from Smith that a former waitress at the Music Box was married to Gary Garrison, who fitted the description of the missing robber, and who had a police record of robbery and burglary. The following day, November 30, defendant Garrison was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">At the trial Mr. Nardoni, Mrs. Nardoni, Mr. Erwin, Mrs. Erwin and Mr. Margid all positively identified defendant Garrison as one of the gunmen. They said the stocking over his face had been very sheer, and they could see his features plainly.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Defendant testified that he had been at his apartment in Bellflower with his wife the entire evening of November 21. His wife supported this alibi. Mrs. Garrison\u2019s brother testified that he was at defendant\u2019s home with him between 7 :30 and 8:15 p.m. Mrs. Hill, a friend of Mrs. Garrison, testified that she telephoned defendant at his apartment and spoke with him between 8 :15 and 8 :30 p.m. that evening. Mrs. Gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>rison\u2019s parents both testified that they had telephoned defendant at his apartment and had spoken with him at about 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Detective Sergeant Stenberg of the Glendale police testified to a conversation he had with defendant after the arrest and after defendant had been advised of his rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this conversation defendant told Sergeant Stenberg that he had not been one of the three who committed the robbery but he knew who they were and where the loot was, but that he wouldn\u2019t snitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Following this the sergeant permitted defendant to speak with John Lee for about 10 minutes. The sergeant then asked if he would like to make a further statement and defendant said, \u201cNo, we\u2019ll take it to court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">While defendant\u2019s wife was on the witness stand she was asked, on cross-examination, and without objection, concerning a conversation she had with her husband at the police station on December 1, 1964. This visit had taken place in a room where she and the defendant were face to face on opposite sides of a glass partition, so that they could converse only through a telephone instrument. The witness testified that she thought defendant had said he thought he knew who was \u201cin on the Nardoni job.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t remember if he had said he \u201cknew where the merchandise was because John had told him. \u2019 \u2019 The prosecutor then put to the witness a series of leading questions, containing the exact words of a conversation between the witness and the defendant. Portions of it she testified were correct, some portions she denied, and as to other parts she expressed uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Defendant did not testify until after his wife\u2019s examination had been completed. On cross-examination he was asked about the December 1 conversation, sentence by sentence. The only portions which he admitted were (1) his statement that \u201cThey have $20,000 worth of merchandise and they want to get it back,\u201d and (2) the statement of his wife that she wished he would tell the police everything that he knew. Defendant qualified this by adding that his wife had said, \u201cIf I knew anything.\u201d Every other portion of the conversation, as put to him sentence by sentence, he denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">In rebuttal, Sergeant Stenberg testified that he had monitored the December 1 conversation of defendant and his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>and had tape-recorded it. The district attorney questioned Stenberg as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cQ. Now I am going to ask you these questions and ask you if this is what you heard while you were there on the date and whether these are the questions that were also on the tape recording.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cDid Mr. Garrison say: \u2018I was with you because I kept calling Johnny to find out\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201cMr. Martin [Defendant\u2019s attorney]: Your Honor, I am going to object to this\u2014on second thought I withdraw my objection. I\u2019d like to hear Officer Stenberg\u2019s testimony myself. Excuse me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">Thereupon the prosecutor put to the witness a series of questions by which he elicited that the recorded conversation included the following statements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">Wife: \u201c \u2018I wish you\u2019d tell them because it is the only wav to help you. With the other people picking you out it is not being a rat or a fink. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018They want the merchandise back. People are picking my voice out not seeing my face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">\u201c \u2018I know that Friday, Saturday and Sunday night I was with you because they went to Vegas Sunday and we were calling the whole time. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">Wife: \u201c\u2018Sal [Mrs. Garrison\u2019s brother] left [our] house that evening at 9 o\u2019clock. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-14\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018You remember I called all day Sunday because I eouldn\u2019t get in touch with them until Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-15\">\u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Gloria, they want me to snitch, that\u2019s all. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-16\">Wife: \u2018\u2018 \u2018Who turned you in?' \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-17\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018Gil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-18\">\u201c \u2018It\u2019s still snitching so if I go up there and tell them I can get the merchandise back they are still going to file on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-19\">\u201c \u2018They have $20,000 worth of merchandise out they want to get back. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-20\">Wife: \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 And you know where it is at ? \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-21\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018Yes, I know where it\u2019s at, you\u2019re damn right I know where it\u2019s at, and I ain\u2019t telling these punks shit because they told me they are going to file on me anyway.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-22\">Wife: \u201c \u2018Do you Imow who else was involved?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-23\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018I know one, two of the people who was, or it was one of two people, but I\u2019m not going to put them in jail\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Wife: \u201c \u2018If you don\u2019t you are going to be there. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">Defendant\u2018No, I\u2019m not either.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">Wife: \u201cGary, these people are picking you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201c \u2018I wish you\u2019d just tell them what you know, please, Gary. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018Look, that\u2019s just sure going to put John and Ed in the penitentiary. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">Wife: \u201c \u2018They know that they went up to Vegas to get rid of some of that stuff. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018They didn\u2019t get rid of but one thing in Vegas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">\u201c \u2018And I\u2019m telling you, Gloria, they are going to try to put me in the penitentiary anyway and if I go tell them that it\u2019s just going to help them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">\u201c \u2018Just my knowing anything is going to help me in the penitentiary and they can\u2019t prove a damn thing on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">\u201c \u2018Not one thing, not even the association, not even what I\u2019m guilty of can they prove on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-15\">\u201c \u2018 I know when it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-16\">\u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t see them until they got back from Vegas.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-17\">Defendant or Wife: \u201c \u2018We found out that Ed and John were in Vegas when we called Joanne from the folks\u2019 home. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-18\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to ask them to drop the charges if I get the merchandise back. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-19\">Wife: \u201c \u2018How are you going to tell them that if you are not involved?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-20\">Defendant: \u201c \u2018They wanted me to help them get rid of it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">Sergeant Stenberg testified that the whole conversation took about 10 or 15 minutes, that the recording included other portions which had not been referred to in the testimony, and that the entire tape would be available to defendant\u2019s attorney if he wished it. Defendant offered no further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">The jury was presented with a clear-cut issue of credibility. The five victims all positively identified the defendant. The defense witnesses just as positively placed him at home some .20 miles away. The extrajudicial statements of the defendant to Sergeant Stenberg and to his wife were consistent with each other and consistent with innocence of the offenses charged. Though these statements reflected some special knowledge on the subject, and at one point there was the admission that he was guilty of something, the whole tenor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Ms statements was that he was not one of the gunmen who had invaded the Nardoni home. Mrs. Garrison\u2019s comments in the recorded conversation indicated that she believed him and thought he could clear himself by telling what he knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">But defendant\u2019s credibility was destroyed by his total denial of the statements made in the December 1 conversation. He even denied some statements which his wife had said were made. After hearing the testimony of Sergeant Stenberg, and his offer to produce the tape, the jury could not have doubted that the conversation was as the sergeant described it.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of the December 1 Conversation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">It is unnecessary to decide whether the conduct of the police in monitoring and recording the conversation between defendant and his wife was such an impropriety as to make inadmissible the evidence obtained thereby. The evidence which resulted includes the cross-examination of defendant and his wife, and the direct examination of the officer in rebuttal. No objection was made to any of this, though at one point counsel started to make an objection and then withdrew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">One of the fundamentals of appellate review is that, except in special circumstances not present here, the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a sufficient objection in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>62 Cal.2d 889, 894 [44 Cal.Rptr. 762, 402 P.2d 834].)  Likewise, where a party seeks to suppress evidence under a claim of constitutional or statutory privilege, his privilege is lost by failure to assert it at the appropriate time. <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 U.S. 367, 370 [95 L.Ed. 345, 348, 71 S.Ct. 438, 440, 19 A.L.R.2d 378, 381-382] (self-crimination)<em>; People </em>v. <em>Kroeger, </em>61 Cal.2d 236, 246 [37 Cal. Rptr. 593, 390 P.2d 369] (confidential communication).)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The failure of counsel to object at the trial does not ordinarily indicate either incompetence of counsel or unfairness to the client. The system of objections is a useful tool in the hands of a trained professional for the exclusion of matter which should not be received into evidence. But the indiscriminate use of objections, solely because they are available, aids neither the client nor the cause of justice.  The choice of when to object and when to allow the evidence to come in as offered is inherently a matter of trial tactics. Ordinarily the tactical decisions of trial counsel will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>reviewed with the hindsight of an appellate court. (See, <em>e.g., People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>64 Cal.2d 130, 139-140 [48 Cal.Rptr. 879, 410 P.2d 383]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>64 Cal.2d 766, 772-773 [51 Cal.Rptr. 691, 415 P.2d 35].) The decisions which counsel must make in the courtroom will necessarily depend in part upon what he then knows about the case, including what his own client has told him. There may be considerations not shown by the record, which could never be communicated to the reviewing court as a basis for its decision. Thus, the appellate court\u2019s inability to understand why counsel did as he did cannot be a basis for inferring that he was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Nevertheless, in view of the contention made by defendant on this appeal, we point out that the record does affirmatively show a perfectly sound reason for withdrawing any objection to Sergeant Stenberg\u2019s testimony about the tape recording. It will be remembered that Stenberg had testified, during the People\u2019s case in chief, about defendant\u2019s statement that he knew the robbers and knew where the loot was. The December 1 conversation in the visitors\u2019 room first came to the jury\u2019s attention during the cross-examination of the defendant and his wife. That conversation contained no admission of guilt. It was consistent with what defendant had told the police: He knew about the robbery but hadn\u2019t participated. If the jury would believe this, defendant would be acquitted. The testimony of Sergeant Stenberg, as to what was on the tape, confirmed this theory of defense. On the other hand, if an objection to Sergeant Stenberg\u2019s rebuttal testimony were made and sustained, the jury would never know that in the December 1 meeting the defendant had made no admission of guilt to his wife and that his wife had talked to him as though she believed he were innocent. Counsel could reasonably have concluded that the wiser course was to clear up the mystery, rather than allow the jury to speculate.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>The Argument to the Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Read as a whole the argument of the prosecutor appears to be a vigorous but dignified comment upon the evidence. With one exception, to be mentioned later, there were no references to matters which the jury could not properly consider. Nowhere was there any intimation that the prosecution had knowledge or information beyond that shown in the evidence. There was no attempt to bolster the case by invoking the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion or his personal endorsement of the People\u2019s witnesses. Indeed, the deputy district attorney sought to forestall any such intimation by stating at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>beginning of his argument: \u201cFirst of all I want you to know that anything I say is not evidence because I was not a witness. I don\u2019t know anything more about the ease than you have heard from the witness stand. ... If I do misquote somebody, I\u2019m not doing it intentionally, it is because my memory may not be as good as it should be. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Throughout the entire argument defendant made no objection, no charge of misconduct, and no request for an admonition to the jury. Now defendant demands a reversal because of four aspects of that argument, which will be discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Defendant\u2019s first point is that the prosecutor asserted in argument that defendant \u201ctook the stand and committed perjury\u201d; that the prosecutor said of defendant\u2019s wife, \u201cShe got up here and she perjured herself. That\u2019s a felony\u201d; and that on other occasions during argument the words \u201cperjury\u201d and \u201clie\u201d were used to characterize the defense testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was that the testimony of these witnesses about the December 1 conversation was wilfully false; and that if they wouldn\u2019t tell the truth on that subject they shouldn\u2019t be believed when they testified that defendant was at home on November 21. This was a perfectly proper suggestion, based entirely upon the evidence which the jury was bound to consider. The argument was not an appeal to passion, but to reason. The words \u201clie\u201d and \u201cperjury\u201d are the expressions commonly used to describe wilfully false testimony, and there is no reason why a prosecutor must resort to circumlocutions when discussing this distasteful but pertinent subject. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that perjury is a felony is no more than a reminder of the gravity of the conduct. It is arguable that, as a mark of untrustworthiness, perjury is more significant than other lands of falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosoto, 58 </em>Cal.2d 304, 360 [23 Cal.Rptr. 779, 373 P.2d 867], the prosecutor\u2019s statement, of that defendant, that \u201che is shown to be a liar\u201d was held not to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Muir, </em>244 Cal.App.2d 598, 601 [53 Cal. Rptr. 398], the court held there was no misconduct of the prosecutor \u201cin suggesting in his argument that defendant committed perjury when he testified. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 615, 624 [7 Cal.Rptr. 22], the use of the word \u201clie\u201d to characterize the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>' In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mora, </em>139 Cal.App.2d 266, 272-273 [293 P.2d 522], the court said: \u201cWhen a witness tells one story when arrested and another story on the trial, one of the stories is untrue, i.e., is a lie, and the person who tells such conflicting stories can properly be characterized as a \u2018liar.\u2019 All of the appellants told different stories at different times. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s statements, although harsh, were in the realm of fair comment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Defendant bases his argument here upon language found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 143 [33 Cal.Rptr. 561], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Conover, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 38 [52 Cal.Rptr. 172],</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u25a0' In <em>Reese </em>the district attorney committed misconduct in arguing to the jury that the defendant had a duty to disclose 'his alibi to the police at the time of his arrest, and that his \"failure to do so was inconsistent with innocence. In reversing the conviction, the appellate court .placed its decision both upon that argument and upon the district attorney\u2019s statement that the defendant\u2019s witnesses \u201chave committed perjury.\u201d The court said (at p. 147): \u201cThe critical objection is that by this technique the district attorney is able to obliquely impeach a witness by charging him with the commission of a felony of which he has not been convicted. A witness on the stand cannot be impeached by an accusation of perjury unless the witness has been convicted thereof, since impeachment of this character stems from a prior conviction of a felony. An attorney should not be permitted to accomplish by argument that which he is precluded from doing by cross-examination. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument in the <em>Reese </em>case unquestionably constituted misconduct, judged by well-established rules. But we are unable to follow the court\u2019s reasoning as to the effect of the word \u201cperjury.\u201d The defendant was impeached not by the prosecutor\u2019s accusation, but by the evidence which showed that he had been wilfully false. In ordinary speech, to say that a man \u201ccommitted perjury\u201d does not mean that he has been convicted, and the jury surely, would not take it that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In the <em>Conover </em>case the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct in expressing his personal belief in the unreliability of defense witnesses, and in arguing that the defense was fabricated because no defense evidence had been offered at the preliminary examination. In reversing, the appellate court .also discussed the prosecutor\u2019s use of the words \u201clying\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201cperjury\u201d to characterize some of the testimony. The court said (38 at p. 45) \u201cThe epithet \u2018lying,\u2019 while blunt, was accurate\u201d and not improper. But the use of the word \u201cperjury\u201d was disapproved upon the authority of the <em>Reese </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We do not believe it makes any difference to the jury whether the prosecutor argues that a witness deliberately lied in his testimony or whether he says the witness \u201ccommitted perjury.\u201d The distinction which the <em>Conover </em>opinion draws in order to be consistent with <em>Reese </em>is not the kind of distinction which marks the boundary between proper and improper argument. The test, as applied in such cases as <em>Rosoto, Muir, Baker </em>and <em>Mora, supra, </em>is whether the argument was fairly based on the evidence. Both on principle, and upon the weight of authority, we think that standard is the applicable one here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The evidence in the case includes the picture which the police technician drew, based upon the description which Mr. Margid and the Nardonis had given a few days after the robbery. While Mr. Nardoni was on the witness stand he identified the picture and also identified Ballard, who was present in the courtroom. In argument, the prosecutor reminded the jurors of this, and asked them to recall how closely the drawing resembled the man. This evidence was, in effect, a demonstration of the accuracy of the robbery victims\u2019 ability to observe and recall the features of a man whom they had seen only through a stocking. The demonstration was a part of the evidence, and it was not improper for the prosecutor to talk about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Defendant calls attention to what the prosecutor said about the defense of alibi. The subject was opened by defendant\u2019s trial attorney. After referring to the witnesses for the defense as \u201calibi witnesses,\u201d he added: \u201cI hate to say \u2018alibi witnesses\u2019 because we hear about the alibi witnesses on the \u2018Untouchables' and that sort of thing and I think the words \u2018alibi witness\u2019 has [sic] come to be misused in legal terminology ; I will call them defense witnesses.''</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In reply, the prosecutor pointed out that \u201calibi\u201d as a legal defense means that the defendant was elsewhere when the crime was committed; but because this defense is so easily misused the term now has a bad connotation, meaning \u201cthe fix is in.\u201d He followed this by contrasting the testimony of the alibi witnesses with that of the People\u2019s witnesses. Defendant seems to feel that this argument was an attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>upon alibi defenses in general. Rather it was an attack upon the credibility of the witnesses who supported the defense, and as such was fair comment upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The prosecutor did on one occasion make a reference to an incident which was not the proper subject of argument. Early in the trial, after the first witness, Mrs. Nardoni, had identified the defendant and had identified the stocking which he had worn, the prosecutor asked that defendant put the stocking over his face. Defendant\u2019s attorney objected upon the ground that defendant had not taken the stand. The objection was sustained. Later on, while defendant was on the witness stand, at the request of his own attorney defendant put the stocking over his head and gave a demonstration of speaking through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In argument at the close of the evidence, the prosecutor referred to these events and pointed out that the defendant had not put on the stocking until all of the People\u2019s witnesses had left the courtroom, and therefore these witnesses had not had the opportunity to say, \u201c \u2018Yes, that\u2019s the way he looked that night in the stocking. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Whether the trial court\u2019s sustaining of the objection was correct or not,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the jury and the prosecutor were required to respect it for the purpose of that trial, and to assume that the defendant was privileged to abstain from demonstrations until he volunteered. No adverse comment upon his exercise of this privilege would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Nevertheless, we cannot believe that what the prosecutor said about this could have affected the result. The comment referred to an event which had occurred in the jury\u2019s presence. Defendant himself allowed the jury to look at his face through the stocking, so as to judge whether the victims\u2019 identification testimony was credible. Neither a demonstration in the presence of the People\u2019s witnesses, nor defendant\u2019s refusal to demonstrate, could add anything to the strength of the identification testimony. The five prosecution witnesses said positively that they had seen defendant\u2019s features through the stocking and no one could have doubted that they would have said the same thing if defendant had put the stocking on in their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The failure of defendant\u2019s counsel to object to the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>eutor\u2019s argument indicates that he too regarded the incident as harmless. Had the point been made, the trial court could have straightened it out with a prompt explanation to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>The Competence of the Defendant\u2019s Trial Attorney</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument here is that the case comes within the rule announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487], In that case the defendant\u2019s attorney, in response to a question of the trial judge, stated that he knew of no grounds to object to certain evidence. The Supreme Court pointed out that the evidence was subject to objection under a commonplace rule, and that counsel\u2019s admitted ignorance of the applicable law reduced the trial to \u201ca farce and a sham.\u201d The <em>Ibarra </em>ease does not hold that the failure of an attorney to object is by itself an indication that the attorney lacks the skill and diligence which are requisite to the proper exercise of his duties.  Subsequent decisions have adhered to the rule that counsel\u2019s failure to make objections, or his consent to informality in the introduction of evidence, does not reflect any impropriety. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>64 Cal.2d 766 [51 Cal.Rptr. 691, 415 P.2d 35]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>62 Cal.2d 889, 894 [44 Cal.Rptr. 762, 402 P.2d 834].) In the <em>Beeves </em>case the Supreme Court said (at p. 774) : \u201cDefendant has the burden, moreover, of establishing his allegation of inadequate representation \u2018not as a matter of speculation but as a matter of demonstrable reality.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>64 Cal.2d 130, 140 [48 Cal.Rptr. 879, 410 P.2d 383], the court said: \u201cIn the heat of a trial, defendant\u2019s counsel is best able to determine proper tactics in the light of the jury\u2019s apparent reaction to the proceedings. Except in rare cases an appellate court should not attempt to second-guess trial counsel. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">A review of the record at bench fails to disclose any basis for asserting that counsel lacked knowledge, ability or industry. There is not even any legitimate ground for hindsight criticism of his tactics. The critical weakness of defendant\u2019s position at the trial (apart from the positive testimony of five eyewitnesses) was his resort to falsehood at a time when the truth would have served him better. It is not easy for counsel to find tactics effective to protect such a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Although defendant has not raised the point we cannot avoid noticing that the sentencing of defendant on all four counts violated Penal Code section 654, which, as -inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>preted by the Supreme Court in <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>55 Cal.2d 11, 19 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839], prohibits multiple punishment of criminal acts done for a single objective. The burglary charged in count I was for the purpose of committing theft from the Nardoni home. This was also the objective of the three robberies which were committed within that house and which are the subject of counts II, III and IV. Hence defendant may not be punished both for the burglary and the robberies. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 63, 73 [27 Cal.Rptr. 429].)  This is so even though all of the sentences have been ordered by the trial court to run concurrently. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>61 Cal.2d 551, 555 [39 Cal. Rptr. 393, 393 P.2d 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">A sentence on each of the three robbery counts is proper because each involved a different victim. <em>{Neal </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>at pp. 20-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. The \u25a0 judgment is modified by striking therefrom the sentence for burglary as charged in count I. As so modified the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Jefferson J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 4,1967. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\">No objection was made to this testimony at the trial and no contention is made by either of defendant\u2019s appellate attorneys that this was improper interrogation or that this conversation was inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">See <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1826], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>64 Cal.2d 208, 210 [49 Cal.Rptr. 386, 411 P.2d 114], fn. 1, both of which eases came down after the trial of this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
