The cause was submitted for decision on a written stipulation of facts. Plaintiff appeals from judgment entered for defendant. The sole issue is whether the trial court properly construed a certain exclusionary clause in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Decedent\u2019s death was proximately caused by a collision between a freight train, of which he was a crew member (brakeman), and a truck-trailer loaded with gasoline. In view of his employment as brakeman, it was stipulated (in addition to other matters not here relevant) that the duties which decedent was then performing were incident to the transportation, loading and unloading of freight; it was further stipulated, however, that such duties were not incident to the operation of loading or unloading of passengers. The exclusionary clause in the policy issued by defendant company provided that the indemnity did not apply where death resulted from bodily injury sustained while engaged \u201cin duties incident to the operation, loading, or unloading of, or as an assistant on, a public or livery conveyance. ...\u201d The issue, then, is whether a common carrier of freight is a \u2018 public or livery conveyance. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Appellant contends that the term above quoted applies only to the transportation of passengers for hire and not to the hauling of freight; respondent, on the other hand, argues against such limited exclusion. Invoking the rule that an insurance policy should be construed most strongly against the insurer, as well as the companion principle that any ambiguity should be resolved against the company, appellant further points out that exceptions or exclusions in a policy are particularly governed thereby since the insurer is under an obligation to spell out any such provisos in clear and unmistakable language. <em>(Prickett </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. Ltd., </em>56 Cal.2d 234, 237 [14 Cal.Rptr. 675, 363 P.2d 907, 86 A.L.R.2d 711].) She cites cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> two arising in California,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which not only hold that the phrase in question is not ambiguous but, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>contrary, assertedly determine that the subject language conveys the meaning contended for by her. It appears, however, that in all of such cases the court was not confronted with the exact situation here, namely, a conveyance of freight as against a conveyance of passengers. Thus, in each instance the insurer denied coverage under a \u201cpublic or livery conveyance\u201d exclusion clause because the named automobile was being used to transport passengers for compensation; since the facts of each case established that the transportation, albeit for compensation, was only casual or on a selective (share-the-ride) basis, the named automobile was not a \u201cpublic conveyance \u2019 \u2019 and the exclusion did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The above distinction is clearly pointed out by the Supreme Court of South Dakota in <em>Sunshine Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Addy, </em>74 S.D. 387 [53 N.W.2d 539], where the plaintiff company sought a declaratory judgment that it was not liable under a policy containing the following clause: \u201c \u2018 Exclusion <em>\u2019 ... \u2018 </em>This policy does not apply: (a) under any of the coverages, while the automobile is used as a public or livery conveyance, or for carrying persons for charge, unless such use is specifically declared and described in this policy. . . . \u2019 \u201d At the time of the accident, defendant\u2019s truck was being used to haul livestock for hire as a Class B motor carrier under a permit issued by the Public Utilities Commission. Holding that such use of the truck constituted use as a \u201cpublic conveyance,\u201d the court said: \u201cThe fallacy of respondents\u2019 [defendants\u2019] position has to do with this matter of which word, i.e. ' conveyance \u2019 or \u2018public\u2019, is in question. Without exception all the cases cited by respondents on this phase of the case deal not with a type of \u2018conveyance\u2019, nor with the question of a conveyance of freight as against a conveyance of passengers but rather with a casual or incidental conveyance of passengers as against an habitual or authorized and licensed conveyance of passengers. As a result the language used in the eases defining the composite term \u2018public conveyance\u2019 quite naturally involves only passenger transportation. A reference to freight transportation in these eases would have been wholly extraneous; . . .\u201d (53 N.W.2d 539, 541.) The South Dakota court reached the same determination in a later ease, <em>Allied Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Milbank Mut. Ins. Co. </em>80 S.D. 613 [129 N.W.2d 543], where a truck employed for \u2018\u2018 custom combining \u2019 '<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was destroyed by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>While the ease last cited was decided in 1964, more than a year before <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Normandie Club, </em>221 Cal.App. 2d 103 [34 Cal.Rptr. 280] (fn. 2), one of the two California cases relied on by appellant, no mention is made therein of the latter decision. Upon the reasoning of <em>Sunshine Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Addy, </em>74 S.D. 387 [53 N.W.2d 539], which it followed, we nonetheless have no doubt that <em>Allstate </em>could have been readily distinguished. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Normandie Club, </em>221 Cal.App.2d 103 [34 Cal.Rptr. 280], involved a denial of coverage under a \u201cpublic and livery conveyance\u201d exclusion, the vehicle in question being regularly used to transport customers to and from a gambling club; nothing was decided, nor had to be decided, with respect to the particular problem presented by this appeal. <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>111 Cal.App.2d 344 [244 P.2d 760], the other California case mentioned in the same footnote, <em>supra, </em>is likewise not determinative of the issue. The case did not decide the specific question, as claimed by appellant, that the use put by the particular vehicle constituted a \u201cpublic or livery conveyance\u201d within the exclusionary clause prohibiting such use; indeed, as stated by the court in the opinion: \u201cOur conclusions render it unnecessary for us to consider this question.\u201d (P. 350.) Too, it appears that the only other point decided in <em>American Motorists </em>is that under the facts there presented injuries to passengers carried by a truck are not covered by an automobile liability insurance policy issued to the owner as a \u201ctruckman\u201d where both insurer and insured understood such word to mean one \u201cwhose business it is to convey goods on trucks\u201d and where, additionally, the carrying of passengers (agricultural laborers to rural areas) did not constitute a mere occasional use of the vehicle for such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In <em>Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brame, </em>232 Ky. 63 [22 S.W.2d 439], the decedent was insured by a policy which included coverage for \u201c \u2018 truck drivers . . . when engaged in the line of their employment, in actually driving or operating a public conveyance. \u2019 \u201d (P. 439.) He was killed when a three-wheel vehicle he was driving on a tire service call for his employer collided with an automobile. The reviewing court, while conceding that the vehicle driven by deceased was a truck, held that it was not a \u201cpublic conveyance\u201d within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ing of the covering clause: \u2018 Manifestly, a public conveyance is one that is used for transporting the public or the personal property of the public, \u2019 \u2019 but not, as in the case at bar, the personal property of defendant\u2019s employer. (P. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The Kentucky court\u2019s use of the word \u201cManifestly\u201d assumes importance in light of appellant\u2019s closing contention that \u201cwe must look to the common definition of the term \u2018public or livery conveyance\u2019. ...\u201d  While, as noted at the outset, any ambiguity in an insurance contract will be resolved adversely to the insurer, such rule is not without limitation. Some actual or apparent ambiguity must be present before the rule comes into play. <em>(Carabelli </em>v. <em>Mountain States Life Ins. Co., </em>8 Cal.App.2d 115 [46 P.2d 1004].)  Too, \u2018 \u2018 An insurance company has the right to limit the coverage of a policy issued by it and when it has done so, the plain language of the limitation must be respected.\u201d <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., </em>46 Cal.2d 423, 432 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914].)  In view of the fact that the meaning of the subject language was \u201cmanifestly\u201d clear to at least one state court of last resort and since the matter was submitted without any extrinsic evidence to aid in the interpretation of the instrument, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the clause must be accepted if it is \u2018\u2018equally tenable\u201d with our own. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Dev. Co., </em>62 Cal.2d 861, 866 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].) After careful consideration of the eases hereinbefore discussed, we are inclined to the latter view.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Wood, P.
