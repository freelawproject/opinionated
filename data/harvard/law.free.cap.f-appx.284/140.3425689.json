He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it was based upon a mechanical application of the Guidelines, and the Sentencing Commission has shown that drug offenders transporting methamphetamine are punished more severely than necessary. He asserts that his sentence is too severe because his offense was simple drug smuggling, because while his criminal history was long, he had never served more than 180 days of imprisonment previously, and because he has lived in the United States all his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">Martinez did not argue that his sentence was unreasonable because the guidelines provisions regarding methamphetamine offenses were too severe below. Accordingly, to the extent that Martinez\u2019s reasonableness argument relies upon the severity of the guidelines provisions regarding methamphetamine, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">As the district court sentenced Martinez within the properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). While the Supreme Court has recently held that a district court may deviate from the guidelines range based upon a determination that a guidelines provision is unduly severe, it did not hold that a district court\u2019s refusal to deviate from the guidelines range based upon the severity of a guidelines provision was unreasonable. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 570-76, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Martinez has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness or shown that the sentence was plainly erroneous. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554; <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-26\">For the first time on appeal, Martinez argues that the penalty scheme in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) is unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Martinez concedes, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582-84 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
