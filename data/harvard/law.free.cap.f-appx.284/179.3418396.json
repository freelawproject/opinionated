The district court denied Criner IFP status on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Criner is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Criner argues the merits of his underlying constitutional claims, but he fails to brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s certification decision or, in particular, its dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous based on <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Criner has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Accordingly, we deny his IFP motion, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. All other outstanding motions are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Criner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Criner previously accumulated a strike in another case. <em>Criner v. Wichita County 30th Dist. Court, </em>No. 7:06-CV-111 (N.D.Tex. Nov. 27, 2006). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387. As Criner has now accumulated three strikes, he may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See \u00a7 1915 </em>(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
