For his sole issue on appeal, DeHoyos contends that his guilty plea was rendered involuntary because his trial counsel repeatedly misadvised him that, if he pleaded guilty, he would receive no more than 10 years in prison and would avoid a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), despite his two prior felony drug convictions. Because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the preferred vehicle for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to address this issue on direct appeal. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>588 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. DeHoyos may, of course, pursue relief under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
