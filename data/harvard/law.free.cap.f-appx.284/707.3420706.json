The district court arrived at this sentence after departing downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Mikell\u2019s substantial assistance to the government. Both parties agree on appeal that the district court\u2019s starting point before the departure was within Mikell\u2019s applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">On appeal, Mikells argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of: (1) his underlying criminal history score before the district court applied the career offender enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; (2) the nature of one of his prior, qualifying drug convictions; and (3) his self-improvement efforts. After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 594, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201c[A]fter giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 596. The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) that the court must consider are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-17\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-18\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). It is sufficient for the district court to acknowledge that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it need not explicitly discuss each of them. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). After considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The Supreme Court has held that, in reviewing sentences for reasonableness under \u00a7 3553(a), a federal appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence imposed within the guideline range. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S.-,-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). However, we have declined to adopt such a presumption. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1184-85 (11th Cir. 2006). Nonetheless, although it is not reasonable <em>per se, </em>a within-range sentence may ordinarily be expected to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In this case, we conclude that Mikell has not met his burden of demonstrating that the district court\u2019s sentence within the applicable guideline range was unreasonable, as the court considered the pre-sentence investigation report, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, arguments presented in mitigation, Mikell\u2019s prior drug convictions, and his self-improvement efforts. Mikell\u2019s reliance on his unenhanced criminal history score is misplaced because he concedes that he was properly classified as a career offender. Accordingly, we affirm Mikell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
