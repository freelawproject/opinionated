Oh appeal, Angelo-Guarino argues that upwardly variant sentence is unreasonable because the district court based the sentence on improper considerations and unfounded speculation. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201c[R]easonableness\u201d review \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)); <em>see also United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory sentencing range in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a factor considered by the district court in sentencing a defendant is impermissible. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We usually defer to the district court\u2019s determinations regarding the credibility of a witness. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe party who challenges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.... \u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Our reasonableness review consists of two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u2018\u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly-calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA sentence that is based entirely upon an impermissible factor is unreasonable because such a sentence does not achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). With respect to sentences imposed outside the applicable guideline range, the district court must \u201censure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance,\u201d but extraordinary circumstances are not required to justify such a sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595, 597. We \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Section 3583 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides that a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence of imprisonment for the violation after considering factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)(D), and (a)(4)-(7). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). However, the district court is not required to explicitly consider each of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors or to discuss each of the factors. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 427, 169 L.Ed.2d 299 (2007). Instead, the district court\u2019s consideration of the factors may be demonstrated by its consideration of objections, arguments, and reasoning on the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">For a Class C felony, the district court may not sentence a defendant to more than three years in prison upon revocation of his term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2). Chapter 7 of the Guidelines addresses violations of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>vised release, contains policy statements, and recommends a sentencing range of 5 to 11 months for a Grade C violation with a criminal history category of III. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. We have consistently held that the policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Angelo-Guarino\u2019s arguments that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable are without merit. The district court properly revoked the term of supervised release upon Angelo-Guarino\u2019s admission of his violations. The district court correctly calculated the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. And the district court properly imposed Angelo-Guarino\u2019s sentence specifically stating that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, the Guidelines, the violation report, and the presentations of the parties. Moreover, because the district court was required to consider Angelo-Guarino\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to deter criminal conduct, and the protection of the public from further crimes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e), the district court did not plainly err in considering Angelo-Guarino\u2019s past criminal conduct and flight to Asia to avoid federal and state supervision. <em>See Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320-21; <em>compare with Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252-53. Lastly, the district court\u2019s determination that Angelo-Guarino was not credible and had not changed his pattern of behavior was not clearly erroneous given his denial of criminal wrong-doing, his pattern of lying and abscondment, and the court\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of AngeloGuarino\u2019s testimony in person. <em>See Copeland, </em>20 F.3d at 413. Accordingly, Angelo-Guarino\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Likewise, Angelo-Guarino\u2019s sentence is not substantively unreasonable. Contrary to Angelo-Guarino\u2019s contention, extraordinary circumstances are not necessary to justify a sentence outside of the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595, 597. Here, the district court faced an unrepentant defendant, who absconded from the United States within a month of commencing his term of supervised release with a history of failing to comply with conditions of parole and probation. The court justified its sentence based on Angelo-Guarino\u2019s inability to comply with the conditions of supervised release, suspicions regarding his explanations for his conduct, and the need to deter further criminal conduct and protect the public from future criminal conduct. Considering the testimony, evidence, and record before it, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence that exceeded the Guideline range. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the district court, which had considered the Guidelines but found an upward variant sentence necessary given the defendant\u2019s previous violations, did not abuse its discretion when it imposed a 24-month sentence instead of a Guidelines range sentence of 3 to 9 months\u2019 incarceration).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Therefore, we affirm Angelo-Guarino\u2019s upwardly variant 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\">. Angelo-Guarino did not articulate with specificity any objection to the district court's factual findings, consideration of his past criminal conduct, its conclusion that his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>duct had not changed, or its manner in imposing the sentence. Thus, we review for plain error his arguments that the district court impermissibly: (1) considered his past criminal conduct and the goal of preventing future violations, and (2) based its sentence on unfounded speculation. <em>See United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087-88 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
