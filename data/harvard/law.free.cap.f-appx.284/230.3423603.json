Vences contends that the district court was improperly prevented from considering during sentencing the disparity caused by the lack of an early disposition sentencing program in the Northern District of Texas. Specifically, he contends that this court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682-83 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3053, 168 L.Ed.2d 766 (2007), which held that sentencing courts do not err by refusing to factor in such disparities, was overruled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Although the parties disagree regarding the applicable standard of review, this court need not resolve the disagreement because Vences\u2019s argument fails regardless of which standard is applied. We rejected precisely the same argument in <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Vences challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Clr. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
