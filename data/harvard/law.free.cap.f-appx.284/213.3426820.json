Because cancellation of removal is governed by \u00a7 1229b, the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae applies in the instant case. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>decision regarding cancellation of removal. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir .2004); \u00a7 1229b(b); \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Although Nsibu contends that she has presented legal arguments not subject to the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, this court need not consider her arguments because they essentially challenge the basis for the discretionary denial of her claim for cancellation of removal. <em>See Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 600 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Nsibu additionally petitions for review of the order of the BIA denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. However, the sole issue presented in Nsibu\u2019s motion to reopen was whether new evidence altered the prior, underlying determination that Nsibu was not entitled to cancellation of removal. Because this court does not have jurisdiction over the underlying discretionary issue, we also do not have jurisdiction over the appeal of the decision to deny the motion to reopen. <em>See Rodriguez v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.3d 797, 800 (5th Cir. 2001). Nsibu\u2019s contention that her petition presents constitutional and legal arguments over which this court has jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) is unavailing. <em>See Falek v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 285, 289 n. 2 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Accordingly, the petitions for review are DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
