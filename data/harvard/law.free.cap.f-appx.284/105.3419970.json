Keyes was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for the conspiracy offense and a consecutive 120-month term of imprisonment for the firearm offense. On appeal, we affirmed his convictions but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Keyes, </em>166 Fed.Appx. 64, 67 (4th Cir.2006). At resentencing, the district court sentenced Keyes to an identical sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-26\">Following <em>Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). We must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2008) ] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Keyes challenges the district court\u2019s application of the murder cross-reference in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2A1.1, 2D1.1(d)(1) (2003). Keyes informed Gregory Felton, a member of Keyes\u2019 drug conspiracy, that Gerald Michie had stolen some of their firearms. After a confrontation, Felton killed Michie. Keyes and Felton need not have specifically agreed to kill Michie in order for the murder cross-reference to apply to Keyes. It was necessary only that the murder was reasonably foreseeable to Keyes. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d 233, 250 (4th Cir.2001). We conclude the district court did not err when it found Felton\u2019s actions in response to Keyes\u2019 information about the stolen firearms reasonably foreseeable to Keyes. We conclude the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Next, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. As the sentence is within the advisory Guidelines range, we presume it is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (applying presumption of correctness to within-Guidelines sentence); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness of within-Guidelines sentence). Because Keyes has not rebutted that presumption, we find the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Keyes\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
