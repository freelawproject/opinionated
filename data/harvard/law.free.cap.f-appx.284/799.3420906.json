The defendant has denied such coverage. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court found, in an order entered on January 18, 2008, that plaintiff was not entitled to uninsured motorist coverage because the \u201cprimary insured knowingly and lawfully waived uninsured motorist coverage, and then added [plaintiff] and her vehicle to that policy without changing is material terms.\u201d The court therefore granted defendant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-21\">Plaintiff appeals. We agree, for the reasons the district court articulated in its January 18 order, that plaintiff is not entitled to the uninsured coverage she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
