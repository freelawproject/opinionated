Appellants allege that because the title insurance premium was only $161 under Alabama law, the remaining $50 \u201csurcharge\u201d constituted a fee for something \u201cother than services actually performed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) of RESPA. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">Appellants\u2019 claims that the $221 title insurance premium exceeded the maximum amount authorized by Alabama law are not actionable under RESPA. We have recently joined the Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh and Eight Circuits in holding that \u00a7 8(b) of RESPA \u201cdoes not govern excessive fees because it is not a price control provision.\u201d <em>Friedman v. Market Street Mortgage Corp. (Friedman II), </em>520 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir.2008). We have rejected the notion that courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>should break single fees into various \u201ccomponents\u201d for evaluation, as Appellants would have us do here with the allegedly \u201cearned\u201d versus \u201cunearned\u201d portions of the fee. <em>Id. </em>at 1297. Moreover, we have held that \u201csubsection 8(b) requires a plaintiff to allege that <em>no </em>services were rendered in exchange for a settlement fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298 (emphasis added). Appellants merely claim that they were charged an inflated fee for a service that was indisputably provided by Transnation: the issuance of the title insurance policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 claims are barred by our prior precedent, and the district court rightly found that such claims are beyond the purview of RESPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-23\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a \"district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Castro v. Sec'y of Homeland Security, </em>472 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-14\">. Appellants allege that Transnation split the fee with Swafford Settlement Services but not with the lender. Appellents concede, however, that Swafford did perform a service by acting at Transation\u2019s agent and selling the policy on Transnation's behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-23\">. Appellants' argument that the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s 2001 Statement of Policy is entitled to full <em>Chevron </em>deference is also barred by <em>Friedman II. Id. </em>at 1297 (declining to give <em>Chevron </em>deference to the SOP given the plain language of \u00a7 8(b)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
