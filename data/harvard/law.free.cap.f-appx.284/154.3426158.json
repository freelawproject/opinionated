The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-23\">The complaint is rambling and difficult if not impossible to understand. Plaintiff asserts that he has an interest in the estate of Redell Clewis, Sr. The defendants include the estate\u2019s administrator, a law firm that collects delinquent taxes, an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>for Martha Clewis, an attorney for Kimberly Clewis-James, and an attorney for Redell Clewis, Jr. The plaintiff makes an incoherent claim to the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest on certain property. He also seems to suggest that there were foreclosure actions and other actions by the defendants that somehow violated the automatic stay. He does not articulate, with any degree of clarity, exactly what the actions were or how they are alleged to have violated the automatic stay. Plaintiff also requests the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The district court correctly dismissed for failure to state a claim. Its actions are in all respects AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
