No. 100-242, tit. II, 101 Stat. 1877 (1988) (\u201cELIHPA\u201d) and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Home-ownership Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-625, tit. VI, 104 Stat. 4249 (1990) (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4101^124) (\u201cLIHPRHA\u201d) (collectively \u201cthe Preservation Statutes\u201d). Defendant-Appellant United States (\u201cthe government\u201d) appeals from a final judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, finding that Plaintiff-Appellee CCA Associates (\u201cCCA\u201d) suffered a temporary taking and awarding CCA just compensation. <em>CCA Assocs. v. United States, </em>75 Fed. Cl. 170, 206 (2007). We <em>affirm-in-part, vacate-in-part, and remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">We most recently addressed these issues in <em>Cienega Gardens v. United States, </em>503 F.3d 1266 (Fed.Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cCienega </em>X\u201d). That decision, which issued after the decision of the Court of Federal Claims in this case and the submission of the government\u2019s opening brief, addressed arguments that are in many respects identical to those presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">As a panel of this court, we are obligated to follow our earlier decision in <em>Cienega X. </em>However, notwithstanding <em>Cienega X, </em>the government argues that CCA\u2019s takings claims are not ripe because CCA did not apply for permission to prepay the loan, or, alternatively, that it did not apply for either of the two other benefits available under the Preservation Statutes\u2014the use agreement option and the sale option.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">We find that there is no distinction between the government\u2019s contention here that CCA\u2019s claim is not ripe, and the contention made in <em>Cienega X, </em>which we rejected. Just as applying for permission to prepay was shown in <em>Cienega X </em>to be futile and therefore not necessary for ripeness, so too here the Court of Federal Claims did not err in finding that an application to prepay would be futile and that the takings claim was ripe. In <em>Cienega X, </em>we also rejected the argument that an owner must pursue other statutory options in order to achieve ripeness, holding that \u201cthe ripeness doctrine does not require the owners to apply for voluntary incentives such as the sale option that they did not wish to pursue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275 n. 9. We therefore affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination that CCA\u2019s takings claim is ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">CCA urges that we not follow <em>Cienega X </em>and that the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 conclusion that a taking occurred should be affirmed. We disagree. On the merits of the takings analysis, <em>Cienega X </em>requires that we vacate the judgment here and remand for further consideration in accordance with <em>Cienega X. </em>Here, as in <em>Ciene-ga X, </em>the Court of Federal Claims \u201cshould allow both sides to supplement the record with additional relevant evidence if they wish to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
