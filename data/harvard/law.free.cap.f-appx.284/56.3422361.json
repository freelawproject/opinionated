The district court sentenced Perry to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release, to run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>consecutive to the sentence Perry presently is serving. Specifically, Perry challenges the district court\u2019s application of a four-level upward adjustment imposed pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2)(B) (2006), for use of a dangerous weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The uncontested facts of the assault are that Perry assaulted a correctional officer by throwing a hard plastic food tray at her, causing radial tunnel syndrome in her left arm, and leaving her with permanent injury and disability relative to the use of her arm. Perry claims error on the basis that the district court considered the results of the assault in its determination that the adjustment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The Guidelines define \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d as \u201can instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury,\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.1, application n. 1. We previously have held that \u201cwhat constitutes a dangerous weapon depends not on the object\u2019s intrinsic character but on its capacity, given \u2018the manner of its use,\u2019 to endanger life or inflict serious physical harm.\u201d <em>United States v. Sturgis, </em>48 F.3d 784, 787 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>324 F.2d 264, 266 (4th Cir.1963)). <em>See also United States v. Moore, </em>846 F.2d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir.1988). Accordingly, an instrument need not be inherently dangerous to be a dangerous weapon, and \u201cinnocuous objects or instruments may become capable of inflicting serious injury when put to assaultive use.\u201d <em>Sturgis, </em>48 F.3d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Applying these standards of consideration to the present case, we find that, while the plastic food tray was not inherently dangerous, and, under other circumstances, was innocuous, Perry\u2019s use of the tray as an assaultive weapon was clearly capable of, and did, inflict serious injury. Thus, both as defined under the Guidelines, and in light of applicable law, Perry\u2019s use of the tray under the circumstances in which he used it, and considering the serious injury he inflicted on his victim, fully supports the district court\u2019s application of the upward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Moreover, consideration of the results of the use of the instrument in the application of these standards was not error. Contrary to Perry\u2019s assertion, the food tray clearly was capable of inflicting serious bodily injury because it, in fact, did inflict serious bodily injury upon the correctional officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Accordingly, we find appropriate the district court\u2019s application of a four-level adjustment pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A2.2 (b)(2)(B), and we affirm Perry\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument'because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
