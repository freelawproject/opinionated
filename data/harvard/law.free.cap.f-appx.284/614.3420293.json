On appeal he argues that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting his initial guilty plea, and that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when it denied his counsel\u2019s request to examine a codefendant at that codefendant\u2019s change of plea hearing. He further argues that, although the district court did not err in sentencing him under the guidelines in effect at the time of his sentencing, the recent amendment to the sentencing guidelines decreasing the sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine should be used to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We have an obligation to review, <em>sua sponte, </em>our jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir. 2005). Questions of jurisdiction are reviewed <em>de novo, id., </em>and we lack jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from federal magistrates. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1352 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1149, 166 L.Ed.2d 998 (2007); Fed.R.Crim.P. 59 (failure to file objections with the district court waives a defendant\u2019s right to review). Further, a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty forecloses all non-jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings. <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Because Hill failed to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to initially reject his guilty plea to the district court, we lack jurisdiction to entertain his claim of magistrate judge error. Further, because the right to confront an adverse witness is non-jurisdictional, Hill\u2019s unconditional guilty plea foreclosed his right to assert this issue on appeal. Accordingly, his convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). A defendant is to be sentenced under the guidelines that are in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(a). In the event that the sentencing range upon which a defendant is sentenced is subsequently lowered by the sentencing commission, a defendant may move for a reduction in sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. Specifically, \u00a7 3582 section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">Because Hill alleges no error on the part of the district court, we affirm his sentence. Moreover, the remedy available to Hill under the guidelines, and as stated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, is to move the district court for a reduction in sentence based on the newly enacted amendment. Accordingly, Hill\u2019s convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-16\">.
