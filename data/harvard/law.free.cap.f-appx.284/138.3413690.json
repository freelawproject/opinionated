He contends the district court erred by increasing his sentence for possessing a firearm in connection with possession of methamphetamine, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Hughs asserts the adjustment was inapplicable because there was no evidence his use or possession of the firearm facilitated or made more dangerous any other felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-22\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-25\">The loaded shotgun in Hughs\u2019 van was readily available to Hughs to protect his drug-related activities and had the potential to facilitate those activities. <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1200 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Cir.1994); \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(A). There is an \u201cautomatic increase in the danger of physical violence ... when drugs and guns are present together\u201d. <em>United States v. Houston, </em>364 F.3d 243, 250 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Fadipe, </em>43 F.3d 993, 994-95 (5th Cir.1995)). Therefore, the district court did not err in applying an increase to Hughs\u2019 sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). <em>See United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1200 (5th Cir.1994); \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
