Hernandez claims the district court erred when it granted the Government\u2019s motion in limine, preventing him from asserting an entrapment by estoppel defense at trial. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-19\">A criminal defendant may assert an entrapment by estoppel defense when the government affirmatively assures him that certain conduct is lawful, the defendant thereafter engages in the conduct in reasonable reliance on those assurances, and a criminal prosecution based upon the conduct ensues. <em>See Raley v. Ohio, </em>360 U.S. 423, 438-39, 79 S.Ct. 1257, 3 L.Ed.2d 1344 (1959). To be able to assert the defense, however, a defendant has to show more than \u201cvague or even contradictory\u201d statements by the government; \u201che must demonstrate that there was \u2018active misleading\u2019 in the sense that the government actually told him that the proscribed conduct was permissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Aquino-Chacon, </em>109 F.3d 936, 939 (4th Cir.1997). (internal citation omitted). Because Hernandez\u2019s evidence failed to establish he was entitled to assert the entrapment by estoppel defense, we find that the district court properly granted the Government\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-20\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
