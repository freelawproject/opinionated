BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">Invanov\u2019s application for relief was premised on mistreatment allegedly suffered as a result of being Roma, a minority ethnicity in Bulgaria. On appeal, he argues that: (1) the BIA erred by finding that extraordinary circumstances did not excuse his untimely asylum application; (2) he was entitled to withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) because he suffered past persecution, thus triggering a presumption that his life or freedom would be threatened upon his return to Bulgaria; and (3) he was entitled to relief under CAT because he suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-19\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-20\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA issued its own decision without any adoption. Therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. In addition, the IJ specifically found Ivanov to be credible and the BIA did not address this finding. Therefore, we take his testimony as true. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1255 n. 2 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-21\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">A. <em>Timeliness of Asylum Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We review questions of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ruiz v. Gonzales, 479 </em>F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). An application for asylum must be filed within one year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Although an untimely application may be considered where the Attorney General is satisfied that there are changed or extraordinary circumstances, \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under [\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B)].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), (a)(3). We have held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201celiminates appellate jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s determination whether an alien filed within one year or established extraordinary circumstances to excuse an untimely filing.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Ivanov failed to timely file his application or demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing this untimely filing. <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1231. Accordingly, we DISMISS the petition as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">B. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must establish that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). If the alien establishes past persecution on account of a protected ground, there is a presumption that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). To establish past persecution, the alien must prove that 1) he was persecuted, and 2) the persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). Although the term is not defined by the INA, we have held that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the IJ must consider the cumulative effects of the incidents.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). With respect to nexus, the petitioner must show that he was persecuted because of a protected ground. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">In this ease, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Ivanov did not suffer past persecution because the incidents he described either did not rise to the level of persecution or were not on account of ethnicity. No presumption of future persecution applies, and Ivanov has not asserted that he can show future persecution, and thus, has abandoned the issue. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. Accordingly, the BIA did not err by denying his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">C. <em>Relief under CAT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">\u201cAs a signatory to [CAT], the United States has agreed not to expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\u201d <em>Jean-Pierre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>500 F.3d 1315, 1322-23 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Cir.2007) (quotation and alteration omitted). To obtain relief under CAT, the applicant has the burden of proving that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">In assessing whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed country of removal, all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">(i) Evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">(ii) Evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">(iii) Evidence of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal, where applicable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">(iv) Other relevant information regarding conditions in the country of removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3). We have previously accepted the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulatory definition of torture as one that includes \u201ccertain isolated, vicious and deliberate acts, such as burning with cigarettes, choking, hooding, kalot marassa, and electric shock,\u201d but does not include \u201cother forms of police brutality ... [such as] beatings with fists, sticks, and belts....\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Ivanov has not established that it is more likely than not that he would suffer torture upon his return to Bulgaria. Accordingly, the BIA did not err by denying his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Ivanov petitions for reviews of the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and relief under CAT. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s finding that Ivanov failed to show extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimely filing of his asylum application, we dismiss the petition as to this issue. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of his claim for withholding of removal because the record indicates that Ivanov failed to establish past persecution based on a protected ground and Ivanov abandoned any argument that he has otherwise established that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to Bulgaria. Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Ivanov\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to establish that it would be more likely than not that he would be tortured upon his return to Bulgaria.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
