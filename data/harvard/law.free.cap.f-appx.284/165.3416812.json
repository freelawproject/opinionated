Sarpy and Linda K. Robinson, both African-American females, as Town Treasurer and the Mayor\u2019s Administrative Assistant, respectively. After an election in the fall of 2002, Homer elected Huey Dean\u2014a white male\u2014as the new mayor. Homer also elected a new Board of Selectmen (the \u201cBoard\u201d) comprised of five members: Johnetta Faulkner (a white female), Thomas McDonald (a white male), Jessie Ford (an African-American male), J.C. Moore (an African-American male), and Billy Jenkins (an African-American male). Dean and the Board were sworn into office on January 1, 2003. At that time, Homer faced financial troubles. At a special town meeting on February 20, an independent accountant cautioned that the previous administration had mismanaged restricted funds and that Homer was illegally budgeting a deficit. Accordingly, Dean recommended several cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in Homer\u2019s workforce, which were approved by the Board. Of Homer\u2019s thirty employees (composed of five white employees and twenty-five African-American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>employees), eight employees were terminated, including Appellants, seven of whom were African-American. By letter dated February 25, Appellants were notified that they were terminated due to Homer\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Appellants filed suit against Homer, Dean, and the Board (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d) alleging: (1) race and gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.; </em>(2) denial of the right to make and enforce contracts in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; (3) violation of their rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses; (4) violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and (5) an illegal conspiracy to terminate them in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on all claims. Appellants now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Clark v. America\u2019s Favorite Chicken Co., </em>110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">To establish a prima facie case of race or gender discrimination, each Appellant must establish that she was: a member of a protected class; qualified for the position from which she was discharged; subjected to an adverse employment action; and treated less favorably than similarly situated individuals who were not members of the protected class. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Vaughn v. Edel, </em>918 F.2d 517, 521 (5th Cir.1990). If Appellants establish a prima facie case, \u201cthe burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action.\u201d <em>Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., </em>249 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2001). At that point, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework disappears and \u201cthe plaintiff must produce substantial evidence of pretext\u201d in order to prevail on her discrimination claim. <em>Id. </em>at 402-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The district court found that, even assuming that Appellants established a prima facie case of race and gender discrimination, Homer\u2019s need to reduce the workforce in order to manage its financial difficulties was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale. Furthermore, the district court found that Appellants did not create a genuine issue of material fact that such rationale was pretextual. We agree. Appellants\u2019 proof of pretext consists of their conclusory subjective beliefs, which is insufficient to survive a summary judgment motion. <em>See Bauer v. Albemarle Corp., </em>169 F.3d 962, 967 (5th Cir. 1999) (\u201cThis court has consistently held that an employee\u2019s subjective belief of discrimination alone is not sufficient to warrant judicial relief.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, Appellants do not prevail on their Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Because Appellants\u2019 equal protection, \u00a7 1981, \u00a7 1983, and \u00a7 1985 claims rest upon a finding of racial discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellees on these claims. Similarly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellees in their individual capacities because Appellees did not violate \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Regarding Appellants\u2019 claim that their due process rights were violated because they were not given an opportunity to be heard at the February 20 meeting, we agree with the district court that Appellants have neither presented evidence to support this assertion nor explained how such alleged failure violates their due process rights. Accordingly, this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
