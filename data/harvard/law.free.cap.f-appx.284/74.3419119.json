On appeal, Bromell\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court erred by sentencing Bromell as a career offender based, in part, on his prior South Carolina convictions for possession of crack cocaine. Bromell was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">We review Bromell\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe first step in this review requires us to \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... improperly calculating ... the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). We then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. At this stage of review, we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding our presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">We have reviewed the record and find Bromell\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court did not err in concluding that Bromell\u2019s prior South Carolina conviction for crack cocaine possession constituted a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (2000). <em>See Burgess v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008). Accordingly, the district court correctly determined Bromell\u2019s statutory maximum penalty for the instant offenses was thirty years in prison, and his offense level under the career offender guideline was thirty-four prior to his three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (b) (2007). Finally, the district court reasonably determined that a sentence within Bromell\u2019s advisory guideline range of 188 to 235 months in prison was appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-17\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
