After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">The presentence investigation report detailed Monescar\u2019s criminal history as follows: With respect to those prior offenses for which criminal history points were assigned, the probation officer included a burglary charge and trespass at age 15 and grand theft at ages 16 and 17. At age 19, Monescar was arrested for possession of marijuana and driving with a suspended license. He was sentenced to time served. At age 21, he again was arrested for drugs and received a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">The probation officer listed numerous juvenile convictions for theft, battery, grand theft, grand theft auto, and burglary for which no criminal history points were assigned. The probation officer also noted numerous other charges for theft, battery, burglary, robbery and possession of a firearm, none of which were prosecuted. Monescar\u2019s criminal history category was VI, with an adjusted offense level of 18 and a guidelines range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. (Sentencing Guidelines Table A). The probation officer recommended a possible upward departure in the criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 because the category understated the seriousness of Monescar\u2019s criminal record. Monescar objected to, inter alia, an upward departure in criminal history because most of his previous arrests were as a juvenile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">At sentencing, the court determined the guidelines range to be 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment based on an adjusted offense level of 16. The government moved for an upward departure in the criminal history and the parties agreed that the court could consider the upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 in conjunction with a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court noted that, because Monescar\u2019s criminal history category was a VI, the court could depart vertically in the adjusted offense level to reach an appropriate sentence. The government requested a sentence of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment to keep Monescar incarcerated until he reached age 30. After hearing argument from both sides, the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its authority to depart vertically where, as here, there was a pattern of criminal conduct. The court stated that it would depart upward 3 levels to an adjusted offense level of 19, resulting in a sentencing range of 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court explained that the criminal history category under-repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>sented Monescar\u2019s criminal record, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors made this the appropriate sentencing range. The court then discussed the sentencing factors: there was overwhelming evidence of guilt at trial and Monescar had committed a serious crime, Monescar had a lengthy criminal history that was escalating and now involved gang activity, there was a great need to protect the public and promote respect for the law, and there was a need to punish the behavior. Accordingly, the court imposed a sentence of 72 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court further stated that, even if it had applied \u00a7 4A1.3 incorrectly, it would have imposed the same sentence as a variance under \u00a7 3553(a). Monescar now appeals, asserting that it is unclear whether the court imposed an upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 or a variance under \u00a7 3553(a), challenging the departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 on various grounds, and asserting that there were no extraordinary circumstances to justify the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). We review the ultimate sentence imposed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court recently clarified that courts of appeal are to review sentences for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United </em>States,-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under this review, we must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>An improperly calculated guideline range is considered a procedural error. <em>Id. </em>However, where the district court states that it would impose the same sentence irrespective of any sentencing calculation errors or enhancements, we may review the reasonableness of the sentence while assuming that the court erred in its guideline calculation. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2006). <em>See also United States v. Dean, </em>517 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Section 4A1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines permits a district court to make an upward departure in imposing a sentence on a defendant \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Vertical departures, such as the one imposed here because Monescar\u2019s criminal history category was VI, are expressly permitted under the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4), (comment. n. 2(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">We need not address Monescar\u2019s arguments regarding the upward departure because the district court stated that it would impose the same sentence even if it erred in its guidelines calculations. <em>See Dean, </em>517 F.3d at 1232. The only issue is whether the sentence imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Upon review, we conclude that the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable. The court stated that it had consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it gave a detailed explanation as to how it weighed those factors. The court noted that Monescar had committed a serious crime and had a lengthy criminal history that had escalated to include gang activity. The court also considered the need to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and punish the behavior. And the sentence imposed was below the statutory maximum of ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Accordingly, because Monesear has not shown his sentence is unreasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-13\">.
