Because the ALJ\u2019s holding and the BRB\u2019s affirmance are supported by the substantial evidence, this petition for review is DENIED and the decision of the BRB is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">On December 17, 2002, Horace D. Craft was employed by Boh Brothers when he slipped and fell on a barge, injuring his lower back as well as his right arm and shoulder. As a result, Craft underwent an anterior cervical discectomy on July 23, 2003. Craft returned to work on restricted duty on August 24, 2004. On January 20, 2005, Craft discontinued working on the recommendation of his treating physician due to continued pain. Boh Brothers voluntarily paid Craft temporary total disability compensation from February 28, 2003 through August 23, 2003, and from January 21, 2005 through the date of the formal hearing before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">After a trial, the ALJ determined that Craft reached maximum medical improvement on November 25, 2003, and that, as of that date, he was unable to return to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>previous position at Boh Brothers as a welding foreman due to his remaining physical restrictions. The ALJ also concluded that Boh Brothers failed to establish the availability of alternative suitable employment. Based on these findings, the ALJ awarded Craft temporary total disability from February 28, 2003 through August 23, 2003, and indefinitely beginning January 21, 2005. The ALJ found Boh Brothers liable for the injuries incurred as a result of his December 17, 2002, work injury and assessed damages against it pursuant to Section 14(e) of LHWCA on benefits owed to Craft prior to January 3, 2004, the date on which Boh Brothers filed its notice of controversion. The BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. On appeal, Boh Brothers contends that the BRB erred by affirming the ALJ\u2019s factual determination that the jobs identified by the vocational expert do not establish the availability of suitable employment. Boh Brothers also contends that the ALJ erred in finding it liable for a Section 14(e) assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We review BRB decisions for errors of law and apply the substantial evidence standard to the BRB\u2019s review of the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations. <em>See Odom Constr. Co. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>622 F.2d 110, 115 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 966, 101 S.Ct. 1482, 67 L.Ed.2d 614 (1981). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that relevant evidence\u2014more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance\u2014that would cause a reasonable person to accept the fact finding.\u201d <em>Director, OWCP v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., </em>125 F.3d 303, 305 (5th Cir.1997). We must affirm BRB decisions that conclude correctly that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and are in accordance with the law. <em>See Pride Offshore, Inc. v. Billiot, </em>240 F.3d 1073 (5th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">An employee establishes a prima facie case of disability under LHWCA by showing that he cannot perform his former job due to a job-related injury. <em>New Orleans (Gulfwide) Stevedores v. Turner, </em>661 F.2d 1031, 1038 (5th Cir.1981). Once an employee establishes a prima facie case of disability, the burden shifts to the employer to show the availability of suitable alternative employment. <em>Id. </em>To do so, an employer must demonstrate that there is at least one job in the claimant\u2019s geographic area, which he is realistically capable of performing given his age, background, and physical restraints, and that there is a reasonable likelihood that the claimant would be hired if he diligently pursued the opportunity. <em>Turner, </em>661 F.2d at 1038; <em>see also P &amp; M Crane v. Hayes, </em>930 F.2d 424, 430 (5th Cir.1991). Here, relying heavily on Craft\u2019s 2004 Functional Capacity Evaluation (\u201cFCE\u201d) and the subsequent opinion of Craft\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Bert Bratton, the ALJ found that Craft was restricted from repetitive movement of his head and neck, and that he could not drive for sustained periods of time without difficulty. After reviewing the jobs identified by vocational experts, Nancy Favaloro and Tom Stewart, in light of these restrictions, the ALJ determined that Boh Brothers failed to meet its burden to show that suitable alternative employment existed within the geographic area in which Craft could reasonably be expected to drive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Boh Brothers does not dispute that Craft has made a prima facie showing of disability, nor does it dispute the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Craft\u2019s physical limitations. Rather, it contends that both vocational experts identified jobs in Craft\u2019s geographic area which he could perform, and that the ALJ erred by rejecting those jobs on the basis that Boh Brothers failed to provide sufficient information regarding the physical requirements of each job.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Boh Brothers, it did not need to establish the precise terms and nature of the jobs and such a requirement contravenes this court\u2019s decision in <em>Turner, </em>essentially requiring employers to serve as employment agencies. We disagree. Simply because an employer states that an employee is capable of performing a certain job does not mean that it is so. <em>See Ceres Marine Terminal v. Hinton, </em>243 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.2001)(holding that the ALJ\u2019s factual determination that the employer did not sustain its burden of showing that suitable alternative employment for the claimant was reasonable because the vocational expert failed to \u201cadequately [take] into consideration all of the circumstances that affected [the claimant\u2019s] employability ... \u201d). Rather, this court made clear that to rebut the claimant\u2019s prima facie showing of disability, an employer is required to show that \u201cat the critical times there were jobs reasonably available within [the claimant\u2019s] capability and for which [the claimant] was in a position to reasonably compete realistically had he diligently tided.\u201d 661 F.2d at 1043; <em>see also P &amp; M Crane, </em>930 F.2d at 430-31. Stated differently, an employer\u2019s burden is not limited to simply showing the availability of any job in the national economy; instead, the employer must also prove that the employee is \u201crealistically capable\u201d of performing those jobs identified by the vocational expert in order to satisfy its burden under <em>Turner. See Hinton, </em>243 F.3d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Here, the ALJ noted that \u201cthe labor market survey performed by Ms. Favaloro used restrictions as outlined in the FCE, which ... are not complete.\u201d The ALJ determined that it was necessary to supplement the finding reported in the FCE with the opinion of Bratton, which was given after Craft was unable to continue employment with Boh Brothers on restricted duties. Particularly, as noted above, the ALJ found that Craft should keep his head in a neutral position when working and avoid a + position that requires repetitive movement of the neck and head. Consistent with this conclusion, the ALJ declined to accept Favaloro\u2019s opinion, and after reviewing the jobs in light of Craft\u2019s physical restrictions, the ALJ determined that Boh Brothers failed to meet its burden to establish suitable alternative employment. In light of our review of the entire record and given that Favaloro\u2019s labor market survey was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>on incomplete information, we find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination. Accordingly, we refuse to disturb the BRB\u2019s affirmance on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Boh Brothers also argues that Craft failed to rebut the evidence of suitable alternative employment by showing that he diligently searched for a job but was unable to find one. However, because we affirm the finding that Boh Brothers failed to establish suitable alternative employment, Craft had no duty to seek employment. <em>See Roger\u2019s Terminal &amp; Shipping Corp. v. Director, OWCP, </em>784 F.2d 687, 691 (5th Cir.1986)(noting that the burden shifts to the claimant to demonstrate \u201cthat he diligently tried and was unable to secure employment\u201d after the employer meets its burden to show suitable alternative employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Boh Brothers next asserts that the ALJ erred by assessing a Section 14(e) penalty against it for the difference between the amount of benefits voluntarily paid to Craft and the amount of benefits actually due between February 28, 2003 and January 8, 2004, the date which Boh Brothers filed its notice of controversion. Section 14(e) of LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(e), provides that \u201c[i]f any installment of compensation payable without an award is not paid within 14 days after it becomes due ... there shall be added to such installment an amount equal to 10 per centum thereof,\u201d unless the employer files a timely notice of controversion within 14 days of notice of the claim, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">It is undisputed that Craft filed a claim on May 5, 2003, contending that he was entitled to benefits at a higher rate. At that time, Boh Brothers was required to pay all of the additional benefits sought by Craft within 28 days, or file a notice of controversion within 14 days in order avoid incurring any liability under Section 14(e). Although Boh Brothers increased Craft\u2019s weekly benefits, it did not pay all of the additional benefits sought by Craft and it failed to file a timely notice of conversion. Accordingly, the BRB properly affirmed the decision of the ALJ, assessing a Section 14(e) penalty on the amount of unpaid benefits from February 28, 2003 until the date Boh Brothers filed its notice of controversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the BRB is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">. Favaloro identified eight jobs, each of which the AU determined to be unsuitable. The following positions were found to be unsuitable because they involved repetitive movement of the head and neck: (1) Outside Cashier; (2) Component Assembler; (3) Lab Technician; (4) Manager Trainee; and (5) Communications Officer. The ALJ determined that the Products Specialist job was unsuitable due to the distance from Craft\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>home, and the Sales Associate job was unsuitable given that \"the location of the job is at the maximum acceptable commuting distance\u201d and that Favaloro failed to provide the specifics regarding the physical demands on the job. Similarly, the AU determined that there was \"insufficient evidence in the record\u201d to determine the suitability of the Service Advisor position.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The ALJ found that the report by Stewart, containing two jobs, \"did not specifically identify [those] jobs as suitable alternative employment. Rather, the jobs are noted in a list of potential employers....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-9\">. Boh Brothers also argues that the ALJ erroneously required it to establish a specific job for Craft. This assertion confuses the issue on appeal. Here, the ALJ did not hold that Boh Brothers was required to identify a specific job for Craft, rather he found that Boh Brothers was required to establish the availability of jobs that Craft could perform given his physical restrictions as required under <em>Turner.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
