The parties signed a settlement agreement, the validity of which Clarke thereafter disputed in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">First, in Case No. 08-1053, Kevin Clarke seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting Provident\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement agreement and denying Clarke\u2019s motion to nullify the settlement agreement. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on November 2, 2007, and Clarke\u2019s notice of appeal and motion for an extension of time to appeal were filed on December 19, 2007. Clarke\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely filed, and the district court\u2019s finding that Clarke failed to demonstrate excusable neglect necessary to extend the appeal period was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Thompson v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., </em>76 F.3d 530, 533 (4th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we dismiss Clarke\u2019s appeal in No. 08-1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">Next, in Case No. 08-1400, Clarke seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to alter or amend judgment. The motion was not timely under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e), and relief was not warranted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) because the motion simply sought reconsideration of the issues already decided by the district court. <em>See CNF Constructors, Inc. v. Donohoe Constr. Co., </em>57 F.3d 395, 401 (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order in No. 08-1400.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">Finally, in Case No. 08-1401, Clarke appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for appointment of counsel. Finding no abuse of discretion, <em>see Miller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>v. Simmons, </em>814 F.2d 962, 964-65 (4th Cir.1987), we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Clarke, </em>No. 1:06-cv-00792-JCC (E.D.Va. Mar. 19, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">No. 08-1053 <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">No. 08-1400 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">No. 08-1401 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\"> To the extent that Clarke seeks to appeal the denial of his motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, which was submitted in the same document as his motion to alter and amend, we likewise dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated above in our dismissal of Case No. 08-1053.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
