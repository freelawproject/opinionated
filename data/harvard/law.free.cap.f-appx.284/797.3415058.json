Specifically, Paredes states that the court should have given more weight to evidence of (1) his cultural assimilation, (2) his hard working nature, and (3) the fact that he had not been arrested since the birth of his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-24\">This court has previously held that \u201c[i]t is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). The doctrine of invited error applies to situations in which \u201ca party induces or invites the district court into making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>error.\u201d <em>United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Because the record demonstrates that Paredes requested, and ultimately received, a low-end guideline sentence and because he never objected to the 41-month sentence at the sentencing hearing, we conclude that he invited any error that may have occurred, and may not now challenge the reasonableness of his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm Paredes\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
