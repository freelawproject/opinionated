At sentencing, the Government moved for a downward departure based on Cabiness\u2019 substantial assistance. Consequently, Cabiness was sentenced below the applicable sentencing guidelines range and below the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">Subsequently, the district court granted the Government\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion for reduction of sentence in light of Cabiness\u2019 assistance in a state murder prosecution. The court reduced Cabiness\u2019 sentence to 132 months\u2019 imprisonment by written order dated December 29, 2006 (\u201cDecember 2006 order\u201d) and entered an amended judgment reflecting this sentence. Cabiness moved to reconsider the December 2006 order, claiming the district court did not consider the full scope of his cooperation and contending his sentence should be reduced by an additional thirty-four months. The district court denied reconsideration by written order dated March 9, 2007 (\u201cMarch 2007 order\u201d). Cabiness filed a pro se motion for leave to appeal both orders out of time on March 29, 2007.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-19\">We first address the timeliness of Cabiness\u2019 appeal of the December 2006 and March 2007 orders. In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of an order or judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). These time periods are manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tory and jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">By written order, the district court found Cabiness\u2019 notice of appeal was untimely as to the court\u2019s December 2006 order. This finding was proper, as the notice of appeal was filed outside the thirty-day extension period for excusable neglect or good cause. We therefore dismiss Cabiness\u2019 appeal to the extent he challenges the underlying December 2006 order granting the Government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion and imposing a term of 132 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Cabiness\u2019 notice of appeal from the March 2007 order denying reconsideration was filed during the thirty-day extension period. Exercising an abundance of caution, the district court found Cabiness demonstrated excusable neglect warranting the extension of time of the appeal period from the March 2007 order. Cabiness\u2019 appeal of the March 2007 order denying reconsideration is therefore not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">To the extent Cabiness claimed in his motion for reconsideration that the district court improperly elected not to hold an evidentiary hearing in the sentencing reduction matter, this claim is cognizable on appeal as an allegation that the sentence was imposed in violation of law under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1) (2000). <em>See United States v. Pridgen, </em>64 F.3d 147, 149 (4th Cir.1995). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 150. A court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based \u201con an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). In light of these principles and after careful review of the applicable materials in the briefs and Joint Appendix, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s March 2007 order and dismiss Cabiness\u2019 appeal to the extent he challenges the December 2006 order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-14\"> Prior to the district court\u2019s order concerning the timeliness of Cabiness\u2019 appeal, we directed the parties to address the timeliness issue and appointed appellate counsel for Cabiness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
