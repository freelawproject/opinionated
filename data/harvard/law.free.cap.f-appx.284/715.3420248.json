The Petitioners argue on appeal that they are entitled to asylum based upon the cumulative effects of all of the events that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>occurred both before and after their one-year stay in the United States,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the IJ erred by considering only the events that the Petitioners experienced following their return to Peru. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Moscoso and Pierre, natives and citizens of Peru, were admitted to the United States on or about April 22, 2003, as a nonimmigrant visitors for pleasure. On January 7, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued them separate Notices to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging that they were subject to removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as nonimmigrants who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted. On April 21, 2004, Moscoso<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Moscoso indicated on the application that she sought relief based upon her political opinion and membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">At the removal hearing, Moscoso testified that she worked for the Program of Support for the Repopulation and Development of Emergency Zones (\u201cPAR\u201d), a government organization in charge of gathering census information from poor people in \u201cemergency zones.\u201d Moscoso stated that, on separate occasions, she received threatening calls, had rocks thrown at her, and had a machine gun pointed at her head. As a result of those events, she and Pierre decided to leave Peru in 2001. Moscoso remained in Peru without incident for approximately two months before she joined Pierre in the United States. The Petitioners stayed in the United States for approximately one year. After their return to Peru, some unidentified people on a large motorcycle taxi followed the Petitioners, insulting them and hitting the Petitioners\u2019 car with a large piece of iron. In November 2002, the Petitioners fired their maid because they discovered that the maid was stealing from them, and, shortly after-wards, the Petitioners noticed that the tire bolts of their car had been loosened. The Petitioners later learned that the maid was connected to a gang. Finally, Moscoso described an incident at a gas station where \u201csome guys,\u201d whom Moscoso described were terrorists, beat, kicked, and insulted the Petitioners. The Petitioners returned to the United States in April 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">The IJ denied the Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief, and ordered Moscoso and Pierre removed to Peru. Among other things, the IJ found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">The respondent, Mrs. Moscoso, lived in Lima, Peru, before she traveled to the United States in May 2001. While in Peru[,] the respondent, Mrs. Moscoso, encountered no problems. It appeared that the problem, if any, is localized in the very poor area where she worked and not nationwide. The respondent, by law, is required to relocate to a safe area and she appeared to have resided [] safely in Lima, Peru, and therefore, the respondents can relocate elsewhere in Peru without encountering the problems from these elements previously identified by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>The BIA dismissed the Petitioners\u2019 appeal and denied their motion to remand. The BIA determined that the Petitioners were not entitled to asylum because they: (1) failed to establish that any of the experiences they described constituted persecution on account of a protected ground; (2) failed to establish that Moscoso was targeted due to imputed political opinion; (3) failed to show how \u201cPAR\u201d satisfied the requirements for recognition as a particular social group; and (4) failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that they could safely relocate within Peru. The BIA also found that the Petitioners were not entitled to withholding of removal and noted that the Petitioners had not challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al-Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial evidence test, we cannot find or consider \u201cfacts not raised in the administrative forum, nor can [it] reweigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will reverse the agency\u2019s factual determinations only where the record compels reversal. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The record is reviewed in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of that decision. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The Attorney General may grant asylum if an alien is a refugee within the meaning of the INA. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). The INA defines \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The alien bears the burden to demonstrate \u201c(1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). That presumption may be rebutted if the government demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence either that: (1) \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change of circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant\u2019s country,\u201d or (2) \u201c[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of last habitual residence, and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>cant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A)-(B), 208.13(b)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">\u201cIf the applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, an applicant may still establish asylum based upon proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1007 (11th Cir.2008) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)). A well-founded fear of future persecution can be established by \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). As an alternative to demonstrating that he would be \u201csingled out for persecution,\u201d an alien may show a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). The alien must show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">An applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality or, if stateless, another part of the applicant's country of last habitual residence, if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Initially, the Petitioners fail to raise any arguments in their briefs concerning: (1) the denial of withholding of removal; (2) the denial of CAT relief; or (3) the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion to remand. Therefore, the Petitioners have abandoned those issues. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The Petitioners have failed to challenge the finding that they could safely relocate in both their appeal to the BIA and in their <em>initial </em>brief here on appeal and, instead, raise the issue for the first time in their reply brief. Thus, the issue of whether Petitioners could safely relocate within Peru is unexhausted and abandoned. <em>See Al-Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283 n. 12 (noting that, when an issue, not raised before the BIA, is raised for the first time after the initial briefs on appeal, the unexhausted issue is deemed abandoned); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lacked jurisdiction to review an unexhausted issue even though the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>considered it).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of the Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the IJ erred by failing to consider the events that occurred before the Petitioners traveled to the United States in 2001, and that the Petitioners suffered past persecution based upon the cumulative effect of all the events to which they claimed occurred, the Petitioners did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution in light of the finding that they could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of Peru. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(B); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii). As such, the Petitioners were not entitled to asylum because they were not \u201crefugees\u201d within the meaning of the INA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256. Accordingly, as the unchallenged finding is dispositive of the Petitioners\u2019 claims, we need not address the Petitioners\u2019 other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">. Pierre left for the United States in February 2001, and Moscoso later joined him in May 2001. The Petitioners returned to Peru in February 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-15\">. Moscoso is the lead respondent; however, Pierre filed the original asylum application. At the hearing on May 19, 2004, Petitioners admitted to the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
