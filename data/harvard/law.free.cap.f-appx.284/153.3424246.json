The Immigration Judge found Wung to lack credibility, and Wung failed to challenge that finding in his appeal to the BIA. Wung therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and we are without jurisdiction to review this issue that is essential to the success of Wung\u2019s claims. <em>See Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181-82 (5th Cir.1986). The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
