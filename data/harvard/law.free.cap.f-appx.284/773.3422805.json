Ray argues that he is \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to an indictment pending since May 12, 2000, and the district court erred in finding that a second indictment filed after that date acted as a superseding indictment. He contends that the continued pendency of the original indictment violates his right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Nyland, v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). A prisoner may bring an action for writ of habeas corpus if the prisoner is \u201cin custody\u201d in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 2241 as requiring a habeas petitioner to be \u201cin custody\u201d under the conviction or sentence he seeks to attack at the time his petition is filed. <em>Carafas v. LaVallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 238, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 1560, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">The Supreme Court has noted that an Alabama prisoner subject to a Kentucky detainer placed on him because of a pending indictment is \u201cin custody\u201d because the Alabama warden acts as an agent of the commonwealth of Kentucky. <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, </em>410 U.S. 484, 489 n. 4, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 1126 n. 4, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973). The Supreme Court has also held that a petitioner under a detainer placed on the petitioner by a state was \u201cin custody\u201d even though he was currently incarcerated pursuant to federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>charges in a federal penitentiary and his state sentence had yet to begin. <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 493, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1926, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). The Court explained that the state\u2019s detainer ensured that, at the conclusion of the prisoner\u2019s federal sentence, he would be returned to state authorities to begin serving his state sentence. <em>Id. </em>A prisoner serving consecutive sentences was \u201cin custody\u201d under any one of them for purposes of \u00a7 2241. <em>Peyton v. Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54, 67, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Under Alabama law, an indictment must not be quashed or dismissed without the permission of the court and such permission must be entered on the record. Ala. Code \u00a7 15-8-130. Reindictment for the same offense does not have the effect of dismissing the first indictment. <em>Ex Parte Washington, </em>716 So.2d 253, 255 (Ala.Crim. App.1998). \u201cWhile it is the duty of the district attorney to decide whether a criminal act shall be prosecuted, once a warrant or indictment has been initiated, the trial court has the final authority regarding the ultimate disposition of the case.\u201d <em>State v. McNeill, </em>716 So.2d 250, 253 (Ala.Crim. App.1998). Although only a court has the authority to dismiss an indictment, the better practice is to bring the second indictment before the first is quashed. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>479 So.2d 1377, 1381 (Ala.Crim. App.1985). In <em>Johnson, </em>a second indictment was brought after a first indictment without leave of the court. <em>Id. </em>The court later quashed the first indictment, but the failure to quash the first indictment had no affect on the validity of the second indictment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Although, under Alabama law, the first indictment remains pending, the second indictment is still valid, providing the basis for Ray\u2019s current sentence. Ray\u2019s reliance on cases in which a petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d on an indictment pursuant to a detain-er is inapposite because no detainer has been placed on Ray. Because Ray is currently \u201cin custody\u201d on the second indictment and not the indictment which he seeks to attack, he has failed to demonstrate that he is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-14\">. Ray also argues that the district court erred in stating that it appeared as if he had not exhausted his state court remedies. Because the federal courts lack jurisdiction to address Ray\u2019s petition because he was not \"in custody,\u201d we need not address the issue of exhaustion. Moreover, even though the district court granted a broad certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d), the district court did not make any specific findings as to exhaustion, confining its decision to the issue of \"in custody,\u201d and, thus, review under the COA was limited to that issue alone. We therefore, lack jurisdiction to address the issue of exhaustion because it was not included in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250\u201451 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that appellate review is limited to issues specified in the COA).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
