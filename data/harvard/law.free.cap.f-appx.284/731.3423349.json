This yielded a base offense level of 26. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). Gonzalez was a career offender, so the PSI increased that level to 34 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), (b)(B). A downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. 3El.l(a), (b), resulted in a total offense level of 31. This coupled with a criminal history category of VI produced a sentence range of 188-235 months\u2019 imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>As indicated above, the sentences Gonzalez received were at the low end of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Gonzalez says that his sentences are unreasonable because he did not receive the benefit of Guidelines amendment 2007. The 2007 amendment provided for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for crack, but he did not receive the benefit of the reduction. The PSI, and thus the court, converted the crack he possessed into its marijuana equivalency because he was also convicted of possessing cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We review Gonzalez\u2019s sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cOur review for reasonableness is deferential, and the party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court recently clarified that, under a reasonableness review, an appellate court is to review sentencing decisions for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, reduced the base offense levels for offenses involving crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706. When a defendant is convicted of possessing multiple types of drugs, the Guidelines provide that each drug must be converted into its marijuana equivalency, and the base offense level is determined based on the combined marijuana equivalency for the different drugs. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. (n. 10(b), (D)). The base offense level is not determined by the combined marijuana equivalency, however, where, as here, the defendant qualifies as a career offender, and the career offender base offense level is higher than the combined marijuana equivalency offense level, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), as it is in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">A district court\u2019s first duty in fashioning a sentence is correctly to calculate, and consult, the Guideline sentence range. Next, the court must take into consideration the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-11\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to the victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-12\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court need not state on the record that it explicitly considered each factor, nor discuss each factor; it is sufficient for the court to acknowledge that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Additionally, how much weight an individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor should receive is committed to the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">Here, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines sentence range and acknowledged that it had considered Gonzalez\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Gonzalez\u2019s sentences are therefore reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-17\">.
