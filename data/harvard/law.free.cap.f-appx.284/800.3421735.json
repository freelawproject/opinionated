Because the BIA correctly determined that the offense qualified as an aggravated felony, we lack jurisdiction to review the removal order. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-24\">Matamoros arrived in the United States in 2000 and became a lawful permanent resident. In 2006, he was convicted in North Carolina of indecent liberties with a child, in violation of N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-202.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this conviction, the Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to appear, charging him with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) on the grounds that his conviction qualified as an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-25\">At the removal hearing, Matamoros admitted the allegations, and the IJ found Matamoros removable. Matamoros then appealed to the BIA, arguing that under the categorical approach, the entire range of conduct prohibited by the statute must qualify as sexual abuse in order to constitute a removable offense. He explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>that it was clear that the statute did not qualify because the North Carolina legislature enacted \u00a7 15A-1343(b2), which required courts to determine if an offense under \u00a7 14-202.1 constituted sexual abuse of a minor, and if every violation of \u00a7 14-202.1 qualified as sexual abuse, this second statute would be unnecessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also attempted to distinguish <em>Bahar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>264 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir.2001), in which this court held that the North Carolina statute under which Matamoros was convicted constituted an aggravated felony. He then argued that the BIA was not bound by\u2014and should overrule\u2014the decision in <em>Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>Int. Dec. 3411 (1999) (discussing Texas law prohibiting indecency with a child by exposure) because the Texas statute differed from the North Carolina statute. He urged the BIA to adopt a definition of sexual abuse consistent with that in the federal criminal code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. Finally, he argued that the rule of lenity required the BIA to conclude the offense was not an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order of removal, concluding that it was bound by Eleventh Circuit precedent, and the plain language of the North Carolina statute confirmed that Matamoros\u2019s conviction qualified as an aggravated felony. Matamoros now petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">This court must inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). Section 1252(a)(2)(C) provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, \u201c[njothing in [\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) ] ... shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). In <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 425 </em>F.3d 1356, 1359-60 (11th Cir. 2005), this court determined that the question of whether a conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under a different immigration provision was a question of law within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Accordingly, we have subject matter jurisdiction to review Matamoros\u2019s claims in his petition that his state conviction was not an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Our review is limited, however, to determining whether Matamoros is an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony. <em>Bahar, </em>264 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">An alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Relevant to this case, aggravated felony is defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>sexual abuse of a minor. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Our conclusion is dictated by <em>Bahar, </em>in which this court considered the statute at issue here and determined that the crime defined by \u00a7 14-202.1 of the North Carolina General Statute qualified as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d if the \u201cfull range of conduct\u201d covered by the statute fell within the meaning of the term. 264 F.3d at 1311. Relying on the plain meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>term \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d this court concluded that the term \u201cincludes not only acts that involve physical contact between the perpetrator and the victim, but also acts that do not.\u201d <em>Bahar, </em>264 F.3d at 1311. In reaching this decision, the court considered the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez </em>and found the decision reasonable and thus entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">As the government notes, we are bound by decisions of prior panels until overruled by this court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. King, </em>509 F.3d 1338, 1343 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Chambers v. Thompson, </em>150 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, <em>Bahar </em>controls, and the BIA properly determined that Matamoros was removable for having committed an aggravated felony. Moreover, the fact that Matamoros raises arguments not considered in the prior decision is irrelevant to the application of the prior panel rule. <em>See, e.g., Saxton v. ACF Indus., </em>239 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir.2001) (noting \u201cthat holding [of the earlier panel] is the law of this Circuit regardless of what might have happened had other arguments been made to the panel that decided the issue first\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Finally, although this court retains jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions such as Matamoros\u2019s due process claim, Matamoros is not entitled to relief. The BIA implicitly considered his argument that <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez </em>should be overruled when it determined that it was bound by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bahar. </em>Moreover, it appears that Matamoros only couches his allegations of error in constitutional language, but he does not raise genuine constitutional violations. As such, this court would lack jurisdiction to reach his issues. <em>See Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Because the BIA properly concluded that Matamoros was an alien who was removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony, and we lack jurisdiction to review the removal order. Accordingly, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-18\">. Under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-202.1,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-19\">(a) A person is guilty of taking indecent liberties with children if, being 16 years of age or more and at least five years older than the child in question, he (1) Willfully takes or attempts to take any immoral, improper, or indecent liberties with any child of either sex under the age of 16 years for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">. Matamoros\u2019s argument is misplaced. Section 15A-1343 applies to conditions of probation. Subsection (b2) lists specific terms of probation for those convicted of sexual abuse of a minor. The statute does not require the court to make any specific finding about the conviction. Notably, however, the state court applied the same special conditions listed in this subsection to Matamoros.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
