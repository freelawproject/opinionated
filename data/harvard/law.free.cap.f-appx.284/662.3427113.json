On appeal, Flores-Moya argues that the district court improperly applied the Guidelines by enhancing his offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a dangerous weapon because he had no knowledge of or connection to the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, but accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177-78 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">A district court must correctly apply the Guidelines to calculate the Guideline range. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. In applying the Guidelines, the court may rely upon the factual statements concerning relevant conduct in the PSI unless the defendant objects to those statements. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). While explicit findings of fact and determinations are preferred, a court\u2019s failure to make such findings and determinations does not require remand, if the recox\u2019d clearly supports the court\u2019s implicit determination. <em>United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1528-29 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Under the Guidelines, if a defendant possesses a dangerous weapon in relation to a drug offense, his offense level is incx\u2019eased by 2 levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The commentax\u2019y instructs that the weapon enhancement should be applied if a weapon was present, unless it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 3. The commentary states that an unloaded hunting rifle in a residential closet would be an example of clear improbability. <em>Id. </em>The government beax\u2019s the burden of establishing the existence of the weapon and its proximity to the site of the offense. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Once the government meets its burden, the bxxrden shifts to the defendant to \u201cshow that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly impi'obable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Even if a co-conspirator was the actual possessor of the weapon, the weapon enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) may apply. <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>24 F.3d 1314, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1994). If the enhancement is based on a co-conspirator\u2019s possession, the government must establish that the conspirator was charged and possessed the weapon in furtherance of the conspiracy, and that the defendant whose offense level is being enhanced was a member of the conspiracy at the time of the possession. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we held in <em>United States v. Pessefall, </em>27 F.3d 511, 515 (11th Cir.1994), that it was reasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would use a weapon to protect cocaine during unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we discern no error. Because Flores-Moya boarded the vessel in order to participate in a dxmg trafficking conspiracy, and weapons intended for protection were found onboard, the district court properly increased his offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a dangerous weapon. Accordingly, we affirm the distxict coui\u2019t\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
