Fontenot\u2019s conviction stems from a traffic stop. He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence that led to his arrest and his ultimate conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">On appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Nunez-Sanchez, </em>478 F.3d 663, 666 (5th Cir.2007). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the prevailing party in this case. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>451 F.3d 320, 329 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1472, 170 L.Ed.2d 298 (2008). All inferences are \u201cindulge[d] ... in favor of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.\u201d <em>United States v. Polk, </em>118 F.3d 286, 296 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">Fontenot\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the traffic stop was unlawful at its outset. Whether a traffic stop constitutes a violation of a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights is analyzed under the standard announced in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506-07 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). This is a two-part inquiry: \u201cCourts first examine whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and then inquire whether the officer\u2019s subsequent actions were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. \u201cFor a traffic stop to be justified at its inception, an officer must have an objectively reasonable suspicion that some sort of illegal activity, such as a traffic violation, occurred, or is about to occur.... \u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d 420, 430 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">In this case, law enforcement officers testified that they observed Fontenot driving a vehicle that did not display a rear license plate. Upon approaching the vehicle and shining a spotlight on it, the officers could see a temporary license plate lying on the rear dashboard but could not read it. Fontenot maintains that because the temporary license plate was visible from the rear of the vehicle, the stop was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">At the time of the stop, the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) required that temporary, thirty-day cardboard license tags \u201cbe displayed in a manner that is clearly visible and legible when viewed from the rear of the vehicle.\u201d 16 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 111.9(b); <em>see </em>43 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 17.23(d)(1) (2002). The Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Transportation Code, which applies to the operator of the vehicle, incorporated the TAC regulations on temporary registration tags. Tex. Trans. Code \u00a7 503.069 (Vernon Supp.2002). Because the transportation code requires that temporary tags be displayed in accordance with the rules of the administrative code, the officers\u2019 stop of Fontenot\u2019s vehicle was proper in light of the fact that the paper registration tag in the rear window was not legible from the rear of the vehicle as required by Texas law. The distance at which the tag was legible is irrelevant as both officers testified that they could not read the tag until after the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
