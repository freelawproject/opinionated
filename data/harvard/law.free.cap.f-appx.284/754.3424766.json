The government then instituted an <em>in rem </em>civil forfeiture action against the currency, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(A) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6), and Mesa responded by filing a claim to the currency. Having consolidated the two cases, the district court ultimately struck Mesa\u2019s claim for lack of standing and entered a default judgment awarding forfeiture to the government. On appeal, Mesa argues that he had standing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F) because the government, after failing to provide timely written notice of the seizure, was not permitted to file a civil forfeiture action until it returned the currency to him. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-20\">Standing \u201cis a threshold jurisdictional question which must be addressed prior to and independent of the merits of a party\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 974 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). In fact, we are obliged to consider standing <em>sua sponte </em>even if the parties have not raised the issue because an appellate court \u201cmust satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also of that of the lower courts in a cause under review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975 (quotation omitted). As with all jurisdictional issues, we review standing determinations <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">A claimant must satisfy both the requirements of Article III standing as well as statutory standing in order to contest a forfeiture action. <em>United States v. $38,000.00 Dollars in U.S. Currency, </em>816 F.2d 1538, 1543-44 (11th Cir.1987). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>order to satisfy Article III standing in the forfeiture context, a claimant must demonstrate the existence of an injury by establishing either an ownership or lesser possessory interest in the property. <em>Via Mat Int\u2019l South America Ltd. v. United States, </em>446 F.3d 1258, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2006). With respect to statutory standing, the Civil Forfeiture Asset Reform Act of 2000 (\u201cCAFRA\u201d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">In any case in which the Government files in the appropriate United States district court a complaint for forfeiture of property, any person claiming an interest in the seized property may file a claim asserting such person\u2019s interest in the property in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(4)(A). Under the Supplemental Rules, the government may move to strike the claimant\u2019s claim based on a failure to comply with Supplemental Rule G(5)\u2014formerly Rule C(6)\u2014or for lack of standing. Supp. Rule G(8)(c)(i). Supplemental Rule G(5) provides that, in filing a claim to the government\u2019s forfeiture action, the claimant must, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cstate [his] interest in the property.\u201d Supp. Rule G(5)(a)(i)(B). We have stated that compliance with this latter requirement \u201cis obligatory in order for a party to have standing to challenge an <em>in rem </em>claim.\u201d <em>Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V Olympia Voyager, </em>463 F.3d 1233, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe burden of establishing standing in forfeiture proceedings is on the claimant.\u201d <em>United States v. Five Hundred Thousand Dollars, </em>730 F.2d 1437, 1439 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">In order to establish standing to challenge the government\u2019s judicial civil forfeiture action, Mesa relies on the following statutory provision governing <em>non-judicial </em>forfeiture proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">If the Government does not send notice of a seizure of property in accordance with subparagraph (A) to the person from whom the property was seized, and no extension of time is granted, the Government shall return the property to that person without prejudice to the right of the Government to commence a forfeiture proceeding at a later time. The Government shall not be required to return contraband or other property that the person from whom the property was seized may not legally possess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Mesa\u2019s argument is not supported by any controlling authority. CAFRA expressly provides that a claimant who wishes to file a claim contesting a government\u2019s <em>judicial </em>civil forfeiture action must comply with the requirements of the Supplemental Rules. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(4)(A). Furthermore, this Court has stated that compliance with this statutory requirement is \u201cobligatory.\u201d <em>Dresdner Bank, </em>463 F.3d at 1237. Mesa\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F) to establish standing and skirt this requirement is undermined by the fact that this provision governs <em>non-judicial </em>forfeiture proceedings. Thus, \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F) is not applicable once the government institutes a judicial civil forfeiture action, which is governed by the Supplemental Rules, a different set of statutory provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Because Mesa failed to argue that his claim complied with the requirements of the Supplemental Rules, he has not met his burden to show statutory standing. We therefore do not address the parties\u2019 additional arguments. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Via </em>Mat\u2014excepting a claimant from complying with the Supplemental Rules because the government failed to bring its judicial civil forfeiture action within 90 days after the claimant filed his claim\u2014is distinguishable because \u00a7 983(a)(3) expressly requires the government to bring its judicial civil forfeiture action within 90 days after a claim has been filed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(3)(A). In this case, \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F) does not expressly impose any pre-condition on the government\u2019s ability to bring a civil forfeiture action. Likewise, this Court's unpublished opinion in <em>De Saro v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>173 Fed.Appx. 760 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished), is also distinguishable. Although this Court reversed, in part, under \u00a7 983(a)(1)(F) because the government failed to comply with the 60-day written notice requirement, that appeal addressed only the plaintiff\u2019s Rule 41 complaint, rather than a judicial civil forfeiture action brought by the government, as we have here. <em>Id. </em>at 761-64. Moreover, the <em>De Saro </em>Court implicitly noted that its ruling requiring the property to be returned did not prevent the government from proceeding with its recently filed judicial civil forfeiture action, despite the fact that this action had been instituted before the government returned the property in accordance with the Court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 765-66.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
