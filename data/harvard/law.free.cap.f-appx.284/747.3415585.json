Alvarez contends that the district court plainly erred by: (1) failing to <em>sua sponte </em>declare a mistrial on count one after Jose Gonzalez, a government witness and confidential informant, testified at trial that he knew Alvarez had a criminal record; (2) failing to <em>sua sponte </em>enter a post-verdict judgment of acquittal on count one on the ground that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict rested on the harmfully prejudicial exchange between the government and Gonzalez regarding Alvarez\u2019s criminal record; and (3) failing to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss the indictment on the ground that the government was over-involved in the particular reverse sting operation used in this case and thus violated Alvarez\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Because Alvarez did not raise any of these arguments during his trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, \u201c[a]n appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). An error is \u201cplain\u201d if \u201cit is obvious and clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 948 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1305, 167 L.Ed.2d 117 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Alvarez first contends that the district court plainly erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>order a mistrial after Gonzalez testified that he knew Alvarez had a criminal record. \u201c[A] trial judge has discretion to grant a mistrial since [she] is in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of a statement or evidence on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">If the district court issues a curative instruction, \u201cwe will reverse only if the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u201d <em>See United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 845 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (holding that the district court\u2019s curative instruction cured any potential prejudice caused by a witness\u2019s testimony that the drug trafficking defendant previously had been involved in the drug trade and incarcerated in Cuba); <em>see also United States v. Mejia, </em>82 F.3d 1032, 1038 n. 7 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that witness\u2019s testimony that he knew defendant from \u201cpast dealings\u201d was not grounds for a new trial where court quickly struck the response and instructed the jury to disregard it). In making that determination, we presume that the jury followed the district court\u2019s curative instruction. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1352 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">At trial, the government played for the jury without objection statements made by Alvarez admitting his prior involvement in drug smuggling, which lessened the likelihood of undue prejudice from Gonzalez\u2019s statement that Alvarez had a criminal record. In addition, follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>ing Gonzalez\u2019s statement, the district court sustained Alvarez\u2019s objection and instructed the jury that it was to \u201cdisregard both the question and the answer, any reference to criminal records that were before the jury.\u201d We presume that the jury followed this instruction, <em>see Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1352, and we conclude that it cured any potential prejudice caused by the mention of Alvarez\u2019s criminal record, <em>see Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d at 845; <em>Mejia, </em>82 F.3d at 1038 n. 7. Accordingly, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>declare a mistrial. <em>See also United States v. Perez, </em>30 F.3d 1407, 1411 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen a court gives a direct and explicit curative instruction regarding improper testimony, it supports the court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial by decreasing the possibility of undue prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Alvarez next contends that the district court plainly erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>enter a post-verdict judgment of acquittal on the count one conspiracy charge. According to Alvarez, when the district court learned that the jury had acquitted him on counts two, three, and four of the indictment, the court should have concluded that the guilty verdict on count one rested on Gonzalez\u2019s statement that Alvarez had a criminal record. To support a conspiracy conviction, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the existence of an agreement between the defendant and one or more persons; (2) the object of which is to commit an unlawful act. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005). It is unlawful to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Alvarez\u2019s contention is without merit. Alvarez\u2019s counsel conceded at trial that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction on the conspiracy charge in count one, stating that \u201cthe defendant would agree, there is sufficient evidence taken in the light most favorable to the Government to establish that an agreement was entered into and that that agreement was for the elicit purposes, which are stated in the indictment.\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any legal question.\u201d Moreover, the record does not support his argument that the jury\u2019s acquittal on the other three counts must have meant that the jury found him guilty on the conspiracy charge simply because of Gonzalez\u2019s brief statement that Alvarez had a criminal record, especially in light of the court\u2019s curative instruction. <em>See Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1352 (\u201cA jury is presumed to follow the instructions given to it by the district judge.\u201d). The district court did not err by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>grant Alvarez a judgment of acquittal on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Finally, Alvarez contends that the district court plainly erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss the indictment on the ground that the government\u2019s sting operation violated his right to due process. Alvarez argues that the government was over-involved in the sting operation that led to his arrest and conviction because government agents: (1) created the entire scenario for a fictitious robbery of drugs, (2) from \u201cbad people\u201d rather than innocent civilians, (3) that was initiated by an informant who is a friend of the lead defendant, and (4) provided crucial assistance to commit the crime, such as using the informant to transport the suspects to meetings and providing a vehicle to the suspects. According to Alvarez, once the district court heard all the evidence, the court should have realized that the sting operation violated Alvarez\u2019s due process rights and <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the indictment. The district court\u2019s failure to do so, he argues, was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">\u201cWe have recognized that government infiltration of criminal activity is a legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>mate and permissible means of investigation and frequently necessitates the government agent\u2019s supplying something of value to the criminal.\u201d <em>United States v. Puett, </em>735 F.2d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.1984). \u201cGovernment involvement in criminal activity constitutes a due process violation only where it violates \u2018fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal cause of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gianni, </em>678 F.2d 956, 960 (11th Cir.1982) (citations omitted). We have repeatedly rejected \u201cchallenges to the \u2018reverse sting\u2019 method of police investigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1413 (11th Cir. 1998). The Supreme Court, however, has recognized the possibility that \u201cthe conduct of law enforcement agents [may be] so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 431-32, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). \u201cOne example of such outrageous conduct is when the government instigates the criminal activity, provides the entire means for its execution, and runs the entire operation with only meager assistance from the defendant.\u201d <em>Puett, </em>735 F.2d at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">This Court has found the conduct of the government did not \u201capproach that demonstrable level of outrageousness the case law suggests would be necessary for reversal of the[ ] defendants\u2019 convictions\u201d where: (1) federal agents contacted individuals suspected of being involved in home invasions; (2) the defendant were then informed by these individuals that large amounts of drugs could be stolen in a home invasion; (3) the defendants voluntarily agreed to participate; (4) the defendants were involved without any investigation from the government; (5) they had contact with the government only after they had already agreed to participate; and (5) the availability of the defendants, their weapons, and vehicles was not the result of any governmental activity. <em>See Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d at 1413-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The district court did not err by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss the indictment. First, Alvarez was not initially contacted by a government agent to participate in the conspiracy. Instead, Gonzalez testified that, while he was acting as a confidential informant, he contacted codefendant Lamar to allegedly buy cocaine. After Gonzalez proposed a cocaine robbery to Lamar, Lamar told Gonzalez that he would contact other individuals who had experience in that area. Lamar then contacted Alvarez. Second, Alvarez voluntarily chose to participate in the plan. Gonzalez testified that Lamar told Alvarez about the planned robbery, and Lamar immediately informed Gonzalez that Alvarez had agreed to participate. Third, Alvarez had no contact with the government until he had already informed Lamar that he wished to participate. Fourth, Alvarez recruited another individual into the scheme. Finally, the government did not induce Alvarez into participating in the scheme, but only offered a vehicle after Alvarez had already agreed to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Accordingly, the evidence shows that the government did not instigate the criminal activity as it related to Alvarez, provide the entire means for the completion of the crime\u2014particularly in light of the fact that Alvarez himself acted as a recruiter\u2014or run the operation with only \u201cmeager assistance\u201d from Alvarez. <em>See Puett, </em>735 F.2d at 1335. Thus, these facts do not rise to the level of outrageous conduct required to warrant a reversal of Alvarez\u2019s conviction. <em>See Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d at 1413-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
