Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, the district court granted downward variances and imposed 235-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Pierce and Blount were resentenced approximately three months before the Supreme Court decided <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). They argue that, although the district court exercised some of its discretion to impose a downward variance sentence, it did not exercise its full discretion as announced in <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough. </em>Defendants rely on the comments of the court that it would be comfortable imposing a lower sentence, but that it was imposing the lowest sentence \u201cunder what is binding to me.\u201d They also briefly argue that, after <em>Kimbrough, </em>the district court was free to reject sentencing factors not based on empirical evidence or used in a manner inconsistent with the design of the sentencing guidelines. The Government argues that the complete record evidences that the district court was aware of its full discretion, by granting initial downward departures, and then downward variances on resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that certain circuit courts had effectively created \u201can impermissible presumption of unreasonableness for sentences outside the Guidelines range\u201d and improperly applied \u201ca heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 595-96. Further, while an appellate presumption of reasonableness applied to a within-Guidelines sentence is appropriate, the Supreme Court noted that a district court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. In addition, in <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court may impose a variance sentence on the basis that, in a given case, the Guidelines range fails to properly reflect the statutory factors. 128 S.Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">We agree with the Defendants that the district court may have understood itself to be barred from imposing a lower variance sentence based only on its determination that the Guidelines sentence was too severe. In light of <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Gaily </em>the district court\u2019s understanding of its authority and discretion may have been erroneous. As the Government correctly notes, the district court was aware that it had some discretion to grant a downward variance because it granted the variance. However, the record is not clear as to whether the court would have granted a further variance if it had the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Gall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Accordingly, we vacate Pierce and Blounts\u2019 sentences, and remand for resentencing. We express no opinion on the reasonableness of any particular sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
