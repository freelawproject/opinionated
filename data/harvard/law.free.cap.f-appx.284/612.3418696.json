Zaytseva argues that the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by sufficient findings of fact. More specifically, Zaytseva challenges the BIA\u2019s conclusion that it was \u201cnot persuaded ... that President Yushchenko has lost his power, or that the Prime Minister is in control.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We review both the denial of a motion to reopen a removal order and the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Motions to reconsider are filed before the immigration officer or court or the BIA, for review of claimed errors in the law or facts. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.5(a)(3), 1003.2(b), and 1003.23(b)(2). \u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(b)(1). Motions to reconsider are distinguishable from motions to reopen. <em>Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90-91 (2d Cir.2001). \u201cA motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board\u2019s previous decision an error was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90 (internal quotation omitted). When the BIA reconsiders one of its prior decisions, \u201cit takes itself back in time and looks at the case as though a decision had never been entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if it grants the motion, it reevaluates its prior decision on the factual record as it existed at the time the original decision was rendered. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, a motion to reopen asserts that the prior proceedings should be reopened for the introduction of new evidence so a new decision may be rendered on the basis of the new evidence. <em>Id.; </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">Zaytseva\u2019s motion to reconsider concerned new evidence in support of reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s prior decision, but did not specify errors of law or fact relating to that decision. Because Zaytseva\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to specify errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s August 29, 2007, decision, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion on these grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We likewise are unpersuaded that the BIA erred by denying Zaytseva\u2019s motion to reopen. A motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(A), (B); <em>Verano-Velasco v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 1372, 1376 (11th Cir.2006). Motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Motions to reopen may be granted if there is new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) and 1003.23(b)(3); <em>see also Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). To make such a showing, the alien \u201cbears a \u2018heavy burden,\u2019 and must \u2018present evidence of such a nature that the [BIA] is satisfied that if proceedings before the [IJ] were reopened, with all attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 813. Evidence is \u201cnew\u201d if it \u201cwas unavailable or could not have been presented at [the applicant\u2019s] former hearing\u201d before an IJ. <em>Verano-Velasco, </em>456 F.3d at 1377 (rejecting the government\u2019s contention that evidence which became available prior to the BIA\u2019s decision was not \u201cnew\u201d). In addition, evidence which \u201cbears upon the credibility of a key witness, whose testimony ... substantially bolstered the IJ\u2019s ... ruling,\u201d is considered \u201cmaterial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Although the articles submitted by Zaytseva constitute \u201cnew\u201d evidence detailing continued political turmoil in the Ukraine and outlining the continued battle for power between President Viktor Yushchenko (supported by the Young Rukh) and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych (supported by former President Kuchma), the articles do not suggest that President Yushchenko has lost his power, or mention anything about the Young Rukh. On this record, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the proffered evidence failed to demonstrate a prima <em>facie </em>case for reopening Zaytseva\u2019s removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">. Zaytseva further argues error stemming from the BIA\u2019s April 24, 2007 order. Although Zaytseva filed a timely motion to reconsider the BIA's dismissal of her appeal on May 23, 2007, the filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review in this Court. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). Because Zaytseva did not file her petition for review until September 26, 2007, more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s initial order dated April 24, 2007, we lack jurisdiction to review the April 24, 2007, order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-15\">. Zaytseva also has failed to satisfy the \"compelling reasons\u201d standard for humanitarian asylum relief. <em>Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A), (B) (providing that IJ may grant an applicant humanitarian asylum on a discretionary basis if the applicant has demonstrated \"compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution,\u201d or \"a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country,\u201d); <em>In re N-M-A, </em>22 I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 312, 326 (BIA 1998) (interpreting humanitarian asylum as requiring an applicant first to show \"severe harm\u201d and \"long-lasting effects\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
