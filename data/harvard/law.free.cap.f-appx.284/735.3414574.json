She alleges that because the title insurance premium was only $284.50 under Alabama law, the remaining $270.50 \u201csurcharge\u201d constituted a fee for something \u201cother than services actually performed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) of RESPA. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">Moody\u2019s claim that the $555 title insurance premium exceeded the maximum amount authorized by Alabama law is not actionable under RESPA. We have recently joined the Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh and Eight Circuits in holding that \u00a7 8(b) of RESPA \u201cdoes not govern excessive fees because it is not a price control provision.\u201d <em>Friedman v. Market Street Mortgage Corp. (Friedman II), </em>520 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir.2008). We have rejected the notion that courts should break single fees into various \u201ccomponents\u201d for evaluation, as Moody would have us do here with the allegedly \u201cearned\u201d versus \u201cunearned\u201d portions of the fee. <em>Id. </em>at 1297. Moreover, we have held that \u201csubsection 8(b) requires a plaintiff to allege that no services were rendered in exchange for a settlement fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298 (emphasis added). Moody merely claims that she was charged an inflated fee for a service that was indisputably provided by Anchor through Commonwealth: the issuance of the title insurance policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Moody\u2019s claim is barred by our prior precedent, and the district court rightly found that such a claim is beyond the purview of RESPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a \"district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Castro v. Sec\u2019y of Homeland Security, </em>472 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-21\">. Moody alleges that Anchor and Commonwealth split the fee, though she does not allege that the fee was split with the lender. Moody concedes, however, that she was \u201ccharged $555.00 for the \u2018Lender's Policy\u2019 ... issued by Anchor thru (sic) Commonwealth.\u201d Thus, Moody has not alleged that Anchor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Commonwealth \"performed no services that would justify its retention of a portion of the fee.\u201d <em>Sosa v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., </em>348 F.3d 979 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
