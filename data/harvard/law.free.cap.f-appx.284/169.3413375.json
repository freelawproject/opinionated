Ivory, Jr., appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for wire fraud and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1343. He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 based on its finding that he obstructed justice. He argues that his conduct did not rise to the level of obstruction of justice because during the recorded conversation between him and Deaderill Harris, a woman he had recruited to sell counterfeit transportation vouchers, he merely repeated a cover story that Harris already knew. He also argues that the facts do not indicate that he knew that there was an investigation actively underway or that his actions actually impeded the investigation. Because Ivoi\u2019y raised this issue in the district court, the district court\u2019s factual findings, i.e., its findings as to what acts were performed, are reviewed for clear error, and the district court\u2019s ruling that its factual findings permit an enhancement for obstruction of justice is a question of law, which this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>470 F.3d 1091, 1093-94 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Ivoi\u2019y has not shown that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1 based on its finding that he obstructed justice. The evidence in the presentence report, the recorded telephone conversation, and the testimony at the sentencing hearing show that Ivory knew Hams was going to be interviewed by Secret Service agents; he told Harris to lie to agents by using a cover story concerning the counterfeit transportation vouchers; he told Harris not to identify him if she was presented with a photograph by agents; and he told Harris to throw away any remaining vouchers that she had. Ivory also stated that a codefendant, Ken Kirby, had told Secret Service agents the same cover story. This evidence indicates that Ivory knew that there was an ongoing investigation as he was aware that both Harris and Kirby had been or were going to be interview by Secret Service agents concerning the vouchers. The district court\u2019s factual findings regarding Ivory\u2019s conduct are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Further, the evidence in the instant case supports the district court\u2019s determination that Ivory\u2019s conduct constituted obstruction of justice. <em>See Brown, </em>470 F.3d at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
