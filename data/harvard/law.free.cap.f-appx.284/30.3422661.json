On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal, but raising the following issue: whether Bennett waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement. Despite notice, Bennett did not file a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-18\">The record reveals Bennett knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal the district court\u2019s determination of whether he was classified as an armed career criminal. <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). Moreover, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s fifteen-year sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-21\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
