BautistaGarcia argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on Bautista-Garcia\u2019s prior Texas conviction for sexual assault of a minor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>indecency with a child. This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the sentencing guidelines; factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>522 F.3d 607, 611 (5th Cir.2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Section 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 16-level increase in the defendant\u2019s base offense level if the defendant was previously deported after a conviction for a crime of violence (COV). \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). For purposes of that section, COV is defined in the application notes and specifically includes \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, application note 1 (B)(iii). Section 2L1.2 alternatively provides for an eight-level increase in the defendant\u2019s base level if the defendant was deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The application notes incorporate by reference the definition for aggravated felony set forth in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which section also specifically includes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d within that definition. \u00a7 1101(a)(43); \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note 3(A). Section 2L1.2 expressly provides that the district court should \u201capply the greatest\u201d of any applicable specific offense characteristics. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). In addition, the Guidelines\u2019s general application principles require the district court to apply the guideline provision that results in the highest sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, Application Note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Bautista-Garcia does not contend that his prior Texas convictions for sexual assault of a minor and indecency with a child not meet the definitions for both a crime of violence and an aggravated felony as those terms are defined in the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2. Instead, Bautista-Garcia asserts that the definitions for COV and aggravated felony provided in the applications notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 conflict with the definition for aggravated felony provided in \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Bautista-Garcia argues that, as a result of this conflict, the rule of lenity applies, requiring that the more lenient enhancement be applied to his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The rule of lenity applies only when, \u201cafter consulting traditional canons of statutory construction,\u201d the court is left -with a truly ambiguous statute. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001). Although this court has considered application of the rule of lenity to Guidelines provisions, the rule is applicable only where the meaning of the provision is not plain. <em>Id. </em>at 312-13. Accordingly, the rule of lenity is inapplicable in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Under the plain language of the \u00a7 2L1.2, if a prior conviction falls in two categories of enhancements, the greater enhancement applies. Therefore, while Bautista-Garcia\u2019s prior conviction for sexual assault with a minor may be an aggravated felony that qualifies for an eight-level enhancement, it is also a crime of violence that qualifies for a 16-level enhancement. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 320 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604-08 (5th Cir.2000). As a result, because \u00a7 2L1.2 advises the district court to apply the greater of the applicable enhancements, the district court did not err in applying the 16-level COV enhancement to Bautista-Garcia\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b167-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
