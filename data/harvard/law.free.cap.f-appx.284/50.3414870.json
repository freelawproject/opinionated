We conclude that Williams is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-20\">The record reveals that the chief judge is not assigned to Williams\u2019 case and that the assigned judge has already ruled on Williams\u2019 objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s October 31, 2007, order. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus. Williams\u2019 motions for expansion of the record and for a permanent stay of execution of his state court sentences and to expedite consideration of the motion for stay are denied. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>pense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
