Kessee argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by arguing that he was responsible for nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>kilograms of cocaine rather than the 133 grams of cocaine he admitted to possessing in the factual stipulation. He also contends that his sentence was imposed in violation of Fed.R.CrimP. 11, Fed.R.Evid. 410, and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 because the district court relied on evidence provided by Kessee as a part of debriefing made pursuant to his original plea agreement. Kessee asserts that he was granted use immunity from those statements. Kessee also asserts that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because his sentence was based on facts to which he did not admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Because the Government\u2019s conduct was consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the plea agreement, the agreement was not breached. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>408 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.2005). The plea agreement did not limit consideration of relevant conduct for the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Kessee\u2019s statements to Agent Scott were made after he initially pleaded guilty. Therefore, Kessee did not have an expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of this conversation. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>582 F.2d 1356, 1365-66 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc). Fed.R.CrimP. 11(f) and Fed.R.Evid. 410 are inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The district court did not violate U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 by using self-incriminating statements made by Kessee to determine his sentence. Neither plea agreement contained a provision requiring the cooperation in describing the illegal activities of others. Therefore, \u00a7 IB 1.8 is inapplicable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.8, comment, (n. 6). Regardless, the district court\u2019s consideration of Kessee\u2019s statements does not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Kessee\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of his sentence is also without merit. Kessee was sentenced in 2006, after the issuance of <em>Booker. </em>Thus, the district court\u2019s determination, under an advisory guidelines scheme, regarding relevant conduct and the applicability of sentence enhancements, does not violate Kessee\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
