Gregg, Richmond Hill, GA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b759-15\">Amy Lee Copeland, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Savannah, GA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b759-17\">Before ANDERSON, DUBINA and HULL, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b759-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b759-19\">Appellant Brentis Hendrix appeals his 144-month sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute crack and powder cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. On appeal, he first argues that the court erred by failing to depart downward under the Guidelines on the ground that his criminal history was substantially overrepresented. Second, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable because: application of the career offender enhancement was \u201carbitrary\u201d; the court did not adequately consider his substantial-assistance efforts; the court did not adequately consider his family support, educational background, and drug addiction; the court imposed a sentence greater than necessary by making his sentence run consecutively to a sentence imposed in connection with the revocation of his parole; and the court gave the Guidelines too much weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-20\">I. <em>Downward Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-21\">We lack \u201cjurisdiction to review a sentencing judge\u2019s denial of a downward departure unless it was made based upon belief that he or she did not possess the discretionary authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>United States v. Liss, </em>265 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir.2001); <em>accord United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1342 (11th Cir.1997) (refusing to review the denial of a downward departure where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>was nothing to indicate that the court misapprehended the scope of its authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider Hendrix\u2019s argument that the court erred by failing to depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) because there is nothing in the record to indicate that the court believed that it lacked the authority to depart. In addition, Hendrix does not sufficiently argue on appeal that the court erred by failing to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, and, therefore, has abandoned the issue. <em>See United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2446, 167 L.Ed.2d 1132 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">II. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-,-,-,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 594, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[Ajfter giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 596. Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">It is sufficient for the district court to acknowledge that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it need not explicitly discuss each of them. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). After considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-17\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in this case because it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, conducted an individualized analysis of Hendrix\u2019s personal history and characteristics, and did not give the Guidelines too much weight. Hendrix has provided no authority to support his arguments that his sentence was unreasonable on the grounds that the career offender guideline was \u201carbitrary,\u201d the court did not adequately consider his substantial-assistance efforts, and the court did not adequately consider his pending state parole revocation. Accordingly, we affirm Hendrix\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
