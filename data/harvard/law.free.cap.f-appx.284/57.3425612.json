After unsuccessfully seeking post-conviction relief in state court, Strickland filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. district court. The district court denied relief, finding several of Strickland\u2019s claims to be procedurally defaulted and denying several others on the merits. We granted a certificate of appealability with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>to the district court\u2019s determinations (1) that Strickland was not entitled to relief on the merits of a claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, 373 </em>U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and (2) that Strickland had defaulted a portion of his claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his case. Because we conclude that Strickland has not established the materiality necessary for his <em>Brady </em>claim nor the prejudice necessary for his ineffective assistance claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Strickland was convicted by a North Carolina jury for the first-degree murder of Henry Brown. In affirming the conviction on direct appeal, the state supreme court described the circumstances of the murder as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">The State\u2019s evidence tended to show <em>inter alia </em>that on 1 January 1995, the victim, Henry Brown, went with his wife, Gail Brown, and her six-year-old child to the home of [Strickland], who lived with Sherri Jenkins and their two-year-old son in Marshville, North Carolina. Mrs. Brown had formerly worked with both Ms. Jenkins and [Strickland] at Cuddy Foods in Marshville and had been \u201cgood friends\u201d with Ms. Jenkins for about six years. Ms. Jenkins had been dating [Strickland] for thirteen years, had mothered his two-year-old son, and had been cohabiting with [Strickland] for about six months at the time of the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">The Browns arrived at the residence of [Strickland] and Ms. Jenkins at approximately 8:00 p.m. Mr. Brown had been drinking but was not drunk. Mr. Brown and [Strickland] went into the kitchen, while Mrs. Brown and Ms. Jenkins stayed in the living room. The children were sent into the bedroom to play, and the adults began drinking alcoholic beverages. Ms. Jenkins testified at trial that they shared a marijuana joint and that all four adults drank from a half-gallon bottle of gin. The four adults continued drinking and talking for several hours. During this time, a shotgun owned by [Strickland] was passed around. Everyone was talking about shooting it and joking about shooting each other, but there were no serious threats. There were two shells in the gun and no other shells in the house. Ms. Jenkins took the gun outside and fired it once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">At approximately 1:30 a.m., Mrs. Brown and Ms. Jenkins were in the kitchen preparing food for everyone to eat. The men were in the living room. Mrs. Brown testified that, while in the kitchen, she looked into the living room, where she saw her husband sitting on an ottoman with his head in his hands. [Strickland] was standing to the back and side of Mr. Brown with the gun in his hand pointed at Mr. Brown. Mrs. Brown saw [Strickland]\u2019s lips move but could not hear what he said. She then heard the gun being fired, smelled burning flesh, and saw her husband fall over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">Ms. Jenkins testified that she witnessed the victim sitting on the ottoman with [Strickland] standing behind him. The victim was mumbling something that she could not hear. She stepped outside to feed the cats, during which time she heard the gun go off. She came back inside and saw the victim fall over. According to Ms. Jenkins, the victim\u2019s behavior that evening was obnoxious and loud. He was cursing at intervals and drinking alcohol throughout the night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">Immediately following the shooting, [Strickland] left in his truck. He drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>to the house of his ex-wife, Ms. Betty Sanders, in Marshville. [Strickland] asked Ms. Sanders to drive him in his truck to his uncle\u2019s house in Rocking-ham. At approximately 2:45 a.m., Ms. Sanders and [Strickland] were stopped in Rockingham by Officer Poston and Officer Grant of the Rockingham Police Department, which had been notified to be on the lookout for [Strickland]. Officer Grant transported [Strickland] to the Rockingham Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">At the Police Department, after being advised of his constitutional rights, [Strickland] spoke to Special Agent Tony Underwood of the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and Detective Bill Tucker of the Union County Sheriffs Department. [Strickland] told them that he shot Henry Brown because \u201che pissed me off\u2019 and because \u201che called me a punk Indian son-of-a-bitch.\u201d [Strickland] said that no one else had anything to do with the shooting. He said that he \u201cmeant to kill\u201d the victim. He denied that alcohol had caused him to commit the murder. [Strickland] said that he had not planned to kill the victim. He did however say that he had to cock the gun in order to get it to shoot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Detective Easley of the Union County Sheriffs Department examined the crime scene during the early morning hours of 2 January 1995. Detective Easley found the body of Henry Brown lying on the living room floor on its left side. Blood was coming from the victim\u2019s nose and mouth and a hole in the back shoulder area. There was no weapon on or around the victim\u2019s body. In the gun cabinet, Detective Easley found one Ithaca twelve-gauge pump shotgun which contained one spent Winchester \u201cdouble aught\u201d buckshot casing in the chamber. He also found one spent \u201cdouble aught\u201d buck-shot shell outside on the ground about eleven inches from the front doorstep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">Michael Gavin of the forensic firearms and tool marks unit of the SBI laboratory tested the shotgun and found that the gun functioned properly. Gerald Long, owner of Long\u2019s Sporting Goods and Pawn Shop, testified that he had experience in selling, firing, and repairing Ithaca twelve-gauge pump shotguns. He testified that, in his opinion, the Ithaca shotgun, in the hands of someone not experienced with it, would go off faster than any other shotgun on the market and is susceptible to accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABh\"><em>State v. Strickland, </em>346 N.C. 443, 488 S.E.2d 194, 198-99 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">A separate capital sentencing proceeding followed Strickland\u2019s conviction. At sentencing a single statutory aggravating factor was submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration: that Strickland \u201chad been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(3). The prosecution supported this factor by presenting evidence of two previous felony convictions. First, Strickland pled guilty in 1985 to one count of assault with a deadly weapon based on an altercation in which he sliced a large knife wound across the back of another man (Todd Kendell). Second, Strickland was indicted for murder based on the 1993 shooting death of Derrick Skipper. A jury convicted Strickland of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Strickland offered three witnesses in mitigation. First, Dr. Mark Worthen, a psychologist, testified about an interview he conducted with Strickland. In that interview Strickland said that he was drunk at the time he shot Brown, that he intended to scare. Brown rather than kill him, and that the gun went off by accident. Strickland also told Dr. Worthen that he was a proud Indian, that he was not crazy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>and that he did not want anyone to beg for his life. Second, Grant Davis testified that he was with Strickland at the time of the incident involving Todd Kendell. Though Davis apparently did not see how Kendell was cut, his testimony suggested that Ken-dell initiated the confrontation with Strickland by, among other things, throwing a piece of cement through the windshield of Strickland\u2019s truck. Finally, Strickland called Officer James Clemmons to testify about his investigation into the shooting of Derrick Skipper. Clemmons testified that, according to witnesses, Skipper had a gun in his possession during the incident. Strickland\u2019s counsel also attempted to elicit testimony suggesting that Skipper initiated the confrontation, but the court cut off this line of questioning after the prosecution objected on the ground that it required the officer to recount inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Two nonstatutory mitigating factors were submitted to the jury: (1) that Strickland was the father of three children, and (2) that he had great pride in his Native American heritage. The statutory catch-all mitigator for \u201c[a] ny other circumstance arising from the evidence which the jury deems to have mitigating value\u201d was also submitted. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-2000(f)(9). The sentencing jury found the state\u2019s requested aggravating circumstance but did not find any circumstances in mitigation. The jury recommended a sentence of death, which the trial judge imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Strickland thereafter filed a motion for appropriate relief (MAR) in state court. In his MAR petition Strickland argued, as relevant here, (1) that the prosecution violated its duties under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to disclose pretrial statements made by witness Gail Brown, and (2) that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase of his case. The MAR court rejected all of Strickland\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Strickland then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. district court. The district court ultimately denied all the claims for relief in the petition. Strickland appealed, and we granted a certificate of appealability with respect to his <em>Brady </em>claim and the district court\u2019s ruling that Strickland had defaulted a portion of his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel by not fairly presenting it to the MAR court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">We first consider Strickland\u2019s contention that the prosecution violated its disclosure obligations under <em>Brady v. Maryland. </em>Three elements are necessary for a successful <em>Brady </em>claim: (1) the \u201cevidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching\u201d; (2) the \u201cevidence must have been suppressed by the State\u201d; and (3) the evidence must be \u201cmaterial,\u201d that is, there must be \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 280-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">Strickland focuses his <em>Brady </em>claim on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose a pretrial statement that the victim\u2019s wife, Gail Brown, made to Officer Ted Keziah. At trial Mrs. Brown testified that her husband (the victim) and Strickland had been drinking during the evening of the murder but had not been fighting or arguing. Her testimony also indicated that she did not overhear what conversation (if any) the two men had immediately prior to the murder. Strickland\u2019s counsel requested that the prosecution disclose any pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>statements made by Mrs. Brown, but the prosecution claimed that there were none. During post-conviction proceedings, however, the state disclosed evidence of several such pretrial statements, including one made to Keziah. According to Keziah\u2019s report, Mrs. Brown told him (Keziah) shortly after the murder that Strickland and the victim had been \u201crunning their mouths at one another\u201d prior to the shooting. J.A. 1345. In addition to Keziah\u2019s report, Strickland\u2019s claim relies on an affidavit from Mrs. Brown, which appears to clarify the meaning of the statement she gave to Keziah. In the affidavit Brown said that about ten minutes before the shooting she heard the two men exchange racial slurs, including \u201cIndian son-of-a-bitch\u201d and \u201cnigger.\u201d She also said that she \u201cdid not hear everything the two [men] said just before the shooting.\u201d J.A. 1490. Because the information contained in the affidavit was not considered by the state MAR court, we must make an independent assessment of the merits of Strickland\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>See Monroe v. Angelone, </em>323 F.3d 286, 298-99 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We agree with the district court that Strickland\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim lacks merit. Even though Mrs. Brown\u2019s statement to Keziah (as supplemented by her affidavit) contradicts the testimony she gave at trial, Strickland is unable to satisfy the third <em>Brady </em>element because he has not established \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936. While Mrs. Brown testified at trial that she did not hear racial slurs, her testimony also indicated that she did not overhear everything that transpired in the moments before the shooting. As the district court recognized, Mrs. Brown\u2019s affidavit is consistent with her trial testimony in that she expressly says in the affidavit that she did not hear the conversation between the men immediately prior to shooting. Inasmuch as Mrs. Brown did not claim at trial to have overheard the entirety of the men\u2019s conversation, the jury had little reason to disbelieve the explanation that Strickland gave to the police shortly after the murder: that he shot the victim in response to the victim calling him a \u201cpunk Indian son-of-a-biteh.\u201d Because the jury knew about this racial slur from Strickland\u2019s confession, it appears quite unlikely that the disclosure of Brown\u2019s statement would have altered the jury\u2019s decision to convict Strickland of first-degree murder. For these reasons, we agree with the district court that Strickland is not entitled to relief on his <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The second issue before us relates to Strickland\u2019s claim that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. Strickland has supported this claim by arguing that his counsel should have introduced additional evidence in mitigation, including evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the Skipper shooting. Specifically, Strickland argues that counsel should have elicited testimony from Doris Perkins Lee, an eyewitness to the shooting, who would have testified that Skipper fired an initial shot at Strickland, hitting him in the thigh. The district court denied several aspects of Strickland\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on the merits, but it held that the portion of his claim relating to his counsel\u2019s failure to present Lee\u2019s testimony was procedurally defaulted because Strickland had not adequately raised it in his MAR petition. We granted a certificate of appealability with respect to \u201cthe district court\u2019s ruling that [Strickland]\u2019s ineffective assistance claim regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>counsel\u2019s failure to present the testimony of Doris Perkins Lee was procedurally defaulted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Upon full review of the issue, we conclude that Strickland is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance claim even assuming that his argument regarding Lee\u2019s testimony was properly presented to the state MAR court. Because the record makes clear that Strickland\u2019s ineffective assistance claim lacks merit, we need not resolve the procedural default issue. <em>Eaton v. Angelone, </em>189 F.3d 990, 994 n. 1 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">To succeed on a claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, Strickland must establish two elements. First, he must show that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Second, he must establish prejudice by showing \u201ca reasonable probability ... that, but for the deficient performance, he would not have been sentenced to death.\u201d <em>Buckner v. Polk, </em>453 F.3d 195, 201 (4th Cir.2006). When a petitioner alleges, as Strickland does here, that his counsel should have put forth additional evidence in mitigation, we assess prejudice by \u201creweigh[ing] the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 534, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). Because the state MAR court did not address the merits of Strickland\u2019s ineffective assistance claim with respect to his counsel\u2019s failure to elicit testimony from Doris Perkins Lee, our review is <em>de novo. See Weeks v. Angelone, </em>176 F.3d 249, 258 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cWhen a petitioner has properly presented a claim to the state court but the state court has not adjudicated the claim on the merits, however, our review of questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact is de novo.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Strickland cannot satisfy the prejudice element, even if his counsel was deficient in failing to present testimony from Doris Lee. After reweighing the totality of the mitigating evidence (including Lee\u2019s testimony) against the aggravating evidence, we cannot conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have returned a sentence other than death. In our view, the addition of Lee\u2019s testimony would not have significantly altered the balance of mitigating and aggravating evidence that was presented at sentencing. For instance, while the sentencing jury did not have all the details of the Skipper incident, it did know that Strickland had been convicted only of voluntary manslaughter rather than a more serious charge such as first-degree murder. Indeed, despite hearing testimony from Doris Lee, the earlier jury at the Skipper trial \u201crejected any theory of self-defense\u201d and found Strickland guilty of voluntary manslaughter. <em>State v. Strickland, </em>488 S.E.2d at 205. Introducing Lee\u2019s testimony before the sentencing jury in Strickland\u2019s capital case would likely have prompted the state to introduce rebuttal evidence from the Skipper trial, which \u201ctended to show that [Strickland] ... shot Mr. Skipper several times, including filing the gun while standing directly over Mr. Skipper after he had fallen in the street.\u201d <em>State v. Strickland, </em>488 S.E.2d at 205. We agree with the district court, which noted when analyzing one of Strickland\u2019s related claims, that \u201cevidence that [Skipper,] the victim in the 1993 shooting[,] may have shot at and even wounded [Strickland] would not have mitigated\u201d these more damaging details of Strickland\u2019s actions during the Skipper shooting. J.A. 1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Moreover, the aggravating evidence against Strickland extended beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Skipper incident to his involvement in the wounding of Todd Kendell. Additional evidence regarding the circumstances of the Skipper shooting would not have offset the aggravating effect of the Kendell incident. As the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">[S]uch evidence [regarding the circumstances of the Skipper shooting] would have done nothing to mitigate the damaging evidence that the State introduced to prove [Strickland\u2019s] other previous felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence\u2014the stabbing of Todd Kendall [sic]. The State\u2019s evidence showed that Kendall was unarmed and that [Strickland] attempted to slash Kendall across the stomach with a knife. When Kendall turned and attempted to run, [Strickland] slashed him down the back, opening him from shoulder to belt. Kendall\u2019s wife testified that when she saw the wound she was certain her husband was dead and that it took over 800 stitches to repair his back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">JA. 1406-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In sum, we cannot conclude that a reasonable probability exists that the sentencing jury would have returned a different sentence if Lee\u2019s testimony had been presented. Therefore, Strickland\u2019s claim for relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
