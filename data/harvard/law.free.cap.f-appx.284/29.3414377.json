We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">We have reviewed the administrative record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s affirmance thereof, and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s ruling that Taboh failed to establish a nexus between the alleged persecution and a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007) (stating that burden of proof is on alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Such a causal nexus is required to support the grant of asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000); <em>Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">Moreover, as Taboh cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (West 2005) ].\u201d). In addition, we uphold the finding that Taboh failed to establish that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
