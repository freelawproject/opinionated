We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). The INA defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2008). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2008); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). A determination regarding eligibility for asylum is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Sissoko failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on one of the statutorily enumerated grounds. The record does not compel a different result. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s denial of his applications for relief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\"> We note Sissoko failed in his brief to this court to challenge the Board\u2019s order denying withholding from removal and withholding under the CAT. By failing to raise these issues in his brief, Sissoko abandoned these issues and waived review. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (noting that issues not briefed or argued are deemed abandoned). We further note Sissoko does not challenge the Board's finding that he did not challenge on appeal the immigration judge's decision to deny relief under the CAT. This court has noted that \"an alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
