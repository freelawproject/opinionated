Garcia asserts the district court did not provide a sufficiently compelling justification for its imposition of an upward variance of his sentence, from an advisory Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months to a sentence of 60 months. Thus, he argues, the sentence does not meet the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After review, we affirm Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-25\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court has clarified the reasonableness standard means review of sentences for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-28\">The district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has explained a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>court improperly calculates the Guidelines imprisonment range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Once we conclude the district court made no procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Such review entails determining whether the sentence is supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 600. Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d there is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">If a district court decides a sentence outside that range is appropriate, it must \u201cconsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, the district court must \u201cinclud[e] an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a sentence is substantively reasonable, we must consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is outside the Guidelines range, we may consider the deviation, \u201cbut must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the district court does not have unfettered discretion in sentencing. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">There is no requirement the district court state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. A district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence, <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191; however, such a sentence is not necessarily unreasonable, <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600 (holding a district court did not commit reversible error simply because it \u201cattached great weight\u201d to one factor). Indeed, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The district court\u2019s upward variance was reasonable. The court committed no significant procedural error. The court stated it had considered the advisory Guidelines and the statutory factors. The court allowed Garcia to present arguments as to what he believed the appropriate sentence should be, and considered Garcia\u2019s arguments for a sentence within the Guidelines on the basis of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court, relying on the unobjected-to facts from the PSI, explained why it had determined an above-Guidelines sentence was appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On the day of sentencing there were 7 cases involving alien smuggling, of a total of 11 defendants, before the court. The district court noted the need to promote respect for the law and insure adequate deterrence for others who might contemplate similar criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B). The court further observed the need to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the background of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Contrary to Garcia\u2019s claim to the contrary, these explanations are sufficient to allow meaningful appellate review. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a 60-month sentence that was well below the statutory maximum. The statutory maximum penalty for Counts 1 and 12 was 20 and 10 years\u2019 imprisonment respectively. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(iii), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 192. Garcia\u2019s total sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment is far less than the statutory maximum he could have received for each of his offenses. This Court has found sentences significantly lower than the statutory maximum to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (relying on fact that 42-month sentence was far below the statutory maximum as a sign of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Garcia has not established his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Much of Garcia\u2019s appellate argument focuses on the reasonableness of his sentence in light of the district court\u2019s focus on the prevalence of alien smuggling offenses on the calendar the day of his sentencing. Garcia asserts the district court varied from the Guidelines range based on its own personal view of punishment. To support his claim, Garcia cites <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which states \u201cwhile the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\u2019s view that the Guidelines range fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>is distinguishable on its facts from Garcia. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the district court sentenced below the sentencing Guidelines range based on explicit disagreement with the sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 565. Here, the district court did not explicitly disagree with the Guidelines. The district court\u2019s focus was on respect for the law and deterrence, both factors under \u00a7 3553(a). The Supreme Court recognized that some departures from sentencing uniformity were a necessary cost of applying \u00a7 3553(a) considerations. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 766-67, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (reasonableness review may not lead to uniformity Congress intended). While the district court did not expressly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it was not required to do so. <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>1329. The district court did not clearly err by emphasizing two factors, respect for the law and deterrence, because \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. Although Garcia\u2019s sentence amounted to an upward variance, the district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, articulated its reasons in open court, considered Garcia\u2019s arguments, and had a reasoned basis for its decision. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Finally, Garcia implies the district court\u2019s decision to impose an upward variance gives rise to the inference its determination was influenced by its personal views regarding illegal immigration. There is nothing in the record to support Garcia\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range. Because the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence imposed by the district court, the sentence is not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Further, the sentence is far below the statutory maximum for each of the crimes of conviction. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Garcia to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, we affirm Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
