After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Grant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">I. District Court\u2019s August 24, 2007 Summary Judgment Order</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Following the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court entered final judgment for the Board on August 24, 2007. On September 11, 2007, Grant filed a motion for reconsideration. On September 21, 2007, the district court denied Grant\u2019s motion for reconsideration as untimely because it was not filed within ten days after entry of judgment as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). On October 5, 2007, Grant filed a notice of appeal \u201cfrom the Order entered September 21, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Grant\u2019s brief on appeal argues the merits of his case, i.e., that the district court erred in its August 24, 2007 grant of summary judgment. However, Grant\u2019s October 5, 2007 notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after the district court\u2019s order entering final judgment for the Board on August 24, 2007. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (stating that notice of appeals in civil cases must be filed within thirty days of final judgment). Moreover, Grant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was filed more then ten days after the August 24, 2007 order and thus did not toll the time to appeal the August 24, 2007 order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (\u201cA motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment.\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Crosby, </em>375 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c \u2018Untimely motions under Rule[ ] 59 ... will not toll the time for filing an appeal.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.1996))).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And in any event, Grant did not designate the August 24, 2007 order as the order that he was appealing in his notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (\u201cThe notice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the August 24, 2007 summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">II. District Court\u2019s September 21, 2007 Denial of Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">Grant\u2019s notice of appeal is timely only as to the district court\u2019s September 21, 2007 order denying as untimely the motion for reconsideration. However, on appeal, Grant does not contend that the district court erred in denying his motion for reconsideration as he argues only the merits of the August 24, 2007 order granting summary judgment to the defendant. Thus, Grant has waived any argument that the district court erred in denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Flanigan\u2019s Enters. v. Fulton County, </em>242 F.3d 976, 987 n. 16 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that a party waives an argument if the party \u201cfail[s] to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support\u201d of the argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because Grant\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely as to the district court\u2019s August 24, 2007 order granting summary judgment, and because Grant has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s September 21, 2007 order denying his motion for reconsideration as untimely (which is the only order as to which his notice of appeal is timely), we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-10\">. Grant's motion for reconsideration does not cite a particular rule, but even if we construe it, in his favor, as a Rule 59 motion, it was not filed within the requisite ten days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-21\">. Grant, for the first time on appeal, argues that this Court should grant him relief from judgment because he has obtained new evidence in the case. Grant filed no motion in the district court and did not present the evidence to the district court. Grant\u2019s claim regarding new evidence is irrelevant to the question of whether the district court properly denied his motion for reconsideration as untimely, and further, we decline to consider arguments or evidence presented for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
