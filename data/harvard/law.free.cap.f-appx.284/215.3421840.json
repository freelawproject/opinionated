The government has moved to dismiss the appeal since DeGreat\u2019s guilty plea included a waiver of his right to appeal. For the reasons that follow, we determine that DeGreat\u2019s appeal waiver is valid and that this appeal should therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-27\">DeGreat agreed to plead guilty to a drug conspiracy charge in exchange for the government\u2019s agreement not to charge him with a prior felony drug conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which would have triggered a 20-year mandatory minimum. In the plea agreement, DeGreat agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence unless the sentence imposed exceeded the statutory maximum, which was a life sentence. DeGreat eventually received a 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>year prison term. He then filed this appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">DeGreat contends that his waiver of his appellate rights is void. He argues that the <em>district court </em>breached the plea agreement when it gave him a higher sentenced based, in part, on the fact that the government had agreed not to pursue the \u00a7 851 charge. This consideration, DeGreat argues, denied him the benefit of his bargain. But even if he the district court did deny him the benefit of his bargain, the district court cannot \u201cbreach\u201d a plea agreement, as the agreement is solely an agreement between the government and DeGreat. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>184 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir.1999) (observing that the court had \u201crepeatedly indicated that \u2018a plea agreement is a contractual arrangement between two parties, the defendant and the government\u2019 \u201d and the district court \u201c \u2018is not a party to the contract.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Standiford, </em>148 F.3d 864, 868 (7th Cir.1998))). DeGreat bargained for certain things from the government and he knew that the ultimate sentencing decision would be left up to the district court. The government fulfilled its end of the bargain. And the exception to the appellate waiver\u2014that DeGreat be sentenced under the statutory maximum\u2014 is not met since DeGreat\u2019s ten year sentence is less than the statutory maximum of life in prison. The appeal waiver should therefore be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED and its alternative motion for a 30-day extension to file a responsive brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
