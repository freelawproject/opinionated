After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">In 2005, Jimenez was charged with illegally reentering the United States after previously having been deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Jimenez pled guilty to the illegal reentry charge in federal district court in Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September 2005, Jimenez was sentenced to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment and 2 years supervised release. Jimenez did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">Instead, in 2006, he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. Jimenez\u2019s motion to vacate argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the lawyer on the illegal reentry charge, Stephen Langs, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to properly investigate and discover evidence establishing that Jimenez is actually a United States citizen (and not a citizen of Mexico, as the government contended in the illegal reentry proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">More specifically, Jimenez, who was born in Mexico as the son of an American citizen (his father) and a Mexican citizen (his mother), argued that Langs advised him that after reviewing all relevant material and law, Jimenez had no legal recourse for challenging the illegal reentry charge against him. As such, Jimenez pled guilty to the illegal reentry charge upon Langs\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">Subsequent to his guilty plea, however, Jimenez himself discovered an affidavit in his Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) file from his father that stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Jimenez\u2019s mother and Jimenez\u2019s father \u201chad personal problems and eventually she <em>remarried </em>and so did I.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Jimenez argued that this affidavit, along with affidavits from other family members, constituted evidence that Jimenez\u2019s parents had been married under the common law of Texas at the time of Jimenez\u2019s birth, such that Jimenez was actually a <em>United States </em>citizen rather than a Mexican citizen at birth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>therefore could not have illegally reentered the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Jimenez, Langs\u2019s failure to investigate and make the argument that Jimenez was a United States citizen by virtue of his parents\u2019 Texas common law marriage amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The district court denied Jimenez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, finding that under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Jimenez failed to establish either deficient performance or prejudice. As to performance, the district court determined that Langs had undertaken \u201can extensive independent investigation into Mr. Jimenez\u2019s background to determine whether he had any defense(s) to the charge.\u201d The district court concluded that even if Langs had performed deficiently, Jimenez still could not establish prejudice because the relationship between his parents fell short of a Texas common law marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">This Court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASB\">Whether [Jimenez\u2019s] counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and advise him of a possible defense to the unlawful re-entry charge against him: that he might have been a United States citizen because his biological parents may have been married under Texas common law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">II. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>first prong, a defendant has the heavy burden of demonstrating that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064; <em>see also Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2008). There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was adequate, and to overcome the presumption, a defendant must show that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take. <em>Gordon, </em>518 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Jimenez has failed to show ineffective assistance. Jimenez contends that Langs rendered deficient performance by failing to examine the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), which (Jimenez further contends) should have led Langs to investigate whether Jimenez\u2019s parents were married under Texas common law at the time of Jimenez\u2019s birth in 1952.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the record in Jimenez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>illegal reentry case establishes that Langs actually undertook investigation into Jimenez\u2019s background <em>specifically to determine </em>whether Jimenez had any citizenship-based defenses to the reentry charge. Indeed, Langs\u2019s motion to compel discovery in Jimenez\u2019s illegal reentry case stated that \u201cthere were several means by which Mr. Jimenez could have obtained American citizenship,\u201d but Langs\u2019s investigation of those \u201cvehicles to citizenship\u201d had proven fruitless. Despite this, Langs\u2019s motion to compel sought Jimenez\u2019s mother\u2019s INS file in an effort to explore yet <em>another </em>possible way in which Jimenez might have obtained derivative American citizenship\u2014through his mother\u2019s naturalization.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, at Jimenez\u2019s sentencing, Langs advised the court that Jimenez was \u201clikely to be deported\u201d after serving his sentence on the reentry charge, adding that the impending deportation was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and that he had \u201cyelled at Mr. Jimenez about that,\u201d because Jimenez \u201chad a number of opportunities to get his citizenship here while in the United States, and <em>every lead that [Langs] tracked down through [Jimenez\u2019s] biological father, his adoptive stepfather ... through his mother and through his oum marriage,\u201d </em>showed that Jimenez never obtained citizenship. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Thus, the record in Jimenez\u2019s illegal reentry case establishes that Langs specifically explored the possibility of various citizenship-based defenses to the reentry charge. Moreover, although the record is silent as to whether Langs actually explored the specific Texas common law marriage defense raised by Jimenez in this \u00a7 2255 case, \u201c[a]n ambiguous or silent record is not sufficient to disprove the strong and continuing presumption\u201d of counsel\u2019s competence. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 &amp; n. 15 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc). Accordingly, Jimenez has failed to establish that Langs rendered constitutionally deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Alternatively, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Langs rendered constitutionally deficient performance, Jimenez has also failed to establish prejudice. To satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, Jimenez must show a reasonable probability that, but for Langs\u2019s alleged errors, Jimenez would not have pleaded guilty and \u201cwould have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (applying <em>Strickland </em>to a challenge to a guilty plea based on ineffective assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Here, Jimenez has failed to establish prejudice because he has failed to establish that his parents were in fact married under Texas common law at the time of his birth. Specifically, although Texas recognized common law marriage in 1952 (and still recognizes it today), to establish a common law marriage in Texas in 1952, a party had to prove three elements: (1) that the couple had an agreement to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>married; (2) that after the agreement, the couple lived together professedly as husband and wife; and (3) that the couple was recognized by the community as husband and wife. <em>See Hodge v. Hicks, </em>149 Tex. 390, 233 S.W.2d 557, 557 (1950) (following <em>Walton v. Walton, </em>228 S.W. 921, 922 (Tex. Comm\u2019n App.1921)); <em>Grigsby v. Reib, </em>105 Tex. 597, 153 S.W. 1124, 1125, 1130 (1913); <em>see also Ex parte Threet, </em>160 Tex. 482, 333 S.W.2d 361, 364 (1960) (citing <em>Grigsby).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In this case, the affidavits are at best ambiguous in terms of establishing that Jimenez\u2019s parents were married under Texas common law. While the affidavit from Jimenez\u2019s father does state that he and Jimenez\u2019s mother eventually both \u201cremarried\u201d after breaking up, the affidavit also states that Jimenez was \u201cborn out of wedlock.\u201d This suggests that Jimenez\u2019s father and mother did not hold themselves out to others as husband and wife at the time of Jimenez\u2019s birth. <em>See Threet, </em>333 S.W.2d at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Additionally, the affidavits reflect that after Jimenez\u2019s mother and father separated, Jimenez\u2019s mother married another man, Arthur Daly, who helped to raise Jimenez. Under Texas law, \u201cthe act of one of the parties to an alleged common-law marriage in celebrating a ceremonial marriage with another person without having first obtained a divorce, <em>tends to discredit the first relationship and to show that it was not valid.\u201d Claveria\u2019s Estate v. Claveria, </em>615 S.W.2d 164, 166 (Tex.1981) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Higgins v. Higgins, </em>246 S.W.2d 271 (Tex.Civ.App.1952); <em>Nye v. State, 77 </em>Tex.Crim. 389, 179 S.W. 100 (1915)); <em>see also Williams v. Williams, </em>336 S.W.2d 757, 759 (Tex.Civ. App.1960) (stating that if a man and a woman \u201chad in truth and in fact entered into a common law marriage as alleged ... said status or relationship of the parties could be dissolved only by death or by divorce\u201d). Here, it is undisputed that both of Jimenez\u2019s parents were alive when Jimenez\u2019s mother married Daly, and Jimenez points to no record evidence that his father and mother ever \u201cdivorce[d].\u201d Jimenez has not shown that his parents were married under Texas common law at the time of his birth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Jimenez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-19\">. There was no written plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">. For instance, an affidavit from one of Jimenez's aunts states that Jimenez's mother and father \"were going to get married and I was to be a[] flower girl,\" while another aunt\u2019s affidavit states that Jimenez\u2019s mother and father lived together \"as man and wife in the years 1953 through 1956 in El Paso, Texas.... They were planning on getting married eventually but their relationship fell apart and they separated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. Jimenez's brief makes certain arguments that are outside the scope of the COA. Our review in \u00a7 2255 cases is limited to the issues specified in the COA, and accordingly we do not address Jimenez\u2019s other arguments. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\">. When reviewing a district court's denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo. See Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). The ultimate question of whether a criminal defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law. <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1142 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-14\">. Specifically, the 1952 version of the INA provided, in pertinent part, that citizens of the United States at birth included persons who were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-15\">born outside the geographical limits of the United States ... [to] <em>parents </em>one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>such person, was physically present in the United States ... [for a certain period of time].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(7) (1952) (emphasis added). However, a person only qualified as a \u201cparent\" under the 1952 version of the INA when, <em>inter alia, </em>their child was \"a legitimate child\u201d or was \"legitimated under the law of the child\u2019s residence or domicile, or under the law of the father\u2019s residence or domicile.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (b)( 1)\u2014(2) (1952) (also qualifying a person as a \"parent\u201d when the child became their stepchild before the child reached the age of eighteen). Since it is undisputed that Jimenez was born out of technical wedlock, the question that he argues Langs should have raised is whether Jimenez was \"legitimated\" under Texas law by virtue of his parents' purported Texas common law marriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b697-12\">. The docket in Jimenez\u2019s criminal case reflects that Langs\u2019s motion to compel was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. Additionally, we note that at the time of Jimenez\u2019s birth, Texas law did \"not favor, but merely tolerate[d], common-law marriages.\u201d <em>Texas Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n v.
