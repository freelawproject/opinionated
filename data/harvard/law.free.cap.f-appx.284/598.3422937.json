Pedron raises four challenges to his convictions: (1) the government committed prosecutorial misconduct in its closing argument; (2) the district court abused its discretion in allowing a prior conviction to be used to impeach Pedron\u2019s testimony; (3) the district court abused its discretion in allowing law enforcement officers to testify as lay witnesses; and (4) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. As to his sentence, Pedron argues that: (1) the district court improperly applied the obstruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>tion-of-justice enhancement; and (2) his ultimate sentence was unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">We review a preserved claim of prosecutorial misconduct <em>de novo. United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir. 2006) , <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1305, 167 L.Ed.2d 117 (2007). We review preserved evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Masferrer, </em>514 F.3d 1158, 1162 (11th Cir.2008). When a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is erroneous, we will not reverse if the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Khanani, </em>502 F.3d 1281, 1292 (11th Cir.2007) . \u201cAn error is harmless unless there is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). We review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction <em>de novo, </em>examining the evidence in a light most favorable to the government and making all credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Garcia-Jaimes, </em>484 F.3d 1311, 1319 (11th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 11, 2007) (No. 06-11863). When a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice is imposed, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). Finally, we review the ultimate sentenced imposed by a district court for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">First, we find no merit to Pedron\u2019s contention that the government engaged in misconduct during its closing argument by making three \u201cmisstatements\u201d: (1) vouching for its position by stating \u201c[o]f course [Pedron] knowingly possessed those pills\u201d; (2) \u201cbelittling]\u201d defense counsel and strategy by comparing a portion of counsel\u2019s defense to a \u201cgrade school playground tactic\u201d; and (3) shifting the burden of proof by telling the jury that it had to weigh the defense\u2019s case in making its decision. Notably, Pedron did not object to the first two of these comments at trial. \u201cTo establish prosecutorial misconduct, the remarks must be improper, and the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947 (internal quotation and punctuation omitted). Here, none of the comments were improper\u2014the vouching comment was simply an argument based on the evidentiary circumstances, the alleged personal attack comment was a valid remark on the defense strategy, and the burden-shifting comment properly addressed the defense\u2019s subpoena power. Moreover, even if there was error concerning this last comment, any possible prejudice was obviated since the prosecutor himself made clear that the burden was entirely on the government, noting that only the government had an obligation to call any witnesses. Accordingly, we find no error\u2014let alone plain error\u2014in Pedron\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion by allowing the government to impeach Pedron with a prior conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. If a criminal defendant chooses to testify, his credibility is placed in issue, and can be impeached with evidence of prior convictions. <em>United States v. Vigliatura, </em>878 F.2d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir. 1989). Federal Rule of Evidence 609 says that for purposes of attacking a testifying defendant\u2019s character for truthfulness, a prior conviction \u201cshall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value ... outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.... \u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1). At trial, Pedron put his credibility at issue by testifying, and the district court limited the government to one question about the conviction and later admonished the jury that a prior conviction could not be considered in determining Pedron\u2019s guilt in this case. In so doing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Pedron\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We also reject Pedron\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by allowing two lay witnesses to testify as expert witnesses without being qualified as experts. Specifically, Pedron challenges: (1) Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) Special Agent Chad Hughes\u2019s testimony, without the establishment of background support, that \u201chandwriting\u201d was a code word for the quality of a controlled substance; and (2) DEA Special Agent Michael Gannon\u2019s testimony about the inability to obtain fingerprints from plastic bags, even though he was not a fingerprint expert. Federal Rule of Evidence 701 limits a witness\u2019 testimony, if not testifying as an expert, to opinions or inferences \u201cwhich are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 701. We have held that employees and officers may testify as lay witnesses \u201cbased upon their particularized knowledge garnered from years of experience within the field.\u201d <em>Tampa Bay Shipbuilding &amp; Repair Co. v. Cedar Shipping Co., </em>320 F.3d 1213, 1223 (11th Cir.2003). We can find no error, plain or otherwise, in admitting Hughes\u2019s lay testimony\u2014to which Pedron did not object at trial\u2014as it was based on Hughes\u2019s experience as a law enforcement officer. While Gannon\u2019s testimony may be the kind that should have been offered by a fingerprint expert, we need not reach this issue because the error, if any, was harmless\u2014that is, the evidence unaffected by this error supported Pedron\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Indeed, contrary to Pedron\u2019s arguments, the evidence was sufficient to convict him of each count. A conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) requires the government to establish that the defendant \u201c(1) knowingly (2) possessed [a controlled substance] (3) with intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied,, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 615, 166 L.Ed.2d 456 (2006). \u201cThe government may prove constructive possession if it shows a defendant maintained dominion or control over the drugs or over the premises where the drugs are located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). To do so, the government may rely on direct or circumstantial evidence and inferences drawn from the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1345-46. The evidence need not exclude \u201cevery reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1345 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">As for Counts 2 and 3, Special Agent Gannon testified that the government\u2019s source, Eli Slieman, provided drugs to the DEA on July 14, 2006. Transcripts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>subsequent phone calls between Slieman and Pedron indicated that: (1) Slieman called Pedron to tell him that \u201cit\u201d would be \u201ccheck[ed] out and then they\u2019ll let me know,\u201d and Pedron responded that it was \u201cA-l\u201d; (2) Slieman asked how many pills there were, and Pedron replied that there were two; and (3) Pedron said that it had been four days and he needed the money, noting the perfect \u201chandwriting,\u201d which Special Agent Hughes testified meant drug purity. In response, Pedron testified that \u201cA-l\u201d referred to his roofing business, that the \u201cpills\u201d referred to prescription medicine that he had previously found in Slieman\u2019s car, and that the \u201cmoney\u201d was in connection with his roofing business and house payments. The jury plainly disbelieved Pedron\u2019s explanations, as evidenced by its verdict, and his statements explaining away his suspicious behavior can be considered substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201c[A] statement by a defendant, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d) (emphasis omitted). In addition, the testifying forensic chemist noted that the drugs recovered on July 14, 2006 and July 17, 2006 shared appearance and purity level. <em>Faust, </em>456 F.3d at 1345-46 (possession can be proved with circumstantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">As for Count 4, Special Agent Gannon testified that the DEA searched Pedron\u2019s car and discovered 4,000 tablets of amphetamines in a briefcase in the rear of the truck\u2019s cabin. Moreover, Special Agent Hughes testified that he discovered Pedron\u2019s drivers license and Social Security card in the briefcase, near the drugs. At a minimum, the government established constructive possession in as much as Pedron had control over the vehicle where the drugs were discovered. <em>Id. </em>at 1345. In short, based upon the monitored phone transcripts, the Special Agents\u2019 testimony interpreting the phone calls, Pedron\u2019s testimony, and the drugs recovered from Pedron\u2019s vehicle, there was abundant evidence from which a jury could find Pedron guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Finally, Pedron\u2019s challenges to his sentence\u2014both of which we review for plain error\u2014are also unsuccessful. Section 3C1.1 of the guidelines provides for a two-level enhancement if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">(A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offence of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. A \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement is appropriate if the defendant has committed perjury. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4(b). In defining perjury for purposes of \u00a7 3C1.1, the Supreme Court has relied on the federal criminal perjury statute and described perjury as \u201c[a] witness testifying under oath ... [who] gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). Four elements are required for a court to find perjury under \u00a7 3C1.1: (1) the testimony must be under oath; (2) the testimony must be false; (3) the testimony must be material; (4) the testimony must be given with willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a result of mistake, confusion, or faulty memory. <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 n. 4 (11th Cir.2002). While \u201cit is preferable for a district court to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>each element of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding,\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, a district court\u2019s decision to enhance is sufficient if the \u201ccourt makes a finding of an obstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court made a factual finding that the jury had to completely reject Pedron\u2019s testimony in order to find him guilty. This finding\u2014which was not clearly erroneous\u2014encompassed the factual predicates of perjury, and therefore, there was no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Turning to the ultimate sentence imposed, our reasonableness review consists of two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sen-fence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Rather than disputing the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, Pedron primarily argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to expressly apply the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, \u201cthe district court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (internal quotation and punctuation omitted); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). In this case, the district court correctly calculated Pedron\u2019s guidelines range after applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement; it stated that the guidelines were advisory, and considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the statutory factors; it noted that Pedron had a lengthy criminal history and that he was a fugitive from justice for ten years; and it then made a downward variance by two offense levels, sentencing Pedron to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment, inside the advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>guidelines range of 151-188 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Pedron has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable, nor that the district court committed any error, much less plain error, in imposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">. As discussed below, however, several of Pedron\u2019s claims relating to prosecutorial misconduct, evidentiary rulings, and his sentence were not raised at trial. In these circumstances, we review the challenges for plain error, and will only reverse if there is (1) error that is (2) plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-15\">. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462 (holding that a court of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence); <em>United States v.
