Brown, formerly Texas state prisoner # 396429, filed a verified 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, naming the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles (TBPP), \u201cJohn Doe, aka B. Jordan,\u201d and other John Doe defendants. Brown alleged that the TBPP wrongfully revoked his mandatory supervision in spite of a hearing officer\u2019s finding that he was not guilty of a violation. He alleged that the defendants violated his constitutional rights and have a policy of indifference toward liberty interests. He not only challenged the decision to revoke his supervision, he alleged that the TBPP\u2019s electronic monitoring system is faulty and violated his constitutional rights. He contended that TBPP officials knowingly failed to implement a policy that would facilitate effective, error-free GPS monitoring. He sought monetary damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-20\">Brown argues that the district court erred when it granted the Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6) motion filed by the TBPP based on the determination that his claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. He argues that the district court erred by granting the Rule 12(b)(6) motion filed on behalf of Defendant Jordan and by dismissing his claims against the other individual defendants based on the determination that they were entitled to immunity with respect to all of his claims. Brown further argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint and by denying his discovery requests. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Brown, however, informs this court that his claims regarding his GPS monitoring are moot; he thus has voluntarily withdrawn his appeal as to \u201cthe issue of being on a GPS monitoring system, and that [he] was denied the opportunity to further [his] claim in the District Court\u201d via an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is reviewed de novo. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008) <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008). Under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when the complaint does not contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The TBPP \u201cis cloaked with Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d <em>McGrew v. Texas Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent that Brown sought monetary damages against the TBPP, the district court did not err by dismissing Brown\u2019s claims. In addition, to the extent that Brown sued Defendant Jordan and the other individual defendants regarding their decision to revoke his mandatory supervision, the district court did not err in its determination that the defendants were absolutely immune from suit. <em>See Walter v. Torres, </em>917 F.2d 1379, 1380, 1383-84 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Brown also sought injunctive relief; however, the district court erroneously concluded that his initial complaint did not seek such relief. <em>See </em>Dkt. # 1, record pp. 46-51 (attachment pp. 4G-4L). Claims for declaratory or injunctive relief challenging a state parole board\u2019s policies and procedures are cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 proceeding. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 76-77, 81-85, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Cook v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice Transitional Planning Dep\u2019t, </em>37 F.3d 166, 168-69 (5th Cir.1994). Likewise, the district court did not consider Brown\u2019s claims against the individual defendants based on their alleged administrative conduct. <em>See Walter, </em>917 F.2d at 1383. We express no opinion whether these allegations state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">We do not address Brown\u2019s argument challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for leave to amend his complaint to add claims against Carlos Fierro concerning Brown\u2019s placement on the GPS system because Brown has voluntarily withdrawn any appeal of this issue. However, Brown also argues that the district court erred when it denied him leave to amend his complaint against the other individual defendants. The district court ruled based on its determination that the amendment would be futile because the individual defendants were absolutely immune from suit as to all of Brown\u2019s claims. As the district court did not address all of Brown\u2019s claims against the individual defendants, this determination, in part, may have been erroneous. <em>See United States v. Riascos, </em>76 F.3d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Finally, as the district court was considering claims of immunity, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that discovery could not proceed. <em>See Williamson v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>815 F.2d 368, 382-83 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Accordingly, the judgment dismissing Brown\u2019s claims for damages against the TBPP on the basis of Eleventh Amendment immunity is affirmed. The judgment dismissing Brown\u2019s claims against Jordan and the other individual defendants for their decision to revoke Brown\u2019s supervised release on grounds of immunity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>affirmed. The judgment dismissing Brown\u2019s claims for injunctive relief is vacated. To the extent the judgment determined that absolute immunity barred Brown\u2019s allegations involving the defendants\u2019 administrative conduct, the judgment is vacated. The decision denying Brown\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint is vacated to the extent that the decision was based on the determination that any amendment would be futile as the defendants were absolutely immune from suit as to all of Brown\u2019s claims. The district court\u2019s judgment denying discovery is affirmed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b197-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
