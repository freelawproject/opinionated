The district court sentenced her to 41 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">Rivera argues that the district court clearly erred in reducing her base offense level by two levels for her minor participation in the offense, rather than by four or three levels for her minimal or less than minor participation in the offense. The advisory Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in the base offense level of a \u201cminor\u201d or a \u201cminimal\u201d participant and a participant who falls between a \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cminimal\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. To merit a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). The role of a defendant in the offense is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-20\">The facts show that Rivera packaged the marijuana, loaded the marijuana, knew that she was participating in the transportation of marijuana, and assisted in the transportation of a large quantity of marijuana. Rivera has not shown that her participation in the offense was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity\u201d or that it was not \u201ccritical to the offense.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 &amp; n. 9; <em>United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 757 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 198 (5th Cir.1995). The district court did not clearly err in reducing Rivera\u2019s offense level by two levels for her minor participation in the offense, rather than by four or three levels for a minimal or less than minor participation in the offense. Additionally, Rivera\u2019s properly calculated, within guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b144-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
