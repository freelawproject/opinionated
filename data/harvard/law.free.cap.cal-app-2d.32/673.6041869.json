All three buildings were used by plaintiffs in the business of manufacturing furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">April 10, 1936, a fire destroyed lumber stored in the building that was not equipped with an automatic sprinkler system and also in one of the buildings that was equipped with such system. Defendants assumed responsibility and paid the loss resulting from the destruction of the property in the sprinkler equipped building but declined liability as to the property which had been destroyed in the nonsprinkler equipped building.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">This is the sole question necessary for us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\n<em>Did, the fire insurance policy above mentioned extend coverage to the contents of the nonsprinkler equipped building?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">This question must be answered in the affirmative, and is controlled by the following pertinent principles of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">(D If the language in an insurance policy may be understood in 'more senses than one, it is to be construed liberally in favor of the insured, and any uncertainty or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ambiguity in the contract is to be interpreted most strongly against the insurer. <em>(Raulet </em>v. <em>Northwestern etc. Ins. Co., </em>157 Cal. 213, 218 [107 Pac. 292]; <em>Meyerstein </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>82 Cal. App. 131, 134 [255 Pac. 220].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\">(2) A clause in a fire insurance policy reciting a special premium rate for the insurance because of the installation of a sprinkler system and requiring its maintenance, which does not purport to be a limitation of the coverage of the policy, is not determinative of the extent of coverage afforded by the contract. <em>(Studley Box &amp; Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co., </em>85 N. H. 96, 100 [154 Atl. 337, 339, 75 A. L. R. 248].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Applying the foregoing rules to the facts in the instant ease, the policy on its face insured against the loss by fire of property stored in a building situated at No. 6000 Boyle Avenue, Los Angeles. Construing this language in one of the senses of which it is susceptible, it covered property located in any building at No. 6000 Boyle Avenue, Los Angeles, which was where the property for the loss of which recovery is sought was located when destroyed by fire. It is immaterial whether the building in which the property was located was equipped with an automatic sprinkler system or not, in view of the fact that two buildings located on said property were so equipped at the time the insurance was issued and the sprinkler systems had been maintained in the same condition from the time of the issuance of the policy to the date of the fire. Therefore, the trial court properly rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Crail, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
