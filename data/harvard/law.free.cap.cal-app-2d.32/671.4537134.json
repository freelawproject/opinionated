(2d) 227 [57 Pac. (2d) 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">As petitioner is now legally detained under the sentence pronounced upon his plea of guilty to the second count of the information, the writ is discharged and the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>is remanded to the custody of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">York, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">An application by petitioner to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on June 15, 1939.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
