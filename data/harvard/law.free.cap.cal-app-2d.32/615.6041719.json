Shafer and Lillie May Shafer. The agreement was executed April 1, 1933. Lillie May Shafer died August 17, 1936, and the plaintiff was appointed executrix of her estate. The plaintiff contends that under the terms of the said written agreement defendant agreed to pay to his wife, or the estate of his wife, the sum of $32.08 per month until the sum of $5,500 had been paid. The trial court made findings to the effect that by the terms of said written agreement all promises by the defendant were solely to pay $32.08 per month, the interest due on a certain promissory note, to his wife, the decedent, and that such payments had been made. From the judgment based on those findings the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">On or before April 1, 1933, marital troubles arose between Mr. and Mrs. Shafer and she was about to apply for a divorce. They had accumulated and were possessed of properties including cash on hand, promissory notes secured by deeds of trust, and a parcel of real estate known as their home. On that date they executed and delivered deeds and assignments. They also executed a formal written agreement. Omitting descriptions not necessary to an understanding of the controversy that instrument provided as follows: \u201cThis Agreement made and entered into this 1st day of April, 1933, by and between Frank Shafer, party of the first part, and Lillie May Shafer, his wife, party of the second part, both of Oakland, California.

Neither that paragraph nor any other part of the agreement supports her. In particular that paragraph does not support her for several separate and distinct reasons. In the first place the first part of said paragraph is addressed to the contingency of the refusal or neglect of the Hutchinsons to comply with the directions of Mr. Shafer to make payments of interest directly to Mrs. Shafer. But the Hutchinsons never refused to make said payments directly to her and the contingency never arose. In the next place the covenant as written was to pay \u201ca sum equal to the total amount due by the terms of said note and deed of trust\u201d. The principal stated in the note was $5,500. The note was payable in one year. The interest was fixed at 7 per cent. The amount was therefore $5,885. But even the plaintiff disclaimed asking that sum. She thereby admitted that said clause was ambiguous. Indeed it was, because if it had any such meaning why did Mrs. Shafer assign her interest in the note to Mr. Shafer? Such act was worse than an idle act. But, \u25a0faking the agreement up by its four corners, it is obvious it had no such meaning as will hereinafter appear. Finally, there was undoubtedly an error in writing said covenant. Clearly the parties did not mean to enhance ten-fold the obligation of Mr. Shafer because the Hutchinsons refused to make their payments to Mrs. Shafer instead of to Mr. Shafer. However, in writing said paragraph they neglected, in stating the amount of the obligation of Mr. Shafer, to use the same words repeatedly employed by them. They wrote \u201ctotal amount due by the terms of said note and deed of trust\u201d, whereas they intended to write \u201ctotal amount of interest due by the terms of said note and deed of trust\u201d, the expression used in other parts of their agreement. If such was the intention of the parties, it is our clear duty to so construe the instrument. (Civ. Code, secs. 1648 and 1652; 12 Am. Jur. 775; <em>Coast Counties Real Estate etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Monterey County W. W., </em>96 Cal. App. 269, 278 [274 Pac. 415].) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>question presented for determination in such cases being \u201cWhat is the paramount purpose or paramount provision of the instrument?\u201d <em>(Todd </em>v. <em>Superior Court of San Francisco, </em>181 Cal. 406, 418, 419 [184 Pac. 684, 7 A. L. R. 938].) That question should be answered, if possible, by an examination and comparison of the several covenants contained in the agreement. (Civ. Code, sec. 1639.) We will turn then to the various covenants contained in the agreement for additional light.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In no place did Mr. Shafer agree generally and by unlimited language to pay money in any amount except in paragraph one he agreed to pay $1700 in cash. That paragraph is in no manner involved. Mrs. Shafer assigned all of her interest in the Hutchinson loan \u201c . . . saving and excepting interest payments thereon, as provided by said note and terms of this agreement in the sum of $32.08 per month.\u201d (Par. 2. ) That sum out of that fund Mr. Shafer agreed he would direct the Hutchinsons to pay directly to Mrs. Shafer. (Par. 3. ) If they did not do so he agreed to pay (ib.). \u201cNothing herein shall he construed ... in relieving him . . . from paying a sum equal to the total interest payments provided in said note and deed of trust\u201d (ib.). If there should be a default by the Hutchinsons, Mr. Shafer agreed to pay Mrs. Shafer \u201c . . . the total sum of interest payments provided by said note and deed of trust (ib.). The first of the covenants recited in this paragraph immediately preceded and all others recited in this paragraph immediately followed the covenant we have written \u201ca sum equal to the total amount (of interest) due by the terms of said note and deed of trust\u201d. It follows that each promise was to pay out of the same fund in the same <em>quantum. </em>That was the \u201cparamount purpose\u201d of the agreement and the trial court did not err in so construing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Moreover, the parties so construed this agreement. Said instalments were paid down to the date of the termination of the 1929 note and were, so far as the record discloses, accepted without complaint. When the Hutchinson note was about to outlaw Mr. Shafer could have declared a default and terminated that loan and also his obligations under the agreement before us because he had then fully performed every covenant contained therein. The parties did not so construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>their agreement. Mr. Shafer renewed the loan December 2, 1935, as the lender in his own name but continued the payments as though the note of 1929 was still in force. He so continued down to the date of the death of Mrs. Shafer.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">After the death of Mrs. Shafer he made no payment to this plaintiff. He was not bound to do so. No covenant contained in the agreement called upon him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">All matters, except making the payments provided in said agreement, were clearly intended to be executed covenants. All provisions were for a division of the properties and the support of each spouse. Bach note, and the trust deed securing its payment, was unconditionally assigned to one spouse. From that instant either spouse could have served notice on the maker of any note held by such spouse and caused a sale in the event of a default. Furthermore, each spouse could have assigned any one of his or her notes and trust deeds. No covenant to the contrary was inserted. If Mrs. Shafer exercised her right and declared a default under the Dull loan, all rights of Mr. Shafer to collect interest thereon would <em>ipso facto </em>terminate. (Par. 5.) If Mr. Shafer did the same thing under the Hutchinson loan, the note dated December 5, 1929, he became liable to Mrs. Shafer to pay \u201c . . . the total sum of interest payments provided by said note and deed of trust\u201d. (Par. 3.) Mr. Shafer\u2019s rights to participate in the Dull loan were limited to him and did not extend to his \u201c . . . heirs and assigns\u201d. (Par. 5.) Mrs. Shafer\u2019s heirs and assigns were not expressly bound by any covenant nor did any covenant expressly run in their favor. The sole language used, except as hereinabove noted, was to the effect that all payments by Mr. Shafer would be made to Mrs. Shafer.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In the preamble it is said the parties were \u201cmutually desirous of equitably settling and adjusting all property rights between them, and for the better support and maintenance of each of said parties hereto shall henceforth have no claim or demand against the other . . . That recital is inconsistent with and cannot be reconciled with the claim of the plaintiff. However, the conclusions stated above are in entire accord with the recital contained in said preamble. The last paragraph, number ten, is also helpful wherein it provides: \u201cIt is understood and agreed by and between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>parties hereto that . . . this document is the full measure of the property rights of the parties hereto ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Nourse, P. J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
