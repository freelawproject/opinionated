Ashton, who testified for the defendants, detailed a conversation he claimed to have had with plaintiffs\u2019 witness Kell during the trial of this cause; the substance of this pretended conversation was, that Kell was a friend of the Yerde people (meaning the owners of the United Yerde Copper Company), and that he was going to do what he could to help them win the case. It will he observed that Kell had already been examined in regard to this matter while he was upon the stand. From an inspection of the testimony of this man Ashton and his pal, Dan O\u2019Boyle, it will be seen that they were a pair of worthless, drunken loafers. Ashton denied having any interest in the matter, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>O \u2019Boyle came out clear and said that he had not been promised anything, but that he was going to get some all the same, and they could not keep him out of it. The plaintiffs moved to strike out this testimony, because no proper foundation had been laid for its introduction. The Verde people were not parties to this suit, nor was Kell. The pretended contradiction was upon a matter wholly immaterial. The rule of law goes no further than to permit Kell to be interrogated upon these matters; when this is done defendants are not allowed to bring in witnesses to contradict, the rule being, that on immaterial matters the answer of the witness first examined is final and binding on defendants.

E. Jordan and his co-locators entered thereon and located the same by performing the acts necessary under the mining laws, reciting those facts, and since had done and performed the annual work, then the verdict should be for the plaintiffs. The court refused to give this instruction as asked, but modified it by adding \u201cor was not in the actual possession of one entitled thereto, \u2019 \u2019 in the third line of the instruction, and gave the instruction so modified. The plaintiffs assign this as error. This modification raises purely a question of law. \u201cIn the actual possession of one entitled thereto.\u201d How could one be \u201centitled\u201d to actual possession without complying with the mining laws and regulations ? \u2022 And would actual possession be of any avail against an actual locator? <em>Horswell </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>67 Cal. 111, 7 Pac. 197; <em>Belk </em>v. <em>Meagher, </em>104 U.

Appellants thereafter instituted this suit against appellees, claiming the title and right of possession of 6.14 acres of land embraced within the said mining claim, Copper Chief,fully describing said 6.1:: acres, as a part of a certain mining claim of the name of \u201cEquator,\u201d claimed by appellants. It appears from the record that on January 1, 1884, the appellants F. E. Jordan, E. A. Jordan, and W. A. Jordan located the mining claim Equator; that the 6.14 acres of land in dispute is within the exterior limits of said mining claim; that said parties performed all tE\u00a1 necessary work and acts to entitle them to the possession of naid Equator mining claim from the date of the location thereof until March, 1888, when they conveyed an undivided interest in said mining claim to the appellant W. S. Head; that the appellants, from the date of said conveyance to Head, have had possession of said mining claim, and performed all the acts and things necessary and proper to be done to hold said mining claim, up to the date when this suit was instituted; that the 6.14 acres in controversy, embraced within both of said mining claims,\u2014viz., Copper Chief and Equator,\u2014is ground formerly embraced within a certain mining claim called the Nellie, which was located in January, 1882; that the Copper Chief mining claim was located in October, 1883, by the appellee W. H. Ferguson. If the Nellie was a valid location, the ground embraced therein was not open for relocation until January 1, 1884, and the location of the Copper CIbef in October, 1883, was void as to all parts thereof embraced in the Nellie. The 6.14 acres of land in dispute are embraced within what was the Nellie mining claim, and also, within the Equator and Copper Chief; and if appellants\u2019 mining; claim, the Equator, is a valid mining claim they should have judgment therefor. The complaint contained substantially the foregoing facts, and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>addition thereto, facts that showed the Nellie to be a valid mining claim, and that the Equator was a valid mining claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">These facts having been established on the trial, and the judgment being for the defendants, we are forced to examine the record, to see if any errors were committed upon the trial that would make it necessary to reverse the judgment. An examination of the record discloses the fact that, on the trial, defendants were permitted to contradict witnesses for plaintiffs on matters irrelevant and immaterial; to prove that a witness for plaintiffs was very friendly to a certain large mining company, which was not a party to the suit; to show that certain witnesses for the plaintiffs had located the same ground in controversy in 1883, and to put the location notice of said claim in evidence. Errors of the character above enumerated are too numerous in the record to be mentioned individually. They were sufficient to prejudice the jury against the plaintiffs, and to require a reversal of the judgment. 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 11th ed., pars. 449-462; 1 Rice on Evidence, p. 588f; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>53 Cal. 119; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>47 Mo. 567, 4 Am. Rep. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The only other error assigned that we will notice relates to the instructions given and refused. Plaintiff offered the following instruction, viz.: \u201cNo. 1. If the jury believe from the evidence that on the first day of January, 1884, the ground in controversy was not embraced within the boundaries of any valid location, <em>or not m the actual possession of one entitled thereto, </em>and that on said day, F. E. Jordan, for himself and his co-locators, entered upon the same, and located the same in the Equator location, marking the boundaries of said Equator lode by placing stone monuments at the point of discovery, and also at each end and each corner thereof, so that the boundaries thereof could be readily traced on the ground, and placed a notice thereon containing the names of the locators, the date of the location, and such a description of the claim located, by reference to some natural object or permanent monument, as would identify the claim, and within sixty days thereafter caused said notice to be recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of said county of Yavapai, where said claim is situate, and since that time plaintiffs have done, or caused to be done, and performed, at least $100 worth of labor or improvements thereon during each year, then your verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>should be for the plaintiffs.\u201d Plaintiffs presented said instruction to the court, and asked that it be given without the part in italics. The court modified .it by inserting the part in italics, and, as thus modified, gave it, to which plaintiffs excepted. It is shown by the record that there was evidence before the jury that one of the defendants located the Copper Chief in October, 1883. Hence, there was evidence from w'hieh the jury might have found that, at the time plaintiff F. E. Jordan, located the Equator, the ground embraced in the Equator was in the actual possession of another. They were instructed that, if they should so find, only one other thing was necessary for them to determine in order that their verdict should be for defendants, and that was, that the one in possession was entitled thereto. A mining claim is acquired by the performance of certain specific acts, and there can be no possession of such a claim unless the party has performed those acts. The acts referred to, when performed, constitute a location. It requires a location of a mining claim to give the right of possession. Hence, it is apparent that by the modification of said instruction a question of law was submitted to the jury. <em>Horswell </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>67 Cal. 111, 7 Pac. 197; <em>Belk </em>v. <em>Meagher, </em>104 U.
