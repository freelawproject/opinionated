The court below rendered judgment for appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>for $292, being one dollar each for tax-certificates issued to the territory.

We have just decided in <em>Maricopa County </em>v. <em>Osborn </em>that a county recorder has no cause of .action against the county for filing and recording tax-certificates and tax-deeds to the territory. He accepts his office with the law as written in the statutes, and can get such fees only by the mode set out in the revenue act. The tax-collector is in the same category. He has stated no cause of action in his complaint against the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The judgment is reversed and cause remanded, with directions to the court below to sustain the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Bethune J., and Bouse, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Baker, C.
