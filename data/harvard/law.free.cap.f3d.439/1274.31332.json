Count I of the complaint alleged negligence, willfulness, and wantonness claims. Count II alleged a loss of consortium claim on behalf of Barbara Young. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the TVA\u2019s motion and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The plaintiffs then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-22\">The issue presented on appeal is whether the district court correctly held that because TVA qualifies as a \u201cspecial employer\u201d of plaintiff Daniel Young under the Alabama Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, TVA is entitled to the same exclusive remedy protections from a tort suit that are applicable to other special employers under Alabama law (i.e., protection from plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of willful conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.1996). A summary judgment is due to be granted only if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we first agree with the district court\u2019s finding that TVA qualified as a special employer of Daniel Young under Alabama law. We also conclude that TVA is entitled to the same exclusive remedy protection from a tort suit (i.e., protection against willful conduct allegations) that are applicable to other persons who are special employers under Alabama law. Where TVA meets the test for a special employer, TVA is entitled to the same exclusivity protection afforded every other employer under Alabama law. <em>Tweedy v. TVA, </em>882 F.2d 477, 479 (11th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of TVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1282-14\">. Apparently, the parties consented to a magistrate judge conducting all proceedings in this cause. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">. Young's reliance on <em>Kirby v. TVA, </em>877 F.Supp. 578 (N.D.Ala.), <em>aff'd, </em>41 F.3d 669 (11th Cir.1994) (table), is misplaced. That case involved a situation in which TVA was neither the employer of the injured worker nor a \"special employer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
