On December 12, 1883, Judge Carswell, of the Middle circuit, who had presided in Bibb superior court on the trial of a case, signed a bill of exceptions in such case, the certificate being in the usual form. Immediately after this certificate .appears the following:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b433-7\">\u201cI certify that, after signing this bill of exceptions on the 12th of December, 1883, it was sent by me to plaintiff\u2019s counsel at Macon on the 17th of December, 1883, by express, at their request; and being informed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the bill was received by them after the ten days in which service on counsel is required to be made, I hereby, within sixty days from the date of said decision, again sign said bill of exceptions, and adopt the foregoing certificate for that purpose.

After a judge has signed a bill of exceptions, he has exhausted his statutory power with respect thereto, and he cannot subsequently alter or re-certify the same. When a bill of exceptions is signed by the presiding judge, the writ of error is thereby completed, and further jurisdiction of the case is lost by the superior court and passes to this court.</headnotes>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b433-15\">Writ of error dismissed.</disposition>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b433-16\">October 9, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-14\">Blandfokd, J.</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
