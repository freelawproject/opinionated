Allhough, when the term commenced at which the rule <em>nisi </em>to foreclose a mortgage was taken, the debt, to secure which the mortgage was given, was not due, yet if, when the petition and rule <em>nisi </em>were presented, the debt had matured, and the rule <em>nisi </em>was served on the defendant more than three months before the next term, at which the money due on the mortgage was required to he paid; this is all that the mortgagee was entitled to.
