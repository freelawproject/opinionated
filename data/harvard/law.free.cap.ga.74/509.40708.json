The action was brought against the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia, a corporation of said state, and Samuel J. Whitesides, of Muscogee county. The declaration alleged that they were partners under the name and style of the Central Line of Boats; that the railroad company was operating railroads in Muscogee and Clay counties; that the boats were run on the Chattahoochee river for the benefit of the railroads so operated, terminating at Columbus and Fort Gaines, in the counties named; that this was with the knowledge and consent of the president of the railroad company; and that it and Whitesides, as partners, were common carriers of passengers by such boats.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">Defendants demurred to the declaration'; and moved to, dismiss it, on substantially the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">(1.)

We have been asked to decide how far such a corporation may engage in the business of purchasing and running boats on the rivers of the state, and how far they would be liable to passengers on their boats for injuries done in consequence of the negligence of their agents or employ\u00e9s engaged in conducting that particular business . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>but from the state of the pleadings in this case, the question thus broadly propounded is not raised, and we should be transcending our powers as a reviewing court were we to undertake to determine it, and must therefore decline to consider the request. When that question arises upon an actual case \u2014 not upon one that may come up at some future time \u2014 we will endeavor to meet and settle it, but until that time, it is obvious that we would be exceeding our powers were we to consider it. Any expression of opinion, under such circumstances, upon the abstract points would be clearly <em>obiter, </em>and would amount to nothing more than the views of the judge delivering the opinion; it would not have the force or effect of a judgment binding upon the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">A corporation is an artificial person created by law for specific purposes, and its powers are limited and fixed by the act of incorporation. Code, \u00a71670. Besides the powers thus specially granted, there are some others common to all corporations, among which is the power to purchase and hold such property, real or personal, as is necessary to the purposes of their organization, and the doing of all such acts as are essential to the legitimate execution of this purpose. <em>Id., </em>\u00a71679. This is the law of their being, and if they transcend its bounds, they are guilty of a misuser of their franchises, and thereby incur a forfeiture of the same. <em>.Id., </em>\u00a7 1685.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In Whittendon Mills <em>vs. </em>Upton <em>et al., </em>10 Gray, 582, in which the question of the ability of corporations to form a partnership with individuals and the validity of contracts made by such an association was fully considered, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts' says: \u201c What\u2022 powers are granted expressly, or by implication, because necessary or usual for the purposes which this charter was given to effect, the corporation has and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u201c There is one obvious and important distinction between such a society as this charter creates and that of a partnership. An act of the corporation, done either by direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>vote or by agents authorized for the purpose, is the manifestation of the collected will of the society. No member of the corporation, as such, can bind the society. In a partnership each member binds the society as a principal. If, then, this corporation may enter into partnership with an individual, there \u25a0 would be two principals, the legal person and the natural person, each Laving, within the scope of the society\u2019s business, full authority to manage its concerns, including even the disposition of its property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>595. Again it is declared <em>(Id., </em>597) that \u201c the effect of all our statutes, the settled policy of our legislation for the regulation of manufacturing corporations, is that the corporation is to manage its affairs separately and exclusively; certain powers to be exercised by the stockholders, and others by officers who are the servants of the corporation and act in its name and behalf. And the formation of a contract, or the entering into a relation by which the corporation or the officers of its appointment should be divested of that power, or by which its franchises should be vested in a_ partner with equal power to direct and control its business, is entirely inconsistent with that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u201c The power to form a partnership is not only not among the powers granted expressly or by reasonable implication, but is wholly inconsistent with the scope and tenor of the powers expressly conferred, and .the duties expressly imposed upon a corporation by the legislation of the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Farther it is said <em>(Id., </em>598) thati! the case rests upon broader grounds. The charter of the corporation is part of the public law. Those who deal with it must take notice of the extent of its powers, and that the corporation is legally \u2022 incapable of entering into the contract of partnership, that that contract was beyond the scope of its authority, and that this incapacity resulted from considerations not personal or peculiar to the corporation or its members, but from general grounds of public policy, which tibe corporation and those dealing with it cannot be pesr<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>xnitted to contravene and defeat. That policy is to confine these corporations within the limits prescribed by law, to protect the stockholders from liabilities which the charter and laws do not create; and while it imposes upon the stockholders of corporations heavy responsibilities, to retain to them the legal control of its business and conduct of its affairs.\u201d East Anglian Railway <em>vs. </em>Eastern Counties Railway, 11 C. B., 775; MacGregor <em>vs. </em>Official Manager Dover &amp; Deal Rwy. <em>et al., </em>18 Ad. &amp; El. N. R., 618; Shrewsbury &amp; Birmingham Railway <em>vs. </em>Northwestern Railway, 6 H. L. Cases, 113, 137; 3 McLean, 102; 24 Barb., 199 ; 24 Conn., 159; 8 Giles &amp; J., 248; 3 Woodb. &amp; Minot, 112; Angell &amp; Ames Corp., \u00a7\u00a7229, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Central Railroad <em>&amp; </em>Banking Company has no express power, by the terms of its charter, to enter into a contract of partnership, nor is this among the powers (as we have seen) common to all corporations. Railroad companies derive their grant of corporate powers and privileges from an act of the general assembly, under the constitution of this state (Code, \u00a75077), and all such legislative acts, published by authority, are to be held and taken as public laws. Code, \u00a73815.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">After this case was argued, it was suggested that the suit was maintainable under the act of 1880 and 1881, p. 165 (Code, \u00a71689(o), as railroad companies are thereby authorized \u201c to build, construct and run, as part of their corporate property, such number of steamboats or vessels as they may d\u00e9em necessary to facilitate the business of such companies.\u201d But it is manifest from the very terms of this law, that they were to be the separate and exclusive owners of such boats or vessels as were employed by them for the purpose of facilitating their business. There is, therefore, no necessity, and indeed it would be improper, to consider or decide the constitutional questions made upon the portion of the act from which this section is taken, and upon that subject we intimate no opinion. We decide the single point that this corporation had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>power or authority to enter into the partnership set out in plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and that its acts and contracts pertaining to the business of such an association are invalid as against the firm and the corporation as a member thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
