Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 55 Mich App 403; 222 NW2d 261 (1974). We granted leave to appeal by order filed December 23, 1974. 393 Mich 773 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The defendants are charged with offering to return to Irving Broadnax, upon payment to them of $800, certain property held in the Inkster Police Department property room which was confiscated from Mr. Broadnax in connection with an earlier burglary investigation. The people\u2019s principal witness was Betty Harris, a former drug addict, convicted felon, and sometime informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The people offered Ms. Harris\u2019 testimony that she had acted as the go-between when defendants made their initial proposals to Mr. Broadnax. Over the objection of defendants\u2019 counsel, Ms. Harris further testified that she had acted as intermediary between the defendants and three local drug dealers in connection with payments for protection and information on police activities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The testimony concerning Ms. Harris\u2019 contact with the three drug dealers was offered and received as bearing upon the defendants\u2019 criminal intent in the transaction involving Mr. Broadnax.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The first issue is the admissibility of the so-called \"similar acts\u201d evidence under MCLA 768.27; MSA 28.1050, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\"In any criminal case where the defendant\u2019s motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing an act, is material, any like acts, or other acts of the defendant which may tend to show his motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing the act, in question, may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto; notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another or prior or subsequent crime by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Defendants raise four points with regard to the applicability of the statute in their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">First, they challenge the relevancy of an alleged drug protection racket to the charges of conspiracy to do a legal act in an illegal manner and solicitation of a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Despite certain factual distinctions, the common thread which connects all the incidents was the use of Betty Harris by the defendants to obtain payoffs in return for the use of their official position to protect or benefit illegal activities. The focus of the analysis is on the nature of <em>defendants\u2019 </em>activities, not on the criminal acts of the persons from whom the defendants solicited bribes. The fact that the identities of the benefited criminals or the nature of the criminal activities protected varied is not a bar to the admissibility of the evidence. The prior incidents of bribery offered by the people were sufficiently similar to the bribery alleged in the information to qualify as admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sible evidence within the meaning of the statute. The statute requires \"like acts\u201d, not identical acts. See, <em>e.g., State v Firestone, </em>68 Ohio App 359; 41 NE2d 277, <em>app dism\u2019d </em>139 Ohio St 216; 38 NE2d 1023 (1942), and cases collected in Anno, <em>Admissibility, in prosecution for bribery or accepting bribes, of evidence tending to show the commission of other bribery, or acceptance of bribe, </em>20 ALR2d 1012, 1034-1035. But <em>cf., People v Fiore, </em>34 NY2d 81; 356 NYS2d 38; 312 NE2d 174 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Defendants next challenge the materiality of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The \"similar acts\u201d were offered to show defendants\u2019 intent with regard to the solicitation and conspiracy. Before any proofs were offered, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement informed the jury that \"our testimony will show along with the prosecution\u2019s testimony that there was talk of a bribe\u201d. The proofs did show numerous conversations between Mr. Duncan, Mr. McIntosh, Ms. Harris and Mr. Broadnax in varying combinations, discussing the sum of $800 to be paid to defendants for the return of Mr. Broadnax\u2019s property from the police station. The crucial differences in testimony were that Mr. Broadnax and Ms. Harris testified that the defendants initiated the scheme. The defendants testified that Mr. Broadnax and Ms. Harris initiated the scheme and that the defendants only went along with it so as to catch Mr. Broadnax in a crime. With regard to the conspiracy count, the evidence of the four principal witnesses showed the discussions and apparent agreement to return the property for $800. The disputed issue was the intent of the defendants at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">By pleading not guilty and disputing intent by their proofs at trial, defendants placed their intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>in issue. <em>People v Reading, </em>307 Mich 616; 12 NW2d 482 (1943); <em>People v McElheny, </em>221 Mich 50; 190 NW 713 (1922). We have previously held that the prosecution may prove intent by offering evidence of a continuing course of conduct. <em>People v Johnston, </em>328 Mich 213; 43 NW2d 334 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><em>Johnston </em>involved payments to a prosecuting attorney for protection of houses used for gambling and prostitution. Evidence of other payments to defendant for the same purpose from the same and other individuals received during the four years prior to the incident alleged in the information was held properly admitted as bearing on the issue of intent. In the case at bar the people offered three other incidents of bribery as bearing on the intent of defendants in their relations with Broadnax. The evidence of a repeated course of conduct tended to show the intent of defendants in doing the acts alleged and was therefore material and admissible under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Defendants also contend that the similar acts were not \"proved\u201d in the manner required by the statute. It is argued that although the people need not prove the alleged similar acts beyond a reasonable doubt, the proofs must at least convince the jury of the probability of the defendant\u2019s actions. The evidence of similar acts in this case is attacked as mere uncorroborated testimony of a witness who had expressed a desire \"to get the defendants in trouble\u201d. Defendants cite <em>People v Davis, </em>343 Mich 348; 72 NW2d 269 (1955), in support of their argument. We do not read the relevant language of <em>Davis</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to require any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>proof than was presented here. <em>People v Allen, </em>351 Mich 535; 88 NW2d 433 (1958), also cited by appellants, requires only that the proofs be sufficient to convince the jury of the probability of defendants\u2019 actions. The people were not required to offer corroboration of Ms. Harris\u2019 testimony when she was testifying as to transactions in which she was an active participant. It was within the province of the jury to believe or disbelieve the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Finally, defendants argue that the probative value of the similar acts testimony was outweighed by its unduly prejudicial impact. It is well settled that the determination of whether the probative value of similar acts testimony is substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>People v DerMartzex, </em>390 Mich 410; 213 NW2d 97 (1973), and authority cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Like the Court of Appeals, we recognize the potentially inflammatory impact of testimony linking police officers with narcotics dealers. However, we also recognize the relevance of this testimony as tending to show a continuing course of conduct involving payoffs. As noted by the Court of Appeals below, the trial judge carefully considered the matter and, when he concluded that the testimony could be presented to the jury, carefully controlled the proceedings and specifically in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>structed the jury on the permissible uses of the testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We find no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in allowing the similar acts testimony to be presented to the jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Defendants\u2019 second major contention on appeal is that they were denied a fair trial because of improper argument by the prosecutor. The people\u2019s closing argument is alleged to contain at least three instances of impropriety sufficient to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Because no objection was made to any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments at trial, appellate review is foreclosed unless our failure to consider the issue would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>People v Alcala, </em>396 Mich 99; 237 NW2d 475 (1976); <em>People v Hancock, </em>326 Mich 471; 40 NW2d 689 (1950); <em>People v Zesk, </em>309 Mich 129; 14 NW2d 808 (1944); <em>People v Connors, </em>251 Mich 99; 230 NW 931 (1930); <em>People v Goldberg, </em>248 Mich 553; 227 NW 708 (1929); MCLA 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We examine the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the context in which they were made. <em>People v Allen, </em>351 Mich 535; 88 NW2d 433 (1958).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case were either proper argument based upon the evidence presented or responses to matters raised by the defendants in their proofs and closing argument. Certain of the latter remarks, although if standing alone could be seen as improper, do not constitute reversible error in this case because of their responsive nature, <em>People v Dersa, </em>42 Mich App 522; 202 NW2d 334 (1972), <em>lv den </em>388 Mich 803 (1972); <em>People v Green, </em>34 Mich App 149; 190 NW2d 686 (1971), <em>lv den </em>386 Mich 769 (1971), and because any unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>prejudicial effect could have been eliminated by a curative instruction if one had been requested upon a timely objection. <em>People v Hall, </em>396 Mich 650; 242 NW2d 377 (1976); <em>People v Omacht, </em>326 Mich 505; 40 NW2d 704 (1950); <em>People v Goldberg, supra; People v Mulvaney, </em>171 Mich 272; 137 NW 155 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">It is, of course, as much the duty of a public prosecutor to ensure that the criminally accused receive a fair trial as it is to use his best efforts to convict those guilty of crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, it is also true that a well-tried, vigorously argued case ought not to be overturned due to isolated improper remarks which could have been cured had an objection been lodged. <em>People v Hall, supra. </em>Whether the defense strategy was to forego objection and hope that the objectionable portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument would engender sympathy in the jury, or to invite error as a foundation for subsequent reversal, we will not now review assignments of error so waived. <em>Cf. Henry v Mississippi, </em>379 US 443; 85 S Ct 564; 13 L Ed 2d 408 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">We pause to observe that the prosecutor discussed the evils of heroin trafficking in his final argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence relating to heroin and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>narcotics protection racket was admitted under the similar acts statute for a very limited purpose. The discussion of the narcotics evidence in final argument was intemperate and ill-advised even though the prosecutor himself, at another point in his argument, informed the jury of the limited uses of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this instance as well, however, defense counsel failed to object and request a curative instruction. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the prejudicial propensity of this brief but improper reference to narcotics could have been cured by a prompt objection and curative instruction. We therefore decline to reverse on this point, although the reference to the similar acts evidence in the .final argument is expressly disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Coleman and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> On cross-examination of Ms. Harris, defense counsel obtained the names of nine other alleged drug dealers who were said to have paid defendants with Ms. Harris acting as intermediary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> In <em>People v Davis, </em>343 Mich 348; 72 NW2d 269 (1955), we noted at page 365:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\"While we are in agreement with defense counsel that such acts if admitted may bear on intent only if the jury is first convinced that they had been perpetrated by the accused, we are of the opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the charge made this point sufficiently clear. The court charged that. proof of previous difficulties may be considered as bearing upon intent and motive. He admonished the jury that they were the sole judges of the credibility of the various witnesses. Inasmuch as defendant categorically denied all of the previous acts, it was sufficiently clear that they must disbelieve him and believe the other witnesses before considering those acts as bearing on his intent. The court further said that such acts 'may be <em>proved </em>and may be considered.\u2019 We think the defendant was adequately protected and no reversible error committed in this regard.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> A detailed instruction on the uses of the similar acts testimony was given upon the introduction of the testimony and in the jury charge. The following is an excerpt from that portion of the jury charge dealing with the similar acts testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\"Now, I say to you, ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly the law in this state that these proofs are admitted or this evidence is admitted not to show a general disposition of proximity to crime, but it is offered to show intent, motive, scheme, plan, design or system, with respect to the conspiracy or the solicitation, because both of these crimes contain the essential element of the existence of intent and agreement and an intent to solicit the commission of an offense, to solicit the payment of a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">\"Now, let me add to that language by saying too, quite emphatically though, that testimony is offered for that purpose and that alone, and you may utilize that testimony if you so choose to assist you in regard to what? the question of intent, plan, scheme, design, but not the guilt or innocence of these defendants as charged in this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\"You are to deliberate with regard to the guilt or innocence upon the charge as established in the information, as claimed in the information, you are not to deliberate upon the guilt or innocence of the defendants in connection with these other offenses which were permitted to be shown you. I say to you that this testimony is offered not as to guilt or innocence, in this case per se and in and of itself, but merely to show the existence of plan, scheme, or design. As far as this case is concerned, you are to consider the charge in the information here alone, but you may consider these other similar acts in determining whether or not there was scheme, intent, motive, you understand. All right. Again not bearing upon guilt or innocence here in this information but for the purposes I have indicated to you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> In passing upon the propriety of a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, this Court observed in <em>Allen:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\"We concede that there is little room for argument that his remarks were intemperate and perhaps better left unsaid. But under all the circumstances we cannot say that they were fatally prejudicial or entirely without provocation. Criminal trials are not basket luncheons, and we seem faintly to recall that in our experience opposing lawyers rarely if ever pelted each other with rose petals. In any case, counsel for defendants cannot on his side be allowed great latitude to goad and provoke adverse comment or criticism from the prosecutor and then seek a reversal because his strategy succeeded. When opposing counsel makes accusations and creates inferences of unfairness and unprofessional conduct against the prosecution, he is scarcely in a position to ask a reversal because of equally intemperate language used in reply. To permit that would be to award victory to those criminal defendants retaining the best 'needier\u2019. Under the circumstances presented here we must hold that this ground of error is without merit.

I don\u2019t think so and I don\u2019t think you think so either.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\"First, let me say this, we have been talking rather casually. I think too casually about dope and about dope dealers. When we have mentioned dope at this trial we are talking about narcotics, about heroin. Heroin is that substance which is corrupting our society. Heroin is that substance which is destroying our children. I think it is important for you to appreciate the significance of what we have been talking about at this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">\"Now, the testimony that has been presented to you shows that both these men spent a lot of time with Betty Harris, one of them said 10 or 15 buys, the other couldn\u2019t remember.

This testimony was nominally offered to show that, in soliciting a bribe from Broadnax, Duncan and McIntosh acted with felonious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial judge ruled that the solicitation and receipt of protection money from drug dealers were acts similar to the solicitation of money, from a suspected fence for the wrongful return of property,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that Harris\u2019 testimony was admissible under the \"similar acts\u201d statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to characterize Duncan\u2019s and McIntosh\u2019s intent in soliciting a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">My colleague agrees, on narrower grounds, that the similar acts evidence was admissible: \"By pleading not guilty and disputing intent by their proofs at trial, defendants placed their intent in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">A plea of not guilty does not in itself justify th\u00e9 admission of similar acts evidence on the issue of intent. If it did, similar acts evidence would always be admissible because criminal intent, <em>mens rea, </em>is an essential element in all felony prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Similar acts are admissible to prove criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>intent only where the defendant\u2019s intent cannot readily be inferred from the evidence probative of the other elements of the offense or where the defendant concedes the act was committed but claims it was committed without felonious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The intent of one who solicits a bribe is not equivocal; felonious intent is readily inferred from the act of solicitation. There is no need, as part of the people\u2019s case-in-chief, to characterize such an act with evidence of other unlawful solicitations to clarify the solicitor\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Duncan and McIntosh did not \"dispute\u201d \"by their proofs\u201d or otherwise the intent of the asserted solicitation; rather, they denied that they solicited Broadnax. The disputed issue was not the intent with which the act was committed but whether it was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Duncan and McIntosh did not concede the act of solicitation and assert as a defense that their purpose was to entice or detect wrongdoing and their intent was therefore innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The trial judge did not indicate any awareness that he could, in the exercise of discretion, exclude the similar acts evidence if he concluded that its unfair prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value. He did not exercise his discretion to exclude the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">As a result of the admission of the similar acts evidence, the primary evidentiary focus became whether Duncan and McIntosh had accepted protection money from dope dealers. The charged offense, solicitation of a bribe from Broadnax, was submerged in a plethora of charges and unsubstantiated innuendo regarding the uncharged \"ongoing\u201d conspiracy to accept protection money from dope dealers and an array of charges that Duncan and McIntosh had received bribes from a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of dope dealers years before on dates and occasions that Harris \u2014 who supplied the <em>only </em>evidence tending to show that any such bribe had been solicited or paid \u2014 could only vaguely or not at all recall. In this connection, Duncan and McIntosh were cross-examined extensively concerning their life styles, personal expenditures and general performance as police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Duncan and McIntosh did not receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It is long-established judicial policy that evidence tending to show that the accused committed an offense not charged in the information is not admissible for the purpose of showing his criminal disposition, or a character trait or propensity to commit that offense to support an inference that he committed the charged offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The United States Supreme Court, conceding that character is relevant and the \"admitted probative value\u201d of character evidence, has said that the \"inquiry\u201d is rejected because \"it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge\u201d. <em>Michelson v United States, </em>335 US 469, 475-476; 69 S Ct 213; 93 L Ed 168 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has said that \"it is clear that the problem is not a simple evidentiary one, but rather goes to the fundamental fairness and justice of the trial itself\u2019. \"[T]he rule is primarily a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>rule of exclusion\u201d and \"although there are many exceptions, these do not detract from the general exclusionary approach which the rule demands\u201d.

A police officer who offers to accept a bribe may be enticing or detecting. Nevertheless, the sexual act, the acts of cutting with a knife, performing an abortion and soliciting a bribe speak so unequivocally regarding the actor\u2019s intent that, absent a claim that the intent was innocent, evidence of similar acts is not admissible to characterize intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">While <em>payment or acceptance of money </em>may be ambiguous or equivocal, and a bribe solicitation might be couched in ambiguous language, the act of <em>soliciting a bribe </em>in unambiguous language is not equivocal. There is no suggestion that any money was paid by Broadnax to Duncan and McIntosh or that there was any ambiguity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>language used to transmit the bribe solicitation to Broadnax which might have justified the admission of extrinsic evidence to clarify Harris\u2019 or Duncan\u2019s and McIntosh\u2019s meaning and, indeed, the similar acts evidence was not offered or received for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Reliance on <em>People v Johnston, </em>328 Mich 213, 231; 43 NW2d 334 (1950), is therefore misplaced.

See <em>Crinnian v United States, </em>1 F2d 643, 645 (CA 6, 1924); <em>United States v DeCicco, supra. </em>There could be no concern that if the jury believed the testimony that Duncan and McIntosh solicited a bribe it might nevertheless acquit them because it entertained a reasonable doubt regarding the intent with which the solicitation was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In <em>Crinnian, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction of a prohibition agent for soliciting and accepting a bribe on the ground that evidence he had previously engaged in or promoted transactions involving violations of the prohibition act should not have been admitted. The court declared that \"former conduct\u201d involving a violation of the prohibition act might be relevant on the element of intent \"where an established fact permitted ambiguity as to intent, as where the taking of money by a prohibition agent <em>might be enticing or might be detecting. </em>There is no such issue here. Either Crinnian asked for and took the money, and is guilty, or he did neither, and is innocent. The <em>relative credibility </em>of Crinnian and Stinson <em>was the issue. </em>Proof that Crinnian had formerly violated the Prohibition Act could have no bearing on the issue, except by showing that he had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>'criminal mind,\u2019 and this is the very inference that the common law calls irrelevant.\u201d <em>Crinnian v United States, supra, </em>p 645 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The act of solicitation being unequivocal, there was no need to admit evidence of similar acts to characterize the intent with which the act was committed; the evidence \"was wholly unnecessary to show intent\u201d. <em>People v Minney, supra, </em>p 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">My colleague\u2019s conclusion that \"the evidence of the four principal witnesses showed the discussions and apparent <em>agreement </em>to return the property for $800\u201d (emphasis supplied) is contradicted by the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u2014Harris testified that Duncan and McIntosh offered to return the property to Broadnax for $1000, that she transmitted counter-offers from Broadnax for lesser amounts and that <em>no </em>agreement was reached because Duncan and McIntosh sought more than Broadnax would pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u2014Broadnax testified that he had such conversations with Harris and a telephone conversation with Duncan regarding the payment of $800 but that <em>no </em>agreement was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">\u2014Duncan and McIntosh testified that Harris told them that Broadnax would be willing to pay $1000 for the return of the property, that because they had found her to be irresponsible (see fn 3) they did not take her seriously, that McIntosh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>subsequently reported the conversation to his superior, Lt. Reid,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> who suggested that they meet with Broadnax to see <em>if </em>he would make a bribe offer; when they did meet with him he did <em>not </em>make an offer. It was Duncan\u2019s and McIntosh\u2019s testimony, in sum, that they had no conversation at any time with Broadnax regarding payment of a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Not only does the record establish that there was no \"agreement\u201d for the return of the pr\u00f3perty, Duncan and McIntosh were not charged in the information with entering into an agreement to accept a bribe nor did the people seek to prove such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Duncan and McIntosh did not place their intent in issue by simply admitting that they had conversations with Harris and Broadnax and that the conversations with Harris concerned payment of a bribe. The conflict in the testimony over whether Duncan and McIntosh solicited a bribe or Harris approached them does not indicate that the intent of the alleged solicitation was equivocal or that Duncan and McIntosh disputed their intent; it shows only that there is uncertainty and dispute regarding the time, place and substance of the conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Evidence of Duncan\u2019s and McIntosh\u2019s asserted propensity to commit a particular \"sort\u201d of offense<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> was not admissible for the purpose of resolving the issues of credibility underlying the uncertainty and dispute regarding the conversations \u2014 such evidence was not admissible to make it appear more likely that Duncan and McIntosh initiated bribe conversations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Just as similar acts evidence is not admissible to show intent unless intent is in dispute, neither is it admissible to show \"defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing the act\u201d unless such evidence tends to prove a disputed element of the offense or negative a defense:<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\"Motive, intent, absence of mistake, plan, and identity are not really all on the same plane.

They did not intimate, let alone claim, that they \"went along with [the scheme] so as to catch Mr. Broadnax in a crime\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u2014On direct examination neither Duncan nor McIntosh asserted that they had met with Broadnax to discuss payment of a bribe or entice him into making a bribe offer. On direct McIntosh said only that Lt. Reid asked him to meet with Broadnax to see if he would make an offer; he did not claim that he had followed through on Reid\u2019s request or met with Broadnax for that purpose. It was the prosecutor who brought out on cross-examination that Duncan and McIntosh had met with Broadnax and that Broadnax did not make an offer. On direct Duncan did not advert to the matter at all and, likewise, on cross-examination testified that Broadnax made no offer when they met. Thus, neither on direct nor cross-examination did they claim that they made any suggestion or offer, enticing or otherwise, to Broadnax.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">My colleague\u2019s statement <em>\"[bjefore </em>any proofs were offered, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement informed the jury that 'our testimony will show along with the prosecution\u2019s testimony that there was talk of a bribe\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied) suggests that the opening statement \"opened the door\u201d to the similar acts evidence. In neither his opening statement nor his closing argument, however, did defense counsel intimate in the slightest an enticement defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The record shows that \"our testimony\u201d related to conversations with Harris in which she indicated Broadnax\u2019 willingness to pay a bribe rather than enticing offers from Duncan and McIntosh. It also shows that the prosecutor offered similar acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>evidence at the preliminary examination. It further shows that during his opening statement and in argument and colloquy with the court \"before\u201d defense counsel\u2019s opening statement the prosecutor said he would offer similar acts evidence at the trial. The similar acts evidence came in through the testimony of Harris as part of the people\u2019s case-in-chief and was not offered in response to an enticement defense or any other defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The prosecutor did not, at the trial, contend that similar acts evidence was being offered to respond to an \"anticipated\u201d enticement defense. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said that it was \"not impressed\u201d by the prosecution\u2019s belated attempt to justify the admission of similar acts evidence on the ground \"of obviating in advance\u201d a defense under the circumstance that the evidence \"was introduced during the Government\u2019s direct case before any\u201d defense \"was delineated\u201d. <em>United States v DeCicco, supra, </em>p 484.

In evaluating these questions it is noteworthy that Lt.

He argued the ineffectiveness of Duncan\u2019s and McIntosh\u2019s efforts to reduce the narcotics problem in Inkster: \"Did and do the names Duncan and McIntosh strike terror into the hearts of the dope dealers in Inkster?

At the time of trial she was in a methadone program and Broadnax was on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Harris\u2019 unsubstantiated testimony of \"similar\u201d acts and the innuendo of the life style and professional record questioning diverted attention from the quality of the people\u2019s evidence on the charged offense to whether Duncan and McIntosh were good police officers.
