Gillis, is before the Court on appeal from the State Bar Grievance Board\u2019s affirmance of a 60-day suspension of his privilege to practice law, ordered by the hearing panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The State Bar Grievance Administrator charged and the hearing panel concluded that Mr. Gillis violated Canon 1, DR 1-102(A), subds (1), (3), and (6), of the Code of Professional Responsibility,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> State Bar Rule 15, \u00a7 2(1)-2(5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and State Bar Grievance Board Rule 16.17.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The State Bar Grievance Board affirmed the hearing panel order suspending Mr. Gillis for 60 days and assessing him costs of $77.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Mr. Gillis\u2019 1975 jury conviction of willful failure to file an income tax return, a Federal misdemeanor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> served as the impetus for the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Before the hearing panel, Mr. Gillis contested neither his conviction nor the fact that Grievance Board Rule 16.18 permits suspension because his conviction is \"punishable by imprisonment for a term of one year or more\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, in mitigation, he testified that his conviction involved no moral turpitude, was unfairly obtained, and was occasioned by certain mental and personality problems which did not affect his law practice adversely and which he is presently attempting to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Before the board, appellant reasserted these arguments and added the following three issues that he also presents to us on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">(1) Whether conviction of willful failure to file a tax return should be a basis for disciplinary action against an attorney;</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">(2) Whether Rule 16.18 denies attorneys who are not judges equal protection of the law;</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">(3) Whether appellant\u2019s conviction was obtained unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Defendant\u2019s principal argument, and the only one his attorney advanced at oral argument, is that an attorney\u2019s conviction of a crime not involving moral turpitude does not bear on his ability to deal wisely and ethically with the public and therefore should not be a basis for disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>action against the attorney. Because defendant\u2019s conviction does not involve moral turpitude,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and because the grievance administrator chose to rely solely on the fact of the conviction without introducing evidence of any surrounding or aggravating circumstances, defendant maintains that his suspension is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In both <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Lewis, </em>389 Mich 668; 209 NW2d 203 (1973) <em>(Lewis I), </em>and <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Lewis, </em>394 Mich 224; 229 NW2d 316 (1975) <em>(Lewis II), </em>we approved the board\u2019s invocation of Rule 16.18 in support of a suspension of an attorney because of his conviction of willful failure to file an income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In <em>Lewis I, </em>we observed that the rule has \"an important expediting function\u201d in relieving \"the administrator of the burden of establishing actionable misconduct under Rule 15, \u00a7 2(5), against an attorney convicted of a serious crime\u201d. 389 Mich 677. We said that the use of the rule \"does not require independent proof of misconduct; the fact of conviction alone establishes the administrator\u2019s case\u201d. 389 Mich 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\"><em>Lewis II </em>answers Mr. Gillis\u2019 contention that his 60-day suspension is too severe. There we ruled that a three-month suspension was not excessive for conviction of willful failure to file an income tax return. We note, also, that this is not appellant\u2019s first violation. He was previously convicted, on his plea of nolo contendere, of willfully failing to file income tax returns for the years 1956, 1957 and 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The foremost concern of Rule 16.18 is protection of the public.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, important ancillary con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>cerns of the rule include protection of the \"courts, and the legal profession\u201d. <em>Lewis I, supra, </em>677. Commentators have said that the \"legal profession\u2019s greatest asset has to be the confidence and respect of the society which it serves\u201d. Stoddard &amp; Stutsman, <em>Income Tax Offenses by Lawyers: An Ethical Problem, </em>58 ABA J 842 (1972). Disciplinary measures for nonprofessional misconduct evidenced by conviction of failure to file an income tax return, whether or not the crime is considered to involve moral turpitude, are necessary to maintain the integrity of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Appellant also argues that he was denied equal protection under the law because the court rules provide different treatment of the lawyer who is a judge and a lawyer who is not a judge. Mr. Gillis notes that Rule 16.18 provides for discipline of a lawyer for conviction of a crime punishable by imprisonment of one year or more, even though the crime may be a misdemeanor. This punishment differs, appellant contends, from punishment of a judge, who can only be disciplined for conviction of a felony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant cites GCR 1963, 932.4(b)(i) in support of his latter contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\"A judge shall be deemed guilty of misconduct in office if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\"(i) He is hereafter convicted in the United States of conduct which is punishable as a felony under the laws of Michigan or Federal Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We find appellant\u2019s argument lacking because GCR 1963, 932.4(b)(i) refers only to acts which \"shall be deemed\u201d to constitute misconduct. It does not preclude the Judicial Tenure Commission from finding in a particular case that a judge who willfully fails to file his income tax return is guilty of misconduct justifying discipline. Canon 2(B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct states that a \"judge should respect and observe the law\u201d and GCR 1963, 932.4(d) provides that conduct in violation of that code \"may constitute misconduct in office\u201d or other conduct warranting discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that his conviction was obtained unfairly because, first, he was probably the victim of discriminatory prosecution because of his status as an attorney and, second, he was denied due process in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals because of that Court\u2019s affirmance of his conviction with a summary opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Appellant argued these and other issues before the Federal appellate courts. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v Gillis, </em>538 F2d 330 (CA 6, 1976), <em>cert den, </em>429 US 1023 (1976). We are not inclined to engage in collateral review of those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Apc\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">In conclusion, we are satisfied that the record supports the panel\u2019s findings that appellant\u2019s conviction violated Rules 15, \u00a7 2(5) and 16.18, and that the violations warranted the disciplinary action imposed. We do not reach the propriety of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>panel\u2019s finding that Mr. Gillis\u2019 conviction also constituted violations of DR 1-102(A), subds (1), (3), and (6) and State Bar Rule 15, \u00a7 2(1)-2(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Affirmed.
