The goal of the no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses. The Legislature believed this goal could be most effectively achieved through a system of <em>compulsory </em>insurance, whereby every Michigan motorist would be required to purchase no-fault insurance or be unable to operate a motor vehicle legally in this state. Under this system, victims of motor vehicle accidents would receive insurance benefits for their injuries as a substitute for their common-law remedy in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><em>The No-Fault Act, insofar as it provides bene\u00f1ts to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to \"fault\u201d (as a substitution for tort remedies which are, in part, abolished), constitutionally accomplishes its goal. </em>After intense scrutiny of this litigation\u2019s extensive record, this Court holds that the No-Fault Act does not exceed the traditional scope of the Legislature\u2019s police power. The partial abolition of tort remedies under the act is consistent with constitutional principles articulated by this Court. The act\u2019s personal injury protection insurance scheme, with its comprehensive and expeditious benefit system, reasonably relates to the evidence advanced at trial that under the tort liability system the doctrine of contributory negligence denied benefits to a high percentage of motor vehicle accident victims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were undercompensated, long payment delays were commonplace, the court system was overburdened, and those with low income and little education suffered discrimination. See Part V, <em>infra. </em>Likewise, the act\u2019s property damage protection scheme reasonably relates to the valid public purposes of creating an incentive to build safer motor vehicles, encouraging group rates, and reducing costs by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>eliminating the necessity of accident \"fault\u201d investigation. See Part VI, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">However, while the No-Fault Act is, in theory, a valid, rational response to problems affecting the general welfare, <em>the actual mechanisms for protecting the welfare of individual Michigan motorists, required by law to purchase no-fault insurance, are constitutionally de\u00f1cient in failing to provide due process. </em>The Legislature, in the No-Fault Act and other sections of the Insurance Code, recognized the significance of a motorist\u2019s interest in the registration and operation of a motor vehicle on Michigan streets and highways. Measures were taken to assure that compulsory no-fault insurance in Michigan would be available to motorists at fair and equitable rates. These measures are, unfortunately, inadequate to protect individual motorists, who must purchase no-fault insurance from private insurers, from potentially unfair insurance rates, insurance refusal or cancellation. In particular, under the No-Fault Act and the Insurance Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">1. The statutory protection against \"excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d rates is without the support of clarifying rules established by the Commissioner of Insurance, without legislatively sufficient definition, and without any history of prior court interpretation; the legislative mandate is thus reduced to mere exhortation (see Part III-B[1] <em>infra);</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\"><em>2. </em>There are inadequate statutory provisions for a motorist attacking the validity of an individual rating decision (see Part III-B[1] <em>infra);</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">3. There is no adequate statutory provision permitting an individual to challenge insurance refusal, discriminatory cancellation, or assignment to the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d with its presumptively higher rates (see Part III-B[2] <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The constitutional status of the No-Fault Act places this Court in an extraordinary jurisprudential position: the No-Fault Act, which has substantially affected every Michigan motorist, every insurance company underwriting motor vehicle insurance in Michigan, and our entire system of civil justice for nearly five years, is constitutional in its general thrust but unconstitutionally deficient in its mechanisms for assuring that compulsory no-fault insurance is available to Michigan motorists at fair and equitable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">\n<em>We therefore believe it necessary, for purposes of the general jurisprudence, the general welfare of the public and the administration of justice, to hold that the No-Fault Act will remain in effect for 18 months from the issuance of this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">During this period, the Legislature and the Commissioner of Insurance can remedy the act\u2019s deficiencies by taking necessary constitutional corrective action assuring that compulsory no-fault insurance is available at fair and equitable rates. The types of corrective actions necessary to remedy the act\u2019s due process deficiencies are set out in Part III-C of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Toward the end of this period, this Court will reexamine the status of the No-Fault Act to determine whether the present constitutional deficiencies have been remedied. At that time, an appropriate order reflecting the act\u2019s constitutional status will be entered by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Prior to October 1, 1973, the effective date of the No-Fault Act, 11 named plaintiffs in their own behalf and as representatives of several classes of other persons initiated this action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Insurance, and 25 named automobile insurers as representatives of the entire automobile insurance industry in Michigan. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the No-Fault Act and an injunction against the act\u2019s enforcement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs initially had sought a temporary injunction against enforcement of the act. This relief had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">An amended complaint was then filed, pursuant to an order of the trial court, on December 6, 1973, adding Michigan\u2019s Attorney General as a defendant. Additionally, the following amendments were made: one named plaintiff was dropped and eight others were added as named plaintiffs; and the assertion of rights to declaratory and injunctive relief were added on behalf of five of the named plaintiffs as property taxpayers, pursuant to GCR 1963, 201.2(3). Two of the defendant insurers, Allstate Insurance Company and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, filed cross-complaints, challenging the constitutionality of the act\u2019s property damage protection insurance scheme, \u00a7\u00a7 3121, 3123, 3125 and 3127.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Pursuant to GCR 1963, 301.6, Judge Horace W. Gilmore was assigned to conduct all matters preliminary to trial and to try the case. Preliminary and final pretrial conferences were conducted on four days during November and December 1973. At these conferences the parties identified legal and factual issues to be tried and stipulated to facts which were undisputed. The pretrial statement issued at the conclusion of the conferences was subsequently amended on several occasions before trial to include additional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Judge Gilmore ably and commendably conducted the trial, which occupied 35 trial days, from January 14 to March 21, 1974. The parties were given every opportunity for argument; the trial record includes over 5,000 pages of transcript and over 200 exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">On May 20, 1974 Judge Gilmore filed a learned and thoughtful opinion of over 100 pages. The court held that plaintiffs had standing to raise every constitutional objection they asserted pursuant to the \"taxpayers\u2019 suit\u201d rule, and statute (GCR 1963, 201.2[3]; MCL 600.2041; MSA 27A.2041), and the declaratory judgment rule (GCR 1963, 521.1). The court also held that the No-Fault Act did not significantly infringe or penalize plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional \"right to travel\u201d. The court held constitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u00a7 3101(1), which requires the purchase of no-fault insurance as a condition precedent to registration and operation of a motor vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">the penalties imposed for non-compliance with the act\u2019s compulsory insurance requirement (\u00a7 3102[2]);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">the act\u2019s personal injury protection insurance scheme;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">the limitation of $1,000 for no-fault funeral and burial expenses (\u00a7 3107);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">the classification between workers in the home and workers outside the home in terms of maximum benefits payable in case of injury (\u00a7 3107);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-10\">the delegation of authority to the Commissioner of Insurance to approve deductibles as provided in \u00a7 3109a of the act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">\u00a7 3102(1), which requires that nonresident motorists maintain no-fault insurance when in Michigan for an aggregate of more than 30 days in any calendar year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-12\">\u00a7 3116 which, read in light of \u00a7 3135, can be interpreted to mean that an insurer paying personal injury insurance benefits is entitled to reimbursement from the tort recovery of an injured person to the extent that the tort recovery includes damages for losses for which personal injury insurance benefits were paid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u00a7 3114, which requires that a person who suffers accidental bodily injury while an operator or passenger of a motor vehicle engaged in the business of transporting passengers seek personal injury insurance benefits from the insurer of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The court held unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">the act\u2019s property damage protection insurance scheme;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u00a7 3101(2), which excludes two-wheel vehicles from coverage under the act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u00a7 3107(b), which requires that the cost of replacement for ordinary and necessary services be \"reasonably incurred\u201d before reimbursement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u00a7 3109(1), which requires that benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government be subtracted from personal injury insurance benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">the delegation of authority to the Commissioner of Insurance to approve deductibles as provided in \u00a7 3109(3) of the act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">\u00a7 3113, which denies injured \"transient\u201d nonresident motorists who have not purchased no-fault insurance or whose insurer has not filed a certificate in compliance with \u00a7 3163 personal injury insurance benefits and tort recovery below the threshold of \u00a7 3135(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">The court also held that the sections of the act declared unconstitutional were severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">On June 25, 1974, the trial court issued its declaratory judgment. Upon entry of this judgment, plaintiffs moved for a new trial. After a hearing, this motion was denied by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Plaintiffs and various defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">Application for leave to appeal to this Court prior to decision by the Court of Appeals was filed on August 21, 1974, by all defendants and was denied by this Court December 23, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">Thereafter, upon review of the record and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>hearing of arguments, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion November 5, 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court that the \"taxpayers\u2019 suit\u201d rule and statute, <em>supra, </em>were applicable to the instant case. 65 Mich App 355, 362; 237 NW2d 325 (1975). The Court then found plaintiffs had standing under the declaratory judgment rule, <em>supra, </em>to challenge a limited number of issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The Court of Appeals held constitutional the act\u2019s personal injury protection scheme (affirming the trial court), 65 Mich App 355, 365-367, and the act\u2019s exclusion of two-wheel vehicles from compulsory no-fault coverage (overruling the trial court), 65 Mich App 355, 367-368. The Court held unconstitutional the act\u2019s property damage protection scheme (affirming the trial court), 65 Mich App 355, 368-370. The Court also held that the unconstitutional property damage protection scheme was severable. 65 Mich App 355, 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">On November 25, 1975, plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing with the Court of Appeals challenging the findings of the Court of Appeals in its opinion but, more specifically, requesting the Court of Appeals remand the case for further testimony consistent with GCR 1963, 820.1(5). Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for rehearing in the Court of Appeals was denied on December 17, 1975. On January 9, 1976, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to appeal to this Court. Leave was granted on May 27, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">A crucial threshold question concerns plaintiffs\u2019 standing to raise certain issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Plaintiffs first seek to establish standing to challenge the constitutionality of the No-Fault Act under the court rule and statute which creates a \"taxpayers\u2019 suit\u201d. GCR 1963, 201.2(3) and MCL 600.2041; MSA 27A.2041, which are identical, deal with real parties in interest. The rule and statute provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\"Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest * * * and further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\">\"3) An action to prevent the illegal expenditure of state funds or to test the constitutionality of a statute relating thereto may be brought * * * in the names of at least 5 residents of this state who own property assessed for direct taxation by the county wherein they reside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The trial court held that plaintiffs had standing under the rule and statute to raise every constitutional objection they asserted. The Court of Appeals reversed, declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\"We disagree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the court rule provides a basis for plaintiffs\u2019 suit. Plaintiffs are not concerned with the illegal expenditure of state funds. The court rule allows taxpayers aggrieved by the outlay of state funds to hurdle the traditional standing obstacle in taxpayers suits. We do not read it as permitting a group to challenge any legislation merely because of an incidental expenditure of state funds; almost all legislation involves some public spending. GCR 1963, 201.2(3) is inapplicable to this litigation.\u201d 65 Mich App 355, 362.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">We agree. The No-Fault Act does not, on its face, contemplate the \"expenditure of state funds\u201d. We do not believe that the \"taxpayers\u2019 suit\u201d rule and statute is intended to give plaintiffs standing to \"test the constitutionality\u201d of an entire act when the expenditure of funds alleged is incidental to its implementation. Compare <em>Hertel v Racing Commissioner, 68 </em>Mich App 191; 242 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>526 (1976); <em>Jones v Racing Commissioner, </em>56 Mich App 65; 223 NW2d 367 (1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Alternatively, both plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs seek to establish standing under the GCR 1963, 521.1 declaratory judgment rule. GCR 1963, 521.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">\"In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, any circuit court of this state may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking a declaratory judgment, whether or not relief is or could be sought or granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The declaratory judgment rule was intended and has been liberally construed to provide a broad, flexible remedy with a view to making the courts more accessible to the people. 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), Committee Comment, p 683; <em>Comm\u2019r of Revenue v Grand Trunk WR Co, </em>326 Mich 371, 375; 40 NW2d 188 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The existence of an \"actual controversy\u201d is a condition precedent to invocation of declaratory relief. In general, \"actual controversy\u201d exists where a declaratory judgment or decree is necessary to guide a plaintiffs future conduct in order to preserve his legal rights. <em>Updegraff v Attorney General, </em>298 Mich 48, 52; 298 NW 400 (1941); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Flint v Consumers Power Co, </em>290 Mich 305, 309-310; 287 NW 475 (1939); see, also, <em>Welfare Employees Union v Civil Service Comm, </em>28 Mich App 343, 350-351; 184 NW2d 247 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">This requirement of an \"actual controversy\u201d prevents a court from deciding hypothetical issues. However, a court is not precluded from reaching issues before actual injuries or losses have occurred. <em>Merkel v Long, </em>368 Mich 1, 11-14; 117 NW2d 130 (1962). Also, before affirmative declaratory relief can be granted, it is essential that a plaintiff, at a minimum, pleads facts entitling him to the judgment he seeks and proves each fact alleged, <em>i.e., </em>a plaintiff must allege and prove an actual <em>justiciable </em>controversy. See <em>Kuhn v East Detroit, </em>50 Mich App 502; 213 NW2d 599 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Therefore, what is essential to an \"actual controversy\u201d under the declaratory judgment rule is that plaintiffs plead and prove facts which indicate an adverse interest necessitating the sharpening of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The five plaintiffs who testified at trial all owned an automobile. Two had purchased no-fault insurance and three had not. One of the plaintiffs who had purchased no-fault insurance, Melvin Janasevich, testified that he was a retiree with no work income who cares for his paralyzed, wheelchair-confined wife. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint names three persons who are \"motorcycle owners and operators\u201d; defendants\u2019 answer admits the status of these plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, it was undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>on the record that the cross-plaintiff insurance companies who challenge the validity of the property damage provisions of the No-Fault Act were required to issue insurance policies in compliance with the act if they wished to continue to underwrite in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">This Court deeply appreciates that the No-Fault Act, in radically redefining the nature of Michigan\u2019s motor vehicle insurance, profoundly and importantly affects a crucial dimension of our lives. We are also aware that the constitutionality of this act has been in question since this action was commenced in August, 1973. In light of the record and our belief that plaintiffs, cross-plaintiffs, and the people of the State of Michigan deserve as definitive a decision on the challenges to the No-Fault Act as judiciously can be afforded within the parameters of the above stated rules for declaratory relief, we hold that plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs have established standing under GCR 1963, 521.1 to raise the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">1) whether \u00a7 3101, which requires registrants and operators of motor vehicles to maintain compulsory personal injury protection insurance, property protection damage insurance, and residual liability insurance, is constitutional;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">2) whether the act\u2019s personal injury protection insurance scheme violates the due process and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 17;

This legislation goes beyond a grant of a monopoly or an attempt to regulate a utility; there exists \"a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the [regulated entity] may fairly be treated as that of the State itself\u2019. <em>Jackson v Metropolitan Edison Co, supra, </em>419 US 345, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The interest of plaintiffs that is affected by compulsory no-fault insurance is not a previously recognized common-law or constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>This Court, however, has recognized that the concepts of \"liberty\u201d and \"property\u201d protected by due process \"are not to be defined in a narrow or technical sense but are to be given broad application\u201d. <em>Bundo v Walled Lake, </em>395 Mich 679, 690; 238 NW2d 154 (1976).

J. Kaufman, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>A driver\u2019s license, once issued, is a significant interest subject to constitutional due process protections. <em>Bell v Burson, </em>402 US 535, 539; 91 S Ct 1586; 29 L Ed 2d 90 (1971). Although the compulsory insurance requirement of the No-Fault Act does not directly affect the issuance of a driver\u2019s license, it directly affects the use of such a license: a licensee may not register or operate a motor vehicle in Michigan without no-fault insurance. A driver\u2019s license is, clearly, of little use unless a licensee can register and operate a motor vehicle. We believe that the interest in registering and operating a motor vehicle is as significant as the interest in the use of a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In choosing to make no-fault insurance compulsory for all motorists, the Legislature has made the registration and operation of a motor vehicle inexorably dependent on whether no-fault insurance is available at fair and equitable rates. Consequently due process protections under the Michigan and United States Constitutions (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17; US Const, Am XIV) are operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The Legislature has, additionally, fostered the expectation that no-fault insurance will be available at fair and equitable rates. Section 2403(1)(d) of the Insurance Code states that \"Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d, MCL 500.2403(1)(d); MSA 24.12403(1)(d); \u00a7 3301(1)(a) of the Insurance Code provides the \"guarantee\u201d that no-fault insurance coverage \"will be available to any person who is unable to procure such insurance through ordinary methods\u201d. MCL 500.3301(1)(a); MSA 24.13301(1)(a).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>We therefore conclude that Michigan motorists are constitutionally entitled to have no-fault insurance made available on a fair and equitable basis. The availability of no-fault insurance and the no-fault insurance rate regulatory scheme are, accordingly, subject to due process scrutiny.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">(1) In scrutinizing the statutory scheme for regulating insurance companies\u2019 underwriting and rate-making practices, we must look beyond the No-Fault Act itself to other provisions of the Insurance Code, including the Uniform Trade Practices Act, MCL 500.2400 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.12400 <em>et seq., </em>and MCL 500.2001 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.12001 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Under the present regulatory scheme, rates and rate-making factors are proposed and supporting material is filed by private insurance companies. MCL 500.2406; MSA 24.12406. The Commissioner of Insurance may approve or reject the proposed rates and rate-making factors. If he takes no action within 30 days, however, \"the filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter\u201d. MCL 500.2408; MSA 24.12408.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">An alternative method for filing provides that an insurance company can specify the date upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>which the rate becomes effective. The Commissioner of Insurance then has 15 days within which to act on that filing. If the filing is not disapproved within 15 days of the filing, \"the filing shall be deemed to be approved\u201d. MCL 500.2430; MSA 24.12430.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The Insurance Code also provides that rating plans may measure any differences among risks that <em>may </em>have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. However, such rates shall not be \"excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d. MCL 500.2403; MSA 24.12403. See, also, MCL 500.2027; MSA 24.12027.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Manuals pertaining to classifications, rules and rates, rate plans and every modification of any of the foregoing must be filed with the Commissioner of Insurance. MCL 500.2406; MSA 24.12406.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The no-fault insurance rate classifications adopted by the insurance industry are allegedly the result of competition, not the governmental process. Private insurance companies are, and should be, primarily concerned with making a profit, while providing a public service.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We also recognize that it is within the Legislature\u2019s authority to prescribe that rates shall be primarily set by competition in the marketplace. However, due process, at a minimum, requires that rates are not, in fact, \"excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d and, further, that persons affected have notice as to how their rates are determined and an adequate remedy regarding that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Although the Legislature has provided some due process protection, significant deficiencies remain. First, the entire rate structure is suspect. The statutory stricture against \"excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d rates is without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>support of clarifying rules established by the Commissioner, without legislatively sufficient definition, and without any history of prior court interpretation. The legislative due process mandate is thus reduced to mere exhortation. When we add that the statute authorizes insurers to utilize any classification scheme which \"may measure any differences among risks that <em>may </em>have a <em>probable </em>effect on losses or expenses\u201d (emphasis added), it becomes clear that rates can be established on insubstantial bases which do not satisfy due process.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Absent administrative rules or legislative definition giving substance to the statutory language, there are inadequate safeguards against arbitrary action or invidious discrimination. Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, \u00a7 6.13 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Second, the present system of rate regulation denies due process to the motorist attacking the validity of a rate. Filings and supporting information submitted by insurers are open to public inspection only after the filing becomes effective. MCL 500.2406; MSA 24.12406. This certainly is questionable due process. Also, under the Insurance Code, if a complainant, upon administrative review, can convince the Commissioner of Insurance that a filed rate does not meet the statutory requirements, the Commissioner will determine that \"within a reasonable period thereafter, such filing shall be deemed no longer effective\u201d. MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>500.2420; MSA 24.12420. This leaves the complainant with the unacceptable choice of paying the invalid rate from the date of the effective filing until the subsequent date when the filing is no longer effective or taking the risk of not having insurance. This is certainly not due process.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">(2) In scrutinizing the statutory scheme affecting the availability of no-fault insurance, we again look beyond the No-Fault Act itself to the Insurance Code, Chapter 20, the Uniform Trade Practices Act, MCL 500.2001 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.12001 <em>et seq., </em>and Chapter 33, the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d (or \"assigned risk plan\u201d), MCL 500.3301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13301 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Under \u00a7 2027 of the Uniform Trade Practices Act, the Legislature statutorily defines \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance\u201d as including \"[Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure * * * an individual\u201d for a number of patently discriminatory reasons. MCL 500.2027; MSA 24.12027.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In establishing the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d, the Legislature expressly provided \"the guarantee that automobile insurance coverage will be available to any person who is unable to procure such insurance through ordinary methods\u201d. MCL 500.3301(1)(a); MSA 24.13301(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">However, although \u00a7 2027 of the Uniform Trade Practices Act attempts, through the good offices of the Commissioner of Insurance, to protect from discrimination a motorist who is refused no-fault insurance or whose no-fault insurance is cancelled, the act does not provide such motorists with an individual legal remedy for challenging an alleged discriminatory basis for the refusal or cancellation.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <em>Wolff v McDonnell, </em>418 US 539, 557-558; 94 S Ct 2963; 41 L Ed 2d 935 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Furthermore, a motorist placed in the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d and classified as an \"assigned risk\u201d is subject to a statutory presumption that the rates charged will be higher than the rates for motorists in the open marketplace. MCL 500.3365; MSA 24.13365. In addition, a motorist insured by the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d is exposed to the procedural and substantive made-, quacies of the facility\u2019s rate regulatory scheme (which are, essentially, the same as the inadequacies of the rate regulatory scheme for motorists able to obtain insurance from an insurance company in the marketplace). Also, this facility does not provide the same varieties of coverage options offered in the standard market. Finally, there is no statutory provision allowing such a motorist to challenge his assignment to the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d with its presumptively higher rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Therefore, although no-fault insurance may be available, motorists can be refused no-fault insurance or have their insurance cancelled without effective legal redress for challenging refusal or discriminatory Cancellation. Furthermore, motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ists can be placed into the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d without an assurance of fair and equitable rates, without an opportunity to obtain the same variety of coverage options, or without a right to challenge such placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">These deficiencies, in our opinion, most certainly deny due process.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">(3) These statutory defects as to the availability of no-fault insurance and the scheme for regulating no-fault insurance rates illustrate the inadequacies of the present statutory system of compulsory insurance but do not define what process is \"due\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">We therefore feel it necessary to identify the concerns which must be addressed in any new system for rate-regulation and \"availability\u201d, although \"[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation\u201d. <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v McElroy, </em>367 US 886, 895; 81 S Ct 1743; 6 L Ed 2d 1230 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In determining what process is \"due\u201d we consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>\" * * * First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or. substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 335; 96 S Ct 893; 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">We are concerned that a person\u2019s interest in the registration and operation of a motor vehicle may be effectively suspended by the legislative requirement that registrants and operators of motor vehicles purchase no-fault insurance as a condition to the operation of a motor vehicle if no-fault insurance is not made available on a fair and equitable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The current procedures of the Commissioner of Insurance for the promulgation of rates by insurance companies do not provide sufficient assurance that rates and rate-making factors will be substantially justified. Absent adequate procedures, there is a danger that persons similarly situated will ultimately be treated differently with respect to their recognized interest in registering and operating a motor vehicle. See Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, \u00a7 6.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">At the same time, we recognize the insurance companies\u2019 need for prompt adjustment of rates which provide adequate capitalization and the state\u2019s desire to minimize its administrative burden. We are also concerned with the availability of insurance. Individuals must have the knowledge necessary to protect themselves against erroneous or discriminatory underwriting and rate-making decisions. See <em>Fuentes v Shevin, </em>407 US 67; 92 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Ct 1983; 32 L Ed 2d 556 (1972). There must be available adequate means of redress for such errors and discrimination. See <em>Dixon v Love, </em>431 US 105; 97 S Ct 1723; 52 L Ed 2d 172 (1977). There must also be available adequate means of redress for insurance refusal, discriminatory insurance cancellation, or assignment to the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d with its presumptively higher rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">These objectives can be achieved and the procedures harmonized consistent with the due process clause in different ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\"><em>At a minimum, </em>this Court holds that no-fault insurance does not satisfy constitutional due process unless:<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">1. The Legislature and/or the Commissioner of Insurance (pursuant to his present rule-making authority, MCL 500.2484; MSA 24.12484), give substantial meaning to the statutory standards \"Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d. See MCL 500.2403; MSA 24.12403; MCL 500.3340; MSA 24.13340.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">2. A filed rate, or a rate determined on administrative or judicial review, provides and sets forth:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">a) premiums reasonable to insured and insurer for the specific insurance coverage without regard to factors assertedly warranting differences in premiums among those insured;</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">b) the factors which properly may be considered by the insurer in differentiating premiums among those insured; and</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">c) the amount of differential appropriate for each such factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>3.

Any party or person wishing to file briefs or be heard shall make timely inquiry of the Clerk as to the proper procedure.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This Court will take whatever action appears appropriate at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">During the interim period:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">1) the Legislature and the Commissioner of Insurance may take whatever action they deem necessary to remedy the due process deficiencies articulated <em>supra;</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">2) \u00a7\u00a7 3101(1) and 3101(4) of the No-Fault Act will remain in effect, <em>i.e., </em>motorists will still be required to obtain no-fault insurance as a condition precedent to the registration and operation of a motor vehicle;</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">3) the No-Fault Act\u2019s constitutionally valid provisions, as decided in this opinion and subsequent opinions, will remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Until there is legislative or agency response to the due process deficiencies articulated <em>supra, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Commissioner of Insurance shall actively enforce the present regulatory scheme in the spirit of our opinion in order to assure the availability of no-fault insurance at fair and equitable rates during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">We also add that all rights accrued by individuals against their insurers or against the \"Automobile Placement Facility\u201d until the order in this case is entered remain valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Although we have held the No-Fault Act\u2019s \"compulsory insurance requirement\u201d unconstitutional because of insufficient due process protections, effective as of 18 months from the issuance of this opinion, we again emphasize our concurrent holding that \"[d]uring the interim period * * * the No-Fault Act\u2019s constitutionally valid provisions, as decided in this opinion and subsequent opinions, will remain in effect\u201d. Accordingly, we now address the remaining issues in this case properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">All the remaining issues involve due process and equal protection challenges to various statutory schemata of the No-Fault Act. At bottom, these issues are directed at the question of whether the Legislature constitutionally exercised its police power in enacting a particular statutory scheme. Because the constitutional framework employed and discussed with respect to the \"compulsory insurance requirement\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the facial due process sufficiency of the protections provided in the act and other sections of the Insurance Code for available no-fault insurance at fair and equitable rates) was, conceptually, of a different constitutional nature, it is necessary that we discuss the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>due process and equal protection tests for these remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The test to determine whether legislation enacted pursuant to the police power comports with due process is whether the legislation bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> See <em>Michigan Canners v Agricultural Board, </em>397 Mich 337, 343-344; 245 NW2d 1 (1976). The test to determine whether a statute enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>pursuant to the police power comports with equal protection is, essentially, the same. As the United States Supreme Court declared in <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture v Moreno, </em>413 US 528, 533; 93 S Ct 2821; 37 L Ed 2d 782 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">\"Under traditional equal protection analysis, a legislative classification must be sustained, if the classification itself is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d (Citations omitted.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In the application of these tests, it is axiomatic that the challenged legislative judgment is accorded a presumption of constitutionality. See <em>Michigan Canners v Agricultural Board, supra, </em>343-344. What this \"presumption of constitutionality\u201d means, in terms of challenged police power legislation, is that in the face of a due process or equal protection challenge, \"where the legislative judgment is drawn in question\u201d, a court\u2019s inquiry \"must be restricted to the issue whether any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>assumed affords support for it\u201d. <em>United States v Carolene Products Co, </em>304 US 144, 154; 58 S Ct 778; 82 L Ed 1234 (1938). A corollary to this rule is that where the legislative judgment <em>is supported by \"any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed\u201d, </em>although such facts may be \"debatable\u201d, the legislative judgment must be accepted. <em>Carolene Products Co v Thomson, </em>276 Mich 172, 178; 267 NW 608 (1936).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In accord with this axiomatic rule and its corollary a court may uphold the constitutionality of police power legislative judgments in the face of due process or equal protection challenge by taking judicial notice of indisputable, generally known or easily ascertainable facts.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> And, because the \"presumption of constitutionality\u201d is a rebuttable presumption, a party challenging the legislative judgment may attack its constitutionality in terms of purely legal arguments (if the legislative judgment is so arbitrary and irrational as to render the legislation unconstitutional on its face)<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> or may show, by bringing to the court\u2019s attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>facts which the court can judicially notice, that the legislative judgment is without rational basis.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">There are, however, instances in which police power legislative judgments cannot be affirmed or rejected on the basis of purely legal arguments or indisputable, generally known or easily ascertainable facts which can be judicially noticed. In such instances, the facts upon which the existence of a rational basis for the legislative judgment are predicated \"may properly be made the subject of judicial inquiry\u201d <em>(United States v Carolene Products, supra, </em>153). Thus, a court may require a trial so that it may establish adequate findings of facts to determine whether, on the one hand, plaintiffs have shown facts which reveal that the legislative judgment is without rational basis, or, on the other hand, whether there is <em>any </em>reasonable state of facts on the record which can be produced in support of the legislative judgment.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Such an approach is particularly necessary when the challenged police power legislation is important, complicated, novel or experimental legislation. <em>Borden\u2019s Farm Products Co, Inc v Baldwin, </em>293 US 194, 204, 210, 212; 55 S Ct 187; 79 L Ed 281 (1934). See also <em>Pinnick v Cleary, supra, </em>34-37 (Tauro, C.J., concurring). As Chief Justice Hughes declared, writing for a unanimous United States Supreme Court in <em>Borden\u2019s Co v Baldwin, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">\"[W]here the legislative action is suitably challenged, and a rational basis for it is predicated upon the particular economic facts of a given trade or industry, which are outside the sphere of judicial notice, these facts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>properly the subject of evidence and of findings. <em>With the notable expansion of the scope of governmental regulation, and the consequent assertion of violation of constitutional rights, it is increasingly important that when it becomes necessary for the Court to deal with the facts relating to particular commercial or industrial conditions, they should be presented concretely with appropriate determinations upon evidence, so that conclusions shall not be reached without adequate factual support. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 293 US 194, 210.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We believe that the No-Fault Act is substantively analogous in this respect to the legislation challenged in <em>Borden\u2019s Co v Baldwin.</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The challenged rational bases for the legislative judgments under the act are \"predicated\u201d upon complicated statistics and actuarial facts of the motor vehicle insurance \"trade\u201d or business (which have substantial economic consequences). We believe, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Borden\u2019s Co v Baldwin, </em>that the \"complexity of problems\u201d inherent in a judicial determination of whether the legislative judgments of the No-Fault Act are constitutional, \"makes it the more imperative that the Court in discharging its duty, in sustaining governmental authority within its sphere and in enforcing individual rights, shall not proceed upon false assumptions\u201d. 293 US 194, 210-211. Thus, as Justices Stone and Cardozo stated in their concurring memorandum in <em>Borden\u2019s Co v Baldwin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\"We are in accord with the view that it is inexpedient to determine grave constitutional questions upon a demurrer to a complaint, or upon an equivalent motion, if there is a reasonable likelihood that the production of evidence will make the answer to the questions clearer.\u201d 293 US 194, 213._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>This Court implicitly recognized this approach in <em>Michigan Canners v Agricultural Board, supra. </em>At issue in <em>Michigan Canners </em>were \"important questions of first impression regarding the constitutionality and construction of the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act, MCL 290.701 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 12.94(101) <em>et seq.\u201d. </em>397 Mich 337, 340. The circuit court, however, dismissed the challenge on (erroneous) jurisdictional grounds. 397 Mich 337, 342, 344-345. This Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-4\">\"As mentioned above, plaintiff has raised important questions regarding the constitutionality and construction of the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act without developing a factual record at trial which would help provide a context in which to consider these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">\"To resolve these significant issues in such a factual vacuum would be imprudent where it appears that further factual development would substantially contribute to the proper disposition of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">\"Such is the case here, especially in that Michigan Canners has claimed that the Bargaining Act is unconstitutional because it exceeds the police power of the state. This claim in particular requires full development of facts which might support or undermine the claim that the statute is an invalid exercise of the police power.\u201d 397 Mich 337, 342-343.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Therefore, in the face of due process challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>to the legislative judgments of the No-Fault Act which resulted in various statutory schemata, our task is double-edged. First, we must determine from the record before us whether plaintiffs have overcome the presumption of constitutionality by showing facts which reveal that the legislative judgment is without rational basis, or, to the same effect, we must determine from the record whether the challenged legislative judgment is supported by <em>any </em>reasonable state of facts justifying its enactment. Second, we must then determine whether the legislative response bears a reasonable relation to this identified objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Similarly, our task is double-edged in considering equal protection challenges to the No-Fault Act. First, we must determine from the record before us whether plaintiffs have overcome the presumption of constitutionality by showing facts which reveal that the legislative judgment is without rational basis or, to the same effect, we must determine from the record whether the challenged legislative judgment is supported by <em>any </em>reasonable set of facts indicating that the legislative judgment is in the exercise of a legitimate governmental interest.

The owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in Michigan must maintain security for payment of benefits under personal injury protection insurance (\u00a7 3101);</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">2. Tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use within the State of Michigan of a motor vehicle is abolished with respect to accidental bodily injury <em>except </em>for non-economic loss \"if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement\u201d (\u00a7 3135[1]), intentionally caused harm to persons (\u00a7 3135[2][a]), or damage in excess of the personal injury insurance benefits provided under the act (\u00a7 3135[2][c]). However, tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use within this state of a motor vehicle with respect to bodily injury is not abolished if the operator of the motor vehicle has not complied with the act\u2019s mandatory insurance requirements <em>(i.e., </em>if the person is uninsured) (\u00a7 3135[2]);</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">3. The owner, registrant and operator of an insured vehicle who suffers accidental motor vehicle bodily injury in Michigan or in another state, whether he suffers this injury in his own vehicle or as an occupant of another vehicle or when he is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, is entitled to personal injury protection insurance benefits. The same is true for the \"spouse and any relative\u201d of the insured who is \"domiciled in the same household\u201d as the insured (\u00a7 3114[1], see \u00a7 3110). However, an owner or registrant of a vehicle with respect to which the compulsory requirements of the act are not in effect <em>(i.e., </em>the uninsured Michigan motorist) is not entitled to personal injury protection insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In general, personal injury protection insurance under the act provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">(a) all medical costs and expenses occasioned by injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident, including expenses for rehabilitation (see \u00a7 3107[a]);</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">(b) reimbursement up to a maximum of $1,000 a month for loss of income resulting from a motor vehicle accident for a period not exceeding three years. This amount is applied pro rata for shorter periods of work loss. (This limit may be adjusted annually to keep pace with changes in the cost of living.) (\u00a7 3107[b].) Personal injury protection insurance also provides up to $1,000 for funeral and burial expenses (\u00a7 3107[a]);</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">(c) reimbursement for the cost of replacement of ordinary and necessary services \"reasonably incurred\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>reimbursement of services the injured person would have performed not for income but for his own personal benefit or the benefit of his household if these services are shown to be \"reasonably incurred\u201d. Under the act, an injured person may be reimbursed for such services up to a limit of $20 a day for a maximum period of three years. (This limit may be adjusted annually to keep pace with changes in the cost of living.) (\u00a7 3107[b].) The family of the injured person may receive the same reimbursement should the injured person die. (\u00a7 3108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">(A) <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the No-Fault Act violates due process by partially abolishing the common law remedy in tort for persons injured by negligent motor vehicle tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">As noted <em>supra, </em>the Legislature need not provide an \"adequate substitute\u201d remedy before abolishing a common-law cause of action in tort; <em>Mackin v Detroit-Timkin Axle Co, </em>187 Mich 8, 13; 153 NW 49 (1915); <em>Naudzius v Lahr, </em>253 Mich 216; 234 NW 581 (1931); <em>Silver v Silver, </em>280 US 117; 50 S Ct 57; 74 L Ed 221 (1929). The abolition of a common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tort remedy is measured by the traditional due process test, namely, whether the legislation bears a reasonable relationship to a permissible legislative objective. See discussion, Part IV, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We believe that the abolition of the tort remedy for personal injury resulting from motor vehicle accidents was clearly justified by deficiencies in the tort system.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial support the apparent legislative judgment that the tort system of reparations for automobile accident victims had several operational deficiencies:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">1. A high percentage of persons injured in automobile accidents received no reparations under the tort system (to collect damages under this system the injured person must be free of any contributory negligence and the accident must be caused by a person who is adjudged to be at fault);<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">2. Minor injuries were over-compensated and serious injuries were under-compensated;<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">3. Lengthy delays existed under the tort system in compensating those injured in automobile accidents\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>often in cases where the need for prompt compensation was strongest;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">4. The tort system imposed a heavy burden on the state\u2019s court system;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">5. The tort liability system discriminated, in terms of recovery, against the uneducated and those persons on a low income scale.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The legislative response, the enactment of the no-fault personal injury protection scheme, reasonably relates to the purpose of correcting these evils. These provisions provide, <em>inter alia, </em>for payment without regard to fault within 30 days of claim for all reasonable medical and rehabilitation expenses, for wage loss and replacement services for a period of three years, for survivor\u2019s loss of support and services for three years. Such payments may substantially compensate all personal injury victims of motor vehicle accidents for economic loss, including the victims of motor vehicle accidents, who were, under the tort system, uncompensated or undercompensated for their economic losses. Prompt payment provided for under the act may remedy the delays under the tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>system. By partially abolishing tort liability to those who suffer personal injuries as a result of motor vehicle accidents, the act may lessen the number of motor vehicle personal injury tort suits in the courts. The prompt availability of compensation for economic losses may relieve the undereducated or those with lower income from the pressure \u2014 \"legal\u201d or economic \u2014 to settle serious claims prematurely and for less than an equitable amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">For these reasons, we hold that the personal injury protection insurance scheme under the No-Fault Act, in partially abolishing the common-law remedy in tort for persons injured by negligent motor vehicle tortfeasors, does not violate the due process clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">(B) <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the No-Fault Act, by partially abolishing the common-law remedy in tort for persons injured by negligent motor vehicle tortfeasors, violates equal protection by creating two impermissible statutory classifications: (1) motor vehicle tortfeasors and their victims and all other tortfeasors and their victims; (2) victims of insured motor vehicle tortfeasors and victims of uninsured motor vehicle tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The treatment of motor vehicle tortfeasors differently from all other tortfeasors does not violate the traditional test for equal protection. Exhibits were introduced at trial to show that motor vehicle accidents have consistently and by a wide margin been the principal cause of accidental injury and death in Michigan. The State Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>reported that in 1973 approximately 360,000 motor vehicle accidents occurred, resulting in 2,215 fatalities. The legislative judgment to limit its experiment in personal injury reparation to victims of accidents involving motor vehicles is justified by the predictably frequent and serious injury to persons and property resulting from the use of motor vehicles. See <em>Williamson v Lee Optical Co, </em>348 US 483, 489; 75 S Ct 461; 99 L Ed 2d 563 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Second, the creation of two classes of motor vehicle accident victims \u2014 victims of an insured motor vehicle tortfeasor who may not sue below the threshold and victims of uninsured motor vehicle tortfeasors who may sue \u2014 does not violate equal protection. This classification, along with penalties imposed by \u00a7 3102(2) may serve as an incentive for compliance with the compulsory insurance provision because an uninsured motorist may be liable in tort for all injury suffered by the victim. <em>McKendrick v Petrucci, </em>71 Mich App 200, 207; 247 NW2d 349 (1976).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> It is significant in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>regard that the Assigned Claims Facility is required to pay benefits to persons who may be injured by uninsured motorists. MCL 500.3171 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13171 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the No-Fault Act\u2019s incidental statutory classification between victims of insured motor vehicle tortfeasors and victims of uninsured motor vehicle tortfeasors does not violate the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The third issue before us is whether the No-Fault Act\u2019s property damage protection scheme violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The features of the act\u2019s property damage insurance scheme relevant to the resolution of the due process and equal protection challenges before us are:</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">1. The owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in Michigan must maintain security for payment of benefits under property damage protection insurance (\u00a7 3101);</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">2. Tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use within the State of Michigan of a motor vehicle is abolished with respect to property damage except for intentionally caused damage to property (\u00a7 3135[2]);</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">3. Tangible (\"non-moving\u201d) property owned by a third party injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident and motor vehicles parked in such a way as not to cause unreasonable risk of damage are entitled to property damage protection insurance benefits up to $1,000,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>000 against the insurer of the motor vehicle which inflicted the damage (\u00a7\u00a7 3121, 3123[1][a]);</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The following damaged property is not entitled to property damage protection benefits: the property of the insured, including the motor vehicle, and tractor attached thereto, or any property of the insured in his motor vehicle (\u00a7 3123[1] subds [a], [b]). Also, property damage protection benefits are not payable for damage to (1) third-party motor vehicles which are parked in such a way as to cause an unreasonable risk of damage, or (2) non-vehicle property arising from out-of-state motor vehicle accidents (\u00a7 3123).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Because property damage to an insured\u2019s own motor vehicle is not covered by property protection insurance benefits, the act requires insurers to offer optional first-party collision insurance to provide an insured reimbursement for such damage if he so chooses (\u00a7 3037).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">(A) <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs contend that the No-Fault Act violates due process by abolishing the common-law remedy in tort for persons whose property is damaged by negligent motor vehicle tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Again, in resolving this due process challenge, we apply the traditional due process test, namely whether the legislation bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The trial court found, and the record tends to support its conclusion, that the weaknesses of the tort system of compensation for personal injuries suffered as a result of motor vehicle accidents<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>not affect that system\u2019s compensation of property damage. Although the switch from property damage liability coverage to collision coverage may yield some increase in the efficiency of payments, it is apparent from a review of the record that the tort system provided relatively prompt, equitable compensation for damage to property resulting from motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The analysis by the trial court and the Court of Appeals suggests that there must be an identifiable evil which the Legislature intends to correct. We do not believe this is constitutionally necessary. The Legislature is as free to experiment with other ways of dealing with a subject in the hope of making a good system better as it is to correct a perceived evil system.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The property damage section seeks to achieve several goals in addition to prompt, equitable and complete compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Testimony at trial established that the Legislature anticipated that the abolition of a tort action for property damage would have at least four major effects ultimately resulting in lower and more equitable premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">First, with the shift from liability to collision insurance resulting from the abolition of tort liability, there would be a new emphasis on the value and repairability of the insured\u2019s own motor vehicle; rates would be calculated on the basis of repair costs for that vehicle, rather than, as in liability insurance, on the potential damage to a vehicle of unknown value.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Second, an additional anticipated effect of relating premium costs to the insured\u2019s car was that this system would create incentives for safer cars.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Third, the abolition of tort liability eliminates the necessity for accident investigations, because a determination of fault is irrelevant to the payment of compensation. The elimination of such investigations, it was hoped, would result in decreased administrative costs and resultant savings on insurance premiums.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Finally, by shifting from a liability to a no-fault system which emphasizes the risk to be insured, not the exposure to some unknown third party, the Legislature anticipated that group insurance would become feasible. Group insurance has been shown to be far less expensive to administer and more likely to result in lower costs. Furthermore, this potential for group insurance may draw large life and group insurance underwriters into the automobile insurance field, resulting in beneficial competition.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The fact that these effects are not yet evident does not diminish the legitimacy of the goals</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>sought to be achieved or the reasonableness of the means adopted. At this early stage in the functioning of the No-Fault Act these long-term developments cannot yet fully be assessed. Indeed, this litigation itself, with its resulting uncertainty as to the viability of the No-Fault Act, may slow the achievement of the act\u2019s goals. Our decision in <em>Manistee Bank, supra, </em>is particularly relevant to this aspect of the case: it is precisely because regulation in the economic field often deals with long-term developments that the Court treats such legislation with great deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs emphasize that fault investigations have continued under the No-Fault Act. But that fact is not at this point a relevant consideration.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Those investigations may be merely vestigial.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Similarly, plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>size the increase in collision premiums resulting from the enactment of No-Fault. Whether or not there has been such an increase and whatever the cause, the important consideration for this Court at this point is to determine whether there existed a permissible legislative objective reasonably related to the statute. We find that the No-Fault Act\u2019s property damage protection scheme meets this test and, accordingly, hold the property damage protection scheme does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">(B) <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs contend that the No-Fault Act violates equal protection by creating the following statutory classifications: (1) damage to vehicular property is not covered by any mandatory insurance under the act, <em>i.e., </em>property damage claims with respect to this kind of property are covered solely under optional first-party collision insurance, while (2) damage to tangible property and properly parked motor vehicles is covered by mandatory third-party (no-fault) property damage insurance up to $1,000,000 required to be carried by the motorist who inflicted the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Again, as in the equal protection challenge to the personal injury section of the No-Fault Act, we apply the traditional equal protection test.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 and cross-plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection complaint is, in essence, that the Legislature has violated equal protection in providing that persons whose vehicular property is damaged as a result of a motor vehicle accident are to be compensated only if they have chosen to purchase collision insurance. While, on the other hand, the Legislature provided that persons whose tangible prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>erty or properly parked motor vehicle is damaged as a result of a motor vehicle accident are to be compensated up to $1,000,000 through mandatory third-party (no-fault) property damage insurance required to be carried by the motor vehiclist who inflicted the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In discussing this equal protection challenge to the property damage protection scheme, it is necessary to first logically analyze a basic misconception: no-fault and first-party insurance are misnomers in the context of property damage protection. It is not essential that every aspect of the no-fault scheme provide first-party protection, <em>i.e., </em>recovery by the victim from his own insurer. First-party protection is only one method of assuring prompt, equitable recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Under the property protection scheme, owners of tangible property and properly parked motor vehicles collect from the insurer of the motor vehicle which inflicted the damage. Owners of moving or improperly parked motor vehicles may collect compensation from their own insurers, if they have chosen to self-insure.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The different treatment of moving vehicles and tangible property and properly parked vehicles is related to the second conceptual difficulty relating to the use of fault in a no-fault act. Common sense would indicate, and actuarial studies have shown, that in accidents involving motor vehicles and tangible property, the motor vehicle is usually at fault. Consequently, the act makes the motorist strictly liable for the damage he does to tangible property and requires him to purchase insurance for such damage.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The system, however, functions without regard to fault. That is, there is no determination in each accident of who was at fault. Thus, the appellation \"no-fault\u201d is a misnomer only if one concentrates on the initial legislative allocation of responsibility. However, if one looks at the operational effect of the act, it remains a system of insurance without fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Section 3121 of the No-Fault Act provides that property protection insurance benefits paid under one policy for all damage to tangible property resulting from an accident shall not exceed $1,000,000. This limit does not violate equal protection (nor due process). It appears from the record that the Legislature sought to limit the absolute liability of insurance companies.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The choice of a $1,000,000 limit was justified from an actuarial standpoint.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">For these reasons we hold that the No-Fault Act\u2019s classification of persons whose vehicular property is damaged as a result of a motor vehicle accident (who are compensated if they have chosen to purchase first-party collision insurance), and those persons whose tangible property or properly parked motor vehicles are damaged (who are compensated up to $1,000,000 through mandatory third-party, no-fault property damage insurance required to be carried by the motorist who inflicted the damage), does not violate the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The fourth issue before us is whether \u00a7 3101(2) of the No-Fault Act, in excluding two-wheel motor vehicles from coverage under the act, violates the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Section 3101(2) of the No-Fault Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\"(2) 'Motor vehicle\u2019 as used in this chapter, except for section 3103, means a vehicle, including a trailer, operated or designed for operation upon a public highway by power other than muscular power <em>which has more than 2 wheels.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) MCLA 500.3101(2); MSA 24.13101(2), as amended by 1975 PA 329.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that the No-Fault Act, by limiting coverage to those vehicles with \"more than 2 wheels violates equal protection because it impermissibly treats owners of two-wheel vehicles <em>(i.e., </em>motorcycle owners) differently from owners of vehicles with more than two wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The actuarial data in the record tends to show that motorcycles are rarely at fault in motor vehicle accidents.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Also, there was extensive testimony to the effect that in accidents involving motorcycles the drivers and passengers of motorcycles are killed or severely injured at a rate twice exceeding that of those involved in automobile accidents. Thus the inclusion of motorcycles in a no-fault system would result in insurance premiums so high as to preclude most motorcyclists from pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>chasing insurance.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> We believe these are, for purposes of satisfying equal protection, legitimate governmental interests. The exclusion of motorcycles from coverage under the No-Fault Act is, quite evidently, reasonably related to these legitimate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We therefore hold that \u00a7 3101(2) of the No-Fault Act, in excluding two-wheel vehicles from coverage under the act, does not violate equal protection.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The fifth issue before us is whether the No-Fault Act\u2019s statutory scheme with respect to work-loss reimbursement and reimbursement for replacement services, \u00a7 3107, violates the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional complaint is \u00a7 3107 violates equal protection: (A) because it invidiously discriminates between workers in the home and workers outside the home in terms of maximum benefits payable in case of injury; and (B) because it creates an arbitrary statutory classification by restricting recovery for injuries to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>employed in the home to expenses \"reasonably incurred\u201d for replacement services.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The trial court held that (A) \"the classification * * * between those who work for compensation and those who do not work for compensation inside the house is [not] so invidious as to strike it down under the Equal Protection Clause\u201d; (B) \"that portion of \u00a7 3107(b) requiring that the cost of replacement services must be incurred and subsequently reimbursed is unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clauses of both the Fourteenth Amendment and the Michigan Constitution\u201d. The Court of Appeals did not consider this issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">At the threshold we observe that the trial court, in deciding this twofold issue, did not hear testimony. Rather, the court based its decision on \"stipulations of fact * * * entered into at the pretrial conference\u201d.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In Part IV, <em>supra, </em>we ruled that as a matter of constitutional policy, in constitutional challenges to the legislative judgments under the No-Fault Act, this Court requires, at a minimum, that evidence be produced at trial to provide an adequate factual context which might either support or undermine the claim <em>that the legislative judgment in question </em>is an invalid exercise of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Although the trial court did make its decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the basis of the noted \"Stipulations of Facts\u201d, we do not feel these stipulations provide an adequate factual context in which we can decide the difficult equal protection issues raised regarding \u00a7 3107. For example, the stipulation that \"there are times when a person working within a home performs services that are equal to the services of those working outside the home, and who are not compensated to the same extent as those working outside the home\u201d does not indicate whether this happens 90% or 10% of the time. This is a factual determination which could, obviously, present an important consideration. And, the stipulation that \"there is at least one person in the State of Michigan who would be unable to [obtain such services on credit] and who does not have the [cash to pay for them]\u201d gives rise to the response, \"De minimis non curat lex\u201d (\"The law is not based on minimal considerations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Therefore, we deem it necessary to remand to the trial court so that evidence relevant to the constitutionality of this two-fold issue may be received by that court and constitutionally adjudged in accord with the \"traditional\u201d equal protection test articulated in Part IV, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We retain jurisdiction as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The sixth issue before us is whether the No-Fault Act\u2019s statutory schemata with respect to nonresident, out-of-state motorists, \u00a7 3102(1), which require nonresident motorists to maintain no-fault insurance when they are in Michigan \"an aggregate of more than 30 days in any calendar year\u201d; and \u00a7 3113, read <em>inter alia </em>with \u00a7 3135(2), which pertains to transient nonresident motorists, violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the due process and equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\"The Court finds \u00a7 3102 (1) not violative of either the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, or those of the Michigan Constitution. The difference in the treatment of out-of-state motorists in Michigan an aggregate of 30 days in any one year is reasonably related to the essential purposes of the act and is not arbitrary and discriminatory. No invidiously discriminatory classification is established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The trial court also held \"the provisions of \u00a7 3113(c) denying a nonresident transient recovery of personal protection insurance, and also depriving such transient of tort recovery below the threshold, is invalid\u201d. The court reasoned that \"[the] disparate treatment of resident and nonresident motorists, and their passengers, violates the due process and equal protection standards discussed earlier in this opinion\u201d. The court then stated, correctly, that <em>\"[tjhere was no evidence offered that such disparate treatment was reasonably related to any proper legislative purpose, nor was any evidence offered to justify the classification\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">In the lengthy and extraordinary trial in this case, neither plaintiffs nor defendants developed an adequate factual record with respect to the statutory schemata pertaining to nonresident motorists. We cannot, as a matter of policy, allow the disposition of these constitutional challenges to succeed or fail on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Therefore, we remand to the trial court so that evidence relevant to the constitutionality of the above schemata may be received by that court and constitutionally adjudged in accord with the \"tra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ditional\u201d due process and equal protection tests articulated in Part IV, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>65</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We retain jurisdiction as to this issue.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The Court of Appeals and the trial court are affirmed in part and reversed in part as indicated by our holdings in this opinion\u2019s individual parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">An appropriate order reflecting the constitutional status of the No-Fault Act will enter 18 months from the issuance of this opinion.

Paragraph B declared the exclusion of two-wheel vehicles from the act\u2019s coverage unconstitutional. Paragraph G declared the act\u2019s property protection insurance scheme unconstitutional. Although the Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge all issues \"found\u201d in Paragraph A of the declaratory judgment, <em>i.e., </em>all issues declared constitutional by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>trial court, the Court only addressed one of these issues, namely, the constitutionality of the act\u2019s personal injury protection insurance scheme. <em>The Court did not address the other issues found constitutional by the trial court although it stated plaintiffs had standing to raise them.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\"> We do not believe that the cases relied on by the trial court in reaching its holding are persuasive.

Plaintiffs have repeatedly voiced objection to the imposition of compulsory no-fault insurance without regard to its financial impact. See Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint, and Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amended Complaint. At trial, the trial court barred testimony concerning the application of the compulsory insurance requirement and its financial impact, perceiving the issue as solely one of law. However, at pretrial, the court recognized, and the parties agreed, \" * * * that the issue of whether there are adequate guidelines to guide the Insurance Commissioner is clearly before the court and must be determined, especially in view of the fact that the statute now requires all motorists to carry insurance or to provide other security\u201d. The trial court did not address this \"sub-issue\u201d in its opinion. In their brief before the Court of Appeals, plaintiffs argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">\"When the Legislature refuses to establish adequate guidelines for rates, it actually encourages illegal rate discrimination.

Because the act does not furnish adequate guidelines to the Insurance Commissioner in setting rates, and the act does not establish adequate guidelines for the Secretary of State in approving security, the 'no fault\u2019 act must be unconstitutional. There cannot be a constitutional compulsory system without sufficient guidelines to establish, implement, and operate the legislative intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The Court of Appeals did not address this \"sub-issue\u201d. Plaintiffs, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>their brief before this Court, once again made reference to it.

The Court of Appeals did not even address plaintiffs\u2019 crucial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">After five years of uncertainty as to the constitutionality of the No-Fault Act, we believe the people of the State of Michigan deserve an opinion which addresses this crucial constitutional challenge to the No-Fault Act\u2019s regulatory scheme head-on.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">This challenge could be considered on the basis of whether the act\u2019s regulatory scheme contains sufficient protections to pass muster as a constitutional delegation by the Legislature. However, this opinion analyzes plaintiffs\u2019 due process challenge in two steps: first, does the requirement that Michigan motorists must purchase no-fault insurance in order to register and operate a motor vehicle create an entitlement to fairness and availability of such insurance; second, if there is such an entitlement, does the No-Fault Act on its face, or on its face complemented by proper agency rules and regulations, indicate that due process has been complied with in terms of plaintiff motorists\u2019 \"entitled\u201d interest. See discussion, Part III(B), <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\"> Michigan\u2019s No-Fault Act is generally recognized to be \"compulsory\u201d, not \"mandatory\u201d.

Insurance is \"mandatory\u201d in nature when the buyer can choose whether or not to purchase insurance, but if he chooses to purchase insurance, he must purchase a specific type of insurance. Insurance is \"compulsory\u201d if the buyer must purchase a specific type of insurance, <em>i.e., </em>the buyer has no choice in whether or not he purchases insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b807-11\"> <em>Gentile v Altermatt, </em>169 Conn 267; 363 A2d 1 (1975), <em>appeal dismissed </em>423 US 1041 (1976); <em>Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41; 340 NE2d 444 (1975); <em>Singer v Shepperd, </em>464 Pa 387; 346 A2d 897 (1975); <em>Lasky v State Farm Ins Co, </em>296 So 2d 9 (Fla, 1974); <em>Manzanares v Bell, </em>214 Kan 589; 522 P2d 1291 (1974); <em>Opinion of the Justices May 14, 1973, </em>113 NH 205; 304 A2d 881 (1973); <em>Grace v Howlett, </em>51 Ill 2d 478; 283 NE2d 474 (1972); and <em>Pinnick v Cleary, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>360 Mass 1; 271 NE2d 592 (1971).

We believe these cases are distinguishable from the instant challenge to the no-fault insurance rate-making scheme.

They cite, as authority, speculative dicta in <em>New York CR Co v White, </em>243 US 188, 201; 37 S Ct 247; 61 L Ed 667 (1917), and <em>Pinnick v Cleary, </em>360 Mass 1, 15; 271 NE2d 592, 602 (1971). They ask that we require the Legislature to afford an \"adequate substitute remedy\u201d before abolishing a common law cause of action in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We disagree. The \"adequate substitute\u201d test is not required by either the United States or Michigan Constitutions. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Silver v Silver, </em>280 US 117, 122; 50 S Ct 57; 74 L Ed 221 (1929), a case decided after <em>New York CR Co v White, </em>flatly declared: \"[t]he constitution does not forbid the creation of new rights, or the abolition of old ones recognized by the common law, to attain a permissible legislative object\u201d. In <em>Pinnick, </em>the Massachusetts Supreme Court, in choosing to apply a \"reasonable and adequate substitute test\u201d, correctly recognized that the test was \"not constitutionally required\u201d. 360 Mass 1, 15-16. Other state courts have also forthrightly rejected the test as constitutionally required. See especially, <em>Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41, 56; 340 NE2d 444, 453 (1975); and <em>Jones v State Board of Medicine, </em>97 Idaho 859, 869; 555 P2d 399, 409 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Our Constitution does not recognize a vested right in the continuance of existing remedies for injuries not yet suffered. Article 3, section 7 of our Constitution states that \"the common law and the statute laws now in force, not repugnant to this constitution, shall remain in force until they expire by their own limitations, or are changed, amended or repealed\u201d. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7. As this Court stated in <em>Mackin v Detroit-Timkin Axle Co, </em>187 Mich 8, 13; 153 NW 49 (1915): \"Except as to vested rights, the legislative power exists to change or abolish existing statutory and common-law remedies. Common and statute law only remain in force until altered or repealed.\u201d See, also, <em>Myers v Genesee County Auditor, </em>375 Mich 1, 7-8; 133 NW2d 190 (1965) (opinion by O\u2019Hara, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">This is not to suggest that the Legislature may arbitrarily abolish a common-law remedy. Leaving seriously injured persons without <em>any </em>remedy may violate concepts of fundamental fairness and justice which are part of the fabric of constitutional government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\"> Plaintiffs contend that this Court should apply the \"substantial-relation-to-the-object\u201d test advanced in <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655; 232 NW2d 636 (1975). In <em>Manistee, </em>we stated this test is applicable in those cases in which \"the challenged statute carves out a discrete exception to a general rule <em>and the statutory exception is no longer experimental\" </em>(emphasis added). 394 Mich 655, 671. The No-Fault Act, not even in effect for five years at the time of this writing, cannot be sensibly characterized as legislation \"no longer experimental\u201d in the same way in which the 45-year-old guest statute at issue in <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co </em>unquestionably was.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Plaintiffs also contend that this Court should review this legislation with \"strict scrutiny\u201d under the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions because a \"fundamental interest\u201d, the right to travel, is involved.

A review of the State Farm report (Exhibit 53) relied on by Kinkade reveals that in 1972 the paid allocated loss adjustment expenses, which includes fault investigations, had substantially greater expenditures for the category of property damage connected with bodily injury ($1,640,284) and bodily injury alone ($1,577,069). It is not clear from the testimony whether the $63,000 figure for property damage reflects those instances where a minimal fault investigation was necessary, nor is it clear what percentage of the figures for property damage were connected with bodily injury and bodily injury investigations. Nevertheless a review of all the figures indicates that the $63,000 sum was an inaccurate estimate of the total fault investigations connected with property damage accidents. The view that fault investigations are a substantial element in the administrative costs of insurance companies is in accord with the testimony of Dean Cowen, contributor to the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, and W. James MacGinnitie, Professor of Actuarial Science and Director of the Master of Actuarial Science program at the University of Michigan. Finally, it should be noted that Mr. Kinkade admitted in his testimony that the cost of investigation would be less under no-fault than it was under the tort system. Thus, even if some fault investigation continues under no-fault for certain types of coverage, it will apparently be less intensive or not as common as before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\"> It is possible that a motorist\u2019s insurer will be liable to the owners of stray animals, trains or other non-stationary tangible property which may occasion the damage.

Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Part II. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">One month prior to the date 1972 PA 294 became effective,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the initial plaintiffs brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the Act, while asking for declaratory and injunctive relief. Subsequently, the pleadings were amended and parties were added in an effort to better arrange a more exhaustive constitutional challenge. Plaintiffs claimed standing pursuant to GCR 1963, 201.2(3) or, alternatively, GCR 1963, 521.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">GCR 1963, 201.2(3) is designed to permit five or more residents of this state who own property assessed for direct taxation by the county where they reside to bring an action to prevent the illegal expenditure of state funds or to test the constitutionality of a statute relating thereto. I agree with the majority conclusion that GCR 1963, 201.2(3) does not contemplate the expenditure of state funds incidental to the operation of a regulatory scheme. Because the state funds required to be expended under the No-Fault Act are merely those costs incidental to the implementation and enforcement of the Act, the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the Act\u2019s constitutionality under that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">In the alternative, plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment pursuant to GCR 1963, 521.1 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\"In a case of <em>actual controversy </em>within its jurisdiction, any circuit court of this state may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking a declaratory judgment, whether or not other relief is or could be sought or granted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Before relief can be granted under this rule, plaintiffs must allege and prove an \"actual justiciable controversy\u201d. \"Actual controversy\u201d encompasses something more than simply the plaintiffs\u2019 \"need to know\u201d in order to guide their future conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In addition, \"actual controversy\u201d connotes the pursuance of an honest and actual antagonistic assertion of right by one party against another. A noncollusive adversary proceeding, as distinguished from a contrived friendly lawsuit, is critical, both pragmatically and constitutionally, to the proper performance of the judicial function. Outside of the constitutional provision for advisory opinions, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 8, this Court limits its resolution of controversies to instances where the stakes of the disputants are committed and the issues developed in adversary proceedings upon trial. <em>Request for Advisory Opinion on the Constitutionality of 1977 PA 108, </em>402 Mich 83; 260 NW2d 436 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Despite the manifestly contrived nature of the instant action, I would allow plaintiffs standing under GCR 1963, 521.1 because of the compulsory nature of the no-fault scheme. Resident plaintiffs who own and operate automobiles are compelled under threat of civil and criminal sanctions to purchase the no-fault insurance. The pleadings allege that various parties are financially unable to buy no-fault insurance coverage and are therefore subject to those sanctions. We need not hypothecate future events in determining that some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of the plaintiffs in this very limited respect are factually in a position antagonistic or adverse to the named state officials whose duty it is to implement the compulsory coverage provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Although \"actual controversy\u201d arises solely out of the compulsory coverage provisions, plaintiffs also have standing to challenge other provisions in the Act because of their specific interest in those provisions and because of the allegedly integrated nature of the scheme. Accordingly, in an effort to prove 1972 PA 294 constitutionally infirm, the plaintiffs have the requisite standing to raise the issues addressed in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Part III. Compulsory Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The first substantive issue addressed in the majority opinion is whether \u00a7 3101 of the No-Fault Act, which requires owners or registrants of motor vehicles to maintain compulsory personal injury protection insurance, property damage insurance and residual liability insurance, is constitutional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Presumably there are a number of theories upon which a challenger might fashion an attack upon the constitutionality of \u00a7 3101. It might be claimed that the statute as applied violates equal protection guarantees of the state and Federal Constitutions, denies due process as applied, or simply is an arbitrary or unreasonable statutory mandate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>There may be other bases for challenge as well. Whatever the theory of attack, however, and no matter what specific claims a party might make in a judicial challenge to the constitutionality of the provision, one fundamental principle of orderly appellate review should govern: A party wishing to make a claim of unconstitutionality must raise it on appeal before the court of appellate review. There are a number of reasons for such a rule including, of course, the fundamental proposition that an appellate court of final and discretionary review does not, in the proper performance of its function, conjure up issues of interest or even of great importance which the litigants have not raised or asked the court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The majority ignores this elemental precept of the appellate function and, acknowledging that the plaintiffs did not expressly raise the issue on appeal, \"feel compelled to address it because of its basic, threshold importance to any decision we might render as to the No-Fault Act\u2019s constitutionality\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I cannot acquiesce in legitimatizing such an approach to the appellate function. It is just that sort of \"this ticket for this train for this day only\u201d ad hoc rule for appellate review which has invited the criticism that this Court is often long on policy and short on judicial restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">It is manifest that the No-Fault Act, currently in its experimental stages, is novel, and some say revolutionary, legislation affecting literally millions of people and a billion dollar industry in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ways utterly beyond our ability to foresee. It is imperative therefore that this Court proceed in a carefully informed manner before declaring upon the constitutionality of the compulsory no-fault insurance scheme. By disregarding the proper scope and conditions of appellate review, the majority has deliberately precluded the possibility of a better informed decision. Because the trial court heard no evidence whatever supporting any claim of inadequate casualty insurance regulation, and since none of the parties nor any of the amici either briefed or argued the \"compulsory insurance\u201d issue, the majority was able to raise and resolve the issue unburdened by any factual record and upon freewheeling speculation. In the absence of a factual basis to illuminate and give meaning to \u00a7 3101 and the manner in which it is applied, the majority has fashioned a strictly facial attack upon its constitutionality. In so doing the majority has assumed the role of the advocate rather than that of the impartially reviewing court. In assuming that posture, the majority has jeopardized, indeed abandoned, the objective and neutral stance so necessary to the proper performance of the judicial function. The inevitable result, of course, is that the Court has forsaken its ability to reach a sound decision as evidenced by its dogged determination to raise and resolve an issue which was neither contentious nor preserved, and its adoption of a most anomalous resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">My brothers discuss the issue of the constitutionality of the \"compulsory insurance requirement\u201d of \u00a7 3101 in the framework of two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">(a) Can the Legislature constitutionally, as a condition precedent to registration and operation of a motor vehicle, require the purchase of no-fault personal protection insurance and no-fault property protection in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>surance or, in the alternative, require security approved by the Secretary of State?</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">(b) Does the present regulatory scheme for compulsory no-fault insurance sufficiently protect the interests of registrants and operators of motor vehicles in accord with the due process clause of the Michigan and United States Constitutions as to (1) the fairness of insurance rates, and (2) the proper availability of insurance?</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">For the reader\u2019s benefit, I shall address the issue within the same framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">(a) Can the Legislature constitutionally, as a condition precedent to registration and operation of a motor vehicle, require the purchase of no-fault personal protection insurance and no-fault property protection insurance or, in the alternative, require security approved by the Secretary of State?</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Authorities are abundant and unanimous that under the police power the state may regulate travel upon its public highways. <em>Stapleton v Independent Brewing Co, </em>198 Mich 170; 164 NW 520 (1917); <em>Bowerman v Sheehan, </em>242 Mich 95; 219 NW 69 (1928); <em>People v Thompson, </em>259 Mich 109; 242 NW 857 (1932); <em>DeVries v Secretary of State, </em>329 Mich 68; 44 NW2d 872 (1950). The power of the Legislature to control the operation of motor vehicles upon the highways of this state includes the power to enact legislation affecting the reciprocal rights and duties of all owners, operators, or occupants arising out of such operation. This sphere of control is the outgrowth of the state\u2019s interest in mitigating the detrimental consequences of highway motor vehicle accidents and is expressed through the enactment of legislation designed to insure a party\u2019s financial responsibility to others<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as to himself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>decision to accomplish those legitimate goals by mandating the purchase of no-fault insurance by Michigan motor vehicle owners and registrants is clearly within the state\u2019s police power. The constitutional validity of the no-fault scheme is properly assessed not only as a police power regulation, but also as an integral part of the authority and interest of the state in licensing motor vehicle operators and the vehicles they own and operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Obviously the imposition of this \"compulsory insurance\u201d requirement upon all owners or registrants of motor vehicles required to be registered in this state may well work something of a burden upon certain persons under certain conditions. However, the imposition of such a burden is not, per se, unconstitutional. The Legislature is vested with wide discretion not only to determine what is inimical to the public welfare, but also to determine what is fairly designed to protect the public against the evils which might otherwise occur. The expediency, the wisdom, the desirability, or even the fairness, in the abstract sense, of the specific means selected by the Legislature to advance legitimate public interests is strictly within the discretion of the lawmaking body and not subject to judicial veto, providing the means chosen do not offend constitutional safeguards. In pursuance of its determination to accomplish the goals stated heretofore, the Legislature may validly condition the operation of a motor vehicle upon the procurement of no-fault personal injury protection and property damage protection insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">(b) Does the present regulatory scheme for compulsory no-fault insurance sufficiently protect the interests of owners or registrants of motor vehicles in accord with the due process clause of the Michigan and United States Constitutions as to (1) the fairness of insurance rates, and (2) the proper availability of insurance?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>It is with regard to this question that I believe my brothers\u2019 reasoning is most seriously erroneous and in consequence of which today\u2019s action is taken. I shall attempt, first, to identify and explain the reasoning which <em>must have </em>fathered the majority opinion and then to demonstrate how the well-known constitutional principle upon which the majority depends has been misapplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The majority holds that the \"compulsory insurance\u201d requirement of \u00a7 3101 denies due process unless the government takes certain necessary steps to assure that all persons required to purchase no-fault insurance have an opportunity to do so on \"fair\u201d terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Although positing the view that some Michigan motorists are, in effect, denied the operation of their motor vehicles because of an inability to obtain insurance at justified, reasonable rates, the majority does not support such a conclusion with a factual record because none exists. There being no evidentiary basis upon which to predicate the assumption of the claim of unavailability of insurance, nor even appellate argument claiming it, the majority is forced to resort to an involved analysis by which an attempt is made to identify fair and equitable insurance rates as an \"interest\u201d warranting procedural protection under the due process provisions of the state and Federal Constitutions. Accordingly, the \"interest\u201d identified by the majority is an alleged \"statutory entitlement\u201d to no-fault insurance on a fair and equitable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Although arguing that persons have a \"statutory entitlement\u201d to fair and equitable insurance rates, the majority meticulously avoids defining or delineating the scope of the term \"statutory entitlement\u201d. Concededly, the United States Supreme Court has never explicitly defined a \"statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>entitlement\u201d, nor does this form of property interest lend itself to easy definition. However, certain attributes of a \"statutory entitlement\u201d are sufficiently established in United States Supreme Court decisions to enable one to extrapolate a tentative definition of the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">A statute creates an entitlement claim to a governmental benefit if it defines the conditions under which the benefit must be granted or if it sets out the specific and sole conditions under which the benefit may be denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once the cognizable benefit is conferred or received, the individual beneficiary has a sufficient property interest in the benefit to warrant due process protection in the event the government attempts to withhold or deny the benefit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Underlying this concept of a property interest to which there is an entitlement is the rationale that the recipients of governmental benefits place a reliance upon the continued receipt of those benefits which must not be arbitrarily undermined.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In attempting to identify the enjoyment of fair and equitable insurance rates as such an entitlement interest, the majority ignores certain absolutely essential attributes of entitlement interests, which will be discussed hereafter, while focusing extensively upon other attributes. In declaring that there exists an entitlement interest in fair and equitable insurance rates, the Court focuses upon two factors which it claims raise insurance rates from an important if abstract economic con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>cern to a constitutionally protected property interest, to wit: (1) a citizen\u2019s dependency and reliance upon fair and equitable no-fault insurance rates; and (2) the action of the Legislature in fostering an expectation that no-fault insurance will be available at fair and equitable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">In finding the necessary citizen dependence or reliance, my brothers reason that simply because \"independent mobility provided by an automobile is a crucial practical necessity * * * \u201d and \"whether or not a person can obtain a driver\u2019s license or register and operate his motor vehicle profoundly affects important aspects of his day-today life\u201d, there exists therefore a constitutionally protected property interest in such registration and operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The next step my brothers take is to conclude that because the new found property interest one has in registering and operating a motor vehicle upon the highways is conditioned upon the procurement of no-fault insurance, constitutionally based procedural guarantees are also applicable to enable one to fulfill the condition. The result of such reasoning, of course, is that the provision established by the Legislature (compulsory purchases of no-fault insurance) as a condition to the exercise of the constitutionally protected entitlement interest (registering and operating one\u2019s motor vehicle upon the highways) is, through bootstrapping argument, itself elevated to a constitutionally protected entitlement interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Apparently recognizing that the element of citizen reliance standing alone is not sufficient to create the entitlement interest to which due process protections attach, the majority finds \"a separate and independent basis for invoking due proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ess protection for Michigan motorists required to purchase no-fault insurance\u201d, <em>viz., </em>legislative enactments, independent of the compulsory no-fault insurance scheme which \"fostered the expectation that no-fault insurance will be available at fair and equitable rates\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">That somewhat convoluted route leads the Court to the conclusion that because of what it perceives to be inadequate procedural protections guaranteeing the availability of no-fault insurance at fair and equitable rates, the \"compulsory insurance\u201d requirement of \u00a7 3101 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The fundamental error in the reasoning of the majority is in the assumption that there is a property interest or entitlement, in the constitutional sense, in the availability of no-fault insurance at fair and equitable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Essentially, \"[t]he Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has <em>already acquired </em>in specific benefits\u201d. (Emphasis added.) <em>Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 576; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972). When such benefits are terminated, the constitutional right to a hearing provides an opportunity for a person to vindicate his claim to such benefits. <em>Board of Regents v Roth, supra, </em>577. Obviously, procedural due proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ess is not required until a benefit is abridged or otherwise threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">At the very outset my brothers err in concluding that the mandatory no-fault insurance scheme is an abridgment of the property interest one has in registering and operating his motor vehicle. The error is the result of an improper analysis of the essence of an entitlement interest. The analysis is deficient in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">First, there is a failure to recognize that the property interest to which a citizen has an entitlement, and which is involved in this case, derives from the action of the state in registering or licensing a motor vehicle, a benefit which, once conferred, permits the use of a motor vehicle upon the public highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The concept of the <em>present enjoyment </em>of the benefit appears to be an essential attribute of the protected interests in property under the entitlement doctrine. The attribute of present enjoyment is consistent with the rationale of the recipient\u2019s dependency and reliance upon the government activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\"><em>\"Once licenses are issued, </em>as in petitioner\u2019s case, <em>their continued possession </em>may become essential in the pursuit of a livelihood.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Bell v Burson, </em>402 US 535, 539; 91 S Ct 1586; 29 L Ed 2d 90 (1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">\"The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has <em>already acquired </em>in specific benefits.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Board of Regents v Roth, supra, </em>at 576.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">\"The emerging and underlying principle is clear; once a cognizable benefit is conferred or received, governmental action must not be employed to deprive or infringe upon that right without some form of prior hearing. We are unaware, however, of any authority for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the proposition that the full panoply of due process protections attaches every time the government takes some action which confers a new status on the individual or denies a request for a different status.\u201d <em>Scarpa v United States Board of Parole, </em>477 F2d 278, 282 (CA 5, 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Second, there is a failure to appreciate that the legislative command that no-fault insurance be obtained as a condition precedent to the registering of a vehicle does not terminate or even abridge one\u2019s entitlement to that benefit, but merely defines, in part, the perimeters or dimensions of the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">An individual does not possess, in the abstract, a property interest in the operation of his vehicle upon Michigan\u2019s highways. Rather, the property interest lies in his status as a registrant or licensee recipient of the entitled benefit. Until an individual acquires such licensure or proves his eligibility for it, he does not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. Essentially, the requirement of no-fault insurance simply conditions or defines one aspect of the eligibility for the benefit. Until an individual fulfills the eligibility requirement of obtaining no-fault insurance, he does not have a valid claim of entitlement to operate his vehicle in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The property interest at issue was created by the Legislature and, within constitutional limitations, the Legislature is free to define its dimensions. <em>Board of Regents v Roth, supra, </em>577. The condition of obtaining no-fault insurance, which is applicable to all motor vehicle registrants, is no more than a partial determinant of such dimensions. So long as the condition is not palpably arbitrary or unreasonable, it does not offend due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Michigan Canners v Agricultural Board, </em>397 Mich 337; 245 NW2d 1 (1976); <em>Grocers Dairy Co v Department of Agriculture Director, </em>377 Mich 71; 138 NW2d 767 (1966); <em>Carolene Products Co v Thomson, </em>276 Mich 172; 267 NW 608 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">To so condition the issuance of such a license does not run afoul of Fourteenth Amendment procedural guarantees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">\"If the statute barred the issuance of licenses to all motorists who did not carry liability insurance or did not post security, the statute would not, under our cases, violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Bell v Burson, supra, </em>539.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The majority implies that the Legislature recognized a constitutionally protected property interest in fair and equitable rates when it enacted legislation toward that end. Moreover, because of this claimed interest in fair and equitable rates, the majority opines that procedural guarantees must be effectuated in connection with the rate making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The validity of the statement by the majority, implying that the Legislature has recognized an <em>interest </em>in fair and equitable insurance rates by \"foster[ing] the expectation that no-fault insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>will be available at fair and equitable rates\u201d, is necessarily dependent upon a showing that the alleged <em>interest </em>in fact exists. Since, as explained above, there does not exist, in the abstract, an interest in fair and equitable insurance rates, the interest in such rates, allegedly recognized by the Legislature, must exist, if at all, within the framework of this statutory scheme alone. Accordingly, we must determine whether the statutory provisions cited by the majority create an entitlement interest in such rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The relevant provisions of the legislative enactment upon which my brothers rely are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\"(1) All rates shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">\"(d) Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d MCLA 500.2403(1); MSA 24.12403(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">\"(1) Every insurer authorized to write and writing automobile bodily injury liability and property damage liability insurance in this state shall participate in an organization for the purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">\"(a) Providing the guarantee that automobile insurance coverage will be available to any person who is unable to procure such insurance through ordinary methods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-10\">\"(b) Preserving to the public the benefits of price competition by encouraging maximum use of the normal private insurance system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">\"(2) The organization created under this chapter shall be called the 'Michigan automobile insurance placement facility.\u2019 \u201d MCLA 500.3301(1); MSA 24.13301(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">The suggestion that, by enacting a regulatory scheme, the Legislature established a property interest in the subject matter of the regulation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>constitutionally unsound. As explained earlier, a statute creates an entitlement to a government benefit when it declares the conditions under which the benefit must be granted or the conditions under which the benefit may be denied. Rather than creating or recognizing the existence of a property interest, the first cited provision, \u00a7 2403(1), sets the standards for the casualty insurers and the Commissioner of Insurance to follow when making casualty insurance rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The cases cited by the majority (footnote 23, pp 599-600, majority opinion) in support of the claim that there exists an interest in \"fair and equitable insurance rates\u201d, do not, in my view, stand for the stated proposition that there exists \"a separate and independent basis for invoking due process protection for Michigan motorists required to purchase no-fault insurance\u201d. Rather, the cases clearly narrow and limit instances in which procedural guarantees attach to situations in which there is not only a dependency or reliance upon the alleged interest, but also a legislative recognition of the interest at issue. <em>Paul v Davis, </em>424 US 693; 96 S Ct 1155; 47 L Ed 2d 405 (1976); <em>Bishop v Wood, </em>426 US 341; 96 S Ct 2074; 48 L Ed 2d 684 (1976); <em>Meachum v Fano, </em>427 US 215; 96 S Ct 2532; 49 L Ed 2d 451 (1976); <em>The Supreme Court, 1975 Term, </em>90 Harv L Rev 86-104 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">MCL 500.3301; MSA 24.13301, cited by the majority (p 599, majority opinion) as independently supporting the claim of legislative recognition of an interest in fair and equitable rates, merely provides for the creation of the \"Michigan automobile insurance placement facility\u201d. The provision compels insurers to participate in the assignment of high risks in order to make coverage available to all, while preserving to the public the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>price competition through the maximum use of the normal private insurance system. Outside of citing this provision in the context of its independent basis argument, the majority does not explain how it recognizes an interest in \"fair and equitable insurance rates\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Even if the majority was correct in concluding that there is a constitutionally protected entitlement interest in \"fair and equitable insurance rates\u201d, there has been no showing that the compulsory insurance provision of the Act either terminates or abridges the continued enjoyment of such interest. As indicated heretofore, Fourteenth Amendment procedural protection of property is a safeguard of interests a person has already acquired and procedural due process is not applicable until a state threatens to terminate or otherwise abridge the benefit. Although the majority alleges that a property interest in \"fair and equitable rates\u201d does in fact exist, their discussion is without any illustration demonstrating how no-fault\u2019s compulsory insurance scheme abridges or terminates this interest. The majority does not discuss the essential factor of termination or abridgment of a property interest which triggers the procedural guarantees, because it is obvious that the compulsory insurance scheme in no sense abridges any interest in fair and equitable insurance rates. The action of the Court in declaring the compulsory insurance scheme unconstitutional is, to say the least, an anomalous approach to assuring procedural safeguards for the enjoyment of such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In summary, I am persuaded that the requirement of security imposed upon <em>all </em>motor vehicle owners by the No-Fault Act, as a condition precedent to the operation of motor vehicles, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>violate Fourteenth Amendment procedural guarantees. More specifically, the statutory requirement, on its face, does not even raise Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In today\u2019s novel declaration of unconstitutionality in futuro, for lack of procedural safeguards, the majority initiated inquiry, defined issues and objectives, and has attempted to coerce a solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">There being no adversarial claims before the Court concerning the issue which is decided today, the compulsory insurance provision is struck down not by the adjudication of specific claims, but upon an inherently generalized approach to an abstract problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Perceived weaknesses, inequities, uncertainties and a concern for the <em>potential </em>unfairness of the compulsory insurance provision of the Act are elevated to the level of constitutional shortcomings to justify judicial veto. Impingement upon the legislative function in today\u2019s judgment is glaring.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Lacking the appropriate plenary power to effectuate the desired purpose, the Court\u2019s declaration of unconstitutionality, in futuro, is used as a bludgeon to motivate, even compel, the Legislature and the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate the casualty insurance industry in conformance with the will of the Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To this end my brothers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>have even proffered a \"minimal\u201d plan unburdened by any experience, expertise or understanding of the myriad factors which are implicated in the rate making process of the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">In its disposition of this issue, the Court has strayed from the constitutional limits of its judicial authority and usurped the legislative function. There is a difference between the Court\u2019s <em>power </em>to make today\u2019s judgment of unconstitutionality and its proper <em>authority </em>to do so. In the instance at hand, the latter has given way to the former and the price is further erosion of the ever weakening doctrine of judicial self-restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Part IV. Due Process and Equal Protection Tests Applicable to the No-Fault Act</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Part V. Constitutionality op the Personal Injury Protection Scheme Under the No-Fault Act</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Part VI. Constitutionality op the Property Damage Protection Insurance Scheme Under the No-Fault Act</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">I concur in the result reached by the majority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The specific constitutional issues raised with respect to the property damage protection scheme are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">(a) Whether the No-Fault Act violates the due process clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions by abolishing the common-law remedy in tort for persons whose property is damaged by negligent motor vehicle tortfeasors;</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">(b) Whether the No-Fault Act violates the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions by creating the following statutory classification: (1) damage to vehicular property is not covered by any mandatory insurance under optional first-party collision insurance, while spect to this kind of property are covered solely under optional first-part collision insurance, while (2) damage to other tangible property and properly parked vehicles is covered by mandatory no-fault property damage insurance up to $1,000,000 required to be carried on the vehicle which inflicted the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">In accord with the so-called traditional test to determine whether the no-fault scheme comports with due process, we inquire only whether the statute bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective. The learned trial judge, rather than focusing his inquiry upon the question whether the new statutory scheme bore a reasonable relationship to permissible objectives, directed his inquiry into the efficiency of the former tort property damage idemnification system. After concluding that the traditional tort system operated with adequate efficiency, the trial court held \"that there was no social objective to be served by abrogating tort rights of owners of property damaged by negligent tortfeasors\u201d. Because of this overly restrictive analysis of the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>issue, the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">As elucidated in the majority opinion, \"The Legislature is as free to experiment with other ways of dealing with a subject in the hope of making a good system better as it is to correct a perceived evil system.\u201d When the trial court\u2019s analysis focused only upon the latter consideration, its inquiry into possible legislative objectives was necessarily incomplete. Upon reviewing the record, the majority found several legitimate goals which would justify the enactment of the property protection scheme. Under the deferential approach inherent in the traditional due process test, I agree that there were legitimate objectives, other than those noted by the trial court, to warrant the legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">With respect to the equal protection claim, plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs argue that the Legislature has arbitrarily treated the subject of damage to moving highway vehicles differently from that inflicted upon other tangible property. As was observed in Part III (compulsory insurance), the Legislature has a legitimate interest in mitigating the detrimental consequences of motor vehicle accidents. Generally speaking, this is the fundamental objective of the No-Fault Act. A quick perusal of the Act makes evident the fact that the scheme is designed to insure one party\u2019s financial responsibility to others as well as to himself. In accord with this objective, the no-fault scheme provides for compulsory third-party property damage protection insurance payable without regard to fault. Stated differently, the Act mandates the owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in Michigan<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to procure third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>beneficiary insurance,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> payable without regard to fault for damage inflicted by his motor vehicle to tangible property. Out of this class of tangible property there is carved the exception of vehicular property<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> designed for operation on a public highway.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Damage to this class of property is excluded from property protection benefits. Plaintiffs and cross-plaintiffs argue that such statutory classifications are not rationally related to a valid objective of the No-Fault Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">In addition to the goal of assuring financial responsibility for motor vehicular inflicted damage to tangible property, the Legislature had other goals in mind. One of them involved cost considerations. As elucidated by the majority, the Legislature sought to make vehicle protection coverage more equitable by allocating premium expense for that protection exclusively to first-party collision coverage. Vehicle damage protection rates would thereby be calculated strictly on the basis of repair costs for one\u2019s own vehicle, rather than including in the liability coverage a cost for the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>damage to a vehicle of unknown and therefore unascertainable value. Essentially, there is a resultant shift in insurance premiums from the liability coverage to the vehicle collision coverage. With this shift the Legislature intended that premiums would more closely reflect the value of the vehicle one drives while affording a more significant premium saving to one who does not purchase the optional first-party vehicle coverage. Additionally, the Legislature hoped that this shift from liability to first-party coverage might make group insurance feasible as well as create incentives for buying more crashworthy highway vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Including moving highway vehicles within the general tangible property class and affording them third-party property protection benefits would frustrate the aforementioned objectives without significantly advancing the interest of financial responsibility.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Part VII. Whether \u00a7 3101(2) of the No-Fault Act Which Excludes Two-Wheel Motor Vehicles from Coverage Under the Act is Constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Part VIII. Constitutionality of the No-Fault Act\u2019s Statutory Scheme with Respect to the Work-Loss Reimbursement and Reimbursement for Replacement Services (\u00a7 3107)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is: (1) that \u00a7 3107 violates the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions because it invidiously discriminates between workers in the home and workers outside the home in terms of maximum benefits payable in case of injury; and (2) that \u00a7 3107(b) violates the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitution because it creates an arbitrary classification by restricting recovery for injuries to those employed in the home to expenses \"reasonably incurred\u201d for replacement services.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Reduced to its simplest, the equal protection guarantees of both constitutions mean that the Legislature may not take what may be termed a \"natural class of persons\u201d, split that class in two, and then arbitrarily designate the severed factions of the original unit as two classes and thereupon enact different rules for the treatment of each. However, when there is a natural difference between the situation or circumstances of the two classes of persons, the Legislature may be justified in treating them differently. The state enjoys a wide range of discretion in distinguishing, selecting, and classifying, and it is sufficient if a classification is practical and not palpably arbitrary. <em>Orient Ins Co v Daggs, </em>172 US 557; 19 S Ct 281; 43 L Ed 552 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">There is a practical reason for the Legislature to make a distinction between benefits for work loss and the replacement of ordinary and necessary services. Reimbursement for the former lends it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>self to determination on the basis of an individual\u2019s prior wage scale, while ordinary and necessary services performed in the home are not susceptible of valuation under the same criterion. Moreover, whereas replacement costs for ordinary and necessary services are susceptible to being incurred, one cannot ordinarily incur the cost of a substitute to perform the job of the accident victim. Additionally, the fact that the ordinary and necessary services must be incurred before reimbursement serves not only a valuation function, but also a prophylactic function which has not been shown to be unreasonable. Finally, the different maximum limits imposed by the Act appear reasonably related to their reimbursement functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">In my view, there is no need for a remand of this matter for the taking of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Part IX. Constitutionality of the No-Fault Act\u2019s Statutory Scheme with Respect to Transient Non-Michigan Motorists and Nonresident Occupants of Motor Vehicles Not Registered in Michigan</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Essentially, plaintiffs complain that this statutory scheme violates due process and equal protection guarantees by denying no-fault benefits to the transient nonresident who has not obtained insurance from an insurer who has filed a certification in compliance with \u00a7 3163 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Rather than representing an arbitrary and capricious exercise of legislative power, this exclusion merely recognizes the realities of the situation. The Legislature, cognizant of the extent of its authority over out-of-state motor vehicles, reasonably excludes from the compulsory coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>scheme out-of-state motor vehicles which are not operated in Michigan for an aggregate of more than 30 days in any calendar year. Those nonresidents who do not voluntarily procure the no-fault coverage quite reasonably do not receive the concomitant no-fault benefits. Under the traditional test, legislation is presumed to be constitutional if any state of facts reasonably may be construed to justify the legislative action and the classifications therein. From the record made below, it does not appear that the presumption is overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Again, I perceive no benefit to be gained by a remand of this issue for further trial court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">In finding the No-Fault Act constitutional, I am compelled to make explicit the following observation. The above holdings are dispositive of the challenges to constitutionality of the No-Fault Act as leveled in this lawsuit by the plaintiffs and raised by the majority, and no more. Upon a different factual predicate, another plaintiff, in the future, may well raise arguments and produce evidence sufficient to persuade me that the presumption of constitutional validity which weighs heavily today is overcome or that, as applied, the act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">In reviewing the issues before us, I have been acutely conscious that the proper discharge of the judicial function, when evaluating new legislation for constitutional validity, is very narrow. It is to determine whether there is any rational relationship between the goals sought to be accomplished and the means chosen to do so. Our stated and restated deference to the legislative function, as embodied in the familiar doctrine of presumptive constitutional validity, is no mere verbalism. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>source is the doctrine of separation of powers and its life blood is judicial self-restraint. We are not free to strike down this revolutionary new concept of compensation for motor vehicle caused injury and damage because we may think it to be unwise or even at odds with our personal notions of what is fair. We test for constitutional collision. If there is none, like it or not, we ought to decline to disturb the legislative will. Stated otherwise, our review and judgment must be such as to not unduly hamper the Legislature\u2019s freedom to experiment and innovate by superimposing our judgment as to the expediency or wisdom of the legislation over theirs. This necessary policy of deference affords the Legislature ample scope for putting its prophecies to the test of proof. The case before us is a contrived lawsuit brought one month prior to the date 1972 PA 294 became effective and is necessarily deficient in presenting evidence of the actual impact, across the board, of the no-fault scheme. Essentially, the plaintiffs produced before the trial court a body of evidence similar to that considered by the Legislature when that body was deliberating upon the propriety of adopting the scheme. That evidence included, <em>inter alia, </em>legislative facts, actuarial data, expert opinion, fiscal projections and professorial theorizing. Much of the evidence is imprecise, even highly speculative. Upon examining all of it, considering the findings of fact by the trial court, and applying those established principles of constitutional law which I have discussed, over all of which is superimposed the presumption of constitutional validity, I am persuaded that the Act is constitutionally sound.</p>\n<judges id=\"b877-4\">Coleman, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\"> Plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief on August 28, 1973.

I would uphold the constitutionality of the challenged provisions of 1972 PA 294, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq., </em>as amended. At this juncture, the act, under our traditional due process and equal protection standards, is a reasonable legislative method of assuring that victims of automobile accidents are promptly and adequately compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The gist of plaintiffs\u2019 many complaints about the no-fault insurance act is that the act is a heavy-handed solution to non-existent problems in a workable tort system. Plaintiffs miss the point. Justice Levin\u2019s observation in <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655, 680; 232 NW2d 636 (1975), is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">\"Courts should proceed cautiously and should defer to legislative judgments which are reasonable. The Legislature must be free to experiment without being required to attain 'mathematical nicety\u2019 in its formulation of remedies to social and economic problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">I would not remand any of the issues in this case for a factual determination. Because this case arises in a declaratory judgment posture, the \"facts\u201d to be gleaned on remand must necessarily be somewhat speculative. I see nothing to be gained by remanding for more current discourse on plaintiffs\u2019 perceived evils of the no-fault system. The act is not yet beyond the experimental stages.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">I, too, am concerned about the procedural due process issue. I cannot, however, conscientiously reach the merits of that issue in the posture of this case. Footnote 14 of the majority opinion shows that the constitutionality of compulsory no-fault insurance in the context of rate-setting procedures was not appealed to this Court. The \"actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>controversy\u201d requirement for issuance of a declaratory judgment might well be met had plaintiffs raised the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs may have standing to raise the issue and the question may be ripe for decision, but the fact remains that plaintiffs did not question procedural due process in rate regulation or insurance availability. I suspect the litigants will be quite surprised at the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the issue of the merits of compulsory insurance/procedural due process was before us, I can not find a constitutional due process violation without a factual record. I do not address possible due process violations based on the entitlement doctrine relied upon by the majority because to do so does not square with my conception of the process that is due litigants from the court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">I cannot say the question of due process protections arises in a case where no plaintiff has claimed an entitlement or a denial of due process. Due process does not exist in a vacuum. The leading entitlement cases spring from a ruling adverse to the plaintiff. See, for example, <em>Bundo v Walled Lake, </em>395 Mich 679; 238 NW2d 154 (1976) (refusal to renew liquor license); <em>Bell v Burson, </em>402 US 535; 91 S Ct 1586; 29 L Ed 2d 90 (1971) (suspension of driver\u2019s license); <em>Goldberg v Kelly, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>397 US 254; 90 S Ct 1011; 25 L Ed 2d 287 (1970) (termination of welfare benefits); <em>Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972) (refusal to grant tenure); <em>Arnett v Kennedy, </em>416 US 134; 94 S Ct 1633; 40 L Ed 2d 15 (1974) (dismissal of Federal civil servant); and <em>Bishop v Wood, </em>426 US 341; 96 S Ct 2074; 48 L Ed 2d 684 (1976) (dismissal of policeman).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The law on the entitlement doctrine is not so clear but that I feel an adversary presentation is necessary to decide whether an entitlement exists. Likewise, such a presentation is needed to decide whether the requisite state action is present.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, determining what due process protections are required by the Constitution ought to involve a balancing of the interests of consumers, insurance companies and the state agency charged with regulating the insurance industry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>prefer to hear what those interests are<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> before deciding what is minimally required to satisfy due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">While there may come a time when the people of the State of Michigan deserve an opinion on a question not raised by the litigants, requiring us to assume facts not in the record, the instant case does not warrant such judicial initiative. I would not today take judicial action to precipitate a crisis at the risk of hasty and ill-conceived reform. At this juncture I would leave what some perceive as a crisis in the hands of those who best understand the problems and solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In a proper case, at another time when the procedural due process issue is properly raised, and a factual record is developed so that we can determine whether or not \"rates are * * * , in fact, 'excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u2019 \u201d, my decision could be otherwise. This Court should bide its time until that proper case arrives.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">I cannot accept the majority\u2019s attempt to soften the blow by holding the act unconstitutional at some future date if no legislative or agency action is taken. As authority for that procedure, <em>Robinson v Cahill, </em>62 NJ 473; 303 A2d 273 (1973), is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>cited. That decision, invalidating New Jersey\u2019s method of financing public schools through local and <em>ad valorem </em>taxation of real property, is now commonly referred to as <em>Robinson I. </em>A look at the later history of that case convinces me that this Court ought not follow a similar procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">In sum, today\u2019s action by the majority potentially junks a workable solution to a problem of importance to the entire population and dictates to the Legislature in a manner neither seemly nor called for. The Court embarks on a perilous course of grave consequence to everyone.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\"> While the declaratory judgment rule, GCR 1963, 521, is to be liberally construed and administered, the granting of a declaratory judgment is still a matter of judicial discretion. To raise an issue <em>sua sponte </em>on appeal from a lower court declaratory judgment is extraordinary. I am puzzled by the majority\u2019s statement that \"before affirmative declaratory relief can be granted, it is essential that a plaintiff, at a minimum, pleads facts entitling him to the judgment he seeks and proves each fact alleged, <em>i.e., </em>a plaintiff must allege and prove an actual <em>justiciable </em>controversy\u201d and reference to <em>Kuhn v East Detroit, </em>50 Mich App 502; 213 NW2d 599 (1973), <em>Iv den, </em>391 Mich 815 (1974). I read <em>Kuhn </em>as strong authority for not deciding the procedural due process issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\"> One author offers the following observation concerning Pennsylvania\u2019s insurance rate-making scheme, which appears essentially similar to our own:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">\"Pennsylvania\u2019s insurance rate regulation procedure, despite its failure to provide for public notice and hearing before rates go into effect, does not appear susceptible to challenge under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. It is unlikely that a court would consider the state\u2019s role in the process to constitute state action. Nor, if the public utility analogy is employed, do consumers have a property interest in fixed insurance rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">He goes on to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">\"The lack of serious constitutional objections to the present rate-making scheme suggests that the resolution of the problem may lie in legislative rather than judicial hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Lewis, Comment: <em>Insurance Rate Regulation in Pennsylvania: Does the Consumer Have a Voice?, </em>81 Dickinson L Rev 297, 309 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-11\"> The Insurance Commissioner has indicated some of the pertinent considerations:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">\"The concern for essential insurance availability and regulation manifests itself in several ways which at first glance seem unrelated.

A third category of consumers find their choice of company limited so that they are unable to select the quality of service they would prefer, or are hesitant to shop among companies because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>fear cancellation of their coverage. The public also questions the extent and nature of government involvement in the marketplace. On the one hand, there is little dispute that government should intervene in the free marketplace where the marketplace will not by itself act in the public interest. On the other hand, there is a strong and growing sense that government regulation has come to intervene in cases where it is unnecessary and may in fact be a negative influence. All of these concerns are pertinent to Michigan, and must be examined if sound public policy is to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Insurance Bureau, <em>A Report to the Governor: Essential Insurance in Michigan </em>(1977), p 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-10\"> Some of the considerations to be balanced are listed in Comment: <em>Entitlement, Enjoyment, and Due Process of Law, </em>1974 Duke L J 89,\u2019 120-122.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\"> See <em>Robinson II, </em>63 NJ 196; 306 A2d 65 (1973) (court would not disturb statutory scheme previously held unconstitutional unless Legislature failed to enact by December 31, 1974, legislation compatible with <em>Robinson I); Robinson III, </em>67 NJ 35; 335 A2d 6 (1975) (court declined to determine a remedy for the 1975-76 school year); <em>Robinson IV, </em>67 NJ 333; 339 A2d 193 (1975) (court mandated provisional remedies for the 1976-77 school year).

It is a giant step towards government <em>management </em>of private enterprise through judicial mandate. With no facts and little or no claimed expertise in the insurance industry, the majority assumes a stance of power and sweeps out to transform the management of an entire private industry into a <em>state </em>function and therefore subject. to such regulation as has been reserved for state agencies. The majority finds that \"[t]his legislation goes beyond a grant of monopoly or an attempt to regulate a utility\u201d and so the action of the automobile insurance industry must \"be treated as that of the state itself\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Like modern day legal alchemists, the Court has managed to transform the insurance rate-setting process from what was essentially a series of private actions with some governmental supervision to that magical \"state action\u201d which opens the door to \"state action\u201d constitutional controls.

First, like \"fair and equitable prices\u201d, any single \"definition\u201d is unlikely to cover the innumerable factual possibilities. Facts and circumstances are necessary against which to test the standards. Facts are lacking here, so understandably we were, not expected by the parties to test the statutory protection in a vacuum. The Commissioner of the judiciary will be able to judge fairly what is an \"excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rate\u201d. The words are ordinary and widely used in statutes and regulations. Even if it were true that there is \"no history of court interpretation\u201d of this standard, one has to ask, \"How does such a history begin?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Noting that the same standards apply to all insurance in Michigan, and have for many years, I wonder how this finding of inadequacy will affect all other areas of the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">(2) The majority say that there are inadequate statutory provisions for a motorist attacking the validity of an individual rating decision.

No-fault is also saving about $45 million per year in insurance costs because of benefit coordination with a potential savings of at least $105 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">\"No-fault collision is also providing people with more options to control their insurance rates through self-insuring portions of their coverage. It also increases equity by making more people pay only for repairing their own car and not for repairing the average car. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">\"Finally, no-fault has not been directly responsible for increases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>insurance rates. The increase in insurance rates in Michigan has been consistent with the rate increases in other comparable states \u2014 both tort and no-fault. Also, insurance rates in Michigan over the past several years have not increased as rapidly as the prices of products the insurance purchases. In addition, no-fault has saved almost $70 million per year from the costs of a tort system. The public is concerned about rate increases, but this is a national phenomenon, independent of no-fault.\u201d Insurance Bureau, <em>A Report to the Governor: No-Fault Insurance in Michigan: Consumer Attitudes and Performance </em>(1978), pp 60-61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\"> <em>E.g., </em>Part III sets forth certain requirements, \u00a7 2 of which seems to contradict itself. Subsection (a) requires that premiums be set \"without regard to factors assertedly warranting differences in premiums\u201d. Subsection (b), however, requires a statement of factors which may be considered by the insurer in differentiating premiums among those insured and (c) requires \"the amount of differential appropriate for each such factor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Does the 2(a) requirement mean that all premiums for the same coverage be the same as to each person (as to the same company)? Do 2(b) and (c) allow specified classifications for specified risks at specified amounts? If so, how does (a) correlate with (b) and (c)?</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Also, it is not clear whether a consumer is expected to \"shop around\u201d among competing companies for one willing to take a greater risk or charge a lesser premium. The words seem to provide that anyone (\"every motorist\u201d) who feels aggrieved by the first offer can demand a full-scale hearing before an administrative law judge and subsequent rights of appeal as provided by the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The expectations of the purchaser are not at all like expectations of a person shopping for the automobile, from which these new constitutional (?) rights spring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\"> Justice Williams attempts to legitimatize discussion of the due process sufficiency of the act\u2019s regulatory scheme by reference in fn 14 of his opinion to plaintiff counsel\u2019s statement at oral argument requesting this Court to utilize the briefs filed in the <em>Court of Appeals </em>\"on <em>any issues </em>that were otherwise <em>inadequate </em>or <em>de\u00f1cient </em>in this reviewing court\u201d.
