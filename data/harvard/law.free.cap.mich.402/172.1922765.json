Plaintiff, Greenfield Construction Company, obtained copies of the project proposal, design plans, and specifications, submitted the low bid on the project and ultimately entered into a construction contract with defendant in December, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Upon arrival at the site in March, 1973, Greenfield alleges it first discovered significant changes in the conditions at the work site from those indicated in the project proposal, design plans, and specifications. Specifically, the water level of Lake St. Clair was approximately 2 feet higher than the last elevation indicated in the project plans supplied by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Greenfield thereupon notified defendant that it considered these developments to be \"changed physical conditions\u201d, as that expression is defined in the contract documents, and claimed that under the contract it was entitled to compensation in excess of the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In petitioning for extra compensation, Greenfield followed the informal procedures customarily employed in situations where there is disagreement between the highway department and contractors as to matters of performance or compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Ultimately, however, the Department of State Highways, in a letter dated June 6, 1973, advised plaintiff that the department would not award additional compensation. No record was made of the department proceedings which culminated in the June 6 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On July 17, 1973, Greenfield filed its two-count complaint in the Wayne Circuit Court. Count I alleged that the June 6 letter from the Department of State Highways was a \"declaratory ruling\u201d subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969, MCLA 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiff sought a reversal of the alleged \"declaratory ruling\u201d and, in addition, a declaratory judgment that there had been a material change in conditions under the contract. Count II alleged that certain construction delays were not the fault of plaintiff and that plaintiff asserted entitlement to a declaratory judgment to that effect and for a determination that plaintiff was entitled to an extension of the contractual construction period without suffering liability for liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In response defendant filed a motion captioned \"Motion for Accelerated or Summary Judgment\u201d. Defendant first asserted that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the matter complained of by plaintiff was not a \"contested case\u201d within the Administrative Procedures Act, and did not involve a \"rule\u201d within the purview of the act. Second, defendant contended that any alleged liability or other claims or demands arising out of a contract with the State of Michigan are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Michigan Court of Claims. Finally, defendant contended that plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>On September 11, 1973, after a hearing, the circuit court issued an opinion holding that the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction contract provisions in dispute were not \"rules\u201d subject to review under the Administrative Procedures Act, MCLA 24.263; MSA 3.560(163), and that consequently the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Greenfield\u2019s claim. Plaintiff filed a motion to stay the entry of accelerated judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">A second hearing was held later and the court issued a second opinion, this time granting the declaratory relief requested by the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The court again found, however, that the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction were not \"rules\u201d subject to review under the Administrative Procedures Act and found, in addition, that defendant had \"not taken any steps for the promulgation of rules, regulations and procedures by which to issue declaratory rulings and that, therefore, the decision of June 6, 1973 amounts to no more than an administrative pronouncement\u201d. However, the court held the June 6 letter to be arbitrary and capricious and a deprivation of due process. It ruled that the Court of Claims lacked the requisite equitable jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. Concluding that the plaintiff had supported its contentions on the merits, however, the court issued its declaratory judgment that a change of conditions had occurred. The issue of money damages was expressly left for later determination in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the dispute. 58 Mich App 49; 227 NW2d 223 (1975). We granted leave to appeal. 394 Mich 836 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Our resolution of the case turns upon the answers to two specific questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">1) Is Section 1.04.03(c) of the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction a <em>rule </em>within the definition of the Administrative Procedures Act, and</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">2) Does the circuit court have jurisdiction in this case to issue a declaratory judgment binding upon the defendant State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Our answer to both questions is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Section 63 of the Administrative Procedures Act, MCLA 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq., </em>provides narrowly circumscribed authority in the circuit court to judicially review a declaratory ruling issued by an agency of state government, and provides that such review is conducted in the same manner as an agency final decision or order in a contested case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Section 64 of the act confers upon the circuit court authority to issue a declaratory judgment concerning the validity or applicability of an agency rule, providing however the plaintiff has first \"requested the agency for a declaratory ruling and the agency has denied the request or failed to act upon it expeditiously\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Greenfield claims that Section 1.04.03(c) of the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction is a <em>rule </em>within the definition of the Administrative Procedures Act and that the highway department letter of June 6, 1973 was a declaratory ruling concerning the applicability of the claimed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">We disagree on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A rule is defined in \u00a7 7 of the Administrative Procedures Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\" 'Rule\u2019 means an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling, or instruction of general applicability, which implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or which prescribes the organization, procedure or practice of the agency * * * MCLA 24.207; MSA 3.560(107).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Section 1.04.03(c) of the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\"Changed Physical Conditions. \u2014 Should the contractor encounter or the engineer discover, during the progress of the work, physical conditions at the site differing materially from those shown in the contract and included documents, or unknown physical conditions of a nature differing materially from those gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ally recognized as work of the character provided for in the contract, the engineer will investigate the conditions. Unless the engineer finds that the work required materially changes the character of the work, the work will be paid for at the contract unit price. If the work required is of sufficient magnitude to affect the unit cost by 10% or more, an allowance will be made on such basis as is mutually agreed upon and authorized in advance of the performance of the work. If agreement cannot be reached as to the basis of payment for which the contractor deems compensation to be due him, the work shall proceed as provided under Disputed Claims for Extra Compensation, 1.05.12.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction are found in a bound volume of 735 pages. The specifications include definitions of terms, allocation of duties between the contractor and the state, payment terms, and hundreds of pages of highly technical and detailed information concerning construction methods and techniques, soil composition requirements, metal heat treating methods, and technical details touching almost every conceivable aspect of highway construction work for which the State of Michigan might contract. Relevant portions of the standard specifications, including Section 1.04.03(c), are routinely incorporated by reference in the highway department construction contracts not only to avoid the cumbersome necessity of reproducing the highly detailed information in every separate contract, but to enable prospective bidders upon state construction contracts to know in advance the bid requirements and construction specifications which will apply if they bid upon a state-owned highway construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">It is undisputed that no part of the 1970 Standard Specification for Highways Construction have ever been promulgated as agency rules within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>meaning of \u00a7 7 of the Administrative Procedures Act as is required by chapter 3 of the act, as a condition of their validity. It is likewise undisputed that the statutory steps preliminary to the adoption of agency rules, including publication of the proposed rule, and publication and transmission of notice of public hearing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were never undertaken with respect to Section 1.04.03(c) or any of the standard specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals that Section 1.04.03(c) of the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Construction is not an agency rule within the meaning of \u00a7 7 of the Administrative Procedures Act. It is, as its title suggests, one of hundreds of standard contract terms and specifications governing the contractual relationship between the state and contractors engaged in state highway work. It follows, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>fore, that the June 6, 1973 letter from the defendant\u2019s Central Office Adjustment Board, and the endorsement thereof by the Director of the Department of State Highways, refusing to allow extra compensation, did not constitute \"a declaratory ruling as to the applicability * * * of a rule or order of the [defendant] agency\u201d subject to circuit court judicial review under \u00a7 63 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Similarly, there was no basis for a declaratory judgment concerning \"the validity or application of a <em>rule\u201d </em>under \u00a7 64 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In addition to the judicial review of administrative action sought in count I of its complaint, plaintiff prayed in count II for a declaratory judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\"A. That the delays heretofore incurred have been on account of unusual conditions beyond the control of plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\"B. That plaintiff is entitled to an extension of the contract time to compensate it for those days unavoidably lost by reason of said delays.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\"C. That said extension of time should be an additional compensatory working day during the normal working season on Lake St. Clair, April 1 through November 1, for each day lost by plaintiff as a result of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">(1) Change of conditions at work site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">(2) Stop Order issued by Army Corps of Engineers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">The defendant claims the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain the complaint for declaratory relief and that the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">We agree, but for reasons not fully addressed by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>This Court has long recognized the well established rule that a state cannot be sued without its consent, granted by legislative enactment. <em>McNair v State Highway </em>Department, 305 Mich 181, 187; 9 NW2d 52 (1943); <em>Mead v Michigan Public Service Commission, </em>303 Mich 168, 173; 5 NW2d 740 (1942); <em>Manion v State Highway Commissioner, </em>303 Mich 1, 19; 5 NW2d 527 (1942); <em>cert den </em>317 US 677 (1942); <em>McDowell v Warden of Michigan Reformatory at Ionia, </em>169 Mich 332, 337; 135 NW 265 (1912); <em>Board of Supervisors of Sanilac County v Auditor General, </em>68 Mich 659; 36 NW 794 (1888); <em>Michigan State Bank v Hastings, </em>1 Doug 225 (Mich, 1844).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">There is, of course, a distinction between sovereign immunity from <em>suit </em>and sovereign immunity from <em>liability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Legislative waiver of a state\u2019s suit immunity merely establishes a remedy by which a claimant may enforce a valid claim against the state and subjects the state to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">By waiving its immunity from liability, however, the state concedes responsibility for wrongs attributable to it and accepts liability in favor of a claimant. In so doing it may even create a cause of action in favor of the claimant which did not theretofore exist. <em>Minty v Board of State Auditors, </em>336 Mich 370; 58 NW2d 106 (1953); <em>Van Antwerp v State, </em>334 Mich 593; 55 NW2d 108 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">It was to various aspects of the issue of sovereign immunity from <em>liability </em>that this Court addressed itself repeatedly in the last decade, most recently upholding statutory state tort immunity in <em>Thomas v Department of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1; 247 NW2d 530 (1976), and abolishing judicially created tort immunity in <em>Pittman v Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41; 247 NW2d 512 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>We address today, however, the issue of sovereign immunity from <em>suit. </em>Broadly stated, the issue is whether the State of Michigan\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit has been waived to the extent that it may be sued in our courts of general jurisdiction upon a complaint for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">While it is clear that the circuit court has general original jurisdiction in matters of law and equity, including jurisdiction to issue declaratory judgments, its jurisdiction is not limitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Article 6, \u00a7 13 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\"The circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters <em>not prohibited by law. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">MCLA 600.605; MSA 27A.605 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\"Circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear and determine all civil claims and remedies, <em>except where exclusive jurisdiction is given </em>in the constitution or <em>by statute to some other court or where the circuit courts are denied jurisdiction by the </em>constitution or <em>statutes of this state. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">To the foregoing emphasized exceptions this Court has earlier and repeatedly added those cases in which the defendant is by its sovereignty suit-immune. <em>Lucking v People, </em>320 Mich 495; 31 NW2d 707 (1948); <em>Manion v State Highway Commissioner, supra; Missouri Tie &amp; Lumber Co v Sullivan, </em>275 Mich 26; 265 NW 779 (1936); <em>McDowell v Warden of Reformatory, supra; People ex rel Ayres v Board of State Auditors, </em>42 Mich 422; 4 NW 274 (1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Thus it is well settled that the circuit court is without jurisdiction to entertain an action against the State of Michigan unless that jurisdiction shall have been acquired by legislative consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In 1939, with enactment of the Court of Claims Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Legislature, for the first time, adopted a comprehensive legislative scheme authorizing suit against the State of Michigan and its various agencies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prior to that time the Legislature had permitted suit only against a few selected state agencies and then only for limited periods.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Save for these scattered exceptions, until 1939 the state could not be sued because the requisite legislative consent had not been given. <em>McDowell v Warden of Reformatory, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Today the Court of Claims Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> stands as this state\u2019s controlling legislative expression of waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity from direct action suit against it and its agencies and of their submission to the jurisdiction of a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">It is controlling because in addition to authorizing suit against the state, the act also limits any prior legislative authorization which may be inconsistent with the act. Those scattered legislative expressions waiving the state\u2019s suit immunity which were enacted prior to the original Court of Claims Act must be construed within the terms and in light of the subsequent act. Such construction is mandated by the sweeping language of the act which clearly manifests the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit its authorization to suits in the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of Claims. So construed, the Court of Claims Act is both permissive and restrictive. This Court has heretofore applied this rationale to post-Court of Claims Act legislation waiving suit immunity by holding that the scope of any such authorization is limited by the terms and conditions of jurisdiction established in the Court of Claims Act. <em>Hirych v State Fair Commission, </em>376 Mich 384, 390; 136 NW2d 910 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">It follows logically, therefore, that to the extent any pre-Court of Claims Act authorization of suit may exceed the jurisdictional limitations imposed by the Court of Claims Act, the former is superseded and limited by the latter. To the extent inconsistent with our opinion today, <em>Hunt v State Highway Commissioner, </em>350 Mich 309; 86 NW2d 345 (1957), is expressly overruled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We have heretofore held that a statutory relinquishment of common-law sovereign immunity from suit must be strictly construed. <em>Manion v State Highway Commissioner, supra, </em>19. Thus a cause of action brought pursuant to a waiver of suit immunity must be of a nature and in a forum permitted by the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The Court of Claims Act is manifestly a narrowly limited waiver of suit immunity. It restricts by its terms the kinds of claims which may be brought, creates a previously nonexistent court of limited jurisdiction wherein such claims may be prosecuted, and declares the new forum to have exclusive jurisdiction to hear them.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The pertinent section of the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\"(1) Except as provided in section 6440, the jurisdiction of the court of claims as conferred upon it by this chapter over claims and demands against the state or any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies, shall be <em>exclusive. </em>The state administrative board is hereby vested with discretionary authority upon the advice of the attorney general, to hear, consider, determine and allow any claim against the state in an amount less than $100.00. Any claim so allowed by the state administrative board shall be paid in the same manner as judgments are paid under section 6458 upon certific\u00e1tion of the said allowed claim by the secretary of the state administrative board to the clerk of the court of claims. The court has power and jurisdiction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\"(a) To hear and determine all claims and demands, liquidated and unliquidated, ex contractu and ex delicto, against the state and any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCLA 600.6419; MSA 27A.6419.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">This Court has previously recognized the limited scope of the Court of Claims Act as a waiver of sovereign suit immunity, in holding that court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>be without \"the broad and inherent powers of a constitutional court of general jurisdiction\u201d. <em>Taylor v Auditor General, </em>360 Mich 146, 150; 103 NW2d 769 (1960).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In sharply restricting the causes of action which may be brought against the state and in creating a new court of limited and exclusive jurisdiction solely for that purpose, the Legislature indicated with ringing clarity that its waiver of sovereign suit immunity under the Court of Claims Act was limited to the prosecution of claims within the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">We hold, for the foregoing reasons, that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs suit for judicial review and declaratory judgment under the Administrative Procedures Act, or declaratory judgment under GCR 1963, 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-9\">Coleman and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> A meeting of the parties\u2019 representatives was held at the highway department\u2019s Detroit <em>office on </em>April 4, 1973.

Thereafter the highway commissioner attempted to renege on the agreement to pay the plaintiffs some $97,500 after the plaintiffs had indebted themselves upon a $30,600 bank loan in order to acquire a new site for their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">This Court appeared to rest its approval of the circuit court\u2019s exercise of equitable jurisdiction on three grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">1. That by authorizing the highway commissioner to make contracts in connection with the purchase of lands and expend funds appropriate for that purpose the Legislature waived the state\u2019s (highway commissioner\u2019s) suit immunity in connection therewith;</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">2. That the action at law available to the plaintiffs in the Court of Claims was, <em>in that case, </em>an inadequate remedy; and</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">3. That upon being sued in equity in the circuit court the defendant highway commissioner filed a cross-claim (nowadays a counterclaim) alleging fraud and seeking revision of the agreement and in so doing \u201csubmitted himself to the jurisdiction and thereby cast aside the vestments of immunity\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">How the court could be vested with subject-matter jurisdiction it did not otherwise have by a party (the state via its agent) \u201c[submitting] himself to the jurisdiction\u201d was not explained by the Court in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\"> In <em>Taylor v Auditor General, </em>this Court declared that the Court of Claims was without the jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment. This conclusion was premised on the fact that the declaratory judgment act did not authorize the rendition of declaratory judgments by any and all courts of record, but only those which had a law side and an equity side. Since the Court of Claims \"does not possess the broad and inherent powers of a constitutional court of general jurisdiction\u201d, in other words does not have an \"equity side\u201d, it could not render a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">With the repeal of the declaratory judgment act, 1948 CL 691.501, by the Revised Judicature Act, MCLA 600.9901; MSA 27A.9901, the former language which restricted the power to render declaratory judgments to those courts which have both an equity side and a law side is no longer controlling. However, because the power of the Court of Claims is not at issue in this case, we decline to decide whether the Court of Claims is now empowered to render declaratory judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b410-10\">Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASd\"><em>(concurring). </em>I have signed Justice Ryan\u2019s opinion because I agree \"that \u00a7 1.04.03(c) of the 1970 Standard Specifications for Highway Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>struction is not an agency rule within the meaning of \u00a7 7 of the Administrative Procedures Act\u201d. I also agree that \"the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain the complaint for declaratory relief\u2019. Under the circumstances of this case, plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">I write to emphasize several points.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">First, there has been no showing that the highway department\u2019s use of standard specifications was an attempt to evade or circumvent the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Second, adopting Justice Levin\u2019s analysis would permit plaintiff's to institute parallel actions against the state \u2014 one in the circuit court, another in the Court of Claims. Recent experience has demonstrated how confusing and time consuming such a procedure can be. See <em>In re Weldon, </em>397 Mich 225; 244 NW2d 827 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Third, Justice Levin\u2019s analysis would force state agencies either to discard standard specifications or move to adopt them as rules under the APA. The former is inefficient, costly in both time and money. The latter is cumbersome and would subject the policy and contract decisions of state agencies to frequent circuit court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">This last point is of great concern to me. Our decision cannot be limited to the highway department. It would apply to all the many agencies of state government. It would significantly increase the caseload of an already overburdened circuit court. Delay, confusion, frustration are predictable.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">It is not necessary to rely on the circuit courts for a proper forum in which to resolve disputes between contractors and a state department. The Legislature has provided a forum \u2014 the Court of Claims. It has exclusive jurisdiction \"[t]o hear and determine all claims and demands * * * against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the state and any of its departments\u201d.

Its \"[p]ractice and procedure * * * shall be in accordance with the statutes and court rules prescribing the practice in the circuit courts\u201d. MCLA 600.6422; MSA 27A.6422.

It has acted in good faith. The circuit court did assume jurisdiction. Greenfield had no reason to believe it was in the wrong forum.

When construction commenced the water level was approximately 2' higher than at the time the plans were prepared by the Department of State Highways and .4' higher than the stated historic high water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Greenfield commenced this action in the circuit court asserting that the highway department\u2019s denial of its claim seeking additional compensation for changed physical conditions was subject to judicial review as a declaratory ruling under the Administrative Procedures Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circuit court held that it was not empowered to review the denial under the APA but, acting under its general judicial power, entered a declaratory judgment that Greenfield is entitled to additional compensation, the amount to be determined in the Court of Claims. The Court of Appeals agreed that circuit court review was not available under the APA but reversed the declaratory judgment on the ground that the Court of Claims has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of claims and demands against the state and its departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Three of our colleagues would affirm the Court of Appeals decision that Greenfield is not entitled to judicial relief, in advance of performance of its contract with the highway department, in the circuit court, whether by review under the APA of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the department\u2019s denial of Greenfield\u2019s claim, or by original action for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The opinion signed by three of our colleagues states that because the provisions invoked by Greenfield in seeking additional compensation for changed physical conditions are expressed as standard contract provisions and were not promulgated in the manner required by the APA they do not constitute a \"rule\u201d and therefore the department\u2019s denial of additional compensation was not a declaratory ruling under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We are of the opinion that the provisions invoked by Greenfield are nevertheless a \"rule\u201d and that the department\u2019s denial of Greenfield\u2019s claim for additional compensation was a declaratory ruling. We would remand to the circuit court for judicial review, pursuant to the APA, of the department\u2019s denial of Greenfield\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Our colleagues\u2019 opinion further states that the circuit court erred in asserting jurisdiction, apart from the APA, to grant a declaratory judgment against a department of state government. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">We would place our concurrence in that result solely on the ground \u2014 the basis of the Court of Appeals opinion on this issue \u2014 that the Court of Claims, under its enabling act, has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of an original action asserting a claim or demand against a department of state government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since this action for a declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>tory judgment asserts a claim against a department of state government, it cannot be maintained in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We would, additionally, hold, however, that because of revisions of the statute and court rules regarding declaratory judgments after <em>Taylor v Auditor General, </em>360 Mich 146; 103 NW2d 769 (1960), was decided, the Court of Claims has jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment regarding a claim or demand against the state or a department of state government.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">This Court\u2019s action in vacating the declaratory judgment granted by the circuit court, based on the exclusivity of the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims of an original action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asserting a claim or demand against a department of state government, should be without prejudice to Greenfield\u2019s seeking a declaratory judgment in the Court of Claims,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> subject to whatever limitations the doctrines of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>exhaustion of administrative remedies, res judicata and related principles may impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Greenfield\u2019s claim to circuit court review under the APA is based primarily<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on its contention that the highway department\u2019s denial of its claim for additional compensation was a declaratory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The APA provides that on request of an \"interested person, an agency may issue a declaratory ruling as to the applicability to an actual state of facts of a statute administered by the agency or of a rule or order of the agency\u201d, and that \"[a] declaratory ruling is subject to judicial review in the same manner as an agency final decision or order in a contested case\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Greenfield\u2019s claim raises the following issues:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>I. Is the standard contract provision concerning claims for additional compensation for changed physical conditions a \"rule\u201d within the meaning of the APA?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">II. Was the decision of the highway department denying Greenfield\u2019s claim a \"declaratory ruling\u201d? If it was, shall the judicial review provided by the APA be in the circuit court or in the Court of Claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The threshold issue is whether the invoked provisions of the standard specifications for highway construction contracts constitute a \"rule\u201d although those provisions are embodied in a contract and were not promulgated in accordance with the notice and comment procedures of the APA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">An APA rule may be substantive or procedural or both. The act provides that a \"regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling or instruction\u201d is a rule if either (i) it has \"general applicability\u201d and \"implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency\u201d, or (ii) it \"prescribes the organization, procedure or practice of the agency\u201d. (See part B and fn 25, <em>infra, </em>for full text of the definition.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The standard contract provisions regarding claims for additional compensation for changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>physical conditions have both a substantive and a procedural content:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u2014They create a right and impose a duty to apply to the department, before commencement of the work, for an increase in compensation because of any asserted change in physical conditions \u2014 the substantive element.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u2014They also establish a procedure by which the merits can be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The provisions invoked by Greenfield state that should a contractor encounter \"physical conditions at the site differing materially from those shown in the contract and included documents\u201d increased compensation will be allowed if the engineer finds that \"the work required materially changes the character of the work\u201d and the work required is of sufficient magnitude to affect the unit cost by 10% or more.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is further provided that failure of the contractor to notify the engineer of such a claim will generally be considered a waiver of claim for extra compensation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The engineer\u2019s decision is appealable to the central office adjustment board, an informal panel that advises the director of the department on claims of contractors for additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The Attorney General states that these standard contract provisions embody the \"procedures used by the department to process claims for extra compensation\u201d and that in seeking additional compensation Greenfield \"followed established procedures\u201d.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It therefore appears that without regard to whether these provisions are seen as a substantive statement of \"general applicability, which implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency\u201d, they at least concern \"procedure or practice of the agency\u201d and therefore, on that basis alone, are within the APA\u2019s definition of the term \"rule\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">These standard contract provisions are additionally, however, a substantive statement of general applicability which \"implements\u201d law administered by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The highway department is specifically<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> empow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ered to adopt rules \"to implement its powers and this act, in accordance with the provisions of\u2019 the APA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is thus empowered to adopt so-called legislative rules having the force of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The primary function of the highway department is to design, produce, maintain and operate highways and ancillary facilities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The department\u2019s substantive decisions of general applicability regarding implementation of its powers and functions in the design and production of highways and ancillary facilities determine the highways and facilities that will be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Thus, while this agency of state government does not, in the ordinary sense, promulgate policies for the governance and guidance of the citizenry, it is nevertheless a policy maker, determining the design and manner of production, maintenance and operation of highways and ancillary facilities. The department\u2019s substantive decisions of general applicability, implementing the law it administers, are \"rules\u201d however or wherever expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The department\u2019s substantive decisions regarding the design and production of highways and ancillary facilities are expressed in elaborate detail in bound, printed volumes containing hundreds of pages,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> one relating to the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>highways, another to bridges, and so forth.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since those decisions apply to the design and production of all highways and ancillary facilities they are of general applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Unless the highway department enters the construction business it cannot build highways without contractors. Disparities between anticipated and actual physical conditions occur with sufficient frequency so that the department has adopted substantive policies and procedures regarding claims for changed physical conditions which provide a means of resolving disputes with contractors. Those policies and procedures are as fully binding on contractors as formal rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">While comparable provisions are not uncommon in private contracting it is the legislative judgment that when an agency of state government adopts substantive policies of general applicability that implement or apply law enforced or administered by it or establishes practice and procedure that the safeguards set forth in the APA are necessary for the protection of those affected by the agency\u2019s action. This legislative judgment recognizes that, although there are some private enterprises and institutions which may be able to fend for themselves, most persons confronted by agency action are relatively powerless. That imbalance between most agencies and most persons obtains whether the form in which the agency exerts its law-imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>menting power is formal rule making, secret rule making or contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The Legislature in adopting the APA, the people in providing for judicial review of certain agency decisions (see fn 35 and accompanying text, <em>infra), </em>did not intend that the safeguards established for their protection could be readily avoided by ignoring the requirements for rule making and incorporating law-implementing decisions of general applicability in contracts with those who are affected by the agency\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Michigan\u2019s APA, modeled<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on the uniform act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in turn based on the Federal act,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> does not, in contrast with the Federal act,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> contain a contract exception exempting from the generality of the act\u2019s definition of the term \"rule\u201d expressions of agency policy, practice and procedure, otherwise within that definition, respecting governmental contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The absolute exemption in the Federal APA for expressions of policy respecting governmental contracting has been criticized as promoting insularity and irresponsibility of government agencies.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Administrative Conference of the United States urged repeal of the contract exception. The conference saw, as did the ABA House of Dele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>gates subsequently, that the selection and wording of contract clauses have a significant impact on the public and on private enterprise.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The first part of the Michigan \"rule\u201d definition expresses its scope in broadly inclusive terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\"[A]n agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling or instruction of general applicability, which implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or which prescribes the organization, procedure or practice of the agency, including the amendment, suspension or rescission thereof * * * .\u201d MCLA 24.207; MSA 3.560(107).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The second part of the definition is a series of specific exclusions from the broader concept,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> none of which are here pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The broad general definition with specific exceptions indicates that the definition is to be applied comprehensively. An agency statement within the first part of the definition and not excepted in the s\u00e9cond part is a \"rule\u201d. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which has an APA comparable to Michigan\u2019s, has not recognized a contract exception.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The generality of \"statement\u201d indicates that the form in which the pronouncement is made is without significance. Other states, applying similar definitions, have refused to allow the form of the pronouncement to defeat the breadth of the definition.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is not dispositive that the agency does not call its statement a rule. \"[T]he label that the particular agency puts upon its given exercise of administrative power is not, for our purposes, conclusive; rather, it is what the agency does in fact.\u201d <em>Lewis-Mota v Secretary of Labor, </em>469 F2d 478, 481-482 (CA 2, 1972).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The Attorney General states that \"to the best of the appellee\u2019s knowledge, no state in the nation considers such specifications to be administrative rules and regulations or has promulgated said specifications as administrative rules and regulations\u201d. The Iowa State Highway Department, however, regards such specifications, including procedures for awarding additional compensation for changed physical conditions, as administrative rules and regulations requiring promulgation in conformity with Iowa\u2019s APA.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The omission in the uniform and Michigan acts of a contract exception appears to have been deliberate and indicates that there is no general exception for law-implementing agency statements merely because they are in the form of standard contract provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">All provisions of a governmental contract are not subject to the APA. APA requirements do not apply to contract provisions which are unrelated to the application or implementation of law enforced or administered by the agency or which do not prescribe agency practice and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Rules have the effect of law because they are legislatively authorized expressions by the agency in the exercise of delegated power to apply or implement the law. A contract or contract provision relating to a commodity manufactured and produced without regard to the needs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>agency or concerning a housekeeping matter affecting only in a subsidiary or ancillary manner the discharge of the agency\u2019s primary function and the law it administers would not ordinarily have that quality.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The standard contract provisions regarding claims for additional compensation for changed physical conditions provide a means of promptly resolving disputes with contractors which may otherwise impede timely completion of the work, and are closely related to implementation of the highway department\u2019s primary function of designing, producing, maintaining and operating highways and ancillary facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The APA seeks to bring law and order to agencies in the exercise of delegated power to enforce and implement statutory law. There is no reason to suppose that the Legislature intended that an agency which can express policy of general applicability applying or implementing statutory law it enforces or administers or its practice or procedure through contracting, rather than formal rule making subject to the requirements and safeguards of the APA, should be able thereby to exempt itself from those requirements and safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The standard contract provisions regarding claims for additional compensation for changed physical conditions so closely relate to the primary function of the highway department that they are rules although incorporated as part of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The APA provisions subjecting to judicial review declaratory rulings regarding the application of an agency rule to an actual state of facts<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>avoided by stating an agency\u2019s substantive policy or its procedure and practice in the form of a standard contract provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">While the APA provides that a rule is not valid unless promulgated in accordance with its notice and comment provisions,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> that proscription merely bars an agency from attempting to enforce against a citizen a substantive or procedural expression, otherwise a rule, not so promulgated. It does not permit an agency to avoid altogether the operative effect of the APA by the simple expedient of ignoring the act and failing to promulgate such expressions in accordance with its provisions. The highway department\u2019s failure to promulgate expressions of agency policy, practice and procedure in accordance with the APA requirements does not preclude enforcement against the department.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">A holding of this Court that only those substantive and procedural expressions which the agency chooses to promulgate in conformity with the APA are rules would, contrary to the purpose and spirit of the APA, encourage agencies not to promulgate as rules statements of policy structuring and limiting the scope of agency discretion except insofar as the agency must do so because it seeks to limit the future conduct of the citizenry and, because of the nature of the agency\u2019s functions, such a prospective limitation cannot be expressed contractually.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The highway department promulgates its standard specifications with industry participation in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>manner paralleling the APA requirements for rule making. The Attorney General states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">\"Because of changing circumstances, new methods and materials and difficulties or disputes encountered by the highway department and contractors in carrying out previous projects, <em>the standard speci\u00f1cations are periodically reviewedupdated and revised. </em>Such review and revision is often accomplished by the appellee highway department <em>in consultation with road building and contractor associations and groups\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The standard contract provisions were published, although not in the Administrative Code. See fn 17 and accompanying text, <em>supra. </em>The relevant public has been made aware of the policies and procedures followed by the highway department in deciding claims for additional compensation for changed physical conditions. See fn 11 and accompanying text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The rule making and declaratory ruling provisions of the APA seek to provide public participation in policy formulation and external review of administrative action to avoid discriminatory and unreasonable enforcement. The act seeks to achieve those goals by requiring agencies to articulate and publish in advance their policies and by providing a measure of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Some agencies have steadfastly resisted implementation of those legislative goals, and have sought by one formulation or another to except themselves from the act. Since many APA safeguards apply only to governmental decisions denominated rules, agencies wishing to avoid the act may fail formally to promulgate rules reflecting policy decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The highway department has not formally adopted and published in the Administrative Code any rules regarding the design, production, maintenance and operation of highways and ancillary facilities, or rules of procedure and practice.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It has been able to operate effectively without formal rule making, implementing its powers and functions in the administration of a budget of over three-quarters of a billion dollars a year, because it is able to effectuate so many of its essential policy decisions through contracting. If the department\u2019s claims are sustained then it will be effectively relieved of compliance with APA requirements in the exercise of the bulk of its law-implementing functions, and a precedent will be set for other agencies to emulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In construing legislation we seek to serve the legislative purpose. Carving out from the broad general definition of \"rule\u201d a judge-made exception for contracting and statements of governmental policy not duly promulgated in compliance with the APA will not serve the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The Constitution provides that \"[a]ll final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>by law\u201d.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In denying Greenfield\u2019s claim the highway department effectively made a \"final decision\u201d that Greenfield would not obtain administrative relief before performing the contract.

In <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41, 49; 247 NW2d 512 (1976), we held \"that the traditional common-law judge-made immunity that the state and its instrumentalities heretofore enjoyed from its torts should be and it hereby is abrogated\u201d. This Court earlier ruled that \"governmental immunity is not a defense to a claim against the State for contractual liability arising out of either governmental or proprietary operations\u201d. <em>Zynda v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Aeronautics Commission, </em>372 Mich 285, 287; 125 NW2d 858 (1964).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">While the state\u2019s judge-made sovereign immunity from suit may, as held in <em>Manion, </em>\"be waived without a waiver of\u2019 the state\u2019s judge-made sovereign immunity from liability, the judge-made immunity from suit cannot survive the abrogation of the judge-made immunity from liability for torts and contracts. Abrogation of the immunity from liability would be pointless if the immunity from suit were retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Be that as it may, and even if it were thought that there are vestiges of the judge-made immunity from suit still extant, the consent to suit in the Court of Claims extends to rendition of a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">This Court declared in <em>Taylor v Auditor General, </em>360 Mich 146, 150-151; 103 NW2d 769 (1960), that the Court of Claims \"derives its powers only from the legislative act of its creation and does not possess the broad and inherent powers of a constitutional court of general jurisdiction\u201d, and concluded that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment. In so holding, this Court said that the declaratory judgment act<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> did \"not authorize the rendition of declaratory judgments by any and all 'courts of record\u2019 \u201d but only those which had both an equity and a law side of the court. Since the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Claims did not have an \"equity side\u201d it could not render a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The declaratory judgment act was repealed by the Revised Judicature Act,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and can no longer be regarded as expressing a legislative purpose to restrict the power to render declaratory judgments to only those courts which have both an \"equity side\u201d and a \"law side\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The new court rules abolish \"procedural distinctions between law and equity. [Citations omitted.] Under the new rules the action for declaratory judgment is simply filed on the civil docket; it is not filed on the law or equity side of the docket\u201d.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The absence of an \"equity side\u201d in the Court of Claims no longer precludes it from rendering a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Nor does the Court of Claims Act evidence any purpose to deprive that court of the power to render a declaratory judgment. While it is a court of limited jurisdiction, its powers and jurisdiction subject to legislative control,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> the act\u2019s generally worded statement that the court shall have \"power and jurisdiction * * * [t]o hear and determine all claims and demands, liquidated and unliquidated, ex contractu and ex delicto, against the state and any of its departments\u201d does not exclude power and jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The subject matter of declaratory judgments is now covered by a court rule, which provides that \"[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, any circuit court of this state may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party\u201d. GCR 1963, 521.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The Court of Claims Act provides that \"[practice and procedure in the court of claims shall be in accordance with the statutes and court rules prescribing the practice in the circuit courts of this state, except as herein otherwise provided. The supreme court shall have the power to make special rules for said court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Statutory and court rule provisions authorizing the rendition of declaratory judgments are regarded as matters of practice and procedure and are not jurisdictional.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Pursuant to the statutorily conferred power to make special rules regarding the Court of Claims, this Court has promulgated rules for that court. Court of Claims Rule 4 provides that except as provided in the Court of Claims Act itself \"[t]he practice and procedure of this court shall be in accordance with the rules prescribing the practice and procedure in the circuit courts of this state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">It therefore appears from both the Court of Claims Act and the special rules promulgated by this Court for that court that the General Court Rules apply to the Court of Claims as well as to the circuit courts. GCR 1963, 521, concerning declaratory judgments, applies to the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">It is not unusual to render, in the exercise of judicial discretion,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> declaratory judgments regarding the constitutionality and construction of statutes in actions involving departments and agencies of state government.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> There is often as much need to determine in advance of breach or performance of a governmental contract the rights and obligations of the parties as there is to make such a determination regarding a non-governmental contract or where there is no contract but enforcement of a statute is involved.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> A declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>rights and obligations in advance of breach or performance does not enlarge the state\u2019s monetary exposure, it merely accelerates the determination of a \"claim or demand ex contractu\u201d to which the state has already submitted itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We would hold that the Court of Claims is empowered to render a declaratory judgment concerning a claim or demand against the state or one of its departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Court of Claims, under its enabling act, has exclusive jurisdiction of an action asserting a claim or demand, ex contractu or ex delicto, against the state or one of its departments.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> While an action for a declaratory judgment involving the state need not assert a claim or demand against it \u2014and if it does not it' may, subject to other provisions of law, be brought in the circuit court<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> \u2014 an action for a declaratory judgment asserting such a claim or demand is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The judgment rendered by the circuit court declared that Greenfield is entitled to additional compensation, the amount to be determined in the Court of Claims.

J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b443-6\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqx\"><em>(to reverse). </em>This case concerns the Legislature\u2019s intention with respect to administrative and judicial protection of the affairs of citizens with state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Basically I agree with Justice Levin that the Legislature intended procedures to determine citizen rights described in the State Highway Department\u2019s standard construction contract specifications to be treated as rules under the Administrative Procedures Act (MCLA 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560[101] <em>et seq.), </em>entitling the citizen to specified due process, including a declaratory ruling and judicial review in the circuit court. I therefore can concur with parts I and II of his opinion and with his order remanding count I to the circuit court for further proceedings. As to count II, I would be forced to remand it to the highway department to give plaintiff a due process hearing on his request for extension of contract time, pointing out that as of record the plaintiff has not yet made any request upon the State Highway Department to acquire the necessary permit to remove the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Stop Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">With respect to citizen suit against an agency of government for a declaratory judgment, I concur with my colleagues who hold that the circuit court has no jurisdiction. However, I disagree with my Brother Levin who would now hold that the Court of Claims has jurisdiction with respect to a declaratory judgment. I do so for essentially two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">First, that issue has both legal and administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tive ramifications which deserve full adversary argument before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Second, my present belief is that the Legislature did not intend to remove immunity from suit in the nature of a declaratory judgment. This belief is premised upon the following four reasons. First, a declaratory judgment, as requested in this case, does not exactly fit the definition of Court of Claims jurisdiction for claims for compensation (although it can be argued the complaint is anticipatory of a claim). Second, and more importantly, the Legislature has specifically indicated in the Administrative Procedures Act how it intends such anticipatory action be handled; the act provides for due process review in the administrative agency, i.e., the tribunal most intimately concerned with the given subject matter. Third, I believe the Legislature\u2019s intention would be evaded if an aggrieved citizen were entitled to bring original suit for declaratory judgment in the Court of Claims, thereby by-passing the applicable procedures under the Administrative Procedures Act, because if an aggrieved citizen were to exhaust the Administrative Procedures Act\u2019s procedures, his action would ultimately be reviewed <em>in the circuit court. </em>Fourth, on the one hand, the Legislature, in the Administrative Procedures Act, intended to provide fair and appropriate procedures within administrative agencies, requiring agencies to act fairly and professionally; on the other hand, the Legislature did not intend the courts to be bogged down with the details of administration except on final review. As is apparent from MCLA 24.306; MSA 3.560(206), which defines the scope of court review under the Administrative Procedures Act, the Legislature did not intend courts to review these matters <em>de novo </em>and make administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>decisions on a preponderance of the evidence, which is what the Court of Claims would be doing if we held it had jurisdiction to hear declaratory judgment suits (especially where the administrative process had not been completed, as is the case here).</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-5\">Blair Moody, Jr., J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> MCLA 24.263; MSA 3.560(163).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> \"The circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters <em>not prohibited by law; </em>appellate jurisdiction from all inferior courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and tribunals except as otherwise provided by law; power to issue, hear and determine prerogative and remedial writs; supervisory and general control over inferior courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions in accordance with rules of the supreme court; and jurisdiction of other cases and matters as provided by rules of the supreme court.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 13 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> As set forth in the text accompanying fns 42 and 43, <em>infra, </em>the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims pertains to original actions, not to judicial <em>review </em>under the APA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> RJA 5856 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">\"The statutes of limitations are tolled when</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">\"(1) the complaint is filed and a copy of the summons and complaint are served on the defendant, or when</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">\"(2) jurisdiction over the defendant is otherwise acquired * * *.\u201d MCLA 600.5856; MSA 27A.5856.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">The accompanying commentary by the Joint Committee on Michigan Procedural Revision states:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">\"In the event of the dismissal, on some ground other than on the merits (as for example \u2014 lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter) of an action in which jurisdiction over the defendant is acquired, the period of time from the time of service or the acquisition of jurisdiction over the defendant until dismissal will not count as a part of the time of limitation, for during such time the statute has been tolled.
