The lien claimants were dealing with the part-owner, not with a contractor. 1929 CL 13101; <em>Smalley v Ashland Brown-Stone Co, </em>114 Mich 104 [72 NW 29 (1897)].\u201d <em>Mielis v Everts, supra, </em>p 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Burton Drywall, </em>stated that Mielis\u2019 reliance on <em>Smalley </em>\"was misplaced\u201d because:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>\u2014Smalley </em>had found that notice under the statute, as amended in 1893, \"was for the protection of the subcontractor, materialman or laborer to preserve its claim against the owner, and as such, was not a condition precedent to the lien attaching\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u2014\"it apparently escaped the attention of the <em>Mielis </em>Court\u201d that the statute had been amended to state that there was no right of lien \"unless and until\u201d notice was served.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\"><em>\u2014Webster v Cooper Development Co, </em>266 Mich 505, 507; 254 NW 186 (1934), construed \"unless and until\u201d as requiring notice as a condition precedent to the perfection of a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Smalley, </em>accordingly, \"was overruled <em>sub silentio </em>by <em>Webster. </em>Therefore, the <em>Mielis </em>exception is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>grounded on authority no longer of precedential value.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\u2014the statement in <em>Wallich Lumber Co v Golds, </em>375 Mich 323, 328; 134 NW2d 722 (1965), that \"notice is not required of a person who contracts directly with the owner. <em>Mielis v Everts, </em>264 Mich 363, 364\u201d, was obiter dictum.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>Webster </em>did not \"overrule\u201d <em>Smalley. </em>It stated only that the statute had been subsequently changed. <em>Webster </em>held that by reason of amendments of the statute, compliance with the 1929 notice proviso \"is a condition precedent to the acquisition of the lien\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In <em>Webster, </em>the lien claimant, who had furnished materials <em>to a contractor, </em>failed to file with the Register of Deeds proof of service of notice of intention to claim a lien. Since the claimant had dealt with a contractor, <em>Webster </em>did not consider the direct dealing exception recognized in <em>Mielis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">It may be, as stated by the Court of Appeals, that the <em>Mielis </em>Court overlooked the 1929 amendments and that those amendments superseded the holding in <em>Smalley </em>that service of notice was not prerequisite.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Another hypothesis is that the Court in <em>Mielis </em>was aware of the significance of the 1929 amendments and <em>Smalley </em>was cited be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>cause it inferentially recognized that the proviso has no application to one dealing directly with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><em>Smalley </em>stated that the function of notice under the 1893 proviso<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was to protect a subcontractor against a failure of the contractor with whom he dealt to list him in the sworn statement furnished the owner. A person dealing directly with the owner would have no need to protect himself against such an omission, and therefore would, have no occasion to avail himself of the opportunity to serve notice pursuant to the proviso.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The direct dealing exception is not \"judicially created\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is, rather, inherent in the language of the statute itself.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> From its inception the proviso has applied only to \u00e1 claimant furnishing labor or material \"to [for] any contractor or subcontractor\u201d. A claimant dealing directly with the owner does not furnish labor or material to or for a contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Since the proviso, as originally adopted, only required claimants to inform the owner that they were furnishing materials or performing labor and a description of the premises, it would have been pointless to require a claimant dealing directly with the owner to inform him that the claimant is furnishing materials or labor to him or to describe the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The 1929 amendments do indeed add two additional requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\u2014notice to the owner of the materialman\u2019s or laborer\u2019s intention to claim a lien (see [ii] <em>supra),</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b589-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u2014notice that he has a right to demand a sworn statement \"from such contractor or subcontractor\u201d before paying any moneys (see [iii] <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nevertheless, the proviso by its terms still applies only to a person furnishing labor or material \"to [for] a contractor or subcontractor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">A person dealing directly with an owner is not, therefore, required to provide either the 1893 notice of furnishing materials or labor or the 1929 notices of intention to claim a lien and of the owner\u2019s right to demand a sworn statement from the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Since the proviso does not apply to a person dealing directly with the owner, such a person is not required to serve \"a notice as in this section provided\u201d. Hence, that language, relied on in <em>Webster </em>and in <em>Burton Drywall, </em>does not support the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The <em>Mielis </em>construction was anticipated in treatises, apparently reflecting the understanding of the profession, written after the 1929 amendments were adopted and before that case was decided.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The rationale of the direct dealing exception is stated in <em>Wallich:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\"The reason for the notice requirement and the distinction between one who deals directly with the owner and a subcontractor, materialman, or laborer who does not, is that in the first situation the owner knows there is a claim against him, but in the second case he may be unaware of a claim without such notice.\u201d <em>Wallich Lumber Co v Golds, supra, </em>pp 328-329.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">After <em>Burton Drywall </em>was decided the amount owing to the lien claimant in that case was adjudicated in a separate action and tendered to it. After leave to appeal was granted we denied a motion to dismiss the appeal. The motion was renewed and now is again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeals created uncertainty concerning the law. The matter is of sufficient ongoing importance both to the lien claimant in that case and to the jurisprudence to warrant resolution at this time. There is the requisite adversariness that provides some assurance that the issues are properly presented.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Our disposition makes it unnecessary to consider the other issues considered in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Burton Drywall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\"><em>Burton Drywall </em>is reversed and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">We respond in the negative to the certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>question stated in the introduction to this opinion; there is a direct dealing exception.</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-5\">Kavanagh, C.J., and Williams, Coleman, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\"> 399 Mich 875 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\"> Actions to foreclose real estate mortgages are pending in the district court.

But for the explicit language, \u00a7 6 <em>by its terms </em>would apply to those dealing directly with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">A direct dealing exception is not inherent in \u00a7 6, as it is in \u00a7 1, and hence the need for explicit language in \u00a7 6 and its absence in \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">The explicit language of \u00a7 6 is derived from 1893 PA 199, \u00a7 6; 1897 CL 10715.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b588-14\"> While it may be desirable that the owner know whether one dealing directly with him intends to claim a lien, there is a reason for a distinction based on whether the mechanic\u2019s lien secures payment of an obligation which the owner incurred or whether the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>action against the owner arises under the mechanic\u2019s lien law. Where the owner deals directly with the contractor he need not he dependent on any other person for the administration of the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> Requiring that a person intending to claim a lien inform the owner of his right to demand a sworn statement from the contractor is readily understandable where the claimant dealt with the contractor and therefore may not be known to the owner. Where, however, there is no intervening contractor, the owner would have no way of exercising the right it is contended he must be informed of. It is unlikely that the Legislature would impose this requirement on all lien claimants for the general edification of owners; where there is in fact an intervening contractor the information must be provided and the owner will therefore necessarily be so informed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> \"The Register of Deeds will accept liens without the proof of service attached from general contractors, architects and material-men, where the lien states that the work was performed or the material was furnished in pursuance of a contract with the owner, since no notice at all, at any time is necessary where the lienor contracts direct with the owner, and this also applies to service of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>copy of the lien. That is, it is not necessary to serve either the fifteen-day notice or the copy of lien on the owner if the person claiming the lien was engaged by the owner, since it is obvious that if the owner hired a person, he would know about it without the service of a notice, but where a person is hired by a contractor or subcontractor, it is an altogether different matter, since the owner has no knowledge of the persons engaged by the general contractor. Hence the fifteen-day notice requirement.\u201d Smith, New Michigan Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law and How To Use It (1929), p 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\"The prerequisites to a valid lien may be stated as follows: * * * (b) A notice to the owner, where dealings are not directly with him, within fifteen days after furnishing the first material or labor is provided for under section 1 of the statute. A notice, solely for labor, is timely if given before the contractor or subcontractor furnishes sworn statement under section 4 of the act. An additional prerequisite to claim of lien is now provided by Act 264 of 1929, C.L. 1929 \u00a7 13101, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\"New Requirements of 1929 Amendment to Section 1, Applicable to Furnishings to Contractors and Subcontractors. \u2014 All furnishers of materials and performers of labor, including subcontractors, dealing with a contractor or subcontractor, and not with the owner directly, are now required to serve on the owner, etc., personally or by registered mail, a written notice of the furnishing, and its nature, calling attention to the owners\u2019 right to demand a sworn statement from the contractor or subcontractor before any payment can be required on the contract, and his right to retain funds to pay subcontractors, materialmen and laborers, and giving notice of the intention to claim a lien.\u201d Wykes, The Michigan Laws of Mechanics\u2019 Liens (2d ed, 1931), \u00a7\u00a7 39, 39(a), pp 77-78, 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">A more recent comment, in response to <em>Burton Drywall, </em>states:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\"The court\u2019s reasoning is clearly erroneous. First, the so-called 'judicial exception\u2019 to the requirement that a subcontractor had to serve a notice of intent to claim a lien upon the owner is not a judicial exception at all but, clearly and unambiguously, a statutory one. The relevant [portion] of the Act provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">\" 'that any person, firm or corporation furnishing materials or performing labor of any kind * * * shall within 90 days after the <em>furnishing </em>of the first of such materials <em>or performing </em>the first of such labor * * * <em>for any contractor or subcontractor, </em>serve on the owner * * * a written notice.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">\"The only reasonable interpretation of this statutory language is that while a claimant who furnishes material or performs labor to a contractor or subcontractor must serve notice of intent, one who furnishes or supplies to an <em>owner </em>does not have to comply with the requirement of sending to the owner a notice of intention to claim a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">\"The court based its statement that the Michigan supreme court\u2019s decision is <em>Mielis </em>was erroneous on the dubious and highly speculative proposition that the supreme court was unaware of a 1929 amendment to the mechanic\u2019s lien statute.\u201d Snider, <em>Commercial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Transactions </em>(\u00a7 V, Mechanics\u2019 Liens), 23 Wayne L Rev 423, 438 (1977) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">See also Ruffus, <em>Burton Drywall, Inc v Kaufman: Pre-Lien Notice Requirements: An Exception?, </em>1977 Detroit Col of L Rev 725.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\"> See <em>Wattles ex rel Johnson v Upjohn, </em>211 Mich 514; 179 NW 335 (1920); <em>Lafayette Dramatic Productions, Inc v Ferentz, </em>305 Mich 193; 9 NW2d 57; 145 ALR 1158 (1943); <em>Milford v People\u2019s Community Hospital Authority, </em>380 Mich 49; 155 NW2d 835 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
