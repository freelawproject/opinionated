Under our decision in <em>Goniwicha v Harkai, </em>393 Mich 255; 224 NW2d 284 (1974), it is clear that plaintiff is entitled to reinstatement of his complaint. To clarify practice in this area, however, we today publish for comment a proposed change in Rule 102, similar to that recommended by the Committee to Review and Consolidate the Court Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A complaint was filed and a summons issued on October 30, 1972, in connection with an automobile accident between plaintiff and defendant on April 6, 1970. Plaintiff attempted to serve defendant under the nonresident motorist statute, but was unsuccessful. On August 7, 1973, however, plaintiff did obtain personal service on the defendant in Muncie, Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Subsequently, on September 19, 1973, the clerk of the circuit court entered an order dismissing the case without prejudice under GCR 1963, 102.5. Plaintiff\u2019s October 18, 1973 motion to set aside the dismissal was denied by the circuit judge, as was a second motion to set aside the dismissal based on <em>Goniwicha. </em>The Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Goniwicha </em>and affirmed. 70 Mich App 456; 245 NW2d 787 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">GCR 1963, 102.4 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\"No summons shall be valid for longer than 180 days from the date of the filing of the complaint with the court. Duplicate summons shall not have the effect of extending the expiration of the original summons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">GCR 1963, 102.5 provides for dismissal of an action if a defendant is not served within 180 days from the filing of the complaint; the clerk is to \"automatically enter an order of dismissal\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In <em>Goniwicha, </em>service occurred more than 180 days after filing of the complaint and issuance of the summons, but before the clerk dismissed. The circuit judge later granted an accelerated judgment on the basis of subrules 102.4 and 102.5, This Court peremptorily reversed. The language of the order does not discuss 102.4, but does include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">\"While amended Rule 102 obliges the clerk of the court to dismiss a complaint upon the expiration of 180 days from the date of the filing of the complaint and provides that he shall 'automatically enter an order of dismissal\u2019, the rule is not self-executing and until the clerk in fact dismisses the complaint, the complaint is not dismissed.\u201d 393 Mich 257.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Goniwicha </em>is controlling; the Court of Appeals erred in failing to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Plaintiff urges us to continue the <em>Goniwicha </em>rule that a summons is valid until the clerk enters a dismissal, despite the language of Rule 102.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Committee to Review and Consolidate the Court Rules has been critical of <em>Goniwicha:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\"><em>\"Goniwicha </em>held that GCR 102.5 was not self-executing. If the clerk did not enter a dismissal, none occurred. The rule created an administrative nightmare for the court clerks, and left the rights of the parties dependent on the administrative operations of the clerk\u2019s office. This situation was inequitable and unsatisfactory.\u201d 402A Mich 96 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Consequently, the committee has recommended a revised form of Rule 102 which specifically includes the provisions that \"Failure of the clerk to enter an order of dismissal does not continue an action deemed dismissed\u201d. Proposed MCR 2.102E(2). We have been convinced by the committee\u2019s presentation that the rule should be changed and that when a change is adopted, <em>Goniwicha </em>should no longer be followed. We have therefore incorporated the committee\u2019s recommendation into a proposed amended Rule 102. We have, however, placed a one-year limit on the period for which a judge may extend the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The proposed amendment to GCR 1963, 102 and DCR 102 is published for comment under GCR 1963, 933, as an appendix to this opinion. Comments should be forwarded to the clerk within 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>days after the rule is published in the Michigan Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b615-6\">Kavanagh, C.J., and Williams, Levin, Coleman, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">GCR 1963, 102.
