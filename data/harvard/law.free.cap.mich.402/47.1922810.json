The first trial commenced July 30, 1973. On the first day of that trial \u2014 after the prosecution had called all the witnesses who were to testify at the second trial, with the exception of the officer in charge of the case, who at the second trial testified solely with regard to unsuccessful efforts to produce two res gestae witnesses \u2014 the people called Tommy McBride. McBride had also been charged with the commission of the offense but was not bound over for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s direct examination was devoted entirely to eliciting a statement made by McBride to the police. McBride recognized his signature on the statement, but could not recall making it. He said that he was under the influence of narcotics during and immediately after his arrest. The statement inculpated Benton and was read into the record in the form of a question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no objection by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Cross-examination explored the extent of McBride\u2019s drug intoxication at the time the statement was made. On redirect, McBride asserted that the statement was untrue. The truth was that a man had run up to the car in which, immediately after the robbery, he and Benton were seated and threw a pistol and wallet into the back seat of the car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>At the beginning of the second day of trial, the judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>declared a mistrial. She said that the prosecutor had improperly impeached McBride, that McBride\u2019s testimony was prejudicial to Benton and that a cautionary instruction would not be efficacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Benton\u2019s second trial began October 1, 1973. His motion to dismiss on the ground that he had previously been placed in jeopardy on the same charge was denied. He was convicted and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">It is established that if the defendant himself moves for or consents to the declaration of a mistrial he will ordinarily be deemed to have waived any double jeopardy claim. In determining whether the defendant has consented to a mistrial, the United States Supreme Court declared, in a case where the defendant\u2019s mistrial motion was assertedly occasioned by judicial error,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \"[t]he important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed\u201d. <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>424 US 600, 607-609; 96 S Ct 1075; 47 L Ed 2d 267 (1976). This Court, on the authority of <em>Dinitz, </em>has declared that the defendant must \"do something positively in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>indicate he or she is exercising that primary control\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s silence or failure to object to a declaration of mistrial does not constitute the requisite affirmative showing on the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In the instant case, there is no indication that Benton or his counsel consented to a mistrial and there is substantial evidence that his counsel objected. In declaring a mistrial, the judge relied on <em>United States v Compton, </em>365 F2d 1 (CA 6, 1966), where counsel for a witness called by the government had advised the court that the witness would claim the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and, over objection, the government read into the record in the form of a question a purported statement given by the witness to the FBI. It appears that counsel for Benton may have argued that <em>Compton </em>was distinguishable because McBride had not asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege: \"I just wanted the court to note my objection raised yesterday as to this Fifth Amendment argument.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In declaring a mistrial, the judge in the instant case said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\"And the Court is mindful, also, of the case of <em>People v Grimmett </em>[388 Mich 590; 202 NW2d 278 (1972)], where it indicated that, at least in general terms, if a mistrial were declared without the consent of the defendant that the defendant could not be tried under the abiding principle of double jeopardy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">It is apparent that the judge was aware that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>was declaring a mistrial without Benton\u2019s consent and that, indeed, her action gave rise to an arguable defense of double jeopardy. She concluded, nevertheless, that she would declare a mistrial because the circumstances caused \"the court to feel it was manifestly necessary to declare a mistrial in this cause because [of] the plain error which erroneously did occur\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The governing standard, manifest necessity, was enunciated in <em>United States v Perez, </em>22 US (9 Wheat) 579, 580; 6 L Ed 165 (1824): \"[T]he law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\"Manifest necessity\u201d has escaped precise formulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has followed an uncertain course in applying <em>Perez. </em>In <em>Gori v United States, </em>367 US 364, 369; 81 S Ct 1523; 6 L Ed 2d 901 (1961), the Court declared that a <em>sua sponte </em>mistrial did not bar retrial if the mistrial had been declared \"in the sole interest of the defendant\u201d. Subsequently the Court declared that the <em>Gori </em>test \"does not adequately satisfy the policies underpinning the double jeopardy provision\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470, 483; 91 S Ct 547; 27 L Ed 2d 543 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Jorn </em>requires that the judge consider viable alternative curative measures before <em>sua sponte </em>declaring a mistrial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As stated in <em>Dinitz, </em>quoting from <em>Jorn, </em>in the absence of a motion by a defendant for a mistrial, \" 'the <em>Perez </em>doctrine of manifest necessity stands as a command to trial judges not to foreclose the defendant\u2019s option until a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion leads to the conclusion that the ends of public justice would not be served by a continuation of the proceedings\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In <em>Illinois v Somerville, </em>410 US 458, 464, 471; 93 S Ct 1066; 35 L Ed 2d 425 (1973), the Court ruled that there was manifest necessity where under local law a defect in the indictment was not curable by amendment and could not be waived by the defendant\u2019s failure to object: \"A trial judge properly exercises his discretion to declare a mistrial if an impartial verdict cannot be reached, or if a verdict of conviction * * * would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reconciled <em>Somerville </em>and <em>Jorn </em>in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>\"Somerville </em>holds, then, that the double jeopardy clause will not bar retrial even though the examination of alternatives mandated by <em>Jorn </em>is not undertaken if to do so would be futile because clearly no reasonable alternative existed.\u201d <em>United States v Grasso, </em>552 F2d 46, 52, fn 2 (CA 2, 1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We turn to a consideration of whether the nature of the defect in the proceedings was such that if a guilty verdict had been rendered at the first trial the conviction \"would have [had] to be reversed on appeal\u201d <em>(Somerville, supra, </em>p 464)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and whether, if the defect was not so pervasive, a \"scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion\u201d would have revealed a less drastic remedy than declaration of a mistrial <em>(Jorn, supra, </em>pp 484-485).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The procedural defect here would not have required reversal had Benton been convicted at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">While a prosecutor is obliged to call res gestae witnesses and, therefore, does not vouch for their credibility and may impeach them \"the same as though such witnesses had been called by the respondent\u201d, MCLA 767.40a; MSA 28.980(1), a prosecutor is not obliged to call an accomplice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \"Absent [such] obligation, a witness thus called becomes the people\u2019s witness and subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>settled rules concerning the examination of any witness voluntarily called by either party.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">McBride, along with Benton, had been charged with commission of the armed robbery and, therefore, may properly be characterized as an accomplice. (If he is not regarded as an accomplice, what occurred would, because of the prosecutor\u2019s undoubted right to impeach res gestae witnesses whom he is obliged to call, have been less objectionable.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Proceeding on the assumption that McBride was an accomplice, the prosecutor could not properly impeach him (his own witness) by use of a prior statement,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the error was compounded by launching the impeachment without a foundation in the form of inconsistent direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Although what occurred was improper, it does not follow that there was manifest necessity for declaration of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In affirming Benton\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals said that if a mistrial had not been declared and Benton had been found guilty he \"would certainly have <em>assigned </em>such a failure as error on appeal\u201d (emphasis supplied). The accuracy of that assumption is debatable; be that as it may, manifest necessity does not arise because the defendant may, providently or improvidently, assign error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The history of adjudication in the Court of Appeals demonstrates that if Benton had been convicted at the first trial it is unlikely that his conviction would have been reversed because of the defect perceived by the judge. In <em>People v Coates, </em>40 Mich App 212, 214; 198 NW2d 837 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(1972), and <em>People v St Onge, </em>63 Mich App 16, 18-19; 233 NW2d 874 (1975), the Court of Appeals, recognizing that it is improper for a prosecutor to impeach an accomplice whom he calls, declined to consider the issue because of failure to preserve the issue for appeal by objection. Benton\u2019s counsel did not object to the improper examination of McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Compton </em>was misplaced. In that case, the prosecutor knew that the witness would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate himself<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and defense counsel objected to the questioning. McBride did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege; he testified freely on both direct and cross-examination without objection by Benton\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">We conclude that, although the direct examination was improper and there was a defect in the proceedings, it is improbable that Benton would on that account have obtained a reversal on appeal if he had been convicted at his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">There was a less drastic alternative which a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion would have revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The power to discharge a jury before a verdict should be exercised \"with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes\u201d. <em>United States v Perez, supra, </em>p 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">\"[W]here the judge, acting without the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ant\u2019s consent, aborts the proceeding, the defendant has been deprived of his 'valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v Jorn, supra, </em>p 484. Before a trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>declares a mistrial he or she should make explicit findings, after a hearing on the record, that no reasonable alternative exists.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In the instant case there was no record of any discussion with counsel of the efficacy of alternative curative measures. A thorough consideration of the situation with counsel would have revealed that the impropriety of confronting McBride with his inconsistent statement on direct was mitigated by his subsequent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The impropriety appears to have been primarily in the order of proof. McBride\u2019s prior statement might have been admissible to impeach his apparently unexpected testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, it would have been in order to give a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>cautionary instruction on the limited use for which an inconsistent statement may be used.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In contrast with <em>People v White, </em>401 Mich 482; 257 NW2d 912 (1977), it does not appear that the prosecutor knew that the witness would testify in a manner inconsistent with his earlier statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The declaration of a mistrial \"entailed not only a delay for the defendant, but also operated as a post-jeopardy continuance to allow the prosecution an opportunity to strengthen its case\u201d. <em>Illinois v Somerville, supra, </em>p 469. At the subsequent trial the prosecutor did not call McBride; the defense did. The mistrial thereby relieved the prosecutor of the embarrassment of having his own witness exculpate the defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Further, at the first trial the prosecution could not produce two witnesses. The delay occasioned by the declaration of a mistrial gave the police an added opportunity to search for the missing witnesses. While the search in this case proved fruitless, nevertheless, this illustrates the possible advantages to the prosecution of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The possible advantages to the prosecutor incident to declaration of a mistrial suggest the need for caution. When a mistrial is declared after the taking of evidence has begun, strategies of cross-examination are often revealed and the prosecution has, for the first time, learned the real strengths and weaknesses of its case. \"Under these circumstances, mistrial exposes defendant not only to the burden of retrial and the possible loss of a favorably disposed tribunal, but also to the possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>bility that the government will improve the strength of its case significantly in the second prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Double Jeopardy Clause stands as a protection against precisely these dangers.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">While the judge no doubt acted in good faith, good faith is not a factor unless the defendant moves for a mistrial and asserts that his \"consent\u201d to a mistrial, thereby evidenced, was constrained by prosecutorial or judicial misconduct or bad faith. In <em>Dinitz </em>the Court observed a distinction between <em>sua sponte </em>mistrials and mistrials granted at the defendant\u2019s request, declaring that where the defendant requests the mistrial, retrials may be barred when the judge or prosecutor acted in bad faith.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Where the defendant does not request or consent to a mistrial, the \"manifest necessity\u201d standard governs. \" 'In the absence of such a motion, the <em>Perez </em>doctrine of manifest necessity stands as a command to trial judges not to foreclose the defendant\u2019s option until a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion leads to the conclusion that the ends of public justice would not be served by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>continuation of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Dinitz, <em>supra, </em>p 607.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">If appellate courts were to take into account the absence of judicial bad faith in deciding whether there is manifest necessity, a mistrial could be declared <em>sua sponte </em>whenever there is an arguable basis for such a declaration; the judge\u2019s good faith, not manifest necessity, would define the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>This Court accords considerable deference to a judge\u2019s determination of whether there is manifest necessity justifying declaration of a mistrial. <em>People v Alvin Johnson, </em>396 Mich 424, 437; 240 NW2d 729 (1976). A mistrial may only be declared, however, after an on the record consideration and discussion of alternatives with counsel. The wishes of defendant and his counsel can then be ascertained and a full exploration of the alternatives undertaken. In the instant case correct procedures were not followed. Had they been observed the insignificance of the error may have been discovered and proper curative instructions given. Instead, an unnecessary mistrial was declared. We conclude that there was no \"manifest necessity\u201d to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-6\">Kavanagh, C.

A revolver and approximately $280 was taken from Benton\u2019s person and the car. On retrial the prosecution did not call McBride as a witness. While the prosecution\u2019s impeachment of McBride on direct examination was a defect in the proceedings, in light of the nature of the defect, which does not go to the integrity of the judicial process, the failure of Benton\u2019s counsel to object and the overwhelming evidence against Benton, the defect was not plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"> The transcript reveals that after the first day of trial there was an off-the-record discussion of a possible declaration of mistrial.

The usefulness of mistrial to the defense depends, moreover, not only on the impact of the particular event but also on two other factors\u2014 the nature of other circumstances that may have helped or hindered the defendant\u2019s cause, and the extent to which the resources of the accused will permit an adequate defense in a second trial. A trial judge normally will have only vague familiarity with the first of these factors and none at all with the second. Deference to the trial judge therefore seems particularly inappropriate when the mistrial decision ostensibly was intended to protect an accused who objected to mistrial or was given no opportunity to do so. In such a case, there is no excuse for not ascertaining defense preferences directly and then honoring them.\u201d Schulhofer, <em>supra, </em>p 496. <em>See, also, Curry v Superior Court of San Francisco, supra, 2 </em>Cal 3d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The United States Supreme Court has noted that \"[m]any juries acquit defendants after trials in which reversible error has been committed, and many experienced trial lawyers will forego a motion for mistrial in favor of having his case decided by the jury\u201d. <em>United States v Tateo, </em>377 US 463, 474; 84 S Ct 1587; 12 L Ed 2d 448 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Reprosecution after a <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of mistrial because of improperly admitted testimony has been barred on double jeopardy grounds in this and other jurisdictions. <em>See People v Alvin Johnson, supra </em>(the mere mention of a polygraph test, without more); <em>People v Gardner, </em>37 Mich App 520; 195 NW2d 62 (1972) (inadmissible reference by prosecution witness to defendant\u2019s prior conviction); <em>Klinefelter v Superior Court of Maricopa County, </em>108 Ariz 494; 502 P2d 531 (1972) (state\u2019s witness on redirect referred to information which had specifically been excluded); <em>State v Embry, </em>19 Or App 934; 530 P2d 99 (1974) (the prejudicial effect was curable by instruction).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b277-7\">Fitzgerald, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayg\"><em>(concurring). </em>When a defendant consents to a mistrial after jeopardy has attached, ordinarily retrial is not barred. <em>People v Grimmett, </em>388 Mich 590, 598; 202 NW2d 278 (1972).
