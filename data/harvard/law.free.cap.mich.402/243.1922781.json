Dressier, and raise two issues: (1) did the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (hereinafter WCAB) err in finding that plaintiff\u2019s employment at Michigan Plating aggravated his back condition to the point of total disability rather than finding his disability resulted from a fall during his earlier employment with Grand Rapids Die Casting Corporation, and (2) was plaintiff suffering from an occupational disease prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>bis employment with Michigan Plating and, therefore, barred from recovering from Michigan Plating by MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431), because he wilfully and falsely represented in his application for employment that he had not previously been treated for back trouble?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We find there was competent evidence to support the findings of the WCAB that (1) plaintiff\u2019s employment at Michigan Plating aggravated his back condition to the point of total disability, and (2) plaintiff is not barred from recovery from Michigan Plating by MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431) because that bar relates exclusively to misstatement relative to a prior occupational disease and has no application to a misstatement relative to a prior single-event injury. Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Plaintiff began working at Grand Rapids Die Casting Corporation, codefendant in this action, in September, 1966. His job consisted of lifting and polishing small and large metal parts. On Friday, June 7, 1968, plaintiff fell at work and injured his spine about two inches above his belt. He reported the fall immediately but did not see a company doctor until his return to work on Monday, June 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Dr. Kempers, to whom he reported on that date, prescribed pain pills and returned plaintiff to work with a \"slip\u201d ordering that he do no heavy lifting. Plaintiff returned to work immediately, but was told there was no light work available. He did not return to work again until the week ending June 30, at which time he was given light work which he continued to do for a period of three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Subsequently, plaintiff was placed back at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>regular duties which continued for another week or two until he quit in August, 1968. During this period he suffered varying degrees of back pain. There is some testimony to the effect that plaintiff left his employment because his wages were being garnished and he wanted to look for a better job.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">On September 30, 1968, plaintiff began the same type of work at Apex Polishing Company, which caused him less discomfort than his prior job because he was able to get up and walk around to relax his back during the course of work. Plaintiff was laid off by Apex in January, 1969, but that same month was able to secure a job at Ronel\u2019s Manufacturing Company, again doing polishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In June, 1969, plaintiff was laid off by Ronel\u2019s, and applied for work at Pridgeon &amp; Clay, but was rejected after a pre-employment physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In August, 1969, plaintiff applied for work with defendant, Michigan Plating. While filling out his employment application, plaintiff responded to the question, \"[h]ave you ever been treated for a back condition?\u201d in the negative. Plaintiff later admitted during testimony that he knew this answer to be untrue, and that he gave it for the purpose of obtaining a job. He began work on August 11, 1969, as a \"racker\u201d, lifting bumpers off a rack and polishing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">While in the employ of Michigan Plating, on January 9, 1970, plaintiff suffered a fall at home in which he injured his upper back. This incident, however, was characterized as not significant in light of plaintiff\u2019s total back pathology by defendant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Glessner: \"I\u2019m not stating that the fall [of January 9, 1970] couldn\u2019t have had something to do with it, but I think the fall had less to do with it than the lifting activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Approximately a week after the fall, there was a layoff at Michigan Plating and plaintiff was not called back to work until March of 1970. After resuming work, plaintiff began to be absent frequently, and did not return to work after April, 1970. On May 15, 1970, he was formally discharged by Michigan Plating.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">On June 8, 1970, plaintiff filed his petition for hearing alleging that he was disabled due to a fall in 1968 and the \"repeated trauma in the course of his employment\u201d at Michigan Plating.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The hearing referee found that plaintiff had suffered a personal injury aggravated to the point of total disability while in the employ of Michigan Plating and awarded compensation to be paid by appellant as the last employer. The appeal board unanimously affirmed on April 6, 1976 and the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal on July 29, 1976. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on April 22, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">II \u2014 Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Findings of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board regarding whether a disability exists, <em>Barrett v Bohn Aluminum &amp; Brass Co, </em>69 Mich App 636, 639-640; 245 NW2d 147 (1976), and whether a particular employment has aggravated a condition to the point of disability are findings of fact. <em>Gilbert v Reynolds Metals Co, </em>59 Mich App 62, 65; 228 NW2d 542 (1975). If supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in the record, such findings are conclusive. <em>Carter v Kelsey-Hayes Co, </em>386 Mich 610, 615; 194 NW2d 326 (1972); <em>Coates v Continental Motors Corp, </em>373 Mich 461, 466-467; 130 NW2d 34 (1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Court must therefore examine the issues raised on appeal under the above standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Ill \u2014 Date of Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Defendant Michigan Pl\u00e1ting asserts that plaintiff was \"disabled from carrying on his employment at Grand Rapids Die Casting Corporation [his original employer] and accordingly was thereafter disabled from heavy work\u201d, and that therefore Grand Rapids Die Casting should be held liable for the payment of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">If plaintiff were disabled from the time of his employment at Grand Rapids Die Casting, and this <em>same </em>disability continued through the time of his subsequent employment at Michigan Plating, defendant\u2019s assertion would be correct, <em>Mullins v Dura Corp, </em>46 Mich App 52; 207 NW2d 404 (1973). However, the meaning of \"disability\u201d, in conjunction with the facts of this case, establishes that there was competent evidence by which the WCAB could find that plaintiff was disabled on the last day of his employment with Michigan Plating.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Although what constitutes compensable disability is a factual determination and can vary with the circumstances of a particular case, of interest is Larson\u2019s treatise on worker\u2019s compensation which describes compensable disability as the \"inability, as the result of a work-connected injury, to perform or obtain work suitable to the claimant\u2019s qualifications and training\u201d. 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 57.00. Larson goes on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>explain \"that the distinctive feature of the compensation system * * * is that its awards (apart from medical benefits) are made not for physical injury as such, but for 'disability\u2019 produced by such injury\u201d. Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 57.10 (authority omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">There is no question that plaintiff sustained a physical injury to his back while in the employ of Grand Rapids Die Casting, and according to the opinion of the WCAB, this \"single-event traumatic injury * * * resulted in immediate disability thereafter\u201d. However, the facts as reasonably accepted by the WCAB demonstrate that within a short time of the fall plaintiff was able to perform his regular duties at Grand Rapids Die Casting. Further, within a short time from termination of his employment at Grand Rapids Die Casting, plaintiff was not only able but did in fact obtain work suitable to his qualifications and training, and was able to perform such work, albeit with various degrees of discomfort from his pre-existing back condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">According to defendant\u2019s own statement of the facts of this case, plaintiff did the same type of work at Apex as he had done at Grand Rapids Die Casting. The termination of that employment was due to a layoff and not inability to perform the required work. The same pattern of employment, ability to perform, and economic layoff occurred at Ronel\u2019s. These facts support a finding by the WCAB that plaintiff was not disabled during this period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Further, although plaintiff suffered pain during substantially all of his employment from the time of his initial injury, the existence of an injury and pain therefrom do not necessarily create disability. As quoted above, \"the distinctive feature of the compensation system * * * is that its awards (apart from medical benefits) are made not for physical injury as such, but for 'disability\u2019 produced by such injury\u201d. Plaintiff was not disabled, despite the pain suffered in his successive jobs, until the pain became so extreme as to force his excessive absence from work at Michigan Plating, and his employment there was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">When aggravation of an injury involves successive employers as in the instant case, the rule is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\" 'The Massachusetts-Michigan rule in successive-injury cases is to place full liability upon the carrier covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relation to the disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\" 'If the second injury takes the form merely of a recurrence of the first, and if the second incident <em>does not contribute even slightly </em>to the causation of the disabling condition, the insurer on the risk at the time of the original injury remains liable for the second. In this class would fall most of the cases discussed in the section on range of consequences in which a second injury occurred as the direct result of the first, as when claimant falls because of his crutches which his first injury requires him to use. This group also includes the kind of case in which a man has suffered a back strain, followed by a period of work with continuing symptoms indicating that the original condition persists, and culminating in a second period of disability precipitated by some lift or exertion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">\" 'On the other hand, if the second incident contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>utes independently to the injury, the second insurer is solely liable, even if the injury would have been much less severe in the absence of the prior condition, and even if the prior injury contributed the major part to the final condition. This is consistent with the general principle of the compensability of the aggravation of a preexisting condition.\u2019 3 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 95.12, pp 508.130-508.133.\u201d <em>Mullins v Dura Corp, supra, </em>55-56. (Emphasis changed.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">See <em>Gilbert v Reynolds Metals Co, </em>59 Mich App 62, 65; 228 NW2d 542 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The ultimate finding by the WCAB was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\"that plaintiffs subsequent employment with defendant Michigan Plating and Stamping aggravated his preexisting back condition and injury to the point of total disability on and after his last day of work on April 24, 1970.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">We do not say that all evidence in this case dictates the WCAB finding, but, under the applicable standard of review, the findings of facts of the WCAB that employment at Michigan Plating contributed independently to the injury are supported by competent evidence and therefore cannot be disturbed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>IV \u2014 Was Plaintiff\u2019s Back Condition an Occupational Disease Bringing Him Within the Purview of MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431)?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Defendant Michigan Plating contends that regardless of when the injury is deemed to have occurred, plaintiff is barred from recovery from it by MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431), which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\"No compensation shall be payable for an <em>occupational disease </em>if the employee at the time of entering into the employment of the employer by whom the compensation would otherwise be payable, or thereafter, wilfully and falsely represents in writing that he has not previously suffered from the <em>disease </em>which is the cause of the disability or death.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">As stated in part I of this opinion, plaintiff did not disclose his prior back problem in the employment application to Michigan Plating, despite the fact that the application contained the question, \"[h]ave you ever been treated for a back condition?\u201d Plaintiff admitted in his testimony that he intentionally answered in the negative to increase the probability of obtaining employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431) precludes the recovery of compensation only when there has been wilful nondisclosure of an occupational disease. Plaintiff asserts that his prior back condition was a traumatic injury and not an occupational disease; the WCAB agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\"Plaintiff sustained a previous single-event injury to his back (compensable by virtue of chapter 3) during the course of his employment with Grand Rapids Die Casting. Plaintiff had a prior back injury but not an occupational back <em>disease </em>(chapter 4) and therefore \u00a7 418.431 is not applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The question of medical causation of plaintiffs disability is a question of fact, <em>Galac v Chrysler Corp, </em>63 Mich App 414, 416; 235 NW2d 359 (1975), as is a determination that an injured employee\u2019s disability results from a single-event injury and subsequent aggravation, as opposed to an occupational disease, <em>Morgan v Win Schuler\u2019s Restaurant, </em>64 Mich App 37, 40; 234 NW2d 885 (1975). Because the findings of the appeal board as to these factual determinations are supported by competent evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In 1937, the following definition of \"occupational disease\u201d was added to part VII, now chapter 4, of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\"Sec. 1. Definition. Whenever used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\"(c) The term 'occupational disease\u2019 means a disease which is due to causes and conditions which are characteristic of and peculiar to a particular trade, occupation, process or employment.\u201d 1937 PA 61, part VII, \u00a7 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The present act does not clearly define occupational disease, but Professor Larson explains the terminology as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">\"Occupational disease cases typically show a long history of exposure without actual disability, culminating in the enforced cessation of work on a definite date.\u201d 4 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 95.21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Defendant cites a limited number of cases in which back disabilities have been found to be occupational diseases. <em>Smith v Lawrence Baking Co, </em>370 Mich 169; 121 NW2d 684 (1963); <em>Fields v GM Brass &amp; Aluminum Foundry Co, </em>332 Mich 113; 50 NW2d 738 (1952); <em>Underwood v National Motor Castings Division, Campbell, Wyant &amp; Can</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>non Foundry Co, </em>329 Mich 273; 45 NW2d 286 (1951). Each of these cases involve situations where the plaintiff\u2019s back condition arose gradually because of long and repeated bending, twisting, or lifting, even though there might also have been an incidental trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In the instant case, plaintiff had no back problems prior to his fall even though he had engaged in the particular occupation for almost two years. His condition commenced with a single-event injury and despite relatively continuous pain, he was not disabled from working until, almost two years later, the strenuous tasks in the course of his employment at Michigan Plating caused his condition to degenerate to a point of total disability. Under these circumstances, it was not error for the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board to find that plaintiff was not suffering from an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">While we can appreciate defendant employer\u2019s frustration at having employed plaintiff under a false belief arising from his misrepresentation, and now being held liable for his worker\u2019s compensation benefits, as well as plaintiff employee\u2019s compulsion to misrepresent in order to secure a livelihood, the fact of the matter is that the statute in this case does not permit the employer to avoid compensation payments. MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431) is specifically limited in its effect and the findings of the WCAB as to the statute\u2019s non-applicability to the facts of this case are supported by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">V \u2014 Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We hold that there was competent evidence to support the findings of the WCAB that (1) plaintiff\u2019s prior back condition was aggravated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>point of total disability as of his last day of work with appellant, Michigan Plating, and (2) plaintiff was not suffering an occupational disease and therefore is not precluded from recovery of worker\u2019s compensation benefits by MCLA 418.431; MSA 17.237(431).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Affirmed. No costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-6\">Kavanagh, C. J., and Levin and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b470-7\">Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIO\"><em>(to remand). </em>The intriguing effect of my colleague\u2019s opinion is that it now legally pays to lie \u2014 and it is the consumer who bears the cost. We cannot attribute to the Legislature the intent to approve fraud nor do we find it appropriate for Michigan\u2019s highest court to condone and invite fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s back problems began on June 7, 1968 when he fell while working for Grand Rapids Die Casting. He quit in August, because of back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">After working for two other employers (where the pain continued) and being refused by a third after a physical examination revealed his back condition, he applied for work with defendant Michigan Plating and Stamping Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">By his own testimony, plaintiff deliberately and intentionally falsified his application regarding his back condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was hired by defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>worked off and on for about eight months with diminishing attendance before he quit, again because of back pain. He then filed a claim for total disability. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) found Michigan Plating and Stamp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ing liable for the full costs. The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The WCAB and Justice Williams assume that fraud is not a bar to compensation unless it is pursuant to a claim based on an occupational disease. The theory is that, because the bar of misrepresentation is specifically mentioned regarding occupational disease<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it is not mentioned as the act addresses a single injury and subsequent disability,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fraud is not a bar to recovery in the latter circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">It strains credibility to conclude that the Legislature deliberated and decided to permit misrepresentation in single injury/aggravation cases and not permit it in occupational disease cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">As the body of workmen\u2019s compensation law grew through the years, other states were confronted by similar problems which Professor Larson addresses in his treatise on Workmen\u2019s Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>pensation Law. He notes that several states apply a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\"common-sense rule made up of a m\u00e9lange of contract, causation, and estoppel ingredients. The following factors must be present before a false statement in an employment application will bar benefits: (1) The employee must have knowingly and wilfully made a false representation as to his physical condition. (2) The employer must have relied upon the false representation and this reliance must have been a substantial factor in the hiring. (3) There must have been a causal connection between the false representation and the injury\u201d. 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 47.53, pp S-201-8-202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Delaware was one of the first jurisdictions to apply this rule. The worker in <em>Air Mod Corp v Newton, </em>59 Del 148; 215 A2d 434 (1965), had a long history of back trouble which resulted in surgery during the spring of 1959. In September, he applied for work with Air Mod denying that he had \"any physical defect or chronic disease\u201d or that he had \"been confined by illness in [the] past year\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The worker was employed by Air Mod for 15 months when he fell and injured his back. He quit work in March, 1961, underwent more surgery and then filed a claim for benefits in October, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The Delaware Supreme Court found defendant\u2019s answers on the employment application to be \"false and misleading\u201d. The Court addressed itself \"to the consequences of such misrepresentation upon the plaintiffs right to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits\u201d. Although it was \"not aided by an explicit provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d, the Court did note Delaware\u2019s Second Injury Fund and apportionment provisions \"are premised upon an employer\u2019s knowledge of an employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>prior injury, disease or infirmity\u201d. Concealing these \"may, unfairly and even fraudulently, deprive an employer of the benefits accorded him by law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Based upon its review of public policy, case law, \"and principles of fairness and justice\u201d, the Court held that an employee would forfeit his right to benefit if in applying for work, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\"(1) knowingly and wilfully made a false representation as to his physical condition; and (2) the employer relied upon the false representation and such reliance was [a] substantial factor in hiring; and (3) there was a causal connection between the false representation and the injury\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The Florida Supreme Court made a similar analysis in <em>Martin Co v Carpenter, </em>132 So 2d 400 (Fla, 1961). The worker had a back problem for 20 years which he concealed by falsely answering questions on an employment form. The Florida statutes did not speak to this situation. The Court adopted the rule that such false representations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\"will preclude [benefits] if there is shown to be a causal relationship between the injury and the false representation and if it is also shown that (1) the employee knew the representation to be false, (2) the employer relied upon the false representation; and (3) such reliance resulted in consequent injury to the employer\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Wisconsin has followed a similar path. It has a legislative policy to encourage the hiring of epileptics by allowing them to elect not to be covered by workmen\u2019s compensation. In <em>Volunteers of America of Madison, Inc v Industrial Commission, </em>30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Wis 2d 607; 141 NW2d 890 (1966), the worker, an epileptic, indicated on an employment form that he did not have a history of seizures or fainting spells. At a physical examination, he did not tell the doctor about the epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The worker drowned while working at a camp run by the Volunteers. The Court said that \"implicit\u201d in the state policy \"is the requirement that the employee will not fraudulently conceal his epileptic condition from his employer\u201d. Such a concealment would preclude benefits. The Court remanded to determine if the epilepsy contributed to the drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The Tennessee Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act also contains no provision for a fraudulent misrepresentation of physical condition to obtain employment. Prior to <em>Federal Copper &amp; Aluminum Co </em>v <em>Dickey, </em>493 SW2d 463 (Tenn, 1973), there was no case law either. Dickey had failed to declare previous back trouble. He injured his back while working for Federal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The Tennessee Supreme Court said the statutory provisions on occupational disease and second injuries \"[evidence] a general policy against\u201d the worker\u2019s conduct. The Court found an employee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\"who has wilfully misrepresented or failed to disclose material information regarding his physical condition should not be permitted a recovery in a workmen\u2019s compensation case merely because the legislature failed to anticipate the problem\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The Court adopted Professor Larson\u2019s analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Finally, there is the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cooper v McDevitt &amp; Street Co, </em>260 SC 463; 196 SE2d 833 (1973). The worker had a serious back injury in 1967. He was employed by McDevitt &amp; Street in 1970 for work on a project in Charleston. The worker told the company about his back problem. He was laid off in December, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In January, 1971, the worker traveled to Columbia, South Carolina, to see about work on another McDevitt &amp; Street project. He filed a new employment application but this time concealed his back problems because \"if they knew it up here, I was going to get fired off the job\u201d. He was disabled by his back trouble in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In a 3 to 2 decision, the South Carolina Supreme Court denied benefits. The supervisor in Columbia testified that he did not have access to the Charleston records. He also said the worker would not have been hired if he had disclosed the prior injury. The Court cited Larson and held that \"[t]here is ample evidence to sustain the finding * * * that the [worker] was guilty of fraud in securing his employment * * * and that the employer would not have hired him had he not misrepresented his physical condition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The logic of Professor Larson and our sister states which have followed his \"common-sense\u201d analysis is persuasive. In addition to the plainly spoken legislative policy in occupational disease cases, we also note that compensation is barred when the notice of injury of a claimant is shown to contain \"the intention to mislead, and the employer or the carrier, was in fact misled\u201d. MCL 418.383; MSA 17.237(383). As the Tennessee Court observed, those provisions alone are indicative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the legislative policy and need not be repeated in each section of the act. It is more likely that the Legislature would be surprised to discover that when it does not explicitly forbid fraud, we will presume that statute to permit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Aside from any judicial interpretation of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act and its predecessor, we are persuaded that it is improper for this Court to condone fraud. Fundamental fairness alone should compel us to reverse or to adopt the Larson analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We would adopt Professor Larson\u2019s guide. In this case, the record amply supports the fact that plaintiff knowingly and wilfully misrepresented his physical history on the application and that there was a causal connection between the false representation and the disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The record is not so clear that the employer \"relied upon the false representation and this reliance\u201d was a \"substantial factor in the hiring\u201d. Plaintiff assumed that he would not have been hired had he told the truth, but the WCAB made no finding in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Because we agree that plaintiff did not suffer an occupational disease within the meaning of the statute, but would find it possible to rule that plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by fraud, we would remand to the WCAB solely to afford Michigan Plating and Stamping Co. the opportunity to show it relied on the knowing misrepresentation in hiring plaintiff and for WCAB to make a factual determination accordingly. If the WCAB could satisfy the Larson test, it should deny benefits to plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-10\">Fitzgerald and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> This rule is so basic as to be found in the Michigan Constitution:</p>\n<p id=\"Aixg\">\"Findings of fact in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>conclusive in the absence of fraud unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, and the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\"The findings of fact made by the board acting within its powers, in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive. * * * \u201d MCLA 418.861; MSA 17.237(861).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> Defendant relies on <em>Mullins v Dura Corp, supra, </em>to support its claim that Grand Rapids Die Casting should be liable. In that case the dispute involved only one employer, but two insurance companies, one claiming disability dated from the date of the original back injury and the other from the last day of work. The Court of Appeals affirmed the WCAB finding that the disability dated from the time of the original injury, despite the fact that the plaintiff continued to work.
