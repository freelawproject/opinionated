Appellant being charged here with burglary with intent to commit theft, it was incumbent upon the State to allege in the indictment that he intended to take the property in the alleged burglarized house \u201cwithout the consent of\u201d the owner. Toder v. State, 269 S. W. Rep. 1043. Also the indictment should have alleged that appellant intended to take such property \u201cfrom the possession of\u201d such owner. Robinson v. State, 160 S. W. Rep. 456. The cases cited are based on others therein referred to and these on still others further back, The indictment herein containing neither allegation mentioned as necessary, was fatally defective, and the motion to quash should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">For the error mentioned, the judgment will be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">HAWKINS, <em>]., </em>absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
