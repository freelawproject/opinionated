It was averred in the affidavit for the search warrant that the premises to be.searched belonged to <em>Chester Olison. </em>Said premises were described as follows: \u201cHouse and premises located about fourteen miles northwest .of Marshall, Texas, on the Marshall and Harleton dirt road, being the home, residence and dwelling house occupied, inhabited and lived in by the said Chester Olison.\u201d The description in the warrant followed that contained in the affidavit. It was charged in the indictment that <em>Chesley Ollison </em>unlawfully possessed the liquor in question. The evidence developed the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that appellant\u2019s name is Chesley Ollison. Among other things our statute requires that the affidavit and search warrant contain the name of the \u201cperson accused of having charge of the suspected place, if there be any such person, or, if his name is unknown, that it describe him with accuracy, and direct him to be brought before the magistrate.\u201d Article 316 C. C. P. Chesley and Chester are not idem sonans. The rule adopted by our court for determining whether names are idem sonans is stated in Milontree v. State, 16 S. W. 764, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cIf the names may be sounded alike without doing violence to the power of the letters found in the variant orthography, or if the name as stated be idem sonans with the true name, the misspelling and variance is immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">See also Short v. State, 266 S. W. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The officers not having a warrant authorizing the search of appellant\u2019s residence, and timely and proper objection having been made to their testimony, the reception of their testimony touching the result of the search constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">HAWKINS, J., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
