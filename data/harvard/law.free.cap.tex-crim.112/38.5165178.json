Appellant appealed to the county court where he was tried on the same complaint and again convicted. He was arrested on a capias pro fine issued from the county court. Upon a habeas corpus hearing for release he was remanded, from which order this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Exactly the same state of facts was presented in No. 12,454, Ex parte S. V.
