The Court in this bill certified as a fact that \u201cthe issue was squarely raised by the testimony as. to whether or not such whiskey was for medicinal purposes.\u201d If this recital be true, it was imperative upon the Court to submit such defensive issue to the jury. We are bound by the recitals of the bill, and presuming them to be true, as we must, the action of the Court was error. Thornton v. State, 13 S. W. (2d) 369; Valdez v. State, 10 S. W.
