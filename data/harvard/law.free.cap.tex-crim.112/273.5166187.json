He abandoned the car about four miles across the line in Austin County. Prior to the trial in Colorado County, complaint and information were filed against appellant in Austin County. He plead guilt in the county court of Austin County and was fined $15.00. The judgment was never set aside, no appeal was taken and at the time of the trial in Colorado County said judgment was final in Austin County. Appellant filed his plea of former conviction. It is undisputed that he was being tried for the same offense in Colorado for which he had been convicted in Austin County. The identical transaction was involved. The plea should have been sustained as it appears that appellant had been legally convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction upon the same accusation after having been tried upon the merits for the same offense.
