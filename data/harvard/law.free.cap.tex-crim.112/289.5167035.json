ITe testified and attempted to justify the homicide upon the ground of self-defense based upon apparent danger. The court submitted to the jury the issues arising from the evidence in a charge of which no complaint is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">There is one bill of exceptions taken to the action of the court in overruling the objection to the reading in the presence of the jury of a written statement made by the witness Allen, who seems to have been a witness for the State. In qualifying the bill the court states that he caused an investigation to be made in the absence of the jury and determined that there was a predicate shown for the impeachment of the witness Allen. The jury was recalled and the writing mentioned was read in the form of a question to the witness; that this was done without objection and the proceeding acquiesced in by counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. On appeal the appellant was represented by a different attorney. That circumstances may arise in the trial of a case warranting the State to impeach its witnesses by proof of contradictory statements is a principle recognized by this court in many opinions. See Somerville v. State, 6 Tex. Crim. App. 433; Williford v. State, 36 Tex. Crim. Rep. 424; Floyd v. State, 29 Tex. Crim. App. 356; and many other precedents collated by Mr. Branch in his Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 154, Subds. 4 and <em>7.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The evidence that the appellant killed the- deceased by shooting him several times is not in conflict. The defensive theory presented was rejected by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The . judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
