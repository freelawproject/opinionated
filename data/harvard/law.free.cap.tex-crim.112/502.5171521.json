According to the testimony of the officers appellant said the beer belonged to him, but declared that he had no interest in the whiskey. The officers testified that they found in said building fifteen half-gallon jars of corn whisky and 150 pint bottles of beer. There were some stone jars, a quantity of sugar and many empty bottles in the building. We deem the evidence sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Several bills of exception are brought forward which we are not authorized to consider as they were filed too late. Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was overruled November 20th, 1928, and notice of appeal given on the same date. The court allowed appellant 80 days from November 20th, 1928 in which to prepare and file bills of exception. The bills were not filed until February 9th, 1929, \u2014 81 days from the date notice of appeal was given. No order of extension appears to have been entered. Article 760 C. C.

The affidavits presented by appellant are indefinite and do not sufficiently fix the fact that the bills of exception were presented to the district clerk within the time fixed by statute for filing same. We have before said that the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>may not seek to make the authorities of the State his agents to do things for him which diligence and his own obligation would seem to require him to do.
