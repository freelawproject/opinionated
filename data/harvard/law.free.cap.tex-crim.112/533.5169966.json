Among the analogous cases there may be mentioned the following: Mims v. State, 1 S. W. (2d) 303; Plant v. State, 292 S. W. Rep. 550; Peoples v. State, 296 S. W. Rep. 536; Rochelle v. State, 294 S. W. Rep. 861; Battle v. State, 105 Tex. Crim. Rep. 568; Silver v. State, 8 S. W. (2d) 145. In an instance in which the facts upon which reliance is had to establish probable cause are uncontroverted, their sufficiency is a question of law for the court; and under such circumstances, a request of the accused on trial that the jury be retired while the subject of probable cause was investigated should be respected and a refusal to do so might under some circumstances result in a reversal. Such is the ruling of this court in Weddle v. State, (No. 11,710, opinion on motion for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>hearing) which ruling is in harmony with the consensus of judicial declarations upon the subject, that is to say, \u201cwhat facts and circumstances amount to probable cause is a question of law; whether they exist in any particular case is a question of fact. Where the facts are in controversy the question must be submitted to the jury under proper instructions.\u201d Cornelius on Search &amp; Seizure, p. 135, sec. 33. /</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The testimony showing that the sheriff had reliable information coming from Judge Stallings that the car in question was \u201cloaded to the brim,\u201d coupled with the testimony of the sheriff to the effect that before making any arrest he' observed jars and cases in the car and saw certain conditions of the car which he described and which were observed by him before the door was opened, warranted the arrest of the accused and the reception of evidence showing the result of the search of the automobile. See Moore v. State, 107 Tex. Crim. Rep. 24; Mims v. State, 1 S. W. (2d) 303; and other cases cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">There being no conflict of controversy touching the facts upon which reliance was had to show probable cause for the arrest and search incident thereto, and no complaint that the jury was present when the testimony was given or request made that the evidence be heard in the absence of the jury and the evidence being sufficient to show probable cause, the court having so decided as a matter of law, we fail to perceive any error in the procedure which would warrant a reversal of the judgment. It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
