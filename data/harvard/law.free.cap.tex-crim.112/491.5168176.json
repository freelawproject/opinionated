He immediately informed a magistrate of this fact. The latter caused the arrest of appellant, who was at once brought before said magistrate. Search of his-person revealed the presence of several bottles of whisky and a pistol. The arrest without warrant was legal. Art. 325, C. C. P.; Burkhardt v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep. 228; Parez v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App. 618; Morris v. State, 79 Tex. 141. Under all the authorities one legally arrested may be legally searched. Washington v. State, 296 S. W. Rep. 512; Sandoval v. State, 293 S. W. Rep. 168; Paulk v. State, 293 S. W. Rep. 169; Hawley v. State, 296 S. W. Rep. 556; Coats v. State, 108 Texas Crim. Rep. 301; Agnello v. United States, 269 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>U. S. 20. The finding of the pistol was part of the res gestae of the search and of the offense and was provable. Appellant was on a public street when first observed on the occasion in question. lie was going along the street. When arrested a short time thereafter he had gone further along said street. We think the conviction for transportation of intoxicating liquor, not without support. Objection to testimony of the search and its results was not well taken under the authorities above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
