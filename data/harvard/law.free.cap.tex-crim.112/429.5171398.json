Officers went to the vicinity of appellant\u2019s residence at night. They saw appellant leave his garage and start toward his dwelling house. Whereupon they went upon the premises. After entering upon appellant\u2019s premises they noticed that appellant appeared to have something under his coat. One of the officers caught appellant by the arm and he dropped a fruit jar containing whiskey. No search warrant had been issued authorizing the officers to search appellant or his premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Proper objection was made to the testimony of the officers touching the result of the search on the- ground that they had no search warrant and that the search was therefore illegal. It is recited in the bill of exception and certified to by the court that the officers \u201ccould not tell\u201d what appellant was carrying under his coat at the time they approached him. The objection was well taken. The officers had entered upon appellant\u2019s premises without authority of law for the purpose of searching him. The whiskey found in appellant\u2019s possession was not seen until one of the officers grasped appellant\u2019s arm. The liquor was not in their \u201cview\u201d until the unlawful entry upon appellant\u2019s premises had been made. Plence the arrest of appellant without warrant was illegal and the evidence obtained by virtue thereof inadmissible under the provisions of Article 727a C. C. P. Hall v. State, 6 S. W. (2d) 762; Steverson v. State, 2 S. W. (2d) 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commmission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
