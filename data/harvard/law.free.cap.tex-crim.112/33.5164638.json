A special charge was asked and refused, the substance of which was that before the jury could find the appellant guilty they must believe that he threatened to accuse Moise Cerf of a felony, to-wit, arson, in the Fortieth Judicial Court of Ellis County, Texas. The action of the Court in refusing to amend his main charge and in refusing to give appellant\u2019s special charge is assigned as error. Practically the same question was before the Court in the case of Strange v. State, 33 Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Crim. Rep. 315. Discussing a similar allegation, the Court used this language:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\">\u201cThis allegation constituted part of the offense, was pleaded as part of the threat, identified the threat charged to have been made, and put the parties upon notice that such state of facts would be proved against them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In the instant case it will be observed that the Court authorized a conviction if the threat was made to prosecute before \u201cany court,\u201d without any limitation as to place and without any designation as to the court. Having alleged in the indictment that the threat was to prosecute before the court named therein, it was incumbent upon the State to sustain such allegation and it was the duty of the Court to authorize a conviction only upon proof of such allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The point is further made that the Court was in error in submitting the case to the jury because of the existence of facts which gave to appellant immunity from prosecution. Suffice it to say in answer to this that an issue was made as to this, which was decided adversely to appellant in the trial court and which finding is conclusive in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">If we understand the appellant\u2019s theory, as gathered from his evidence, he insisted that his only motive in approaching Cerf was to collect money paid to Cerf by the insurance company for burned buildings which ought not to have been paid by the insurance company for the reason that the fires which had destroyed said buildings were of incendiary origin, with which Cerf was criminally connected, and that he did not threaten to extort money from Cerf by any threat of criminal prosecution but endeavored only to collect what Cerf had wrongfully and illegally received. This theory should, we think, have been affirmatively and appropriately submitted to the jury by the Court in his charge. We hardly think appellant\u2019s exceptions were sufficient to require this, and mention it only in view of another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Alleged errors not discussed are such as we Relieve to be without merit or are those not likely to occur on another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">For the error first above discussed the judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
