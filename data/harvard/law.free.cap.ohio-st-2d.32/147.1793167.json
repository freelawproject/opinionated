This being so, there is nothing presented by defendant upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>which a reviewing court can determine whether error was committed by the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">It is necessary that a bill of exceptions be filed and allowed by the trial court exemplifying the facts necessary to determine the issues presented. <em>State, ex rel.

Defendant could have prepared a narrative bill of exceptions, or stipulated with the state as to what transpired in the Municipal Court hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\">As a matter of fact, the trial judge\u2019s journal entry overruling the motion for new trial and to vacate judgment specifically stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">\u201cThe Court on two separate occasions specifically advised the defendant of his right to counsel and said defendant advised the Court of his desire to proceed without counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
