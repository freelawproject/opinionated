Although the syllabus in that decision was phrased in terms of Willis Leroy\u2019s particular situation, the reasons underlying it pertain to every criminal cause in which the time for filing a direct appeal expired prior to July 7, 1971, the date of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Further, while this appellant admittedly knew about appeal rights at the time of his sentencing, there is absolutely nothing before us to show that he told the trial judge, after his conviction, either that he desired to appeal or that he wanted the continued assistance of court-appointed counsel for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Lucas County, denying the motion for leave to appeal, is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-9\">Schneider, Corrigan, Leach and Brown, JJ.-, concur.
