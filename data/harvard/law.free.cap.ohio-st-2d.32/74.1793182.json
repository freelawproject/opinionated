C. 5739.01(B).\u201d <em>Machinery Moving </em>v. <em>Porterfield, supra, </em>is not controlling in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It is not disputed that the cost of the equipment here involved is economically inconsequential when compared with the entire charge. However, economic inconsequentiality is not the sole determining factor. <em>Recording Devices </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 208, 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We look as well to the function of the equipment in regard to the overall service being provided. In <em>Machinery Moving, </em>the bins were inanimate objects. Both the bins and the subscribers involved there played only a minor role in the overall service transaction. A similar situation existed in <em>American District Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 92, which involved a central alarm system. In <em>ADT, </em>no function was performed by the subscribers and, although the alarm device did send a signal from the subscribers\u2019 premises, that function was insignificant when compared to the substantial service performed by those offering the service..</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In <em>ADT, </em>this court held that the alarms, by themselves, were useless, since the subscribers had sought protection of their property, which, the court said \u201ccomes only # * * when those companies [ADT] contact local authorities and send out their own guards.\u201d The court stated further that \u2018\u00a3 the equipment * * * may reasonably be viewed as only an aid in the rendering of protection service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In this case, the \u201cLittle Watchman\u201d was not just an aid; it was essential in solving the enuretic\u2019s problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Further, as was pointed out in <em>Columbus Coated Fabrics </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 307, 310, the emphasis in <em>ADT </em>was placed upon the substantial manual personal service provided by the persons rendering the service. The same is true in <em>Machinery Moving, </em>for in both cases the subscriber contracted to receive the substantial manual personal efforts of individuals. No such substantial personal effort exists herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Appellee also looks to the language of <em>ADT </em>and <em>Machinery Moving </em>to the effect that when the property is \u201cuseless\u201d by itself it is functionally inconsequential. It must be noted, however, that \u201cuseless,\u201d as used in <em>ADT </em>and <em>Machinery Moving, </em>was a relative term used in comparing the function of the alarm device and trash bin to the overall service rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Here, the function of the \u201cLittle Watchman\u201d in providing a means of awakening both the enuretic and parent immediately upon the occurrence of an emission was substantial when compared to the sending of a signal <em>{ADT) </em>or the holding of trash <em>{Machinery Moving). </em>Further, the function performed by appellee herein (sending preconceived responses to reports), is insubstantial when compared to the function in <em>ADT </em>(sending notice of a burglary to the police and sending men to the subscribers\u2019 premises), and in <em>Machinery Moving </em>(picking up and hauling away refuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">This case is more akin to <em>Bunker-Ramo Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 231, 237, in that the activities performed hy <em>Bunker-Ramo </em>were practically a completely mechanized service. Although here, appellee does render a service in sending appropriate responses in answering the report cards received, that function is of slight mechanical significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Recording Devices </em>v. <em>Porterfield, supra </em>(30 Ohio St. 2d 208), we again denied a tax exemption where the bulk of the service rendered was accomplished by the equipment and the subscribers. In that case, we stated at page 213: \u201c \u2018Personal service\u2019 means an act done personally by a particular individual; it is, in effect, an economic service involving either the intellectual or manual personal effort of an individual, not the saleable product of his skill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u25a0 An analysis of the foregoing cases indicates that the procedure for determining whether the transfer of possession of tangible personal property qualifies it for tax exemption as a personal service transaction under R. C. 5739..01(B) is, in addition to determining the economic inconsequentiality of the property, to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>overall effort exerted in rendering the service is substantially provided by (1) the persons rendering the service, (2) the property transferred, or (3) the subscribers. If the function can reasonably be said to be substantially performed by the persons providing the service, the exemption is available. To the contrary, if the overall effort is not substantially made by the persons rendering the service, a personal service transaction does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">As previously noted, the personal property herein involved was economically inconsequential. We must then examine the function it and the parties involved played in the performance of the overall service offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Appellee contends that the \u201cLittle Watchman\u201d is such an inconsequential element of the service offered subscribers that it would be possible to perform the service without its use; that, therefore, it must be functionally inconsequential. This assumes, without factual basis, that the information provided appellee by the subscribers could <em>reasonably </em>be assembled <em>sans </em>the \u201cLittle Watchman.\u201d We do not share this assumption. Further, we have no such factual situation before us, and even if we did, under these circumstances, the intellectual or manual personal effort provided by appellee would not have been increased one iota by eliminating the \u201cLittle Watchman\u201d since the subscribers would still perform the bulk of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">It is true that the pre-development of the responses by appellee, and their correlation to the reports sent in by subscribers, represents the result of an intellectual personal effort. However, distribution of such responses requires no substantive intellectual or manual personal effort. Bather, it is in essence an installment plan whereby the subscriber purchases the saleable product of some person or person\u2019s skill. Accordingly, it does not represent a \u201cpersonal service\u201d as stated by the General Assembly in B. C. 5739.01(B)..</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Appellee contends further that since there was an alternative to the use of the \u201cLittle Watchman,\u201d it follows that it was functionally inconsequential. This reasoning, pursued to its logical end, would require this court to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that any time tangible personal property is replaceable by an individual, the function served by the property would be inconsequential. Such reasoning ignores the fact that most mechanical devices are designed to replace individuals, and therefore can be replaced by individuals. This argument has no merit, particularly when applied to this case, because it is unreasonable to assume that a parent would stay up each night for the entire period of time necessary and maintain such a vigil so as to <em>immediately </em>awaken the child at the beginning of each emission.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The real service provided by this plan is the solution of the child\u2019s bed wetting problem. In accomplishing this by means of the appellee\u2019s program, three functions occur. One, the enuretic and a responsible person must be awakened immediately upon the occurrence of each emission. Two, the responsible person must record the time and size of the emission and deliver the report to the appellee. Finally, upon receipt of the recorded information, the appellee responds with preconceived instructions to the subscriber.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">It is evident that an essential function is performed by the equipment and the subscriber before appellee can even determine which predetermined response should be sent. Under such circumstances, the \u201cLittle Watchman\u201d cannot reasonably be held to be functionally inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Finding that a transfer of possession of tangible personal property has occurred, R. C. 5739.01, and that such property was not available for the personal service transaction exemption of R. C. 5739.01(B), we hold that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable and unlawful and the same is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
