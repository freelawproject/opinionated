Plaintiff-Appellee is the State of Ohio. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     State Prosecution of Appellant Eckley for Child Endangering\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b62} On or about October 25, 2012, appellant was caught shoplifting candy at a convenience store. Although responding police officers offered her a ride home, she refused, stating she would rather go to jail than return to the house where she and her young daughter resided with two roommates, Jessica Hunt and Jordie Callahan. When the police went to the residence in question to further investigate, Hunt and Callahan showed the officers videos of appellant beating her young daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} On October 25, 2012, a complaint was filed in the Ashland County Common Pleas Court charging appellant with two counts of child endangering, R.C. 2919.22(B)(2) and R.C. 2919.22(B)(4), felonies of the third degree. On October 31, 2012, appellant entered an initial plea of not guilty. A bill of information setting forth the same charges was presented on December 7, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} However, on December 17, 2012, appellant appeared with counsel before the trial court and entered a plea of guilty to both counts. A presentence investigation was ordered, and a sentencing hearing was conducted by the court on February 11, 2013. During the time between the guilty plea and the sentencing hearing, further investigation occurred into the conduct of Hunt and Callahan. Among other things, Sergeant Darcy Baker of the Ashland Police Department prepared a letter to the trial court judge reporting that appellant had been living under harsh, captive conditions with Hunt and Callahan. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel for appellant stated that the case was unlike any he had encountered in his career, stating that appellant had basically been \"held hostage by two persons\" who had threatened and assaulted her. Sentencing Tr. at 5. The guilty plea was nonetheless entered and the trial court accepted same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b65} The trial court proceeded to sentence appellant to community control, including residential sanctions of 150 days in the Ashland County Jail, probation supervision through the Ohio Adult Parole Authority for a period of four years, and 200 hours of community service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Entry of Sentence, February 12, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Federal Prosecution of Jessica Hunt and Jordie Callahan\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b66} As set forth in a written opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Hunt and Callahan were thereafter prosecuted under federal labor human trafficking laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The facts as set forth in the opinion of the Sixth Circuit tell the story of \"two vulnerable individuals-S.E.

After she was released from jail for that incident in May 2010, she moved in with Hunt and Callahan. They forced appellant to clean the apartment, do yardwork, care for their dogs, and run their errands.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055364\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/606/#p613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055364\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/606/#p613\">\n    at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellant complied with the incessant work demands of Hunt and Callahan because she believed they would physically assault her if she resisted, as they had done in the past. Appellant and her daughter were typically fed one meal a day, consisting of unheated canned food, bread, and unrefrigerated lunch meat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055364\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/606/#p613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055364\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/606/#p613\">\n    at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court found\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   the plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing at the time it was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Appellant's First Appeal\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b611} Appellant thereupon appealed to this Court from the February 28, 2017 judgment of the trial court. Upon review, we held the trial court had abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on appellant's motion to withdraw her guilty pleas. We therefore reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case for a hearing on November 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Eckley\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

Appellant tendered Maureen Guirguis of Case Western Reserve University as an expert witness on human trafficking. However, the State objected to any expert testimony from Guirguis on the grounds that appellant had failed to timely provide a written expert report pursuant to Crim.R. 12. The hearing was therefore adjourned and rescheduled for March 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b613} In the meantime, the State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   concerning Guirguis as a witness. The trial court granted the State's\n   motion and limited Guirguis' testimony to her areas of expertise, which the court determined to be internet human trafficking and drug-related human trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b614} At the March 12, 2018 hearing, the trial court first took judicial notice of the outcome of the federal labor human trafficking case described in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Appellant then presented testimony from the federal prosecutor that had helped handle the case against Callahan and Hunt. Appellant then had Guirguis take the stand, as further discussed\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   The State of Ohio did not present any witnesses, but it introduced into the record certified copies of appellant's change of plea hearing and sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b615} The trial court, via a judgment entry issued on March 15, 2018, denied appellant's motion to withdraw her guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b616} On March 29, 2018, appellant filed a notice of appeal. She herein raises the following two Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b617} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S MOTION TO WITHDRAW PLEA TO CORRECT MANIFEST INJUSTICE WHERE THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WAS IN CAPTIVITY AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE CONDUCT AND WAS FORCED BY HER CAPTORS TO SPANK HER CHILD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b618} \"II.

We recognize that the full details of appellant's abuse at the hands of Hunt and Callahan may not have been known at the time of the change of plea and sentencing hearings, but the potential structure of a duress defense,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that appellant was ordered to hit her child while herself being threatened with physical violence, was apparent at the time of sentencing, when appellant could have withdrawn her plea prior to finalization of the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b631} Furthermore, even though appellant's defense counsel at sentencing likely did not fully know the full extent of the abuse, appellant was unfortunately familiar with the terrible facts. While her experience was undoubtedly traumatic, appellant had four months between her arrest and her sentencing to say something on her behalf, but she apparently revealed little at that time. Furthermore, two months passed between the date of her plea and the trial court's issuance of her sentence. Later, when presenting her motion to withdraw, appellant did not take the stand to explain her silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b632} In addition, as previously noted, the trial court sentenced appellant to community control, including residential sanctions of 150 days in the Ashland County Jail, probation supervision through the Ohio Adult Parole Authority for a period of four years, and 200 hours of community service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Entry of Sentence, February 12, 2013. The parties herein do not dispute that appellant has now served her residential sanction time, probation, and community service requirements. Thus, although there may be some lingering costs to be paid, appellant's sentence appears virtually completed. We also again note appellant's motion to withdraw her plea sought, in the alternative, to seal the record of her conviction; however, such a remedy is barred under Ohio law due to the nature of her offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2953.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b633} In misdemeanor cases, a motion to withdraw a guilty plea after a sentence has been served and the fine paid is not moot if the appellant can assert a collateral disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Maple Hts. v.

In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , appellant claimed somewhat vaguely in her motion to withdraw plea that she had \"recently made application for a new job.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3. While there was no onus on appellant under Ohio law to demonstrate a collateral disability in this instance, we find under such circumstances a trial court can still consider, as part of its overall Crim.R. 32.1 \"manifest injustice\" analysis, what future impact a felony conviction might have on a movant, particularly where a number of years has passed and the potential for\n   incarceration has ended. In the present case, appellant's lack of testimony at the Crim.R. 32.1 hearing of March 12, 2018 severely limited the trial court's ability to factor into its decision what specific negative impact her convictions will have on her potential employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b634} Upon review, we are unpersuaded the trial court abused its discretion in declining to find a manifest injustice warranting the extraordinary step of negating appellant's plea following its evidentiary hearing upon our prior remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b635} Appellant's First Assignment of Error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b636} In her Second Assignment of Error, appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in failing to fully recognize one of her witnesses, a law professor and law clinic co-director from Case Western Reserve University School of Law, as an expert on human trafficking, and in limiting its consideration of her testimony.

She is a 1998\n   <em>\n    summa cum laude\n   </em>\n   graduate of the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Her resume lists nearly three pages of formal presentations she has conducted since early 2015. In addition to her extensive background in the study of human trafficking, Guirguis had the opportunity to meet appellant and review her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b640} We note that at an earlier hearing on January 29, 2018, the trial court had in essence partially accepted Guirguis as an expert on human trafficking, limiting her\n   recognized expertise to \"drug-related human trafficking\" and \"internet human trafficking.\" But appellant had failed at that time to provide the State of Ohio with an expert report by Guirguis under Crim.R. 12, and the matter was continued. The State, on March 6, 2018, filed a motion in limine to prevent Guirguis from testifying in the matter. Appellant filed a response to the motion in limine on March 12, 2018. The trial court thereupon granted the State's motion in part and limited Guirguis' testimony for purposes of the March 12, 2018 hearing to what it considered her areas of expertise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b641} Despite the foregoing, and despite the fact Guirguis was not presented as a psychological expert, appellant's counsel was permitted to ask Guirguis if appellant's child endangering acts were of her free will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., March 12, 2018, at 61. Guirguis responded as follows to this crucial question. \"I came to the conclusion that they were not of her free will because of the coercion that she was suffering under and the force and the daily beatings and all of the other degradation that she was dealing with at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b642} The record also reveals that at the March 12, 2018 hearing, the trial court took judicial notice of the outcome of the federal case in which Jordie Callahan and Jessica Hunt were prosecuted for labor human trafficking. Appellant also presented testimony from retired Assistant United States Attorney Thomas Getz, the lead prosecutor in the federal criminal case against Callahan and Hunt. Getz thus described for the trial court some of the horrors and brutal treatment appellant had undergone at the hands of Callahan and Hunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b643} It is well-established that an appellant, in order to secure reversal of a judgment, must show that a recited error was prejudicial to her.\n   <em>\n    Tate v.
