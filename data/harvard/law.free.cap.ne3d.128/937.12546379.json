She raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court's twelve-month prison sentence for a technical violation of community control sanctions is contrary to\n   law because it exceeded the 90-day maximum sentence authorized by R.C. 2929.15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} Finding no merit to her argument, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b64} In December 2016, Neville and her codefendant were indicted for receiving stolen property. In January 2017, Neville was indicted for drug possession. At a plea hearing in June 2017, the trial court dismissed the charges against Neville for receiving stolen property at the state's request in exchange for Neville pleading guilty to drug possession (less than five grams of crack cocaine) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a fifth-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b65} The trial court sentenced Neville on July 20, 2017. Defense counsel informed the court that Neville had been struggling with sobriety for 16 years. According to Neville's presentence investigation report (\"PSI\"), Neville has a lengthy criminal history beginning in 1988 when she was a teenager (although the PSI does not indicate if she was found delinquent of two juvenile charges). As an adult, she has almost 20 convictions for various offenses, including many drug possession or drug abuse charges, theft, aggravated theft, soliciting, aggravated disorderly conduct, and several other minor convictions. Neville's previous convictions were not violent offenses or sex offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b66} Defense counsel further informed the court that Neville had mental health issues as well, including \"bipolar, PTSD, anxiety, and depression.\" Defense counsel requested the court to take into consideration the fact that Neville would like \"some additional help with her drug usage.\" Neville also told the court that she had \"a drug problem.\" The trial court sentenced Neville to five years of community control sanctions with the following conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [1.] Defendant to abide by the rules and regulations of the probation department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [2.] No drugs or alcohol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [3.] Defendant may not patronize any establishment, event, family function or work anywhere where alcohol or drugs are sold or served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [4.] Defendant to attend a 12-step meeting every other day for 90 days, defendant to attend a meeting every other day, excluding Sunday, verifiable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [5.] Defendant to obtain a sponsor by 8-21-17 who is female and has a minimum of 10 years sobriety. Sponsor's name and phone number to be given to probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [6.] Defendant to obtain full time employment or 2 part-time jobs by 8-21-17. Employment verified through pay stubs showing all taxes taken out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [7.] Defendant is not allowed to associate with anyone with a criminal record or with anyone engaging in criminal activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [8.] Defendant to pay monthly toward costs, fees and fine. Defendant to pay in equal monthly installments. All financials to be paid in full by 1-20-22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b67} The trial court also suspended Neville's driver's license for five years and imposed a $ 1,000 fine and court costs. The trial court further notified Neville that if she violated the terms and conditions of her community control sanctions that it would sentence her to 12 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b68} On August 24, 2017, the trial court issued a capias for Neville's arrest \"for failure to report to probation after sentencing.\" Neville was arrested in early November 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b69} On November 14, 2017, the court held a community control sanctions violation hearing. Michael Cain of the probation\n   department told the court that Neville admitted that she violated \"all of [the] conditions\" of her community control sanctions because she failed to report to the probation department after she was sentenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b610} Neville told the court she was wrong for not complying. She said that when she \"got released from here,\" her \"ex was fighting for his life in ICU for 19 days.\" She explained that she spent a lot of time at the hospital during that time. \"And then [she] just got more nervous\" to report to the probation department because so much time had passed. Neville asked the court, \"[g]ive me prison time, your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b611} The trial court found Neville to be a violator and sentenced her to 12 months in prison. It notified her that once she was released from prison, the probation department may impose up to three years of postrelease control. It also advised her of the consequences that she would face if the probation department gave her postrelease control and she violated the terms of it. It is from this judgment that Neville now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b612} In her sole assignment of error, Neville maintains that the trial court erred when it sentenced her to 12 months in prison because under R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i), which went into effect on September 29, 2017, the court could only sentence her to a maximum prison term of 90 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.Sub.H.B. No. 49. Specifically, Neville argues that failing to report to the probation department is a \"technical violation,\" and thus, the trial court could only sentence her to 90 days in prison under R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i). We note at the outset that this issue is one of first impression in this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b613} R.C. 2929.15(B) provides (with the 2017 amendments emphasized):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1) If the conditions of a community control sanction are violated or if the offender violates a law or leaves the state without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) [A longer duration of the same community control sanctions provided the total amount does not exceed the maximum five-year limit];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) [A more restrictive sanction, including a residential sanction under R.C. 2929.16, community service or house arrest (or many other options) under R.C. 2929.17, or a financial sanction under R.C. 2929.18 ];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (c) A prison term on the offender pursuant to section 2929.14 of the Revised Code\n   <em>\n    and division (B)(3) of this section, provided that a prison term imposed under this division is subject to the following limitations, as applicable:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    (i) If the prison term is imposed for any technical violation of the conditions of a community control sanction imposed for a felony of the fifth degree or for any violation of law committed while under a community control sanction\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    imposed for such a felony that consists of a new criminal offense and that is not a felony, the prison term shall not exceed ninety days.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    (ii)\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Addresses when a prison term is imposed for a technical violation of the conditions of a community control sanctions imposed for a fourth-degree felony; limits prison to 180 days if merely a technical violation\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicability of R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b614} The amendments to R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i) became effective on September 29, 2017. Neville's community control violations hearing was in November 2017. The state argues that the amendments do not apply to Neville's case. The state maintains that \" R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i) would have applied when [Neville] violated the terms of her community control sanctions\" if the trial court had originally sentenced Neville to\n   <em>\n    just\n   </em>\n   community control sanctions\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   notifying her that it would send her to prison for 12 months if she violated the terms of her community control, it would impose a sentence of 12 years. We disagree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b615} The plain language of the amended statute shows that it applies to Neville's case. The first part of the statute, R.C. 2929.15(B)(1) (which was exactly the same under the prior version), states: \"If the conditions of a community control sanction are violated\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   if the offender violates a law\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   leaves the state without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties[.]\" Subsection (a) provides that one option a court has if an offender violates is the court could extend the duration of the \"same\" community control sanctions (as long as the court did not already impose the maximum of five years). The second option under subsection (b) states that the court could impose more restrictive sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b616} The third and final option is subsection (c), the subsection at issue in this case, which provides that the court may impose a prison term pursuant to R.C. 2929.14 (which sets forth the minimum and maximum prison sentence a court may impose for different felony levels). This is exactly what R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c) stated prior to the H.B. 49 amendments, that is, it ended with this sentence. But under the 2017 amendments, the General Assembly limited a trial court's discretion with respect to the amount of prison time it could impose if offenders violate their conditions of community control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b617} All statutes that relate to the same general subject matter must be read in pari material.\n   <em>\n    Carnes v.

The court shall notify the offender that, if the conditions of the sanction are violated, if the offender commits a violation of any law, or if the offender leaves this state without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer, the court may impose a longer time under the same sanction, may impose a more restrictive sanction, or may impose a prison term on the offender and shall indicate the specific prison term that may be imposed as a sanction for the violation, as selected by the court from the range of prison terms for the offense pursuant to section 2929.14 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b621} R.C. 2929.15(B)(3) and 2929.19(B)(4) were not substantively changed by H.B. 49. Thus, a trial court may still impose community control sanctions for the fourth- or fifth-degree felony offense at the original sentencing hearing\n   <em>\n    and still\n   </em>\n   notify an offender that if he or she violates the terms of those sanctions, it will impose a prison term \"as selected by the court from the range of prison terms for the offense pursuant to\" R.C. 2929.14 and \"shall not exceed the prison term specified in the notice provided.\" R.C. 2929.15(B)(3) ; 2929.19(B)(4). Applying amended R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i) to this scenario (meaning if the trial court chooses option (c) under R.C. 2929.15(B)(1) when the offender violates), the statute now provides that the court can still impose prison\n   <em>\n    but if\n   </em>\n   the violation is\n   <em>\n    merely technical\n   </em>\n   , the trial court cannot impose the full amount of prison time that it had previously notified the offender it would impose if the offender violated the terms of his or her\n   community controlled sanctions. Instead, if there is a technical violation of community control sanctions, the trial court can now only impose a prison sentence of 90 days for a fifth-degree felony and 180 days for a fourth-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b622} Thus, we disagree with the state that because the trial court notified Neville at her original sentencing hearing that if she violated the terms of her community control sanctions that it would impose a prison term of 12 months, means that subsection (c)(i), limiting the trial court's prison option to 90 days, does not apply. The state's interpretation of the statute would render the amendments under H.B. 49 meaningless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b623} The amendments to R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c) became effective on September 29, 2017. Neville's community control violations hearing was in November 2017, and thus, we agree with Neville that amended R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i) applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

If a statute is ambiguous, a court may consider the legislative history and the circumstances under which the statute was enacted, as well as the consequences of a particular construction, among other things. R.C. 1.49 sets forth certain criteria that serve as guideposts for courts to follow when determining the legislative intent of an ambiguous statute. Under R.C. 1.49, courts may consider the following when determining legislative intent of an ambiguous statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (A) The object sought to be attained;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (C) The legislative history;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (E) The consequences of a particular construction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (F) The administrative construction of the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b629} Further, \"[w]ords and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\" R.C. 1.42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b630} H.B. 49 was a budget bill. Testimony before the House Finance Committee established that the purpose of the H.B. 49 amendments with respect to criminal sentencing was to reduce the amount of low-level felony offenders in state prisons. Gary Mohr, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, testified that although there have been \"previous reform efforts, Ohio's prison population has not realized the reduction in prison population found in other states.\" Mohr further stated that H.B. 49 \"strikes the appropriate balance between treating those drug addicted Ohioans in the community, while maintaining the Department's obligation to protect the public by safely incarcerating those who commit more serious offenses.\" Thus, the purpose of the relevant amendments to H.B. 49 was to reduce the amount of low-level felony offenders in the state's prison population, to save the state money, and to provide drug addiction treatment to offenders by keeping them in their local communities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   With this legislative history in mind, we now turn to defining \"technical violation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b631} Neville contends that the phrase \"technical violation\" has a particular meaning.

Neville not only failed to report for over three months, she\n   <em>\n    never reported at all\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, Neville failed to engage in any of the conditions of her community control. If we were to adopt Neville's interpretation of the statute, then an offender who fails to report indefinitely or manages to avoid coming into contact with the criminal justice for months or even years could potentially avoid any punishment for committing a fifth-degree felony offense. This could not be what the legislature intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b648} Thus, we conclude that Neville's violation here was not a technical violation. The outcome of this case would have likely been different had Neville failed to report for one meeting with her probation officer after she had previously reported. Failing to report one time after previously reporting may be a technical violation - depending on all of the other factors of that individual case. But here, Neville failed to report at all for over three months, and thus, failed to comply with any of the conditions imposed for her community control sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b649} In sum, it is our view that the legislature did not intend to limit the meaning of \"technical violation\"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to conduct that is not criminal in nature. Rather, it is our view that the General Assembly intended to allow the judge to retain some discretion when faced with more serious violations that do not rise to the level of a crime. This case is a perfect example as to why the General Assembly\n   did so - because if Neville had not been arrested on the capias in November 2017, she could have indefinitely avoided all punishment and treatment for her drug addiction. This directly contravenes the stated purposes of H.B. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b650} As the Fifth District stated in\n   <em>\n    Mannah\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

Thus, the choice of the term \"technical\" implies it has meaning distinct from \"non-criminal\" violations. R.C. 2929.15(B)(1)(c)(i) specifically sets forth the ninety-day sentence limitation applies for violations of the law which are not felonies, if community control was imposed for a felony. If the legislature intended the statute to apply solely to violations of community control which constitute criminal offenses, it would have said so directly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b651} Accordingly, Neville's sole assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b652} We do note that on February 8, 2018, the court issued a judgment entry stating that it had \"no comment\" on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction's request to place Neville in a \"transitional control release program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b653} The Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court docket indicates that on July 25, 2018, Neville was indicted on escape charges (in Cuyahoga C.P.

Neville pleaded guilty to fifth-degree felony escape in CR-18-630602 in September 2018, and was sentenced in October 2018.
